            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>AMong the ſeveral Hiſtories that <hi>Saluſt</hi>wrote when living, by which he acquir'd the Title of <hi>Prince of Hiſtorians,</hi> there are none that have reach'd our times entire, nor many Ages before, but only the Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi>and the War of <hi>Jugurth.</hi> The reſt were ſtifl'd, as ſome conjecture, by the Admirers of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> Mortal Enemies to the Fame of <hi>Criſpus.</hi> The Orations alſo in his Fragments and his two Epiſtles to <hi>Caeſar</hi> are without all doubt his own; So that there is nothing to be queſtion'd but his Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>Cicero.</hi> Yet that ſtands fair too in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Fabius.</hi> But let the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer Criticks diſpute that point; certain it is, that <hi>Saluſt</hi>is one of the greateſt <hi>Latin</hi>Authors Extant, both for Stile and Language. Of whom <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſays, That <hi>Livy</hi> was fitter to be read by Boys, then <hi>Saluſt,</hi>as being the Nobler Hiſtorian of the two, whom rightly to underſtand both Age and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were requir'd. Conformable to which, <hi>L. Vives</hi>ſpeaking of this Fam'd Hiſtorian, <hi>Saluſt</hi>ſays He, <hi>the moſt florid Writer of the</hi>Roman <hi>Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is very frequently thumb'd by School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys, but in my Opinion much more deſerves to be handl'd by Men of riper years and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two things, for which <hi>Saluſt</hi>is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and admir'd above all others, except <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34632:4"/>
of whom he was an imitator; Fidelity and Conciſeneſs. As to the firſt, <hi>Vibius Sequeſter</hi> and <hi>St.Jerome</hi> gave him the Encomiums of <hi>Autor Certiſſimus;</hi> and <hi>St.Auſtin</hi>ſtiles him an <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of ennobl'd Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Conciſeneſs and the Gravity of his Sentences acquir'd him by the unanimous conſent of all the Learned Men of <hi>Martial's</hi> Time, to be <hi>Romana Primus in Hiſtoria:</hi> and <hi>Quintillian</hi> affirms the <hi>Saluſtian Brevity</hi> to be ſuch, that nothing can be more perfect to a Learned Ear.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, and altho' theſe curtail'd Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, theſe unexpected Cadences of Periods, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure brevity of <hi>Saluſt,</hi> might well be apprehended and underſtood by them whoſe mother Language was the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, yet they that are not accuſtom'd to the natural Idiom of any Speech, will find it a hard task to unravel the Sence of Sentences including much in little. As if theſe Myſtic Authors made it their ſtrife to imitate Nature, that holds her moſt precious Treaſures in the Earth, to make us delve and labour before we can come at 'em. And therefore I cannot chuſe but laugh at thoſe who tell me 'tis an eaſy thing to Tranſlate <hi>Saluſt,</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late! there's no ſuch thing to be done. For to Tranſlate him word for word into Engliſh, were to ſet the two Languages together by the Ears: You may as well make <hi>Brains</hi> and <hi>Stairs</hi> to Rime, as make that ſenſe in <hi>Engliſh</hi> which is ſence in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. As may be ſeen by thoſe Hide-bound Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionss
<pb facs="tcp:34632:4"/>
of <hi>Heywood</hi> and <hi>Croſs;</hi> eſpecially the latter; ſo pitiful, that the very Ribbs of verbal Deformity appear through the ſlender skin of the Tranſlation: eſpecially when they come to the knotty Orations and Moral Excurſions of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. For his compacted <hi>Latin</hi> is like a ſolid piece of Gum that muſt be melted into Engliſh Phraſe, before it will dlate it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But nothing plagu'd me more then to obſerve that inſipid clutter which that impertinent and trifling Chiurm of Pedants make, that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Expoſitors:</hi> a ſort of <hi>Piſmires,</hi> whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious toyl produces nothing but the moſt Chaffy and Husky part of all Learning. They fill the Text with Stars and little Letters; but when you think to meet with a Clue to guide ye through the Labyrinth of the Obſcurity; Heavens! How your expectations are deceiv'd! There's nothing but a ſcuffle about <hi>the Genitive</hi> or the <hi>Ablative</hi> caſe, whether <hi>Locupletum</hi> or <hi>Locupletium;</hi> whether <hi>Locupleti</hi> or <hi>Locuplete;</hi> whether <hi>ac</hi> or <hi>et.</hi> When you look for the unravelling of a dark ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Satis,</hi> cries <hi>Thomas a Didimus,</hi> is abſent in four Manuſcripts. <hi>Apage At, </hi> cries another in great Wrath: another as furiouſly ſends <hi>Que</hi> to the Gallows, or to uſe their own words, <hi>ad Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monias Scalas.</hi> Another ſtorms, and ſays it muſt be written <hi>Plancia</hi> and not <hi>Plautia</hi> with a Dipthong: another will have it right or wrong <hi>ab Numidis,</hi> and not <hi>a Numidis;</hi> another tho' it
<pb facs="tcp:34632:5"/>
coſt him a fall will have it <hi>Arteis</hi> and not <hi>Artes; Omneis</hi> and not <hi>Omnes.</hi> Another finds that his changing <hi>ne</hi> into <hi>nec</hi> will do the buſineſs, and then he crows out like a Cock of the Game, <hi>Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reca, Heureca,</hi> as if he had made a new diſcovery of a Fifth part of the Earth: with a thouſand more ſuch Fopperies as theſe. As if it were not better to cite the variations of Manuſcripts, for others to make a judicious choice, or elſe to be careful in Correcting the trueſt Edition, without ſuch a deal of triffling Oſtentation, and bringing all the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Engines upon the Stage of an Annotation to defend an <hi>Autem</hi> or an <hi>Etiam,</hi> in hazard of Eternal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation, All this while not a word of the Authors meaning: not the leaſt Dark-lanthorn Light into the Obſcurity of the Sence. Beſides when that there is a gapp indeed, there like Hounds at a fault, they ſinell about, and ſnuff up their Noſes i'th Air, but all to no purpoſe; they are got into a Wood, and the Game is loſt.</p>
            <p>Thus finding little aid from them, after a more ſerious Study and Meditation I found <hi>Saluſt</hi> to be the beſt Expounder of himſelf: only that it would take up a little more Time and Induſtry. Both which produc'd at length this new Attempt to make the choiceſt of the <hi>Latine</hi> Hiſtorians more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately familiar with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue. Wherein however I do not think my ſelf ſo abſolute, but that I am ready to ſubmit to any other, who may think to gain a better Credit by correcting what I have done amiſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was deſcended of the Noble Family of the</hi> Saluſtii, <hi>which for a long ſeries of years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the ſplendor of its antient Dignity. It is by all allow'd that from his Childhood he had his Education in</hi> Rome, <hi>and that his Genius led him to the milder Studies of the Liberal Arts. But hapning to live in thoſe unfortunate times of Faction and Popular ſiding, when Vertue and Learning wanted their due Encouragements (His Inclinations being deprav'd in a City ſo corrupted) he was eaſily vanquiſh'd by voluptuous Allurements. So that being call'd to public Employment, ſo ſoon as his years render'd him capable of it, he ſuffer'd many Misfortunes, through the Iniquity of the Times; in regard the Commonwealth was then turmoyl'd and beſet with</hi> Sylla<hi>'s Party.</hi>

            <head>THE WAR OF CATALINE, BY <hi>Caius Salluſtius Criſpus.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT behoves all Men that labour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other Creatures, to make it their chief Endeavour not to waſt their Lives in Silence like the Brute Beaſts, form'd by Nature prone to the Earth, and only Slaves to their Bellies. But our whole ſtrength and vigor is ſòated as well in the Mind as in the Body. We make more uſe of the command of the Mind than of the ſervice of the Body.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34632:8"/>
The one we ſhare with the Gods, the other is common to us with the Beaſts. Whence it appears to be a nobler way to purchaſe glory rather by our Ingenuity, than our Strength of Body; and becauſe the life it ſelf which we enjoy is but of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, to render our Memories the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that we can. For the Spendor of Form and Riches is frail and tranſitory; but Vertue is accounted Illuſtrious and Eternal. 'Tis true the Conteſt has been long among Mortals which moſt prevail'd in War, vigor of Mind, or ſtrength of Body. For firſt, before we begin, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to conſult, and after delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing more requiſite than ſpeedy Execution. Thus both defective of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the one becomes effectual by the aſſiſtance of the other. Therefore at the beginning Kings (for that was the firſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Soveraign Dignity upon Earth) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in ſeveral places, ſome made uſe of their Parts and Ingenuity, others exercis'd their Bodies. Then alſo was the Life of Man without Ambition; while every one was pleas'd with what himſelf enjoy'd. But after that in <hi>Aſia Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> began to ſubdue Cities and Nations, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34632:8"/>
they made Ambition of Dominion the cauſe and foundation of War; and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd the extent of Glory by the ſpaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Territories, then Danger and Buſineſs taught the world that War was chiefly manag'd by Wit and Ingenuity. So that if the Vertue and Magnanimity of Kings and Emperors were alike in Peace as in War, Human Affairs would be leſs ſubject to inconſtancy; nor ſhould we ſee ſuch Changes, ſuch Revolutions, nor ſuch Topſy Turvies in the world. For Empire is eaſily preſerv'd by the Arts, by which it was at firſt acquir'd. But when Sloth, inſtead of Induſtry; when Ambition and Pride, inſtead of Equity and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, invaded once the Breaſts of Men, then their Fortune with their Cuſtoms underwent a univerſal change. Thus is Empire always tranſlated to every one that is moſt excellent from the Inferiour and leſs Brave. The toyls of Plowing, hazards of Navigation, and expence of Building, all ſubmit to Vertue, as being obedient to her Inſtigations. But many Men addicted to Luxury and Sleep, Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and void of Education, conſume their Lives like Travellers upon the Road; to whom, quite contrary to Nature, their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34632:9"/>
Body is a Pleaſure, but their Soul a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Now their living and their dying, I look upon to be the ſame, as being both buried in Silence. But he it is, who ſeems to me to live and enjoy a Soul, who finding himſelf employment, labours for the Fame of ſome great Action, or ſome noble Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Though in ſuch a vaſt variety of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Nature chalks out diſtinct and various Roads for differing Undertakers. Among the reſt 'tis highly Commendable to act well for the Common-wealth; nor is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſpeak well in its Honour; for thus may Fame be purchas'd both in Peace and War; ſince many are applauded that acted themſelves, and many that wrote the Atchievements of others. And for my own part, although I never thought the ſame Renown attended the Writer as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſher of great Affairs, yet it ſeems to be no ſuch eaſy task to commit to writing Public and Memorable Tranſactions. Firſt becauſe that Deeds require Words to equal their Grandeur: for that moſt People believe the Reprehenſions of Crimes and Miſcarriages, to be the Reprimands of Envy or Ill will: where the Author inſiſts upon the Vertue and Honour of good Men, there, whatever every one deems
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34632:9"/>
eaſily perform'd he patiently endures; but whatever is extraordinary, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as Fiction. For my part from my youth, my Inclinations carry'd me to Public Affairs, where I met with many Croſſes and Obſtructions of Misfortune. For Modeſty, Abſtinency and Vertue were over rul'd by Inſolence, Profuſeneſs and Avarice. Which though my diſpoſition abhor'd, as unaccuſtom'd to the Practices of Evil, yet among ſo many Vices, my weak and tender Age could not reſiſt the ſtrong Corruptions of Ambition. And though averſe to the lewd Cuſtoms of the Age, yet the ſame Ambition tormented me as well as others, with thirſt of Fame and envy'd Greatneſs. Therefore, when after many Miſeries and Dangers, my thoughts came once to be at Reſt, and that I had reſolv'd to ſpend the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my days remote from Buſineſs, my Intentions were not to conſume a happy leaſure in Sloth and Vanity, nor to waſte my time upon thoſe meaner and more ſervile Employments of Husbandry and Hunting; but returning to the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and purpoſes, from whence unruly Ambition had before withdrawn me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd briefly to write the ſeveral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34632:10"/>
Tranſactions and Atchievements of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, as they occurr'd moſt worthy the Remembrance of Poſterity: So much the rather, as knowing my ſelf no way engag'd by Hope or Fear, nor any way byaſs'd by prejudice or Intereſt. In purſuance of which Determination I ſhall endeavour a conciſe, and to the utmoſt of my Ability, a ſincere Relation of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>'s Conſpiracy. For that ſame perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated Act of Villany do I eſteem moſt Memorable, as well for the novelty of the Crime as of the Danger. Of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Inclinations of which Perſon it will be expedient in the firſt place, to give a ſhort Accompt before I begin my Relation.</p>
            <p>L. <hi>CATALINE,</hi> deſcended of a Noble Family, was a Perſon of Great Strength and Vigour both of Body and Mind; but of an Evil and Vicious Diſpoſition. From his early Adoleſcency nothing was more grateful to him than Civil War; Slaughter, Rapine and Domeſtic Diſcord were the Paſtimes of his Youth. He had a Body enur'd to Hunger, Cold, and want of Sleep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Belief. Daring beſide, and Crafty, Inconſtant, able to counterfeit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34632:10"/>
what he pleas'd himſelf; greedy of other Mens Proprieties, Prodigal of his own; Ardent in his Deſires, and Burning in his Luſts; ſufficiently Eloquent, but his ſtock of Prudence very ſmall; A vaſt Mind that always Thirſted after things Exorbitant, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and two High above his Reach. This Man, after the Domination and Tyranny of <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> nothing would ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie but an unreaſonable deſire of invading the Common-weal. Nor by what means he might obtain it, ſo he might graſp a Kingdom to himſelf, did he at all regard or value. But every day his Thoughts were more and more tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyl'd, himſelf grown wild through his Domeſtic Wants, and the Guilt of his Crimes. Both which he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated by his Deprav'd and Vicious Life, augmented moreover by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Cuſtoms of the City; which two the worſt Diſtempers of a Common-wealth, and moſt directly oppoſite one to another, Luxury and Avarice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at that time. For which reaſon, the Subject it ſelf ſeems to require, ſince opportunity has put us in mind of the Vices of the City, to go a little Back,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34632:11"/>
and take a ſhort view of the Conſtitutions of our Anceſtors; after what manner they govern'd the Common-wealth, how they left it, and how being alter'd by Degrees, from moſt beautiful and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, it became deformed and flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>ROME,</hi> as I have gather'd from Tradition, at firſt the <hi>Trojans</hi> built and then poſſeſſ'd; who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of <hi>Eneas,</hi> Fugitives from their native Country, wander'd up and down without any certain Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; with whom alſo join'd the original Off-ſpring of the Land; a ſavage ſort of People, living at their full ſwinge of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Licence without Laws or Government. Theſe after they were muſter'd together within the ſame Walls, of differing Race, and different Language both, and no leſs different in their Manners and Ceremonies of living, incredible it is to think how eaſily they embody'd. But when their Power, enlarg'd with Number of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, with Conſtitutions and Extent of Territory, began to ſeem ſufficiently proſperous and prevalent, as generally it happens among Mortals, Envy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34632:11"/>
ſprung from Opulency. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes and States diſturb'd 'em with Invafions; few of their friends would ſtir to their Relief; the reſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd with fear kept far enough from danger. The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore ſedulous at home and no leſs diligent abroad, make haſt, prepare, encourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; march forth to meet the Enemy, and with their Arms protect their Liberty, their Country and their Aged Parents. Afterwards, when they had foyl'd all Danger, and repell'd it from their own Walls, they lent their Succour to their friends and Allies; and eſtabliſh'd Amity and Leagues among the neighbours more by giving than receiving benefits. Legitimate was their Form of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Title of their Form was Regal. Certain Perſons ſelected, whoſe bodies were infirm with years, but active Brains were vigorous in wiſdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted for the Common Good; who either for their Age, or the Reſemblance of their Cares, were call'd <hi>Fathers.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when Regal Dominion, made choice of at the beginning for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Liberties, and enlarging the Territories of the Common-wealth, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34632:12"/>
into Pride and Tyranny, changing their Cuſtom, they ſet up An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Governments, and became ſubject to two Supream Commanders. For by that means they thought to prevent the Pride of Dignity from growing too exorbitant. But at that time every one began to advance himſelf more and more, and to ſhew the ſharpneſs of his Wit upon all Occaſions. For Kings are ſtill more jealous of the vertuous than the wicked; and always that vertue which diſplays it ſelf in others is moſt formidable. But the City, ſo ſoon as once it had recover'd its Liberty, incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it is to think how ſuddenly in grew into Renown; ſuch was the univerſal deſire of Fame and Glory. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Youth of the City were no ſooner able to endure the Hardſhips of War, but in the Camp continual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour taught 'em the practice of Military Diſcipline; while their delight was only in their burniſh'd Armour, and their Warlike Steeds, contemning Effeminate Lewdneſs and Voluptuous Riot. To ſuch men therefore Labour was no unuſual thing, not any Cliff ſeem'd ſteep and rugged, nor armed Enemy frightful:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34632:12"/>
their vertue ſubdu'd all things; while the chiefeſt Conteſts among them were only for Fame and Honour. Every one haſten'd to give his Enemy the firſt Blow; to ſcale the Wall, and be conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the Action. In ſuch Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they plac'd their chiefeſt Riches, their greateſt Honour, and moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Nobility. Covetous of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe they were, but liberal of their Money; Vaſt Fame, but moderate Wealth was their deſire. I could call to mind in what pitch'd Fields the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> People with a ſmall handful of Men have over-thrown moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Armies of their Enemies; what Cities Fortifi'd by Nature they have wreſted from the Defendants by bare fighting, but that I fear ſo great a Task would draw me too far from my deſign. Nevertheleſs Fortune aſſuredly prevails in every thing, ſhe Celebrates or Ecclipſes all things more according to her own will and pleaſure than adhering to truth. The Actions of the <hi>Athenians</hi> were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently great and magnificent, in my Opinion; however ſomewhat leſs than Fame reports 'em. But in regard that there it was ſo many Writers flouriſh'd,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34632:13"/>
matchleſs for their Ingenuity, the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Atchievements are thoſe which are celebrated above all others over all the World. And the Vertue and Courage of thoſe that perform'd thoſe great Actions are deem'd to be as great as thoſe high ſoaring Wits had with their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence extoll'd 'em to be. But the People of <hi>Rome</hi> had never that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, becauſe that the moſt prudent were ſtill moſt publickly engag'd: no man exercis'd his Wit without his Body; every one choſe rather to act than ſpeak; and that his deeds of Merit ſhould rather be applauded by others, than that he ſhould be the magnifier of other Men's Exploits. And therefore both in Peace and War good Cuſtoms were religiouſly obſerv'd. There was moſt of Unity, the leaſt of Avarice. Right and Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them prevail'd by Nature more than through the Terrour of the Law. Their Quarrels, their Diſcords and their Contentions were only with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Citizen with Citizens conteſted only for preheminence in vertue: Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in their Adoration of the Gods, thrifty in their Houſes, and faithful to their Friends. By theſe two never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34632:13"/>
means, in War by daring Boldneſs, and when at Peace by Juſtice, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd both themſelves and the Common-weal. Of all which things I have theſe ſignal Proofs to produce, for that in War, they more ſeverely puniſh'd thoſe, who diſobedient to command adventur'd to fight the Enemy, or lateſt left the field when order'd to retreat, than ſuch as durſt forſake their Colours, or give ground to their Adverſary. On the other ſide, in Peace they rather choſe to oblige by beneficial Indulgence, than conſtrain by Fear: and having receiv'd an Affront they rather choſe to pardon than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute.</p>
            <p>Thus while the Common-wealth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd it ſelf by Labour and Juſtice, Kings vaſtly Potent were ſubdu'd by War, Barbarous and Populous Nations were tam'd by Force: <hi>Carthage</hi> jealous of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was utterly ruin'd; All Seas and Continents lay open; Fortune ſeem'd to rage and ranverſe all the world. They who had undergone all ſorts of Labour, Dangers, Hardſhips and Uncertainties of chance, Leaſure and Riches ſo much deſir'd by others, to them were but a Burthen and Affliction.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34632:14"/>
Firſt therefore Thirſt of Money, then of Rule encreas'd. They, were the Materials of all enſuing miſchiefs: for Avarice ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Fidelity, Probity, and all other vertuous Practices: in ſtead of theſe it taught 'em Pride, Cruelty, to neglect the Gods, and to put all things to Sale. On the other ſide Ambition enſlav'd her Captives to Treachery; to conceal one thing within their breaſts, and utter quite the contrary with their Tongues: to eſtimate friendſhip and hatred not as they are in themſelves, but according to the dictate of Intereſt: and to carry rather an honeſt Countenance than an honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Theſe things at firſt inſenſibly grew up, and ſometimes were puniſh'd. But when the Contagion once began to ſpread, the face of the whole City was alter'd, and that Government which was the juſteſt and the beſt, became not only Cruel but intolerable. But firſt of all Ambition more than Avarice employ'd the thoughts of Men. A Vice that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the neareſt of the two to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For that the ſedulous and ſlothful are equally covetous of Glory, Honour, and Dominion. However the one takes the Right Courſe to obtain his lawful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34632:14"/>
ends; the other wanting vertuous means, by fraud and treachery aſpires to what he never deſerv'd. Avarice, Toiles and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after Money; of which no wiſe man ever coveted the Superfluity. That Vice, envenom'd as it were with poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixtures, effeminates the body and the Maſculine Soul of all Mankind: 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unlimited and inſatiable; neither does abundance or penury exhauſt it.</p>
            <p>But after <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> having by force of Arms laid violent hands upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal, turn'd good beginnings into ruinous events, then there was nothing but rending and tearing; one muſt have a Houſe, another Lands; the Victours obſerv'd no bounds, no moderation, but fowl and hainous were there Cruelties to their fellow Citizens. To which we may add, that <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> contrary to the Cuſtom of our Anceſtors, oblig'd the Army which he had Commanded in <hi>Aſia,</hi> thereby to render it more affectionate and faithful to his Intereſt, by a Toleration of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Luxury, Debauchery; and the delightful Quarters where they wallow'd in pleaſure and eaſe, had ſoon ſoftn'd the fierce and martial Diſpoſitions of the Souldiery. And then it was that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34632:15"/>
Army firſt began to be in Love, to drink, to admire Pictures and emboſs'd Goblets of Gold and Silver, to commit public and private Robbery, to Plunder the very Temples, and to Pollute all things both ſacred and Prophane. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Souldiers, after they had once obtain'd the Victory, left nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the vanquiſh'd: For Proſperous ſucceſs never leaves tyring out the Minds of wiſeſt men with her Importunities, leaſt they themſelves, their Manners being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſhould moderate their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or know which way to conſult for the beſt.</p>
            <p>When Opulency thus began to be in high Eſteem, and that Renown, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Power attended upon Riches; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue began to grow Numb and Stupid, Poverty to be derided, and Innocence to be taken for Ill will. Therefore from the Source of Riches, <hi>Luxury</hi> and Avarice together with immoderate Pride firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth. And then their buſineſs was to catch and ſnatch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, deſpiſe their own and covet other Men's; to caſt off ſhame and modeſty, make no diſtinction of Divine or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor any reckoning of thrift or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34632:15"/>
It might be worth the while for him that firſt has view'd ſo many Houſes and Palaces, rear'd up as big as Villages, to viſit the Temples, which our Anceſtors, the moſt Religious of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, erected to the Gods. You find 'em much the leſſer Fabricks; yet they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd their Temples with Piety, their Houſes with Fame and Honour; nor did they deprive the Vanquiſh'd of any thing but only the Liberty of doing wrong. But theſe men, quite the contrary, of Mortals the moſt ſlothful, moſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ingloriouſly wreſt from their Friends and Allies thoſe things which their Couragious and Victorious Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors left their very Enemies, as if doing wrong were the true Exerciſe of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For wherefore ſhould I call to mind thoſe things, which, unleſs to ſuch as have beheld 'em, are hardly Credible, that is to ſay, great Mountains levell'd, and whole Sea's built over by ſeveral Private Perſons, that in ſo doing ſeem'd to me to make a May-game of their Riches? ſince what they might have honourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, they made ſuch haſt in ſcorn to fling away. Nor is the Rage of adulterous Luſt, of Brothel-haunting and other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34632:16"/>
Beſtialities leſs prevalent, while Men as Women ſuffer, and Women make public Proſtitutions of their Chaſtity: to ſatiate their Riot, they ranſack Sea and Land: They ſleep ere need of Reſt requires: Nor will they ſtay in expectation of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Thirſt, of Cold or Wearineſs; but all thoſe things their Luxury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. And thoſe Exorbitances inflam'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth, when once their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies fail'd, to ſeek for new ſupplies, by Acts of Horror and Impiety: for when the Mind is ſeaſon'd thoroughly with evil Courſes, it never fails of looſe deſires; and for that reaſon ſo much the more profuſely raves after extravagant Gain and wild Expence.</p>
            <p>In ſo great and ſo corrupt a City, <hi>Cataline,</hi> a Peice of Pomp moſt eaſily to be obtain'd, walk'd the Streets atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by whole Troops of Diſſolute Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians and Debauchees that follow'd his Heels, like ſo many Guards of his Body. For whoever he were that void of ſhame, an Adulterer, a Glutton or a Gameſter had diſſipated his Paternal Fortunes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Hand, or kindneſs to his Belly, Venereal Member, or run himſelf up to the Ears in debt, to purchaſe the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34632:16"/>
Pardon of his Villanies: all Parricides, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Perſons, Convicts after Sentence, or ſuch as fear'd the Judgment of the Law for their Miſdeeds; moreover ſuch whoſe Hands or Tongues earn'd 'em their Bread by Perjuries or Shedding Civil Blood; and laſtly, all whom Villany, Penury, or guilt of Conſcience agitated with Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Terror, Theſe were <hi>Cataline</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars and Favourites. Or if any Perſon blameleſs and free from miſcarriage hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to light into his friendſhip, by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practice and repeated Allurements, he ſoon was taught to be alike and equal to the Reſt; for above all he coveted the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of young men, whoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's being ſoft and yielding, were eaſily entangl'd in the ſnares of crafty Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For ſtill as he obſerv'd the Flame of their youthful Inclinations, ſome he dazl'd with the Charms of Curtezans; while others were won with Dogs and Horſes. Nor did he ſpare for Coſt or to expoſe his own Reputation, ſo he might render 'em obnoxious and faithful to himſelf. I know there were ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who ſhrewdly ſuſpected, that the Young Gentlemen frequenting <hi>Cataline</hi>'s Houſe, were ſomewhat too undecently
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34632:17"/>
laviſh of their Chaſtity: But that Report was raiſs'd and believ'd, rather upon other Grounds, then that any Perſon could affirm it upon knowledg. <hi>Cataline</hi> had been Guilty of ſeveral Nefarious Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as having Debauch'd a Lady of Noble Extraction, and a Veſtal Virgin, beſides ſundry other Crimes, of the ſame Nature, which he had Committed in Contempt of Gods and Men. At length, falling in Love with <hi>Aurelia Oreſtilla,</hi> who had never any thing in the World to Commend her in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any honeſt Man, beſides her Form, becauſe ſhe delay'd to marry him for fear of her Son-in-Law that was of Age, 'tis certainly believ'd, that he murder'd the Young Man, and extinguiſh'd the Family to enjoy an Impious Wedlock. Which Fact of his ſeems chiefly to me to have been the Cauſe of haſtning his Villanous Deſign. For his Polluted Soul abominable both to Gods and Men, could take no reſt awake or aſleep; in ſuch a manner did his Conſcience perplex and terrify his reſtleſs and deſtracted Mind. Therefore was his Complexion pale and wan; his Eyes hollow, his Pace ſometimes ſwift, ſometimes ſlow; in a

word, Madneſs and Fury diſplay'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in every Lineament of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And for the Young Gentlemen whom he had thus debauch'd, he was not wanting ſo to inſtruct 'em, as to make 'em ſerviceable to all his pernicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. For out of them he cull'd Falſe Witneſſes and Forgers of Wills and Deeds. Them he taught to deſpiſe their Credit, their Fortunes and all manner of Danger. And when he had thus ruin'd their Honour, and their Modeſty, then he Commanded other greater Villanies. And if he could not meet with a preſent Opportunity for Miſchief, they were to circumvent and maſſacre the Innocent as if they had been guilty; meerly to keep their thoughts and hands in ure; while their Tutour rather choſe to exerciſe his Cruelty <hi>gratis,</hi> then to lie idle in drowſy wickedneſs. Confiding in ſuch Friends and Aſſociates as theſe, <hi>Cataline</hi> began to conſult how he might graſp the Soveraign Power, and ſubdue the Common-weal: ſo much the rather becauſe he knew his own Retinue to be ſo vaſtly every where in debt, and for that the moſt of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Souldiers having ſpent their ill got Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and calling theſe Victorious daies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34632:18"/>
to mind, when they wallow'd in Rapine and Maſſacre, both the one and the other thirſted after Civil War. In <hi>Italy</hi> there was no Army. <hi>Pompey</hi> was waging War in the remote parts of the World; he had great hopes, if he ſtood for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, of obtaining it. The Senate were careleſs and minded little buſineſs; all things were quiet and a kind of Calm of Affairs: which were all ſeaſonable Opportunities for <hi>Cataline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore about the firſt of <hi>June, Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Caius Figulus</hi> being Conſuls, firſt he diſcourſes 'em in private one by one, encourages ſome, of others he feels the Pulſes, urges his own Power, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided Condition of the Common-wealth, and the vaſt rewards of a Succeſsful Conſpiracy: and when he had ſufficiently tented every one in particular, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons 'em all together, whom he knew to be moſt in want and daringly bold. Upon this ſummons there appeared of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Order <hi>Publius Lentulus Sura,</hi> P. <hi>Autronius, Caſſius Longinus, Caius Cethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, P.</hi> and <hi>Ser. Sylla,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Servius; Lucius Vargunteius, Q. Annius, M. Porcius Lecca, Lucius Beſtia, Q. Curius.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of the degree of Knights, <hi>M. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34632:18"/>
Nobilior, Lucius Statilius, Mar. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binius Capito,</hi> and <hi>Caius Cornelius.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe there were alſo many out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, and Municipal Towns, who were of Noble Extraction at home. Nor were there wanting a good number of other Accomplices, who more privately and cloſely favour'd and abetted this deſign, excited rather by the Hopes of Domination, than through any want or neceſſity. However, the Greateſt part of the Younger ſort, eſpecially the Nobly deſcended, wiſh'd well to <hi>Cataline</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: who having ſufficient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to live in Pomp and Luxury, yet rather choſe Uncertainties for Certainties, and War inſtead of Peace. There were alſo ſome at the ſame time who verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that <hi>M. Licinius Craſſus</hi> was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Deſign, in regard that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> whom he hated, then Commanding a numerous Army, he minded not what Party he ſupported in Oppoſition to his Power: Confident moreover, That if the Conſpiracy prevail'd, he ſhould eaſily be able to make himſelf chief Head of the Faction. Yet ſome few there were, who joyn'd in a Conſpiracy againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth before: of which deſign it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34632:19"/>
my purpoſe now, as truly as I can, to give a plain and unbyaſs'd account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>L. Tullus,</hi> and <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> being Conſuls, <hi>P. Autronius,</hi> and <hi>P. Sylla</hi> being deſign'd Conſuls, being accus'd of uſing indirect means to attain their Honour, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the Puniſhment of the Law. A little after that, <hi>Cataline</hi> being condemn'd for Bribery, was forbid to ſtand for the Conſulſhip; ſo that he could not give in his Name within the days appointed by the Law. At the ſame time there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Cn. Piſo,</hi> a Young Gentleman of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Ancient Extraction, moſt daringly Arrogant, Needy and Factious, whoſe wants and wicked courſe of Life, ſpurr'd him forward to diſturb the Common-wealth. With him <hi>Cataline</hi> and <hi>Autro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> having conſulted together upon the Fifth of <hi>December,</hi> agreed upon the Firſt of <hi>January</hi> enſuing to Aſſaſſinate <hi>Lucius Cotta,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Torquatus,</hi> the two Conſuls, in the Capitol. Which done, they themſelves, after they had ſeiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Faſces,</hi> or Enſigns of Conſular Dignity, were to have ſent <hi>Piſo</hi> with an Army to take Poſſeſſion of both the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Provinces. But this Plot having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wind, they deferr'd the Execution of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34632:19"/>
the Murder till the Fifth of <hi>February</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but contriv'd in the mean time the Maſſacre, not only of the Conſuls, but of moſt of the Senators; ſo that had not <hi>Cataline</hi> been too haſty to give the Signal to the reſt of his Confedrates, ſince the firſt Foundations of <hi>Rome</hi> were laid, never had an Act of Villany ſo execrable been perpetrated within her Walls. But the Conſpirators not meeting ſo early as they ought to have done, that Opportunity was loſt. After this, <hi>Piſo</hi> was ſent Treaſurer or <hi>Questor</hi> into the hither Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> with <hi>Praetorian</hi> Power, <hi>Craſſus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at it, becauſe he knew him to be a bitter Enemy of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s. Neither was the Senate averſe from decreeing him the province, as being deſirous to remove from the City a Perſon of his Vitious Principles. Beſides, they thought that many good men might relie upon him; for that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s greatneſs began already to be formidable. But <hi>Piſo,</hi> in his Journey toward his Province, was ſlain by certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſemen that he carry'd along with him in his Army. Some there are who report, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> could not brook his unjuſt, his haughty and Cruel Commands: though others ſay,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34632:20"/>
that thoſe Horſemen, having been long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troniz'd by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and being become his faithful Clients, had by his connivance made that attempt upon <hi>Piſo:</hi> for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had never enterpriz'd ſo foul a fact before; although they had ſuffer'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly many more Severities of Lordly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: However it were, we ſhall leave the Queſtion undetermin'd: and ſo let this ſuffice concerning the firſt Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cataline,</hi> when he ſaw the Perſons, by me already mention'd, to be Aſſembl'd all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though he had frequently diſcours'd the Point with every one apart, however, deeming it more advantageous to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to beſpeak and encourage'em all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, withdrew into the remoteſt part of the Houſe, and there excluding all others that were not abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, he made 'em an Oration to this Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Were I not ſufficiently aſſur'd of your Courage and Fidelity, in vain this Opportunity had happen'd; in vain had I conceiv'd theſe Noble hopes of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion; nor ſhould I go about to graſp at uncertainties upon the weak ſupport of Sloth, or fickle Irreſolution. But becauſe I have found ye ſtout and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34632:20"/>
faithful to me in many and moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Attempts, therefore it is that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Bravery has begun the Greateſt and Nobleſt of Deſigns: as alſo for that I underſtand you have no other Felicity or Miſeries but what are ſtill the ſame with mine; for to have ſtill the ſame deſires, and the ſame diſaffections, that's the only firm and perfect Friendſhip. Now what it is I have been thus revolving in my mind, you have already ſeverally heard. And I muſt tell ye, that this Reſolution of mine is every day ſtill more and more enflam'd, when I conſider what our future Condition of Life muſt be, unleſs that we our ſelves redeem our own endanger'd Liberty. For when the Common-wealth is once reduc'd under the Power and Juriſdiction of a few, then ſhall Kings and Tetrachs be their Slaves and Tributary Vaſſals. People, Nations muſt pay Them their Taxes and Impoſitions: all others, as well the Brave, the Stout, the Noble muſt be the Vulgar Herd, diſhonour'd and without the leaſt Authority, in ſubjection to Them, to whom, did but the Common-wealth retain it's perfect
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34632:21"/>
Health and Vigour, we ſhould be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: while they engroſs to themſelves all Favours, Honour, Dignity and Riches, or elſe beſtow 'em where they pleaſe, but leave us nothing but Dangers, Repulſes, Condemnations and Poverty: which how long will ye at length endure, moſt Couragious of Men? Is it not far more glorious to dye Magnanimouſly and Bravely, then Ignominiouſly to loſe a miſerable and contemptible Life, after ye have been the ſport and ſcorn of others domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pride? But by the Faith of Gods and Men the Fault's our own; The Victory is in our hands; Our years are in their Prime; Our Courage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and Vigorous; They, on the other ſide, grown old and feeble with Age and Wealth. We only want but to begin, the reſt would follow. For who among the Race of Mortals, endu'd but with a Maſculine Spirit, would ere endure, that they ſhould wallow in wealth, which they profuſely laviſh in rearing Palaces upon the Sea, and levelling Mountains, while we are pinch'd at home with want of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? That they ſhould have their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34632:21"/>
Change of Sumptuous Houſes, while we can no where find a Cottage of our own to harbour our Miſery? They purchaſe Pictures, Statues, Sculptures and Emboſſments of all ſorts to pamper their Eyes; pull down, build up again, and by all manner of extortions hale and torture Money to themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtill with all their Luxury to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their Wealth; we Starve at home, abroad our debts ore-whelm us; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable our Condition, and our hopes more deſperate: Then what remains for us beſides a wretched Life? Why ſleep ye therefore? Behold that Same, that very Liberty which ye have ſo often ſigh'd for: Moreover Plenty, Splendour, Honour, ſhew themſelves in view: For all thoſe things does Fortune offer to the Victors. Let the Enterprize it ſelf, the Opportunity, the Dangers, your own Wants and the magnificent Spoils of War inflame your Courage beyond my Oration. And whether you make uſe of me as your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander or a Private Souldier, my Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour nor my Perſon ſhall be abſent from ye. For theſe are ſtill the things which I intend to act in Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34632:22"/>
with ye; unleſs perhaps my Courage fail me, and you prove more prepar'd to ſerve, then to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things were heard by People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Miſery, but to whom not any hope ſurviv'd: and though they look'd upon it as a ſufficient recompence to be diſturbers of Public Tranquillity; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the greateſt Part deſir'd him to declare the Conditions of the War; what rewards the ſucceſs of their Arms might Challenge; how their wants and how their expectations might every way be ſatisfi'd. Then <hi>Cataline</hi> promis'd 'em <hi>New Tables,</hi> or the Cancelling of their Debts, the Proſcription of the Wealthy, Offices, Prieſthoods, Rapines, Plunder, and all thoſe Advantages which War and the Victors Fury render lawful. Moreover he aſſur'd 'em that <hi>Piſo</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the Hither Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> that in <hi>Mauritania P. Sitius Nucerinus</hi> was lodg'd with an Army, Both privy to his deſign. That <hi>C. Antonius</hi> ſtood for the <hi>Conſulſhip,</hi> and as he hop'd would happen to be his Collegue, his Familiar Friend, and a Perſon under the burthen of utmoſt Indigency. That being Conſul with him he would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34632:22"/>
then begin to act. Moreover all whom he thought Honeſt he loaded with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and Reproaches: then calling every one of his own Confederates by their Names, ſome he applauded, others he put in mind of their Penury, ſeveral of the danger of Puniſhment and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy that attended 'em; and many of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victory, eſpecially thoſe who had taſted the ſweets of Pillage and Rapine. Then beholding a chearful unanimity in their Countenances, after he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd 'em to be mindful of ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening his Party againſt he ſtood for the Conſulſhip, he diſmiſs'd the Aſſembly. Some there were, who at that time repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Cataline,</hi> after he had concluded his Oration, when he took the oath of ſecrecy from his Confederates, caus'd Human Blood to be mingl'd with the wine, and then to be given about to every man his Cup. Of which, when after the Repetition of the Curſe, they had all ſipp'd, according to Cuſtom at the Solemn Sacrifices, then he reveal'd the depth of his deſign, and told 'em the reaſon of his urging ſuch a Ceremony, which was to engage 'em to the greater Secrecy and Fidelity one among ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34632:23"/>
while ſodder'd thus together, equal in Guilt, and equal in their Fears. Yet ſome there were who deem'd theſe Stories fain'd, and many things invented beſides by thoſe, who believ'd, that the <hi>Antipathy</hi> conceiv'd againſt <hi>Cicero,</hi> which brake out ſoon after, might be aſſwag'd by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the hainouſneſs of their Crime, who had ſuffer'd puniſhment. However 'tis my Opinion, That had the Crime been ſo great as was reported, it could not have eſcap'd our knowledge.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe precautions, there was in this Conſpiracy <hi>Quintus Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> a Perſon of no mean Parentage, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly branded with all manner of Lewdneſs and Villany, whom therefore the Cenſors had expell'd the Senate as a Public Nuiſance.</p>
            <p>This Perſon was a Man no leſs vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious than inſolently bold: He neither could contain the Secrets which he heard, nor conceal the Crimes which he himſelf committed. Among the reſt he had been long familiar with <hi>Fulvia,</hi> a Woman however of Noble Deſcent, to whom at length when he became impertinent and troubleſom by reaſon of his Indigency, that could no longer preſent and treat her
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34632:23"/>
as he was wont; of a ſudden, as if he had commanded all the World, he began to promiſe her whole Seas and Mountains; at other times threatning her with his drawn Sword, unleſs She comply'd with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and in ſhort, to behave himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more Lordly and Domineering man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then formerly. <hi>Fulvia</hi> therefore, having ſifted out the cauſe of this unſual ſwagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her Paramor, ne'er went about to conceal a danger that ſo nearly threatn'd the Common-wealth, but ſuppreſſing her Authors name, recounted to ſeveral what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever She had heard concerning <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy. This Rumor firſt of all ſtirr'd up the Favor and good Will of moſt Men, to procure the Conſulſhip for <hi>M. Tullius Cicero.</hi> For before that time the greateſt part of the Nobility burn'd with diſdain, and thought the Conſulſhip defil'd by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a Perſon but newly known to the World, though otherwiſe of ſoaring and egregious Parts, to that degree of Honour. But when Danger was ſo near their doors, Malice and Pride were laid aſleep. Therefore upon the day of Election <hi>M. Tullius</hi> and <hi>C. Antonius</hi> were declar'd Conſuls. Which was the firſt thing that ſhook the Abetters of the Conſpiracy.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34632:24"/>
However, <hi>Cataline</hi>'s Fury was nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated; but every day made new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes to advance his Deſign; making Proviſion of Arms in all Convenient Places all over <hi>Italy:</hi> and taking up Money either upon his own or the Credit of his Friends, ſent it away to one <hi>Manlius,</hi> then dwelling or reſiding at <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Now</hi> Fieſoli, <hi>two Miles from</hi> Florence.</note> 
               <hi>Faeſulae,</hi> and afterwards Captain General for the War.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time he is reported to have purchas'd to himſelf ſeveral Men of all Sorts and Conditions; nay, and ſome Women too, who firſt of all had maintain'd themſelves at a prodigious Rate by the Proſtitution of their Bodies; but afterward, decay of Youth and Beauty limiting their Gains, though not their Luxury, had vaſtly run themſelves in Debt. By their Aſſiſtance <hi>Catiline</hi> thought to ſollicite and inveigle the City Rabble, to ſet the houſes on fire, and either to gain or murder their Husbands. In this Number was <hi>Sempronia,</hi> who had frequently Committed ſeveral Facts of Maſculine boldneſs. This Woman was for her Birth and Beauty, in her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alſo and her Children ſufficiently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34632:24"/>
happy; well acquainted with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Learning; Sung and Danc'd with much more exactneſs and elegancy then was neceſſary for a Woman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chaſtity. With many other Graces alſo that heighten Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was ſhe endow'd; but ſtill ſhe priz'd all other things above her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. Whether ſhe were more Prodigal of her Money or her Reputation you could not eaſily diſcern; and ſuch was the heat of her Luſt, that ſhe more often courted Men, then Men Her. Falſe to her Promiſe, to her Truſt Forſworn, and Driving head-long where-ever the Torrent of her Luxury and Poverty carry'd her. Otherwiſe a Woman of no mean Wit: for ſhe made Verſes, jeſted facetiouſly, could vary her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Modeſt or Obſcene according to her Company: and in a word had all the Charms of Speech and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>All this Proviſion thus far made, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi> nevertheleſs put in to be Conſul the next year, hoping if he were elected, that he ſhould govern <hi>Antonius</hi> at his own pleaſure. Nor was he Idle in the mean while, but laid all Ambuſhments
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34632:25"/>
imaginable for <hi>Cicero,</hi> who on the other ſide wanted neither craft nor ſubtilty to guard himſelf; for from the beginning of his Conſulſhip, making great Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by <hi>Fulvia</hi>'s means he had brought it to that paſs, that <hi>Quintus Curius</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid open to him <hi>Catiline</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. And beſides that, he had made ſure of his Collegue <hi>Antony,</hi> by confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him the Grant of his Province, that he ſhould not diſſent in any thing from him to the Prejudice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. He had his Guards of Friends and Clients alſo alwaies within call.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſo ſoon as the day of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was paſt, and that <hi>Catiline</hi> had not only miſſ'd of the Conſulſhip, but alſo fail'd in all the Snares and Plots which he had contriv'd againſt <hi>Cicero,</hi> he reſolv'd upon a War, and to make tryal of all Extremities, ſince what he had Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinly attempted, had prov'd ſo difficult and unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Therefore he diſpatch'd away <hi>C. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to <hi>Fieſoli,</hi> one <hi>Septimius Camertes</hi> into the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Now called</hi> La Marca D'Ancona.</note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Picenum, C. Julius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Apulia;</hi> and ſome one way, others another, as he thought every
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34632:25"/>
one might prove moſt ſerviceable to him. In the mean while himſelf at <hi>Rome</hi> had many Irons in the Fire, to get the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul Murdred; to order the firing of the City, to ſeize and fill convenient Poſts with Armed men; ſome he commanded; others he encourag'd, to the end they might be always ready and prepar'd: Day and Night in a continual Hurry; reſtleſs, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and yielding neither to want of ſleep, nor labour. Laſtly, When after many meditated Miſchiefs, nothing ſucceeded, again in a tempeſtuous Night he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd the Ring-leaders of the Conſpiracy by <hi>M. Porcius Lecca.</hi> Who being met, he chid 'em firſt for their Remiſsneſs, then gave 'em to underſtand, how he had ſent <hi>Manlius</hi> before to head ſuch Forces as he had got together ready to take Arms: Others to other convenient Places: and that he was prepar'd to go to the Army himſelf, ſo ſoon as he could but get <hi>Cicero</hi> murder'd; for that mainly obſtructed his Deſigns. Thereupon, when all the reſt were in a kind of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tottering in their Reſolutions, <hi>C. Cornelius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, and with him <hi>L. Vargunteius,</hi> a Senator, promiſing their Aſſiſtance, they agreed to go that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34632:26"/>
Night, with an armed Retinue, as if it were upon a Viſit to <hi>Cicero;</hi> and ere he were aware to Stab him unprovided in his own Houſe. Preſently <hi>Curius,</hi> when he underſtood the Danger that ſo nearly threatn'd the Conſul, by <hi>Fulvia</hi> gave him ſwift Intelligence of the ſudden Plot upon his Life. So that the Aſſaſſinates not being permitted Entrance into the Houſe, they undertook in vain a Fact ſo Hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Manlius</hi> Sollicits the Rabble in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where want and the ſmart of former ſufferings had prepar'd the People for Change; for that under the Tyrannical Uſurpation of <hi>Sylla,</hi> they had loſt their Lands and all their Goods. Nor did he leave uninveigl'd the very Thieves and Robbers, who were very numerous in that Country; and ſome that <hi>Sylla</hi> himſelf had planted there by way of remuneration, who by their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury and Prodigality, had waſted what before they had got by Plunder and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cicero</hi> had Intelligence of theſe Proceedings, ſtartl'd at the Apprehenſion of a double Miſchief, and finding he could no longer, by his ſingle care and aſſiduity,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34632:26"/>
Protect the City from menacing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, nor certainly knew how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Manlius</hi>'s Forces were, nor what his Councels drove at, he reports the whole Matter to the Senate, which had been toſs'd already to and fro in common Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and vulgar Diſcourſe. Thereupon, as uſually was done on all Important Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the Senate decreed, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls ſhould take care, leaſt the Common-wealth receiv'd any Damage. Which Power, the greateſt that could be, was granted by the Senate to the Supream Magiſtracy, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; to raiſe Armies, carry on the War, and by all ways whatever to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and curb both Subjects and Allies: and both at Home and in the Field to Exerciſe both Soveraign Empire and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature. Otherwiſe, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the People, no Conſul has any Authority to act in thoſe Affairs.</p>
            <p>Some few days after, <hi>L. Senius,</hi> read certain Letters in the Senate, which he ſaid were brought him from <hi>Fieſoli;</hi> of which the purport was, That <hi>C. Manlius</hi> had taken Arms with a numerous Multitude, about the beginning of <hi>November.</hi> And ſome there were, as is uſual upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34632:27"/>
that talk'd of great Prodigies and Wonders: Others diſcours'd of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Aſſemblies in ſeveral places, of Arms carry'd to <hi>Capua,</hi> and that the Slaves would riſe in <hi>Apulia.</hi> Thereupon by a Decree of the Senate, <hi>Q. Marcius Rex</hi> was diſpatch'd away for <hi>Fieſoli,</hi> and <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Creticus,</hi> was ſent into <hi>Apulia</hi> and the neighbouring Parts. Both theſe returning to the City, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd their triumphal Entrance, through the malice of ſome few Detractors, whoſe Cuſtom it was to put all things to Sale, whether honeſt or diſhoneſt. But for the Pretors, <hi>Q. Pompeius Rufus, Q. Metellus Celer,</hi> the firſt was ſent to <hi>Capua,</hi> and the latter into <hi>Picenum,</hi> or <hi>La Marca</hi> D' <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> with Power to raiſe an Army ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Importance of the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and the Danger. Moreover if any one ſhould make any diſcovery of the Conſpiracy on foot againſt the Common-wealth, Rewards were promis'd; to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant his Liberty, and Two Thouſand Five Hundred Crowns; To a Freeman, a General Pardon and Five Thouſand Crowns. They alſo farther decreed, That the Families of the Gladiators ſhould be ſeparated and diſtributed into <hi>Capua</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34632:27"/>
ſuch other Municipal Towns, that were moſt wealthy and populous; That at <hi>Rome</hi> the Guards ſhould be doubl'd through the whole City; and, That the inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould take charge of the Watches. Theſe things put the whole City into ſuch a Conſternation, that the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the People were quite alter'd; inſtead of Jolity and Wantonneſs, the effects of long repoſe, all Men were ſeiz'd with ſudden Sadneſs and Perplexity: all in a Hurry; all in Fear; not knowing whom to truſt, or where to be ſecure; neither at War, nor in Peace, but every one meaſuring his danger by his fears. Nay the very Women too, to whom the Terrors of War, in ſuch a Potent Common-wealth, were altogether unuſual, bemoan'd themſelves; ſpread their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant hands to Heaven; bewail'd their tender Infants; inquir'd the News; dreaded all things; and laying aſide their Pride and Pleaſures grew diſtruſtful of their own and the ſafety of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But <hi>Catiline</hi>'s cruel fury acted ſtill with the ſame Vigor, notwithſtanding the Preparations of Military oppoſition, and that he himſelf were impeach'd upon the <hi>Plautian</hi> Statute by <hi>L. Paulus.</hi> But then
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34632:28"/>
to ſhew how well he could diſſemble, or elſe to juſtifie himſelf, as if the Quarrel had been pickt out purpoſe to teaze him, he went into the Senate. At what time <hi>M. Tullius,</hi> the Conſul, either dreading his Preſence, or incens'd with Anger, made a ſplendid Speech, highly to the benefit of the Common-wealth, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he publiſh'd to the World. But ſo ſoon as he ſate down again, <hi>Catiline,</hi> who was a perſon well prepar'd for all manner of Diſſimulation, with a dejected Countenance and ſuppliant Tone, beſought the Fathers not over raſhly to credit vain Reports concerning him; that the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was ſuch from whence he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and ſuch the Life which he had lead from his Youth, that he had all things great and good to hope for: Nor to believe that he, a Perſon of Patrician Quality, whoſe own and the ſervices of his Anceſtors had been ſo beneficial to the <hi>Roman</hi> People, ſtood in need of a ruin'd Common-weal, eſpecially when <hi>M. Tullius</hi> forſooth preſerv'd it, an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which words being cloſely follow'd with other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Invectives, all humm'd him down, and call'd him Enemy and Parricide.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34632:28"/>
Then in a Rage, <q>Becauſe, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> Thus circumvented, I am driven head-long by my Adverſaries, I'll extinguiſh the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of my Fortunes with Ruine.</q> And ſo ſaying he flung out of the Senate, and made directly home; there muſing and revolving many Miſchiefs in his Mind: for that he ſaw his Plots upon the Conſul had no ſucceſs; and underſtood beſides, that the City was ſufficiently guarded from all Attempts of Fire. And therefore deeming it his wiſeſt courſe to augment his Army, and before the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were enroll'd, to be beforehand with many things that might be uſeful to him in the War, with a few Attendants in a Tempeſtuous Night, he poſted to the <hi>Manlian</hi> Camp. But firſt he left ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with <hi>Cethegus, Lentulus</hi> and others, whoſe daring Boldneſs he ſufficiently knew, to ſtrenghthen the Power of the Faction by all the ways they could; to haſten the Deſtruction of the Conſul, to provide for Slaughter, Conflagration, and all the diſmal Executions of War: and that he himſelf in a ſhort time would appear before the Walls of the City. Now while theſe things were thus acted at <hi>Rome, C. Manlius</hi> ſent certain Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34632:29"/>
ſelected out of his own Number, to <hi>Q. Marcius Rex,</hi> with Inſtructions to the following Effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>We call both Gods and Men to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Noble General, That we have taken up Arms, neither againſt our Country, nor to terrify others with the fears of danger; but only to protect our Bodies from Oppreſſion. Who miſerable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, and over-whelm'd with Violence and Cruelty of Uſurers, are moſt of us deveſted of our Country, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil'd of our Reputation, and our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Neither is it permitted any of Us, according to the Cuſtom of our Fathers, to have the benefit of the Law; nor after the loſs of our Patrimonies, to enjoy the freedom of our Bodies. Such was the ſeverity of the Bankers and the Pretor. Yet your Forefathers in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> People by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees reliev'd their Wants: and lately, in our Memory, by reaſon ſo vaſt a a number were every where endebted, by the conſent of all good Men, three parts of the Silver Credit were abated, and only a fourth part paid in Braſs. Nor is it the firſt time that the Common-People themſelves, either affect Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34632:29"/>
or provok'd to Arms by the Pride of the Magiſtrates, have revolted from the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But neither do we deſire Empire or Wealth, the general Cauſes of all the Wars and Conteſts among Mortals: 'tis only Liberty we ſee, which no man of Courage ever loſes, but his Life together with it. We conjure both Thy ſelf and the Senate, that you will conſult the good of your unfortunate fellow-Citizens; that you will reſtore us the benefit of the Law, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the <hi>Pretor</hi> has wreſted from Us: and that you will not impoſe that dire Neceſſity upon Us, to ſeek which way to periſh, chiefly in revenge of our own Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Q. Marcius</hi> return'd for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if they had any thing to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Senate, they ſhould lay down their Arms, and repair in an humble manner to <hi>Rome.</hi> That the Senate and the <hi>Roman</hi> People were endu'd with that Meekneſs and Compaſſion, that never any Supplicant in vain implor'd their Aſſiſtance. On the other ſide <hi>Catiline,</hi> while he was upon the Road, ſent Letters to all the Conſular Perſonages, and the chiefeſt of the Nobility, That being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34632:30"/>
with falſe Aceuſations, becauſe he could not withſtand the Faction of his Enemies, he had therefore ſubmitted to Fortune, and was retiring, a willing Exile, to <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> not that he was guilty of ſo great a Crime; but for the Repoſe of the Common-weal; and that no Sedition might ariſe from his contending with the Public. But <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> read other Letters in the Senate, quite different from theſe; which he affirm'd to be deliver'd to him in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>'s Name, and of which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Copy gives the ſence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>L. Catiline</hi> to <hi>Quint. Catulus,</hi> Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thy ſingular Fidelity, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of the thing it ſelf, ſo grateful to me in theſe my threatning dangers; gives me the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe three Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be very imperfect in the Original.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have determin'd not to ground any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon new Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; yet I have decreed to propound ſatisfaction, as no way conſcious of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending: which in good truth it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for thee to know. At length provok'd with Slights and Contumelies; for that being depriv'd the fruits of all my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34632:30"/>
Labour and Induſtry, I could not obtain the Dignity I ſtood for, according to my innate diſpoſition, I have undertaken the public Cauſe of the Unfortunate. Not but that I could pay my own Debts by the Sale of my Lands; and for what I ſtand engag'd for others, the Liberality of <hi>Oreſtilla</hi> has been ſuch as to take care to diſcharge it out of her own and her Daughters Revenues; but becauſe I ſaw unworthy Perſons advanc'd to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, my ſelf neglected and thrown by, through jealouſie and counterfeited ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. For that reaſon I have purſu'd thoſe Hopes for preſerving the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my Reputation, which, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my Condition, I deem to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently honeſt. While I was about to have written more, Intelligence was brought me, That Force is preparing. I recommend <hi>Oreſtilla</hi> to thy Care, and depoſite her in Truſt with thee, Conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee for the ſake of thy own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to protect her from all Injury. Farewel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Catiline</hi> himſelf after he had ſtaid ſome few days with <hi>C. Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>Campo Pendente.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Reatinum,</hi> to to Arm the Neighbouring

Parts, already ſollicited and drawn to his Party, he March'd directly to the Camp, to joyn <hi>Manlius</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular <hi>Faſces,</hi> and other Enſigns of Supream Authority born before him.</p>
            <p>When theſe things were known at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate pronounc'd both <hi>Catiline</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> open Enemies. To all the reſt of the Multitude, thoſe only excepted that were convicted of Capital Crimes, they prefix'd a certain day, before which time, if they departed from their Arms, they ſhould incur no Penalties. Farther alſo they decreed, That the Conſuls ſhould proceed to a Muſter, that <hi>Antony</hi> ſhould follow <hi>Catiline</hi> with his Army, and that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſhould ſtay to take care of the City. At that time, the vaſt Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> People ſeem'd to me beyond extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable. To whom when all the Conquer'd World, from the Riſing to the Setting Sun, pay'd Homage and Obedience; when they wallow'd at home in Plenty and Tranquillity, which Mortals deem their chiefeſt Bleſſings; that among <hi>Them</hi> there ſhould be ſuch a Crew of fellow-Citizens, ſo fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſuch obſtinate Fury bent to ruine themſelves, their Fortunes and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34632:31"/>
Common-weal. For after two Decrees of Senate, among ſo vaſt a Multitude, neither did ſo much as one, aſſur'd of great Rewards, make the leaſt Diſcovery of the Conſpiracy; nor any one deſert the Camp of their Rebellious Leader, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline.</hi> Such was the violence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which like a Contagion had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Minds of all thoſe People. Neither did this Peſtilence ſpread it ſelf, to alienate the Affections of thoſe alone, who were guilty of the Conſpiracy; but even all the Commonalty, covetous of Innovation, applauded <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But this they ſeem'd to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their uſual Cuſtom. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in a City, they who labour under Penury, envy the better Fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; extol the Wicked; abominate the ancient Conſtitutions, covet Novelty, and deteſting their own Conditions, ſtudy Change of all things: they are nouriſh'd, void of Care, by Tumult and Sedition; For that want is eaſily ſupported and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd with public dammage. But many Motives carry'd head-long the City Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Firſt of all, who ever they were that in any corner of the Country, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd in Impudence and Debauchery;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34632:32"/>
whoever had waſted their Patrimonies by expenſive Lewdneſs; And laſtly, all whom Villany and Crimes the moſt Enormous had Out-law'd from their Native homes; all theſe together empty'd into <hi>Rome,</hi> as into the <hi>Common Sewer</hi> of all Diſorder. Many others remembring <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, while they beheld ſome rais'd from Souldiers to the degree of Senators; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo Wealthy, that they liv'd like Princes in the height of Eaſe and Plenty; promiſed every one to themſelves the ſame Enjoyments from ſucceſsful Victory. Moreover the Younger ſort, that wrought hard for a poor Living in the Country, finding the ſweets of Private and Public Liberality, preferr'd the City Eaſe before ſevere and painful Labour. However both Them and all the reſt, the Public Calamity ſupported. So that it is the leſs to be admir'd that Men ſo badly. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipl'd, ſo wrapt up in Expectation, ſhould be as little careful for the Common good, as for themſelves. And then again, all thoſe whoſe Parents upon <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victory, were proſcrib'd, who loſt their Eſtates, and were depriv'd of their Right of Freedom, had the ſame Intereſt in the Succeſs of the War. To which I may add, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34632:32"/>
whoever ſided with any other Faction than that of the Senate, rather deſir'd to ſee the Common-wealth diſturb'd, than grow too Potent. And this was a Miſchief, that many years after this time return'd again to the City. For when the Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Authority was reſtor'd to. <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>M. Craſſus,</hi> Young Gentlemen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got the Supream Power into their hands, whoſe Years and Courage were full of mettle and fury, by calumniating the Senate, they began to put the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar into a Ferment; then by Gifts and Promiſes more and more to inflame 'em: and ſo became Eminent and Powerful themſelves. Againſt them the greateſt part of the Nobility contended with all their Might, under colour of defending the Honour of the Senate, to ſupport their own Greatneſs. For to conclude in few words, Whoever in thoſe times diſturb'd the Public Peace, made uſe of ſpecious pretences; while ſome made a ſhew of Protecting the Privileges of the People, and others pretending to advance the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate, had all their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Aims to promote their own Intereſt: neither did they obſerve any Limits of Moderation in their Conteſts, both exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34632:33"/>
cis'd their Victories with Cruelty. But when <hi>Pompey</hi> was ſent againſt the Pyrates, and ſoon after againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the Authority of the People fainted, and the Power of a few encreas'd. Theſe few diſpos'd of Magiſtracies, Offices, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and all things Elſe. They, not to be controul'd, and flouriſhing liv'd free from fear; yet terrifying the Tribunes with their Sentences and Condemnations, to prevent their exaſperating the People againſt their Proceedings; to which purpoſe they were compell'd to abate of their former ſeverities. But ſo ſoon as firſt the hopes of introducing Change in dubious Affairs was offer'd, then the old Conteſt ſet their thoughts and courages at work: So that had <hi>Catiline</hi> been Victor in the firſt Battle, or that the Combat had been equal, certainly a moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious effuſſion of Blood, and Calamity had afflicted the Common-wealth: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it have been in the Power of the Victorious to have made any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Conqueſt; for that whoever had been more prevalent would have wreſted the Supream Dominion and the Public Liberty from the weary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebl'd. However there were ſeveral with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34632:33"/>
the pale of the Conſpiracy, who at the beginning went to joyn with <hi>Catiline.</hi> In which number was <hi>Fulvius,</hi> the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Son; who being Apprehended upon the Road, and brought back, his Father commanded him to be put to death. At the ſame time <hi>Lentulus</hi> alſo abiding at <hi>Rome</hi> in purſuance of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Orders, made it his buſineſs to ſollicite all ſuch Perſons, whoſe looſe manner of Living, or decay'd Fortunes rendred 'em fit for State-Innovation; not only Citizens, but all ſorts of Perſons whatever, that might be uſeful in the War. To that purpoſe he gave Commiſſion to one <hi>P. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrenus</hi> to tamper with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the <note n="*" place="margin">A People which then Inhabited that part of <hi>France,</hi> of which the chief Cities are now <hi>Geneva, Chambery, Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> c.</note> 
               <hi>Allobroges</hi> and if he could, to draw 'em in to be Confederates in the War. Believing, that in regard they were both publicly and privately vaſtly in Debt; beſides that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were naturally a Warlike People, they might be eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigl'd to lay hold of the Opportunity. This <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrenus</hi> having traded much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gauls,</hi> was known to moſt of the Chief Princes of the Cities, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34632:34"/>
knew Them. Therefore without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, ſo ſoon as he beheld the Embaſſadors in the <hi>Forum,</hi> or Place of uſual Concourſe, after ſome few Queſtions concerning the Condition of the City, and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the Public Calamity, he began to ask 'em, what they thought would be the Iſſue of ſuch deſtructive beginnings. In anſwer to which, when he heard 'em complain of the Covetouſneſs of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; accuſe the Senate, as from whom there was no hopes of redreſs; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lamentations, that only death could terminate their Miſeries; <hi>But I,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will ſhew ye a way, provided ye will be but Men, how ye may avoid all theſe great and Terrifying Misfortunes.</hi> The <hi>Allobroges,</hi> their Expectations thus ſcrew'd up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrenus</hi> to compaſſionate their Condition; aſſuring him, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too deſperate or difficult which they would not moſt readily undertake, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it might conduce to diſcharge their City out of Debt. Thereupon he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd 'em to <hi>D. Brutus</hi>'s Houſe, as being near the <hi>Forum,</hi> and not altogether a ſtranger to the Conſpiracy, becauſe of <hi>Sempronia,</hi> for that <hi>Brutus</hi> him ſelf was not then in Town. Moreover he ſent for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34632:34"/>
               <hi>Gabinius,</hi> to the end that Credit might be given to his words. In his hearing he ſays open the whole Conſpiracy, names the Confederates, together with ſeveral others, who were no way concern'd, to give the Embaſſadors the more Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and having ſo done, after they had made him fair Promiſes, he ſent 'em to their Lodgings.</p>
            <p>However the <hi>Allobroges</hi> when they came to conſider, were long uncertain and heſitating what Courſe to take. On the one ſide, there was a Ponderous Debt, a prompt Inclination to War, and a charming Proſpect of great Gain from the hopes of Victory. On the other ſide there was greater Wealth and Power, the ſafer courſe, and for uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes aſſur'd <note n="*" place="margin">No leſs then 200000 <hi>Seſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 750000 l.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And long they rowl'd and tumbl'd theſe Conſiderations in their Minds; but at length the Fortune of the Common-Wealth obtain'd the Victory. Therefore away they go to <hi>Fabius Sanga,</hi> and to him as Patron of their City, diſcover'd the whole Plot, as far as it had been laid open to them. <hi>Cicero</hi> being inform'd of this Diſcovery by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34632:35"/>
               <hi>Sanga,</hi> gave order to the Embaſſadors to diſſemble ſtrongly their Approbation of the Conſpiracy; that they ſhould apply themſelves to the reſt, and to do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour to aſſure themſelves of their Names and Perſons.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time there were alſo ſome Commotions in the <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Piemont.</hi>
               </note> Hither and <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>France</hi> it ſelf.</note> Farther-moſt <hi>Gaule,</hi> as likewiſe in <note n="c" place="margin">La Marca d' Ancona.</note> 
               <hi>Picenum</hi> among the <note n="d" place="margin">Calabria.</note> 
               <hi>Bruttii</hi> and in <note n="e" place="margin">Now <hi>Puglia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi> but they prov'd to be only Tumults and no more. For the Perſons whom <hi>Catiline</hi> had ſent thither, acted without any conſideration like ſo many Mad men; and with their Midnight Aſſemblies, their diſpoſing to and fro of Arms and Darts, their Hurrying and Buſtling about, occaſion'd more of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror than Danger. So that <hi>Q. Metellus Celer</hi> the Pretor, when he underſtood by the Senates Decree, the Reaſon of their Deligence, Apprehended and Impriſon'd a great Number of thoſe Buſie fellows; and the ſame did alſo <hi>C. Murena</hi> in the Hither <hi>Gaule,</hi> being Lord Lieutenant of that Province.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34632:35"/>
But at <hi>Rome, Lentulus</hi> with the reſt of the chief Ring-leaders of the Conſpiracy, having as they thought a ſufficient ſtrength about 'em, reſolv'd, that ſo ſoon as <hi>Catiline</hi> was advanc'd as far as <hi>Fieſoli</hi> with his Army, <hi>Beſtia</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the People, in a ſet Speech ſhould inveigh againſt <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Proceedings, and lay the <hi>odium</hi> of a moſt terrible War upon the beſt of Conſuls; which being the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the next Night the whole Body of the Conſpirators was to riſe, and every one to act his Part: Though they were reported to have been thus order'd to their ſeveral Poſts. That <hi>Statilius</hi> and <hi>Gabinius,</hi> with a conſiderable number, ſhould ſet fire to twelve convenient Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the City: to the end that in the Hurry of that Tumult, there might be the more eaſy acceſs to the Conſul, and ſuch others as were deſign'd to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. That <hi>Cethegus</hi> ſhould beſet <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Houſe, and by main force make way to his Perſon. Others were to attempt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the Sons of the Families, of whom the greateſt part were of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, were to murder their Parents; and thus when all the whole City was in a general Conſternation, diſmay'd with Fire

and Sword, the next work was to force their way through the Guards, and march directly to meet <hi>Catiline.</hi> In the midſt of theſe Preparations and Counſels, <hi>Cethegus</hi> often complain'd of the ſloath and ſlackneſs of the Confederates: that by heſitation and delay, they loſt great Opportunities; that in dangers of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Execution not Conſultation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd: and then proffer'd, if only a few would ſtand by him, ſince others were ſo faint and tender hearted, himſelf to lead the way into the Senate Houſe: for being naturally fierce, choleric, and prompt of hand, his chiefeſt Confidence was in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Allobroges</hi> according to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Inſtructions, being introduc'd by <hi>Gabinius,</hi> met the reſt of the Conſpirators; at what time they requir'd from <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> an Oath which they might carry Sign'd to their Magiſtrates and fellow Citizens; for that elſe they would never be induced to engage in ſuch a weighty Enterprize; which they, ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, readily gave. <hi>Caſſius</hi> alſo promis'd to be with 'em in a ſhort time, but left the City a little before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34632:36"/>
But when they went, <hi>T. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turcius</hi> of <hi>Crotona</hi> was order'd to attend 'em, and to procure a mutual Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the League between the <hi>Allobroges</hi> and <hi>Catiline,</hi> and an Exchange of the Articles on both ſides. He alſo ſent a ſhort Letter by <hi>Volturcius</hi> to <hi>Catiline,</hi> to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Who I am thou wilt underſtand by the Meſſenger I have ſent thee. Be ſure to conſider the vaſtneſs of the Danger wherein thou art; and remember that thou art a Man. Conſider, what thy Affairs require; and beg Aſſiſtance from all, even from the Loweſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover he had Inſtructions to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him by word of mouth, that ſeeing he was adjudg'd an Enemy by the Senate, for what Reaſon would he refuſe the worſt of Slaves? that all things were ready in the City according to his Orders; and that he ſhould not delay to make his Approach a little nearer.</p>
            <p>Having thus far in this manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, upon the Night appointed when they were to go, <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was inform'd of every thing by the Embaſſadors, gave Orders to the Pretors, <hi>C. Pomptinius,</hi> and <hi>L. Valerius Flaccus,</hi> to ſurprize the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34632:37"/>
and their Train ſo ſoon as they, arriv'd at the <hi>Mulvian</hi>

               </note> Bridge; unfolded to 'em the Reaſon, why they were ſent, and bid 'em act in other things as they ſaw occaſion. They being Military men that underſtood buſineſs, having Poſted their Guards without the leaſt diſturbance, as they were commanded, beſet the Bridge; ſo that when the Embaſſadors, together with <hi>Volturcius</hi> came to the Place, preſently there was hideous bawling and tearing of Throats on both ſides. But the <hi>Gauls</hi> underſtanding the Deſign, yielded forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Pretors. <hi>Volturcius</hi> at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the reſt, defended himſelf a while with his Sword from the Multitude; but finding he was deſerted by the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, after he had with many Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's adjur'd <hi>Pomptinius,</hi> with whom he was acquainted, to ſerve him with his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, at length fearful and diſtruſtful of his Life, he ſurrendred himſelf to the Pretors, as if they had been Enemies.</p>
            <p>This being done, an exact Relation of all things was ſent to the Conſul; who at the ſame time was no leſs over anxious than over joy'd. He rejoic'd, for that the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34632:37"/>
Conſpiracy being now diſcover'd, the City was wreſted from the Jaws of danger. But his trouble was no leſs extream, ſeeing ſo many Eminent Citizen's the detected Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſo foul a Crime, what was to be done. Their Puniſhment was greivous to him, and their Impunity the ruin of the Common-weal. But at length recovering his Reſolution, he commanded <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, Gabinius</hi> to appear before him; alſo <hi>Ceparias</hi> of <hi>Tarracina,</hi> who it ſeems was gone for <hi>Apulia,</hi> to raiſe the ſlaves; the reſt attended without delay. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul himſelf, taking <hi>Lentulus</hi> by the hand, becauſe he was a Pretor, lead him into the Senate; the reſt he order'd to be ſent to the Temple of Concord under ſtrong Guards. Thither he ſummons the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and before a great Appearance of that Order, cauſes <hi>Volturcius</hi> and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to be brought in; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi> to bring in the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pacquet of Letters which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Embaſſadors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Volturcius</hi> being Examin'd concerning his going out of Town, and the Letters, what was his deſign, or what the cauſe of his Journey; at firſt fram'd ſeveral fictitious ſtories, and ſhifted off the Conſpiracy; but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34632:38"/>
being commanded to delare the Truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Public Faith, he unfolded all things as they were tranſacted; that he was ſome days before drawn in by <hi>Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Ceparius;</hi> but that he knew no more than the Embaſſadors; only he had heard from <hi>Gabinius,</hi> that <hi>P. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius, Ser. Sylla, L. Vargunteius,</hi> and many others were involv'd in the ſame Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracy. The <hi>Gauls</hi> confeſs'd the ſame things. But as for <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who diſſembl'd and veil'd the Truth, they convinc'd him not only by Letters, but from ſeveral brags that he was wont to make in Public, That the Kingdom of <hi>Rome</hi> was aſcertain'd to three <hi>Cornelii</hi> by the Propheſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the <hi>Sibilline Books.</hi> That <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> had had their Turns, and that he was the Third, whoſe Fate it ſhould be to rule the <hi>Roman</hi> People: Moreover that from the Burning of the Capitol, the twentieth Year was now arriv'd, which the Soothſayers from ſeveral Prodigies had foretold, ſhould be deeply dy'd with Civil Blood. Therefore the Letters being read, after the Criminals had all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the Seals to be <hi>Lentulus</hi>'s, the Senate decreed, That <hi>Lentulus,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from the Magiſtracy, and the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34632:38"/>
reſt, ſhould be confin'd in free Priſons. Therefore <hi>Lentulus</hi> was committed to the Cuſtody of <hi>P. Lentulus Spinther</hi> who was <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Ediles</hi> were Officers who had charge of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temples and public Houſes, and look`d after the Weights  Meaſures.</note> 
               <hi>Edile, Cethegus</hi> to the care of <hi>Q. Cornificius; Statilius</hi> to <hi>C. Caeſar; Gabinius</hi> to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Craſſus; Ceparius</hi> (for by this time he had been apprehended upon the Road and brought back) to <hi>Cn. Terentius</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator.</p>
            <p>And now the Conſpiracy being detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Common People, who before, out of their uſual deſire of Change, had too much favour'd the War, now vearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, curs'd <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Deſigns, applauded <hi>Cicero</hi> to the Skies, and as if they had been ſnatcht from the Jaws of Bondage, by their Geſtures and their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances fill'd the Streets with Joy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation. For other Acts of War would rather afford 'em the Advantages of Plunder, than bring detriment to <hi>Them;</hi> whereas they lookt upon firing of Cities to be cruel, exceſſive and chiefly pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves; ſince all their Riches conſiſted in their Cloths and Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34632:39"/>
The next day after, one <hi>L. Tarquinius</hi> was brought before the Senate, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been apprehended upon the Road, going to <hi>Catiline.</hi> This Man promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to make great Diſcoveries of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, if he might be aſſur'd of his Pardon; and being thereupon commanded by the Senate to declare his knowledge, inform'd the Senate the ſame things which <hi>Voltur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> had done, concerning the Firing of the City, the Maſſacre of all the honeſt Party; and the March of the Enemy; and farther, that he was ſent by <hi>M. Craſſus,</hi> to give him an Account of what had happen'd, leaſt he ſhould be deterr'd to hear that <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus,</hi> and ſo many others of the Conſpirators were in Cuſtody; and to adviſe him ſo much the rather to haſten his March to the City, as a means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Spirits of the reſt, and the better to ſecure 'em from the danger they were in. But when <hi>Tarquinius</hi> named <hi>Craſſus,</hi> a Perſon Illuſtrious by Extraction, vaſtly Rich and moſt eminently Potent, ſome deeming the thing incredible, others, tho' they thought it true, yet becauſe at ſuch a Conjuncture, the Power of ſo great a Man was rather to be appeas'd and qualify'd, than exaſperated, the moſt part obnoxious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34632:39"/>
to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> upon the ſcore of their Private concerns, unanimouſly cry'd out, That the Witneſs was Perjur'd, and demanded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference upon the whole Matter; therefore by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Advice, it was Decreed in a in full Senate, That the Evidence was lookt upon as falſe, that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> ſhould be laid in Irons: and that he ſhould never be admitted more to give his Teſtimony, unleſs he diſcover'd the Perſon who had put him upon inventing ſuch a falſhood. Some Perſons at that time were of opinion, that this ſame Evidence was contriv'd by <hi>P. Autronius,</hi> to the end that <hi>Craſſus</hi> being Impeach'd, might be the more ready to Protect the reſt by his Power, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the ſame danger. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was Suborn'd by <hi>Cicero,</hi> leaſt <hi>Craſſus,</hi> undertaking the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of wicked Miſcreants, according to his Cuſtom, ſhould joyn with Them to diſturb the Public Peace. And I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards heard <hi>Craſſus</hi> himſelf declare, that the Affront, though of ſo high a Nature, was put upon him by <hi>Cicero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time neither <hi>Q. Catulus,</hi> Preſident of the Senate, nor <hi>C. Piſo</hi> could either by Favour, Importunity or Bribes prevail with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34632:40"/>
be falſely accus'd either by the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> or any other Evidence: For they were both his Mortal Enemies. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> as being <note n="*" place="margin">But being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf.</note> Condemn'd upon an Impeachment of Bribery, under pretence that he had unjuſtly puniſh'd with death a certain <hi>Piemontane. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi> burning with Revenge, for that upon his ſtanding for the Supream Pontificate in his Hoary years, <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> a young man had carry'd againſt him. And now they thought they had an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity put into their hands, for that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> partly through his exceſſive Liberality in Private, and partly through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs of his Public Preſents, had run himſelf deeply in Debt. But when they could not perſwade the Conſul to ſuch a diſhonourable Compliance, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by running perſonally from place to place, and ſpreading falſe Reports of what they had heard from <hi>Volturcius</hi> and the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> had heap'd no ſmall <hi>Odium</hi> upon him, inſomuch that ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, who guarded the <hi>Temple of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> with their Partiſans in their hands, whether mov'd thereto by the Greatneſs of the Danger, or the Inconſtancy of their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34632:40"/>
own Affections, to make their zeal for the Common-wealth the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, threatn'd him with their naked Weapons as he came forth of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were tranſacted in the Senate, and that Rewards were decreed to the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> and <hi>Volturcius, Lentulus</hi>'s Enfranchiz'd ſlaves, and ſome few of his Clients taking ſeveral Roads, made it their buſineſs to ſollicite Handicraft Tradeſmen and Slaves, and incenſe 'em to his Reſcue; while others ſought out every where for the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders of the Rabble, who for Money were wont to perplex the Common-wealth. <hi>Cethegus</hi> alſo by Meſſengers, beſought his Family and his Enfranchiz'd ſlaves, all fellows cull'd and exercis'd in Inſolence, to make a Body, and by force of Arms to break in upon him. The Conſul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtanding how theſe Plots were laid, having plac'd his Guards as the time and the occaſion requir'd, after he had ſummon'd a Senate, made a Motion what ſhould be done with thoſe Priſoners that were under Cuſtody. For not long before a full Senate had adjudg'd 'em to have acted againſt the Commonwealth.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34632:41"/>
Upon that Motion therefore <hi>D. Junius Silanus,</hi> being firſt of all deſir'd to deliver his Opinion, in regard he was at that time deſign'd Conſul, had declar'd, That not only they who were in Priſon, but alſo <hi>L. Caſſius, P. Furius, P. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrenus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Annias,</hi> ſo ſoon as they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ſhould be put to death. Though afterwards being mollify'd by <hi>Caius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s Oration, he had proteſted his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance altogether with <hi>Tiberius Nero's</hi> Vote, which Report he did not think however fit to have been made till the Guards were doubled. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ask'd his Opinion by the Conſul, deliver'd himſelf in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It behoves all Men whatever, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Fathers, who deliberate in dubious Affairs, to be void of Hatred, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Anger and Compaſſion: for where theſe things obſtruct, the Mind can never have a perfect Proſpect of Truth: neither was there ever any man who at the ſame time, could indulge his private deſires and the public good. When we fortify our reſolution, it grows vigorous; If Paſſion poſſeſs us, that prevails, and Reſolution languiſhes I want not plenty of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Conſcript Fathers, to ſhew what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34632:41"/>
Kings, and People upon the Motives of Anger or Pity, have ill conſulted in the main. But I rather chooſe to cull out what our Anceſtors have done in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their Paſſions. In the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> War, which we wag'd with King <hi>Perſeus,</hi> the City of the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> mighty and magnificent, and grown up to that height by the Aſſiſtance and Support of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, became treacherous and injurious to Us. Yet when the War was ended, and that the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude came to be debated, our Anceſtors, leaſt any might ſay hereafter they had begun a War in thirſt of Riches, rather then ſenſible of ſuffer'd wrongs, they diſmiſs'd the <hi>Rhodians</hi> home unpuniſh'd. Alſo in all the Punic Wars, when fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> both in Peace, and by breach of Treaties, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated many abominable Acts, never did they, when opportunity offer'd, do the like; they rather ſought what might become their own Dignity, then what they might juſtly retaliate upon them. This therefore, you are to take care of, Conſcript Fathers, that the Impious Crime of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and the reſt, do not ſway your Paſſions more prevalently
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34632:42"/>
then your honour; and that you be not more indulgent to your Anger, then your Flame. For if there might be found a puniſhment to equalize their Miſdeeds, then I approve your Counſel newly taken; but if the vaſtneſs of their Crimes ſurpaſſes all our Invention, 'tis then my Judgment, that we make uſe of thoſe which are provided by the Law. Moſt of thoſe Perſons, who before me, have declar'd their Opinions, have ſedately and nobly compaſſionated the Condition of the Common-wealth: they have number'd up the Cruelties of War, and what moſt uſually befalls the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd: Rapes of Virgins, and Young Boys; Infants torn from the Embraces of their Parents; Mothers of Families at the Luſtful pleaſure of the Victors; Temples and Private Houſes robb'd and and plunder'd; nothing but Fire and Sword; All placed laſtly ſtrew'd with ſcatter'd Arms and Carcaſſes, beſmear'd with Blood, and fill'd with Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But by the Immortal Gods, what did that long Oration drive at? was it to raiſe your Antipathy to the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy? that is to ſay, who e're he be, whom ſo prodigous, and ſo terrible a Fact cannot
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34632:42"/>
exaſperate, that ſame Oration ſhall incenſe. It cannot be ſo; neither does any Man look ſlightly upon his own Injuries: nay, many bear 'em with leſs Patience then they ought to do. But, Conſceipt Fathers, there is one ſort of Liberty to ſome allow'd, another ſort to others. They who lead their Lives in Obſcurity, if at any time they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an Error in heat of Anger, few take Notice: their Reputation and their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are alike. But they who being arriv'd to large Command, live in the ſoaring height of Greatneſs, are always in view, and their actions are beheld by all men. So that in Fortunes moſt conſpicuous, there's the leaſt of Liberty; there's no permiſſion to Love or Hate, much leſs to be in Wrath. What is call'd Anger among others, in Government bears the name of Pride and Cruelty. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, 'tis my Opinion, Conſcript Fathers, that all the Tortures in the World are far inferior to their Crimes. But moſt Men ſtill remember what was laſt; and in the ſufferings of the moſt Impious, forgetting the Fact, diſcourſe of nothing but the puniſhment, if more ſevere then ordinary. As for <hi>Decius Silanus,</hi> a Man moſt Brave and Stout, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34632:43"/>
convinc'd, that what he has ſaid, he has ſpoken out of his Affection to the Common-wealth; and that he is byaſs'd neither by Favour nor Enmity, in a concern of this Importance; ſo well I have been acquainted with the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Moderation of the Perſon. But his Judgment in this caſe ſeems to me not cruel, no, (for what can be thought cruel when inflicted upon ſuch Men) but without preſident in our Common-wealth. For certainly, <hi>Silanus,</hi> either Fear or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury orerul'd thee, being the deſign'd Conſul, to decree an unuſual ſort of Puniſhment. To talk of fear is altogether now ſuperfluous, ſeeing that by the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diligence of our moſt Illuſtrious Conſul, ſuch numerous Guards are up in Arms. As to the Puniſhment, I ſhall ſay no more, then what is obvious from the thing it ſelf; that in Sorrow and Affliction, 'tis death not torment that ſurceaſes all our Miſeries: that puts an end to all the ſufferings of Mortals: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, there is no room for Care or Joy. But wherefore, by the Immortal Gods, didſt thou not add this farther to thy Sentence, that firſt they ſhould be rigorouſly ſcourg'd? Was it becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34632:43"/>
the <note n="*" place="margin">By which no <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Citizen could be Whipt.</note> 
                  <hi>Porcian</hi> Law forbids it? However there are other Laws that Privilege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Citizens from loſs of Life, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only Baniſhment. Or was it becauſe it is more grievous to be Whipt then to be put to Death? Pray, what can be too grievous or ſevere for men to ſuffer, once Convicted of ſo great a Crime? But if it be the ſlighter puniſhment, why ſo obſervant of the Law in the Leſſer Infliction, when thou haſt broken it in the Greater? But who dares queſtion what ſhall be Decreed againſt Parricides of the Common-wealth? A time, a day to come; nay. Fortune her ſelf, that at her pleaſure governs all the World: Then, whatever happens will deſervedly befall 'em. But as for you, Conſcript Fathers, conſider what ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree againſt theſe Men. All bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples derive their Original from bad beginnings. For when the Government ſhall fall into the hands of the Ignorant and Unjuſt, that new Example will be transferr'd from the worthy and fit, to the unworthy and unfit to rule. The <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> having vanquiſh'd the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34632:44"/>
                  <hi>Athenians</hi> impos'd upon 'em Thirty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to manage the Public Affairs. Theſe, firſt of all, began to put to death, though uncondemn'd, the worſt of Men, and only ſuch as had deſerv'd the General hatred: at this the People rejoyc'd, and cry'd twas juſtly done. But when this Liberty augmented and grew bold, then Will and Pleaſure raigning, Good and Bad were put to Death without diſtinction, and the City under Bondage and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, pay'd ſeverely for their fooliſh joy. In our remembrance, <hi>Sylla</hi> then Victorious, caus'd <hi>Damaſippus</hi> and others that were grown up to the prejudice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to beput to Death; and, Who did not applaud the Fact? Such as they, they cry'd, Men Impious and Factious, that with Sedition did nothing but dicturb the Public Peace, deſerv'd a Public Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. But that very thing was the beginning of horrid Calamity and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For as every one had a fancy to this or that Neighbours Houſe or Farm, his Furniture or his Cloaths, he took care to get him Liſted in the number of the Perſons that were to be proſcrib'd. And thus, they who rejoyc'd at the death of <hi>Damaſippus,</hi> ſoon after them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34632:44"/>
were dragg'd to Maſſacre. Nor was there any end of Slaughter, till <hi>Sylla</hi> had gorg'd his followers with the wealthy Spoils of the Innocent. Not that I am jealous in the leaſt of <hi>M. Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or fear the ſame Confuſion in theſe times. But in a ſpacious Common-wealth, there are men of various Inclinations and Deſigns. At another time, and by another Conſul, that has an Army at his heels, ſomething may be believ'd that may beget miſunderſtanding. And when the Conſul once by virtue of this Preſident has drawn his Sword in purſuance of a Decree of Senate, who ſhall then limit his Ambition, or moderate his Paſſion? Our Anceſtors, Conſcript Fathers, never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either Counſel or Courage: nor was their Pride ſo great, but that they could imitate Foreign Cuſtoms when they found 'em Advantageous. Their Military Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and Darts they borrow'd: from the <hi>Samnites;</hi> and moſt of their Enſigns of Majeſty from the <hi>Tuſeans.</hi> Laſtly, whatever they beheld proper and uſeful either among their Enemies or their Allies, that they put in Execution with an eager Induſtry, chooſing rather to imitate then to deſpiſe. Therefore at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34632:45"/>
that time, they only Scourg'd offending Citizens, and thoſe that were condemn'd for greater Crimes they put to death. But when the Common-wealth encreas'd in Power, and Factions became Potent through multitude of Citizens, then the <hi>Porcian</hi> Law and other Statutes were ordain'd which only puniſh'd Capital Offenders with exile. Which is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> that I take to be of higheſt Importance, why we ſhould not make any Innovations in our Counſels. For certainly their Wiſdom and Vertue was greater, who rais'd ſo vaſt an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from ſuch ſmall beginnings, then ours who hardly can preſerve what they ſo bravely won. Would we therefore have the Priſoners ſet at Liberty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Army? No, but this is my Opinion, that their Eſtates be put to Sale; their Perſons kept in durance apart, in the ſeveral Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Towns, which are moſt reſponſible for their forth-comming: that after this, the Senate be no farther mov'd, nor the People tamper'd with in this Matter, and that whoever ſhall do otherwiſe, the Senate ſhall adjudge him to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Common-wealth and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Safety.</q>

After <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made an end of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome by word of mouth, others to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions variouſly delivered their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. But <hi>M. Portius Cato,</hi> being ask'd his Judgment, made the following Oration.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am quite of another Opinion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Fathers, when I conſider our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and our Dangers, and ponder in my mind the Judgements of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. They ſeem to me to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd concerning the puniſhment due to thoſe Perſons who have rais'd a War againſt their own Country, their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, their Religion and Liberty. But the Conjuncture admoniſhes us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, rather how to preſerve our ſelves from their Attempts, then what Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to inflict upon 'em. For other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs we may proſecute when acted; this, we muſt take care to prevent; leaſt after it has done the fatal Execution, it be too late to conſult Opinions. But by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods, I appeal to you your ſelves, who always had a greater value for your Houſes your Mannors, your Statues and your Pictures, then for the Common-wealth, if you have a deſire ſtill to hold faſt thoſe things whatever they be, which you embrace and hug with ſo much Affection
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34632:46"/>
and Content; whether this be a time of leaſure for your Pleaſures: therefore for ſhame awake at length, and ſave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Neither our Tributes, nor the Wrongs of our Allies, but our Liberty and our Lives lye now at ſtake. Frequently, Conſcript Fathers, I have deliver'd my ſelf in this Aſſembly: often have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Luxury and Avarice of our fellow Citizens; and for that reaſon have contracted the Enmity of many Men. I who never pardon'd in my ſelf the leaſt Error of my own Thoughts, could not eaſily forgive the Miſdemeanors of Paſſion and Ambition in others. Of which though you took little Cognizance, yet ſuch was then the ſame Condition of the Common-wealth, that it's united Power could brook your negligence: But now the queſtion is not whether we ſhall be able to ſupport our ſelves by good and laudable Cuſtoms; nor how large, nor how magnificent the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is; but whether theſe things, whatever they be, ſhall be ours, or that our Enemies muſt be allow'd their ſhare. In this caſe, ſhall any man talk to me Mildneſs and Pity? Certainly we have long ſince loſt the true Significations of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34632:46"/>
words. Since the Prodigal diſpoſal of other mens Eſtates is call'd <hi>Liberality;</hi> and Boldneſs in evil Enterpriſes goes by the name of <hi>Fortitude.</hi> And between theſe two Extreams the Common-wealth is ſeated. Well then, ſince their good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſuch, let 'em be Liberal of their Friends Eſtates; let 'em be merciful to thoſe that rob the Public Treaſury; let 'em not be prodigal of our Blood; and while they are ſo ſparing to a few notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Villains, go about to ruin all honeſt Men. Well and Learnedly has <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> diſcours'd of Life and Death in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; deeming, as I believe, thoſe things to be Fables, which are taught us concerning Hell; that the Wicked are reſerv'd in Places horrid, dark and frightful, at a diſtance from the Juſt. Therefore it was his Opinion that their Eſtates ſhould be put to ſale, and their Perſons be ſent to the particular Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Towns, leaſt if they ſhould be kept in <hi>Rome,</hi> they might be reſcu'd by their Confederates in the Conſpiracy, or by the tumultous Rabble. As if all the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Villains were only at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not diſpers'd over all <hi>Italy;</hi> and as if auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious boldneſs were not like to be more
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34632:47"/>
prevalent in places where there was leſs power to oppoſe it. Wherefore certainly this advice was very frivolous, if he have any fear of them, as dangerous Perſons; but in the general Conſternation of all Men, if he alone be not afraid; the more it concerns me to look both to my ſelf and you. Therefore when you ſhall make any Decree concerning <hi>P. Lentulus</hi> and the reſt, aſſure your ſelves the ſame Decree will reach both <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Army and all the Conſpirators: the more ſedulouſly and vigorouſly you act in thoſe Affairs, the more their Courage will be daunted; but if they find you once remiſs and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, there's nothing then will ſtop their Fury. Never believe our Anceſtors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd our Common-wealth from ſmall to great by force of Arms. For were it ſo, it would be much more ſpendid now, ſince we are much more numerous in Allies and number of People; far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided with Weapons and Horſes: But other things were thoſe that made them Great; all which we want: Seduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at home and juſt Command abroad: a Mind in Conſultation free, nor favouring the Crime, nor obnoxious to Paſſion: Inſtead of theſe, we flouriſh in Luxury
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34632:47"/>
and Avarice; in public want, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opulency: Wealth we applaud, but follow Sloth: between the Good and Bad there's no diſtinction: but Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enjoys all the Rewards of Vertue. Nor is it a thing to be admir'd; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you never adviſe together for the common Good, but ſeparately conſult your own Intereſts: becauſe at home you ſerve your Pleaſures, and here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave your ſelves to Profit or Favour. From whence it comes to paſs that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence invades the empty Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The moſt Illuſtrious of our Fellow-Citizens have conſpir'd to burn their Countrey; to revolt and war they inflame the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the mortal Enemies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name; and the General of the Rebels himſelf is with his Army almoſt at our doors. And do ye now at ſuch a time as this ſit lingring and ſtaggering what to do with Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within your walls? My O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, ye ſhould take pity of 'em. They are young men that have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Ambition; and therefore give 'em their Liberty and their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to boot; but aſſure your ſelves, this Clemency and Compaſſion of yours,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34632:48"/>
if they have liberty to uſe their Armies, will turn to all our Sorrows. 'Tis true, Miſery is a grievous thing, but you are not afraid of it. Yes, moſt of all; but through Sloth and want of Courage, you ſit ſtaring one upon another, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing help from the Immortal Gods, who oft have ſav'd this Commonwealth in all her greateſt Dangers. But the Aſſiſtance of the Gods is not obtain'd by Female Importunity and Supplication: Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity attends on watchfulneſs, activity, and well conſulting. When we aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſelves to Sloth and Puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, 'tis in vain to implore the Gods, who are offended and angry. Among the reſt of our Progenitors, <hi>A. Manlius Torquatus,</hi> caus'd his own Son to be put to death, becauſe he had fought the Enemy contrary to his Command; ſo ſeverely was the valiant Youth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiz'd for his over-haſty Courage. And do you heſitate what to decree againſt the moſt cruel of Parricides? Oh! but 'tis pity to puniſh 'em, conſidering their former vertuous Lives: However, I'll give ye leave to be merciful to <hi>Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Dignity, if ever he were merciful to his own Chaſtity, his own Honour;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34632:48"/>
if e'er he ſpar'd the Gods or Men. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Cethegus</hi>'s his Youth, becauſe this is but the ſecond time he has rebell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Country. For what do I talk of <hi>Gabinius, Statilius</hi> and <hi>Ceparius,</hi> who had they had the leaſt Grain or Sence of Vertue and Reputation, would never have engag'd in ſuch Deſigns againſt the Commonwealth. Laſtly, Conſcript Fathers, were there any room for an Overſight, readily would I brook that you ſhould be corrected by the Matter of Fact it ſelf, ſince you ſo little regard my words; but we are every way ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. <hi>Catiline</hi> with his Army is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the very Paſſages of the <hi>Apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine;</hi> other Enemies we have within the Walls of the City, and even in our Boſoms; no private Preparations can be made, no ſecret Conſulations taken: For which reaſon, we muſt uſe the greater diligence. Therefore 'tis my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; ſince the Commonwealth is now upon the Brink of Danger through the Sacrilegious Machinations of profligate and impious Wretches, who being detected by the Diſcoveries of <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turcius,</hi> and the Embaſſadors of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobroges,</hi> have confeſs'd their joynt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34632:49"/>
to murder, burn, and utterly deſtroy their Country and their Fellow-Citizens, together with other enormous Cruelties and publick Havock by them intended, That capital Puniſhment be inflicted upon Them confeſſing, as if they had been actually convicted of the Crimes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Cato</hi> ſate down, all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular Perſonages, and the greateſt part of the Senate applaud his Opinion, and extol his Courage to the Skies; while others are upbraided with the Name of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; but <hi>Cato</hi> is look'd upon by all as great and famous; and a Decree of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſes in compliance with <hi>Cato</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. And here, as being a perſon who have heard and read much more of what renown'd Atchievments the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> People have perform'd both in Peace and War, by Sea and Land, by chance it came into my Mind to conſider, what it was that upheld the management and accompliſhment of ſuch glorious Actions. I knew, That frequently with inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bands they had vanquiſh'd nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Legions of their Enemies: That with ſmall Forces they had wag'd War againſt potent Princes; moreover, That
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34632:49"/>
they had many times experienc'd the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of Fortune: That for Eloquence, the <hi>Greeks;</hi> in Military Glory, the <hi>Gauls</hi> were ſuperior to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But after many ſerious Reflexions and Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was plain to me at length, That the ſurpaſſing Courage of a few Citizens had brought all things to paſs; and thence it fell out, That Poverty overcame Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Multitudes were vanquiſh'd by a few. But when the Commonwealth was once corrupted by Luxury and Sloth, then the Commonwealth by her own Vaſtneſs ſupported the Vices of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Magiſtrates; for that, like a Woman that has done bearing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for ſeveral Intervals of Time, <hi>Rome</hi> could not ſhew a famous Perſon: But in my Memory there were two Great Men of different Diſpoſitions and Manners of Living, yet in Vertue both ſurmounting; <hi>M. Cato,</hi> and <hi>C. Caeſar;</hi> whom therefore, ſince ſo fair an Opportunity offer'd, I could not think it became me to paſs by in ſilence, before I had given a true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as far as my Wit would reach, of the Genius and Nature of Both. For Nobility of Deſcent, for Years and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the difference of Equality was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34632:50"/>
very ſmall between 'em. In Magnanimity likewiſe equal, as alſo in Glory, thô treading different Paths to purchaſe Fame: For <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Bounty and Munificence made him great; <hi>Cato,</hi> his Integrity of Life. The firſt, his Clemency and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion render'd Illuſtrious; the other was admir'd for his Severity: <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, relieving, pardoning; <hi>Cato,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing nothing, got Renown: In the one, the Miſerable found a Sanctuary; the other was a Terror to the wicked: The one for his eaſie Temper, the other was applauded for Conſtancy of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made it his buſineſs to labour and watch; intent upon the occaſions of his Friends, to neglect his own; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nothing that was worthy giving; thirſting after great Command, an Army and a new War, that ſo the Luſtre of his Courage might ſhine brightly forth. On the other ſide, <hi>Cato</hi> ſtudy'd Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Temperance, Decency, but Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above all the reſt: He never contended for Riches with the wealthy, nor with the Factious for Command: but who was moſt couragious with the Stout; moſt modeſt with the Baſhful; and with the moſt abſtemious, who more temperate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34632:50"/>
and continent? He rather choſe to be, then ſeem to be good; ſo that the leſs he courted Honour, the more ſhe follow'd him.</p>
            <p>Now then ſo ſoon as once the Senate had approv'd the Opinion of <hi>Cato,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul,</hi> believing it the ſafeſt way to take the advantage of the Night approaching, for fear of any unexpected Accident in the mean time, commanded the <note n="a" place="margin">Who were a ſort of <hi>High-Sheriffs,</hi> who had the Charge of the Priſons, and were to ſee Malefactors pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</note> Capital <hi>Triumvirs</hi> to make ready the Place and Inſtruments for Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He, after the Guards were ſet, brings <hi>Lentulus</hi> himſelf to the Priſon, as the <hi>Praetors</hi> alſo did the reſt. Within the Javl there is a certain place call'd <note n="b" place="margin">The <hi>Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſo call'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by K. <hi>Tullus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tullianum;</hi> after a ſmall Aſcent to the left hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Twelve Foot under ground, being wall'd about on every ſide, with an Arch of Stone over head; but naſty, dark, offenſive to the Smell, and frightful to the Sight. Into this Dungeon <hi>Lentulus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let down, the <hi>Lictors</hi> or <hi>Executioners,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34632:51"/>
according to their Orders, ſtrangl'd him with a Halter. Thus fell that great <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician,</hi> deſcended from the Illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Cornelii,</hi> that frequently had held the Conſular Dignity of <hi>Rome,</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that fatal End which the Courſe of his Life, and his Actions juſtly merited. In the ſame manner alſo <hi>Cethegus, Statilius, Gabinius</hi> and <hi>Ceparius</hi> were executed at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>While theſe things are thus tranſacted at <hi>Rome, Catiline,</hi> of all the Men which he had rais'd himſelf, and thoſe that <hi>Manlius</hi> had muſter'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made two <note n="a" place="margin">A Legion conſiſted of ſix Thouſand Men.</note> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, and fill'd up his <note n="b" place="margin">Every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort conſiſted of 555 Foot, and 66 Horſe.</note> Cohorts proportionable to the Number of his Men. Then as Voluntiers or Friends came in to him, he made an equal diſtribution of their Number; inſomuch, that in a ſhort time he compleated both his Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas before he had but Two Thouſand in all. Of theſe, not above a fourth part were arm'd with Souldier like Weapons; the reſt ſupply'd by Chance and Fortune, carry'd either Country Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaves, Javelins, or Stakes made ſharp at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34632:51"/>
the end. But when <hi>Antonius</hi> approach'd with his Army, <hi>Catiline</hi> keeping the Mountains, bent his March ſometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City, ſometimes towards <hi>Gallia,</hi> carefully avoyding Combat with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for he was in hopes of numerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements, ſo ſoon as his Confederates had accompliſh'd their work at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time, he refus'd the Aſſiſtance of Slaves and Servants, of which, a great Number had reſorted to him at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, confiding in the ſtrength of the Conſpiracy; and deeming it might alſo diſadvantage his Intereſts, to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd the Complaints and Cauſe of Free Citizens with <note n="*" place="margin">For if a Servant were diſcover'd in a Muſter of <hi>Roman</hi> Freemen, he was preſently thrown head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock.</note> Slaves.</p>
            <p>But afterwards, when News was brought to the Camp that the Conſpiracy was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and that <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus,</hi> and the reſt were executed, the greateſt part, whom hopes of Plunder, and deſire of new revolutions had inveigl'd to the War, dropt from him: with the reſt <hi>Catiline</hi> ſwiftly retires through the rough and difficult Paſſes of the Hills, into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34632:52"/>
of the <note n="a" place="margin">Now <hi>Piſtoia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Piſtorien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> with a Deſign to ſteal away privately under the ſhelter of the Woods and Mountains into <hi>Lumbardy:</hi> But <hi>Q. Metellus Celer</hi> lay with three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in the Territory of <hi>Picenum,</hi> rightly conjecturing <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Intention, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtreſs of his Affairs. Therefore having intelligence of his March, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fugitives, he preſently raiſes his Camp, and poſts himſelf at the foot of the Mountains, where <hi>Catiline</hi> muſt come down in his March for <hi>Hither Gallia.</hi> Nor was <hi>Antonius</hi> far behind, as he that follow'd the nimble Fugitives with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army through more level and leſs incumber'd ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catiline</hi> therefore, when he perceiv'd himſelf enclos'd with Hills and numerous Enemies, that all things had fail'd his Expectations in the City, and that there was no ſafety in flight, nor hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, believing it his wiſeſt courſe in ſuch a condition, to try the chance of War, he reſolv'd to hazard his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with <note n="b" place="margin">Believing that he being privy in part to the Conſpiracy, would have yielded him an eaſie Victory.</note> 
               <hi>Antonius:</hi> And to that purpoſe, at the Head of all his Army he made this Oration to his Souldiers:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:34632:52"/>
               <q>I am convinc'd by Truth of Hiſtory and Experience, fellow Souldiers, that Words afford no addititon of Courage unto Men; or that a Generals Harangue renders a ſloathful Army ſtout, no Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly numbers Valiant. Only what Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is by Nature or generous Practice inherent in the Soul of every Man, ſo much diſplays it ſelf in Battle. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom neither Glory nor Dangers can excite, in vain we ſeek with Speeches to inflame: for Conſternation ſtops his Ears. However I have call'd ye here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, partly to inculcate ſome few things into your Breaſts, but chiefly to unfold the cauſe of this my ſuddain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. You underſtand too well, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Souldiers, how great a Calamity the ſloath and negligence of <hi>Lentulus</hi> has brought upon himſelf and Us; and how I am debarr'd from Marching into <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> in Expectation of conſiderable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. And now you likewiſe know, as well as my ſelf, what is the deſperate condition of our Affairs at preſent. Two Armies of the Enemy, one from the City, another from <hi>Gallia</hi> lie poſted in our way. To ſtay longer in theſe Parts, had we never ſo great a Deſire,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34632:53"/>
ſcarcity of Proviſion and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will not permit. And whereſoever we deſign our March, we have no other way but what our Swords muſt open. Wherefore I exhort ye, be reſolute, and ſtill prepar'd for vigorous Encounter, and when ye are ready to joyn Battle, that you carry Riches, Honour, Grandeur, your Liberty and your Country in your hands. If we vanquiſh, all theſe things will be ſecure, plenty of Proviſion, Municipal Towns and Colonies, will be at our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. But if through Cowardice we turn our Backs, then all the World will be our Enemies; no place nor friend will ſhelter them, whoſe Arms could not protect 'em. Moreover, Fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the ſame neceſſity binds not them, that ſtrictly obliges us. We Combate for our Country, our Liberty and Lives, 'tis only a ſuperfluous kindneſs in them to defend in fight the Uſurpation of a few; the reaſon wherefore you ſhould be more daringly mindful of your Ancient Vertue. You had your choice to ſpend your ignominious Lives in ſhameful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile; or elſe to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> your Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Fortunes loſt in Expectation of other Mens Eſtates. But becauſe theſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34632:53"/>
things ſeem'd baſe or not to be endur'd, you determin'd to follow theſe reſolutions. If theſe your laſt determinations pleaſe not, the more need of Courage at this time. For no man but the Victor, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes War for Peace. And to expect Security in Flight when we have thrown away our Weapons that were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Bodies, that's a peice of Real Madneſs. Always in Battle they are moſt in Danger who are moſt afraid, for daring Boldneſs guards yee like a Wall. When I conſider your Perſons, Fellow Souldiers, and put an eſtimate upon your Actions, my hopes of Victory are exceeding Great. Your Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Age and Stoutneſs, all encourage me. Moreover, your Neceſſities which renders even Cowards Valiant: nor will the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe narrow paſſages permit the Enemy to ſurround us with their numbers. However if <hi>Fortune</hi> frown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Valour, beware, that unreveng'd you do not loſe your Lives, or chooſe to be taken, and be maſſacred like Sheep, rather then fighting like Men, to leave the Enemy a Bloody and mournful Victory.</q>

Having thus ſpoken, after he had made a little Pauſe, he commanded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to ſound, and leads down his Men in good order into a Champion ground. Then, ſending away all the Horſes, to the end, the danger being equal, the Souldiers might be the more encourag'd, himſelf a foot Embattles his Army, as his number and the Nature of the Place would permit. For finding that the Plain lay between Mountains on the Right, and rugged and ſteep Rocks on the Left, he made a Front of Eight Cohorts. The reſt he drew up more cloſe in Reſerves. Out of theſe he brings all the choice <hi>Centurions</hi> and <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Reformades, together with the ſtouteſt of all the Common Souldiers well Arm'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his firſt Array. To <hi>C. Manlius</hi> he gave the Right, to a Commander of <hi>Fieſoli</hi> the Left Wing. Himſelf with his enfranchiz'd Bondmen, and ſome of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that had been diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into <note n="*" place="margin">Where being ſuddainly before enrich'd by Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they had as ſoon by Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity conſum'd their Fortunes.</note> Colonies, he poſted himſelf next to the Eagle, which as they ſaid, had been the Standard which <hi>Marius</hi> made uſe of in the <hi>Cimbric</hi> War. On the other ſide, <hi>C.

Antonius</hi> being then ſick of the Gout, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not be preſent at the Battle, gave the Command of his Army to his Legate, <hi>M. Petreius.</hi> He plac'd the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane Cohorts, which he had rais'd of a ſuddain, in the Front; and behind them, the reſt of his Men for a Reſerve. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Riding about from Rank to Rank, calls every one by their Names, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and intreats 'em to be but mindful, that they fought againſt unarm'd Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for their Country, their Liberty, their Altars and their Houſhold Gods. This Man, an old Souldier, who had been for above thirty years together, either a <note n="a" place="margin">A Tribune ſeems to be a kind of Major of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. For it was his Duty to ſee the Souldiers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd, and well Diſciplin'd, and to attend the Conſul for Orders.</note> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, or <note n="b" place="margin">A Prefect ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Legates place in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> Prefect, or <note n="c" place="margin">The Legate was a kind of Adjutant General to the Conſul.</note> Legate or Pretor, and all along acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with great Honour, knew moſt of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, was acquainted with their ſtouteſt Actions, and by bringing 'em freſh to their Memories, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflam'd their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>

Now then <hi>Petreius</hi> having diligently obſerv'd the Enemies Array, and given out his laſt Orders, by ſound of Trumpet Commands the Signal of Battle, and the Cohorts at the ſame time to move ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward. The ſame did the Enemy; but when they were ſo near to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Lighter arm'd might well begin the fight with their Miſſive weapons, the Legionaries never ſtood to throw their <note n="d" place="margin">Piles were a ſort of Darts like a Boar-Spear, about two Cubits and a half long in the wood, and a Cubit and a half in the Iron head, which was heavy and ſharp, and being thrown with Art, would ſtrike thro' any Armour; with this the Legiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries began the fight at a diſtance and then clos'd.</note> 
               <hi>Piles</hi> as they were to do, but running with a hideous ſhout on both ſides to the Combat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a cloſe fight foot to foot with their Swords. The Veteranes, mindful of their Priſtine Bravery, bore vigorouſly upon the Enemy; nor did their Oppoſites make a Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reſiſtance, ſo that the Combat was ſharp on both ſides. All the while <hi>Catiline,</hi> with the moſt active and ſmarteſt of his followers kept ſtill in the head of his Men; ſuccour'd thoſe that were over-power'd, ſupply'd the places of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34632:55"/>
the wounded with freſh Men; frequently charg'd in Perſon, and perform'd all the Duties of a ſtout Souldier, and experienc'd Commander. <hi>Petreius</hi> therefore perceiving that <hi>Catiline</hi> made a ſtouter Reſiſtance then he expected, orders the Pretorian Cohort to Advance and Charge the very thickeſt of the Enemy; and then it was that all things went to wrack on <hi>Catiline</hi>'s ſide, his Men being every where diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and every where put to the Sword: which done the Legate flew upon both the Enemies Wings at the ſame time with the ſame fury. <hi>Manlius</hi> and the <hi>Faeſulane</hi> fell among the firſt. But as for <hi>Catiline,</hi> when he ſaw his Army rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and himſelf left naked with a ſmall Remainder, remembring his Deſcent and his Ancient Dignity, he threw himſelf into the thickeſt of his Enemies, and was there ſlain with his Sword in his hand.</p>
            <p>But after the Battle was over, then you might ſee the wonderful Audacity and Reſolution that had reign'd in <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>'s Army. For generally the place which every one had ſtood on when alive,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:34632:56"/>
the ſame when dead he cover'd with his Body. Some few indeed, whom the Pretorian Cohort had routed in the middle, lay more diſpers'd, yet all had receiv'd their wounds before, and no man turning his back. Only <hi>Catiline</hi> was found at a diſtance from his own Men among the Carcaſes of his Enemies, with ſome remainder of Life, retaining in his Countenance that Fury and Fierceneſs of Mind which inſpir'd him when alive: and the laſt thing remarkable is this, that of that whole Number, neither in the Fight nor in the Purſuit was any Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Citizen taken Priſoner, ſo equally merciful had they all been to their own and the Lives of their Enemies. Nor can we ſay that the Army of the <hi>Roman</hi> People enjoy'd a Victory to be rejoyc'd at, or at the expence of little Blood. For not a Man of forward Bravery, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell in the Battle, or was carry'd off deſperately wounded. So that of many, that either out of Curioſity or greedy of Plunder, going to view the Field of Battle, turn'd up the Carcaſes of the Slain, there were hardly any but either knew their Friends, their Gueſts, or their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34632:56"/>
Kindred: and ſome there were who knew their Enemies. Thus Joy and Sorrow, Mourning and Gladneſs variouſly affected the Victorious Army.</p>

            <p n="1">1. FAlſely does Human kind complain of the Condition of Life, as if it were too frail and ſhort, and rather under the Dominion of Chance then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For entertaining contrary thoughts, we ſhall find that there is nothing greater, nothing more excellent then Man himſelf, and that he neither wants power nor length of years, but only Induſtry. For the Captain and Commander of human Life is the Soul, which while it journeys with an eager pace toward Glory, through the paths of Vertue, is ſufficiently preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34632:58"/>
powerful and eminent, not needing Fortune's aid; which neither can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath or take away from any Man his Probity, his Induſtry, or any other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Endowments. But if enſlav'd to lewd deſires, we plunge our ſelves in Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Corporeal Pleaſures; by degrees accuſtom'd to pernicious ſenſuality; when we have once miſpent our Parts, our Strength, our precious Hours in Sloath and Oſcitancy, the Infirmity of Nature is then accus'd, for that the Guilty lay the blame of their folly upon the difficulty of Buſineſs. Whereas if Men were but as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in laudable Profeſſions, as they are eager in the purſuit of things unprofitable, and many times extreamly hazardous, they would rather govern then be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Fortune; and would advance themſelves to that degree of Grandeur, that inſtead of being Mortal, they would become Eternal in Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For as all Mankind is compounded of Soul and Body, ſo do alſo all our Affairs and all our Studies follow, ſome the nature of the Body, others of the Soul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lovely Form, ſuperfluous Riches, ſtrength of Body, theſe in a ſhort time all decay; but the glorious Atchievements of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34632:58"/>
Wit and Parts, are like the Soul, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. Laſtly, as there is a beginning, ſo there is an end of all the Bleſſings of Body and Fortune; all things riſing ſet again; and as they grow, grow old. But the Soul, Incorruptible, Eternal, the Guide and Ruler over all Mankind, acts and poſſeſſes all things, not poſſeſs'd it ſelf. And the deprav'd humor of thoſe Men is ſo much the more to be admir'd, who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning themſelves to the felicity of bodily Pleaſures, conſume their days in Luxury and Idleneſs, and ſuffer the Wit of Man, then which there is nothing more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, nothing more boundleſs in human Nature, to grow ſtupid and lie fallow through ſluggiſhneſs and want of careful Manuring. More eſpecially ſince the Gifts and Sciences belonging to the Mind, are ſo many and ſo various, by which we may arrive to higheſt degree of Reputation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet in the midſt of this Diverſity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magiſtracy, nor Empire, nor any Adminiſtration indeed of Public Affairs to me at this preſent ſeem ſo eagerly to be thirſted after: for Honour is not beſtow'd on Vertue: Neither are they that by Fraud have obtain'd Advancement, ſafe; or for their eminent Authority the more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34632:59"/>
honeſt. For, for a Man to rule his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or his Parents by force, though he have Power, and be never ſo much a Corrector of Miſdemeanors, yet is it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to the Sufferers; eſpecially ſince all Mutations of Affairs portend Slaughter, Exile and other Effects of Hoſtile Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Vainly therefore to take pains, and acquire nothing elſe by reſtleſs toil but Hatred of himſelf, is Extremity of Madneſs; unleſs there be any ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with a ſlaviſh and pernicious deſire to ſurrender their Honour and their Liberty to the Power of a Few.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But among the Crouds of Buſineſs, which are proper for the Exerciſe of the Wit, the Remembrances of great Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem chiefly beneficial. Of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of which Application, ſince many have diſcours'd, I deem it not fit to be repeated: leaſt ſome beſides, may think it Inſolence in me, by Praiſes to extol the Study which my ſelf affects. 'Tis true, that I believe there may be ſome, who, becauſe I have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to live remote from Public Affairs, may give the name of Idleneſs to this ſame Toil of Mine ſo great and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: though ſurely none but ſuch, whoſe chiefeſt Induſtry it is to court the <hi>Mobile,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:34632:59"/>
and to ingratiate themſelves by Popular Banquets. Who if they again conſider, both at what time I obtain'd the Magiſtracy, and who they were that could not gain that Honour, and afterwards what ſort of Men were brought into the Senate, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they will be then convinc'd, that the Change of my Judgment proceeded rather from Deſert then loytring Drowſineſs, and that greater Advantage will accrew to the Commonwealth from my Leiſure, then the Buſineſs of others. For I have frequently heard, that <hi>Q. Maximus</hi> and <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> the moſt renowned Perſons of our Commonwealth, were wont to ſay, That when they beheld the Statues of their Anceſtors, their Minds were ardently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd to Vertue; not that the Wax or the Figure had ſuch an efficacy in its ſelf; but only that the flame was kindl'd in the breaſts of thoſe Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by the remembrance of paſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions; nor could be extinguiſh'd, before their Vertue and Courage had equall'd the Fame and Glory of their Predeceſſors. Quite otherwiſe, who is there now adays that does not ſtrive to outvie his Anceſtors in Riches and Expences, rather then in Probity and Induſtry? Upſtarts alſo, who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34632:60"/>
formerly were wont by their Vertue to anticipate Nobility, now by Stealth and private Bribery, contemning worthy means, preſs forward to Commands and Honors. As if Pretorſhips and Conſulſhips, and all high Employments whatever, were Noble and Magnificent in themſelves, and not to be eſteem'd and valu'd according to the merit of thoſe Perſons that enjoy'd 'em. But I have been too free, and ran too high, in deteſtation of the corrupted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Commonwealth. I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Deſign in hand.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34632:60"/>
But before I enter into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Story, I muſt look back a little into Antiquity, to the end that all things may be more clearly diſplay'd in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd to the better underſtanding of the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond <hi>Punic</hi> War, when <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> had broken the Strength of <hi>Italy,</hi> more then ever any one, ſince the Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> King of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> being admitted into a League of Friendſhip by <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> Sirnam'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus</hi> for his Valour, had perform'd many noble and famous warlike Exploits. In recompence of which, the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being vanquiſh'd, and <hi>Syphax</hi> taken Pris'ner, whoſe Power was great, and his Dominions in <hi>Africa</hi> ſpacious at that time, the <hi>Roman</hi> People freely beſtow'd upon the King what Cities and Countries they had then ſubdu'd by force of their own Arms. For which reaſon he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd in his Friendſhip to Us advantageous and ſincere, till his Life and Sov'raignty ended both together. After that, his Son <hi>Micipſa</hi> obtain'd the Kingdom, and reign'd ſole Monarch, <hi>Manaſtabales</hi> and <hi>Gulaſſa</hi> his Brothers being carry'd off by Sickneſs. To him were born in lawful
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34632:61"/>
Wedlock, <hi>Adherbal</hi> and <hi>Hiempſal,</hi> with whom he bred up <hi>Jugurth,</hi> the Son of his Brother <hi>Manaſtabales,</hi> and gave him Royal Education in his Palace, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> had left him only in a private Condition, in regard his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was no more then a Concubine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Who, when he arriv'd to years of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, ſurpaſſing in ſtrength, lovely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but far more vigorous in Parts and Wit, would not be corrupted by Luxury and Eaſe; but according to the Cuſtom of that Nation, enur'd himſelf to Riding, Darting, and to out-run his Equals, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do all, and yet to be belov'd by all. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſpent his time in Hunting, and was ſtill the formoſt, or among the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that firſt wounded the Lion or any other wild Beaſts: thus performing moſt, but ſpeaking leaſt of himſelf. With which, altho' <hi>Micipſa</hi> were well pleas'd at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as believing <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Courage would be an Honour to his Kingdom; but when he found, in his declining years, and while his Children yet were ſmall, the ſprightly Youth improving daily more and more, then violently diſturb'd with Jealouſies and Fears, he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve many things in his Thoughts. The
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34632:61"/>
Nature of Mortals, greedy of Dominion, and precipitately prone to gratifie their Ambition, terrify'd him; beſides the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his own and his Childrens Age; enough to overturn the Loyalty of meaner Courages: Add to this the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Numidians</hi> kindl'd toward <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth;</hi> which made him anxious whether to contrive the Death of ſuch a man or no, to remove all Occaſions of Sedition or War.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the midſt of theſe Difficulties, when he ſaw that a Man ſo acceptable to the People, could neither be deſtroy'd by Force nor Treachery, in regard that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> was. a Perſon prompt of his hands, and covetous of Military Honour, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to expoſe him to danger, and to try his Fortune that way. Therefore in the <hi>Numantine</hi> War, <hi>Micipſa</hi> deſigning to ſend the <hi>Romans</hi> a numerous Aſſiſtance both of Horſe and Foot, and hoping his deſtruction, either by dating too far, or through the ſeverity of his Enemies, he gave him the Command of the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which he ſent into <hi>Spain.</hi> But it fell out quite contrary to his Expectations: for <hi>Jugurth,</hi> a Perſon indefatigable, and of a piercing Wit, when once he came
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34632:62"/>
to underſtand the Diſpoſition of <hi>Scipio,</hi> then General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and the Enemies manner of Fighting, by his extream Labour and Diligence, by his modeſt Obedience, and frequent expoſing himſelf to Danger, arriv'd to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reputation, that he was not only greatly belov'd by our People, but equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formidable to the <hi>Numantines.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a thing moſt extraordinary, and rarely to be met with in one ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he was not only ſtrenuous in Battel, but ſafe and ſhrewd in Counſel: Of which, the one from foreſight generally begets Fear; the other from dating and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate boldneſs, uſually produces Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The General therefore for the moſt part made uſe of <hi>Jugurth</hi> in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his moſt difficult Enterprizes, took him into the number of his Friends; and dayly more and more augmented his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Favour toward him; as being one whoſe Counſel and Courage ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail'd. Beſides all this, he had a large Soul, and a Genius moſt induſtrious, by which means he had contracted a moſt familiar Friendſhip with many of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34632:62"/>
8. At that time were ſeveral Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts and Noble Perſons in our Army, that preferr'd Wealth before Juſtice and Honeſty, factious, powerful at home, and among our Allies more eminent for their Riches then Vertue; who by oſtentatious Promiſes, did not a little inflame the hopes of <hi>Jugurth,</hi> that ſo ſoon as <hi>Micip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> dropt into his Grave, himſelf ſhould reign ſole Monarch of <hi>Numidia;</hi> That he was a Perſon accompliſh'd for Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Rule,</hi> and that all things were put to Sale at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, when <hi>Numantia</hi> was levell'd with the Ground, and that <hi>Scipio</hi> had determin'd to diſmiſs his Auxiliaries, and return home, he took <hi>Jugurth</hi> along with him magnificently rewarded, and laden with <hi>Encomiums,</hi> into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Pavilion, before the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Chief Officers; and there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd him in ſecret, rather publicly then privately to continue his Friendſhip with the <hi>Roman</hi> People; leſt by ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his Bounty, he might happen to purchaſe with danger, from a few, that which belong'd to many: That if he took the right Courſe, Glory and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would drop of themſelves into his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34632:63"/>
Boſom; but that if he made too much haſte, his own Money would throw him headlong into Ruin.</p>
            <p n="9">9. After theſe Admonitions, he diſmiſs'd him with certain Letters which he was to deliver to <hi>Micipſa,</hi> to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Thy <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Courage has been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſpicuous in the <hi>Numantine</hi> War, which I am aſſur'd will be acceptable News for Thee to hear. By Us he is highly reſpected for his Merits; and that he may have the ſame Eſteem from the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall mainly endeavour. I congratulate thy Happineſs for our Friendſhips ſake; for thou enjoy'ſt a Subject worthy of thy ſelf, and thy Father <hi>Maſſiniſſa.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The King therefore, when he found true by the Generals Letters what he had heard before by Report, ſmitten as well with the Courage, as the Lovelineſs of the Perſon, allay'd his Anger, and reſolv'd to try whether he could vanquiſh him by Acts of Grace and Favour: To which purpoſe he adopted him, and by his laſt Will left him Co-heir of the Kingdom
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34632:63"/>
with his Sons; and ſome few years after, waſted with Age and Sickneſs, perceiving the Concluſion of his Days at hand, he is ſaid to have us'd the following Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to <hi>Jugurth</hi> in the hearing of his Friends and Kindred, as alſo of his Two Sons, <hi>Adherbal</hi> and <hi>Hiempſal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <q>When thou wert young  helpleſs, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> after thou hadſt loſt thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without Hopes or Maintenance, I took thee into my Kingdom, believing thou wouldſt prove equally grateful both to me and to my Children, ſhould I have any, for favors heap'd upon thee: Nor was I deceiv'd in my good Opinion: For, to omit thy other many great and famous Explots, lately returning from <hi>Numantia,</hi> thou haſt honour'd both Me and my Kingdom with Martial Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and by thy Proweſs haſt made the <hi>Romans,</hi> Friends before, moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Us. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Name and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of our Family is again renew'd; and which is the hardeſt Task for Mortals to perform, thou haſt vanquiſh'd Envy with Renown. Now then, becauſe that Nature puts an end to my Life, by this Right Hand, by the Truth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34632:64"/>
I beſeech and conjure thee, That theſe Young Men, by Birth thy neareſt Kindred, and Brothers through my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, may be always the dear Objects of thy real Affection; and that thou wilt not forſake the Friendſhip of thy own Fleſh and Blood, for the Alliances of Strangers. Neither Armies nor Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are Guards ſufficient to defend a Kingdom, but Friends; which thou canſt neither compel by Force, nor purchaſe with Gold: They are only to be gain'd by Duty and Fidelity. But where ſhould Friendſhip then be moſt ſincere, if not between Brother and Brother? Or where ſhall he find a Friend among Strangers, that is an Enemy to his own Relations? I leave yet a Kingdom ſtrong and durable, while vertuous and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; but weak, and of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, if wicked and perverſe. For by Concord ſmall Beginnings thrive; through Diſcord the moſt Sinewey Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments ſhrink to nothing. Till then theſe Striplings are grown up, Thee, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi> it behoves, their Senior both in Years and Prudence, to take care, that nothing may diſturb this happy Union. For in all Contentions, the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

though he recieve the Injury, yet becauſe his Force is greater, ſeems to do it.

To all this, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> altho' he knew, That what the King had utter'd, was all but craftily diſſembled, and that he had other Deſigns in his Head, nevertheleſs obſerving the Seaſon, he anſwer'd as if nothing but Submiſſion and Duty had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd him.

At that time, <hi>Hiempſal,</hi> naturally fierce, and contemning <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s mean Deſcent by the Mothers ſide, plac'd himſelf upon <hi>Adherbal</hi>'s Right Hand, to prevent <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi>'s ſitting in the middle, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the chiefeſt Place of Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Numidians.</hi> Nor would he give way to Age, till tir'd with his Brother's
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34632:65"/>
Importunity, he was forc'd to change his Seat. There, after they had diſcours'd many things concerning the Government of the Kingdom, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> among other paſſages, throws in a word by the By, That it was but reaſonable that all the Decrees and Acts for the five Years laſt paſt, ſhould be made void; in regard that during all that time, <hi>Micipſa</hi> being waſted with Age, had not had the right Uſe of his Underſtanding. To which <hi>Hiempſal</hi> made Anſwer, That the Propoſal pleas'd him well; for that it was but three years ago, ſince he had obtain'd his ſhare of the Kingdom by Adoption. Which Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion deſcended deeper into <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Breaſt then they that heard it were aware of: Therefore from that time, turmoyl'd with Indignation and Fear, he toyls, provides, and in perpetual agitation of Thought, ſets all his Trains and Engines at work by Treachery to ruine <hi>Hiempſal:</hi> Which in regard they had but ſlow Succeſs, and yet his cruel Mind could no way be appeas'd, he reſolv'd to accompliſh his Deſign whatever it coſt him.</p>
            <p n="12">12. At the firſt Meeting of the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces already mention'd, in regard they could not agree, it was adjudg'd requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34632:65"/>
That the Treaſures ſhould be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that the Limits of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories ſhould be ſetled. For the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which Decrees, a Time was prefixt, but firſt of all for the diſtribution of the Money. Now it happen'd that <hi>Hiempſal</hi> had hir'd a Houſe in a Town call'd <hi>Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mida,</hi> which belong'd to <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s chief <hi>Gentleman-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> but a Perſon greatly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs'd  belov'd by himſelf. This Officer, ſo opportunely in his Service, <hi>Jugurth</hi> loads with rich Preſents; and conſtrains him to go, under pretence of viewing his Houſe, and get falſe Keys made to all the Doors (for the true ones were in <hi>Hiemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi>'s poſſeſſion) and to let him know when all things were ready; for that then he would come with a ſufficient Strength. The <hi>Numidian</hi> fulfill'd his Commands, and as he was inſtructed, in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time let in <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Souldiers; who were no ſooner ruſht into the Houſe, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ran to ſeek out the young Prince; ſome kill'd thoſe that were aſleep; others ſlew all they met; all the private Corners were ranſack'd, Doors broke open, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Noiſe and Tumult every where; at length <hi>Hiempſal</hi> is found in a Cottage belonging to a young Woman his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34632:66"/>
whither at firſt in fear, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Countrey, he had fled for ſhelter. The <hi>Numidians,</hi> as they were commanded, carry'd his Head to <hi>Jugurth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. But the Report of ſuch a Bloody Fact was ſoon ſpred over all <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo that all that were under the Dominion of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipſa,</hi> were in a dreadful conſternation. The <hi>Numidians</hi> divide themſelves into two Parties: More adher'd to <hi>Adherbal,</hi> but to the other the more ſtrenuous in War: Therefore <hi>Jugurth</hi> arms all the Forces he could raiſe, and adds to his Territories ſeveral Cities, ſome by Force, others by willing Surrender, and prepares to make himſelf Maſter of all <hi>Numidia. Adherbal,</hi> although he had ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to inform the Senate of the Murther of his Brother, yet confiding in the Number of his Souldiers, reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a deciſion of the Quarrel by the Sword. But when the Buſineſs came to Battel, conſtrain'd to quit the Field, he fled into the <hi>Roman Province,</hi> and thence made haſte to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then <hi>Jugurth,</hi> having accompliſh'd his Deſigns, and now Lord of all <hi>Numidia,</hi> revolving more at leiſure, in his Mind, the Fact he had committed, began to dread the <hi>Roman</hi> People, nor
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34632:66"/>
had he any hopes of appeaſing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but in the Avarice of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and his own Money. Therefore within a few days he ſent his Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> loaden with Gold and Silver, with his Inſtructions, firſt to cram the Purſes of his old Friends, then to purchaſe new; and laſtly, by ſcattering their Bribes, to make: ſure of all they could, for fear of haeſitation.</p>
            <p>Upon this, when the Embaſſadors came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had diſpers'd their Preſents according to their Maſter's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, among the King's Friends, and others that bore the greateſt Sway in the Senate, there was ſuch a Change en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd, ſo that whereas no man before had more incurr'd their diſpleaſure then <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi> no man was more in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Thereupon, when the Embaſſadors thought their Game ſure, a Senate was appointed to hear both Sides; and then it was that <hi>Adherbal,</hi> as we have heard, thus deliver'd himſelf:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Conſcript Fathers, Micipſa</hi> my Father, upon his Death-bed, gave me in charge, that I ſhould look upon the Kingdom of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34632:67"/>
                  <hi>Numidia,</hi> ſo far as concern'd the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration only to be mine, but that the Right of Jurisdiction and Dominion was veſted in your ſelves: and that I ſhould make it my buſineſs both in Peace and War, to be as ſerviceable as poſſible I could be to the <hi>Roman</hi> People. That I ſhould va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and reſpect you as my Parents and neareſt Kindred and Relations: which if I did, I ſhould find in your Friendſhip, Armies, Riches and the ſafety of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Theſe Inſtructions of my Father, while I was meditating carefully to put in Practice, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> a Man of all men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Face of the Earth, moſt Impious, contemning your Authority, me <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa</hi>'s Grandchild, and conſequently by Lineal Deſcent an <hi>Allie</hi> and friend of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, has expell'd his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and depriv'd of all his Fortunes: I muſt confeſs, Conſcript Fathers, ſince Fate had deſtin'd me to theſe Calamities, I could have wiſh'd that rather for the ſake of my own, then the ſervices of my Anceſtors, I might have implor'd your Aid; and that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> might have ow'd me thoſe favours which I had no need of, that then, if occaſion requir'd, I might have reap'd the advantage of my Debts.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34632:67"/>
But in regard Integrity is not ſecure of it ſelf, neither was it in my power to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee what ſort of perſon <hi>Jugurth</hi> would prove, I fled to you for Succour, to whom, which is my worſt misfortune, I am conſtrain'd to be a burthen, before I could be uſeful. Other Princes either vanquiſh'd in War, have been admitted into your Protection, or in the tottering condition of their Affairs, have ſought your Alliance. Our Family engag'd in Amity with the <hi>Roman</hi> People, in the time of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, at ſuch a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when their Fidelity rather then their Fortune was to be deſir'd. Whoſe Off-ſpring, Conſcript Fathers, my own ſelf, t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Grand-child of <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> permit not to implore your Aid in vain. Had I no other reaſon for my Suit, but only my Misfortune, that deſerves Commiſeration; lately a Potent Prince, no leſs Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Birth and Fame; now disfigur'd with Calamity, reduc'd to Poverty and begging Aid of others, yet it became the Majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> People to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet Injury; and not to ſuffer any Man whatever to enlarge his Kingdom by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Acts. But I, alas, am here expell'd thoſe very Confines, which the

                  <hi>Roman</hi> People beſtow'd upon my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, from whence my Father and Grand-father aſſiſting your Victorious Arms, ejected <hi>Syphax</hi> and the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> Your Favours, <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> are wreſted out of my hands; and you are contemn'd in the wrongs I ſuffer. Wretch that I am! Are thy kindneſſes come to this, Father <hi>Micipſa,</hi> that he whom thou mad'ſt equal with thy Children, and ſharer of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he ſhould be the firſt to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thy Race and Lineage? Shall our Family never be at quiet? Always muſt Boodſhed, Exile and Slaughter be our Portion? While the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, there was ſome reaſon for our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; the Enemy cloſe by our ſides; you our Allies far diſtant: all our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance was upon our Swords. But when that Peſt was exterminated out of <hi>Africa,</hi> we enjoy'd a gay Tranquility: for then we had no Enemy, unleſs whom you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo to be. But now upon a ſuddain, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> advancing himſelf, through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable audaciouſneſs, and vaunting in Villany and Pride, having murder'd my Brother and his neareſt Kinſman, has firſt ſiez'd the Kingdom as the booty of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34632:68"/>
his Impiety; then when he could not ruin Me by the ſame Treachery, yet expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing leſs then Violence and War, within your own Empire, he has ſtript me as you ſee of Houſe and Home and Native Country, and ſent me hither an exil'd Beggar, overwhelm'd with miſery, and any where more ſecure then in my own Kingdom. I was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Conſcript Fathers, with my aged Parent, when I heard him oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they who inviolably embrac'd your Friendſhip, underwent indeed much hardſhip, but of all Men upon Earth were moſt ſecure. What was in our Families Power to do, they did; ſtill your Auxiliaries in your Wars: and it is in your Power that we may be as well ſecure in Peace as others under your Protection. My Father left two Brothers of us, and <hi>Jugurth</hi> the third he thought would have been rivetted to us by his continual kindneſſes. The one of theſe is Butcher'd, the others Impious Clutches my ſelf could hardly eſcape. What ſhall I do? Or whither, unhappy as I am, ſhall I repair? All my expectancies of ſupport from Conſanguinity are loſt. My Father, by neceſſity of Fate, has ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd

The reſt of my near Kindred, Relations and Friends, one ſort of ruin ſome, another others have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd; taken by <hi>Jugurth,</hi> part nail'd upon the Croſs; and part expos'd to the Fury of Wild Beaſts; the ſmall remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der clos'd up in Darkneſs with mourning and lamentation, lead a Life far worſe than Death. Were all things, which either I have loſt, or which inſtead of proving neceſſary have fallen out averſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, had been ſtill unhazzarded and ſafe; yet if any thing had happen'd unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, I ſhould however have addreſs'd my Supplications, Conſcript Fathers, to your ſelves, to whom, conſidering the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of your ſpacious Empire, belongs the care of all juſtice and Oppreſſion. But now an Exile from my Country, from my Houſe and Home, by all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and indigent of neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to whom ſhall I make Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or whoſe Aid invoke?

of my Anceſtors? Can any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon take Compaſſion upon Us, who at any time was once your Enemy? <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> Conſcript Fathers, gave us thoſe Inſtructions, that we ſhould pay fidelity to none, but to the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> that we ſhould accept of no new Alliances or Leagues, there being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of ſafety in your Friendſhip: and that if the Fortune of this Empire ſhould happen to change, that we ſhould fall together with it. By your Courage, and through the favour of the Gods, you are mighty and opulent; all things proſperous, all things obedient to your Commands: whereby you have the Power to take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of injur'd Allies. Only this I fear, leaſt ſome there may be, whom <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s private Correſpondence, cloſely carry'd, hurries topſy turvy; who as I am well inform'd, with all their Might endeavour, ſolicit, and weary with their Importunities particular Perſons, that nothing be decreed againſt the Perſon abſent, ere the Cauſe be heard: that I counterfeit words, and diſſemble Flight, when I might ſtay in my Kingdom if I pleas'd. But I wiſh to Heaven I might ſee the Traitor, whoſe Villany has
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34632:70"/>
plung'd me into theſe Calamities, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling here the ſame Things; and at length that either You or the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods would be mindful of Human Affairs; to the end that He, who is now become Haughty and Illuſtrious by his perpetrated Crimes, tormented then with all imaginable tortures, might receive the diſmal reward of his Impiety toward the Parent of us both, in the murther of my Brother, and rendring me thus miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And now Brother, to my Soul moſt dear, although thy life was robb'd untimely from Thee, and by him whom it behov'd moſt charily to have preſerv'd it, yet I am apt to think, thy Fate affords us an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion rather of Joy then Lamentation. For together with thy Life, 'tis but a Kingdom thou haſt loſt; thou haſt eſcap'd the terrors of Flight, Exilement, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and all thoſe miſeries that weigh down my Soul: While unfortunate as I am, thrown head-long from my Native Kingdom into ſo many diſaſters, I am only a Spectacle of Human uncertainties; Uncertain what to do, whether to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thy wrongs, my ſelf a ſuppliant for Succour; or whether to take farther care of my Kingdom, whoſe Power of Life and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34632:70"/>
Death depends upon the Charity of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. I wiſh to Heaven that Death might be the vertuous end of all my Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; leaſt I ſhould ſeem contented, were it but only to live, if tir'd with my Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, I ſhould ſink under the burthen of the Oppreſſion. Now therefore, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Fathers, impatient of Life, yet not permitted to die without diſgrace, for your own, for the ſake of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and your Parents, by the Majeſty and Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, vouchſafe your Succour to Me unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; ſtop the Career of Injuſtice, and ſuffer not the Kingdom of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which is your own, to conſume and pine away, while harraſs'd by Impiety and the Effuſion of our Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. When the King had made an end of ſpeaking, <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Embaſſadors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying more upon the profuſeneſs of their Preſents, then the juſtice of their Cauſe, anſwer'd in few words,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>Hiempſal</hi> was by the <hi>Numidians</hi> put to death for his Cruelty; that <hi>Adherbal,</hi> having begun a War without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, when he ſaw himſelf vanquiſh'd
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34632:71"/>
came to complain, becauſe he could not do the wrong he intended: and therefore <hi>Jugurth</hi> beſought the Senate, that they would not think him any other Perſon, then what he was known to be at <hi>Numantia;</hi> nor prefer the Stories of an Enemy, before his own apparent Deeds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſaid, they both withdrew. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the Senate took the buſineſs into Conſideration. At what time the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the Embaſſadors and ſeveral others corrupted by Dependency, made ſlight of <hi>Adherbal</hi>'s Complaint, highly applauded <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Vertue; ſpar'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Affection or Words, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd with all their Might imaginable, for the Villany and Treachery of a Stranger, as if it had been for their own Honor. On the other ſide ſome few there were, to whom Juſtice and Equity were of more value then Riches, who were of opinion that <hi>Adherbal</hi> was to be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the Death of <hi>Hiempſal</hi> was to be ſeverely reveng'd. But among all the reſt chiefly <hi>Emilius Scaurus,</hi> Nobly deſcended, indefatigable, factious, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of Power, Honour and Wealth, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34632:71"/>
one that cunningly knew how to conceal his Vices. For he, perceiving the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſcandalous Bribery of the King, fearing, as oft it happens in ſuch caſes, leaſt a Pollution ſo licentious ſhould bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon him, checkt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Deſires, and kept his Avarice within bounds.</p>
            <p n="16">16. However in the Senate that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carry'd it, which preferr'd Reward and Favour before Truth. A Decree was therefore made, That Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhould divide <hi>Micipſa</hi>'s King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom between <hi>Adherbal</hi> and <hi>Jugurth;</hi> In which Commiſſion <hi>L.

the ſame Baits the <hi>Numidian</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt of the Commiſſioners and the greateſt part ſwallow'd the Silver Hook; only ſome few valu'd their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit above Gold.

They were neither govern'd by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Laws, nor under any Command; roving and wandring, where Night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, there they took up their preſent Quarters. But after that <hi>Hercules</hi> dy'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> as the <hi>Africans</hi> believe, his Army, compos'd of ſeveral Nations, having loſt their Leader, while many ſought to lay the Foundations of particular Dominion, ſhatter'd into ſeveral Parties.

that in ſearch of convenient Habitations, they ſometimes try'd one Country, then another, they call'd themſelves <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And as yet, the Buildings of the wild <hi>Numidians</hi> were oblong, and bow'd on both ſides, like the Keels of Ships.

an Hoſtile manner approaches moſt of the Cities with his Cavalry.

Of which when <hi>Jugurth</hi> had intelligence, contrary to his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one who was fully perſwaded that all things were to be bought at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſends Embaſſadors to the Senate, his own Son, and two of his familiar Friends, with the ſame Inſtructions as he gave to thoſe which he ſent after the Murder of <hi>Hiempſal,</hi> that they ſhould not ſpare to tempt all Perſons whatſoever with their Money.

However he did nothing without <hi>Scaurus,</hi> whom he made his boſom Companion and ſharer of his Counſels. Who though at firſt he fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppos'd the Kings Intereſt, when moſt of his Faction were corrupted; yet at length the vaſtneſs of the ſum was ſuch,

that it drew him from Honour and Juſtice to vile Depravity. All this while <hi>Jugurth</hi> had only purchas'd a Ceſſation of War, believing in the mean time that he ſhould make a better progreſs either by Price or Favour. But when he underſtood that <hi>Scaurus</hi> was come in for a ſhare, encourag'd then with all the hopes imaginable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Peace, he determin'd to treat in Perſon upon the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

The King therefore, as he had reſolv'd, arrives in the Camp, where after he had made a ſhort Speech in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, in excuſe of the Crime that was laid to his charge, and formally peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that he might be admitted to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, the reſt he tranſacted in private with <hi>Beſtia</hi> and <hi>Scaurus.</hi> And then the next day, the opinions of the Council being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in a huddle and over-rul'd by the Conſul, his Surrender was admitted.

However according to the Impoſition of the Council, Thirty Elephants, Cattle, a great number of Horſes, and no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of Money were deliver'd to the <note n="*" place="margin">Or Treaſurer at War.</note> Queſtor.

            <p n="30">30. But after Fame had ſpread abroad the Proceedings in <hi>Africa,</hi> and how things had been manag'd, at <hi>Rome</hi> there was nothing diſcours'd of in all Places and Meetings, but the ſtrange management of the Conſul; among the Commonalty terrible diſguſt; The Fathers troubl'd, and at a kind of Loſs; nor did they know well what to do, whether they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſo ſcandalous a Miſdemeanor or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul the Conſuls Decrees. But ſuch was the Power of <hi>Scaurus,</hi> who was reported to be both <hi>Beſtia's</hi> Confederate and Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Act, that it ſtopp'd 'em ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in the courſe of Honeſty and Juſtice. Yet <hi>C. Memmius</hi> whoſe freedom of Speech, and inveteracy againſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility we have already mention'd, while
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34632:82"/>
the Senate ſat wavering and heſitating, encourag'd the People by Popular Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to Revenge; exhorts 'em not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Commonwealth nor their own Liberty; laid open many haughty and cruel Acts of the Nobility, and ſedulouſly kindl'd up the Indignation of the People by all manner of ways. Which gives me an opportunity ſince the Eloquence of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> was at that time in ſuch high eſteem, and ſo powerfully perſwaſive upon all occaſions, to recite one among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Orations; more eſpecially what he diſcours'd in a particular Aſſembly, preſently after the return of <hi>Beſtia</hi> in theſe words;</p>
            <p n="31">31. <q>Many things diſlwade me, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, why our Affection to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſhould not be ſo highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd above all other things. The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Faction; your patient Sufferance; no Juſtice; but more eſpecially, for that there is more Danger then Honour at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends upon Innocency. For it grieves me to utter what I am about to ſpeak, That for theſe fifteen years, during which time you have been the Laughter and Contempt of the prevailing Power of a few, how ſhamefully, how unreveng'd
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34632:83"/>
your Champions have periſh'd, as if your Courage were infected with Sloth and Oſcitancy; who neither at this time rowſe up in oppoſition of your criminal Enemies; and are alſo now afraid of thoſe, to whom ye ought to be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But yet in this unhappy Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs, my Zeal conſtrains me to oppoſe the Predominancy of Faction. I ſhall certainly make tryal of that Liberty, which my Parents left me as part of my Inheritance, but whether in vain, or to the purpoſe, that's only in your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Neither do I perſwade ye, as frequently your Anceſtors have done, to arm your ſelves againſt theſe Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. There is no need of Force or Tumult; for you'll find they will run headlong after their uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> being ſlain, whom they accus'd of deſigning Regal Sovereignty, grievous were the Bloody Executions of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Murder of <hi>C. Gracchus</hi> and <hi>M. Fulvius,</hi> many of your Quality and Degree were ſlaughter'd in Priſon. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Law, but their Ambition put a ſtop to both thoſe cruel Havocks. Yet certainly the Reparation of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34632:83"/>
Government ſhould rather have conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſtoring the Commonalty their Privileges. Whatever cannot be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently puniſh'd, without ſhedding the Blood of Fellow-Citizens, let it be done by Law. Of late years you tacitly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut'd to ſee the public Chequer robb'd; to ſee Kings and Free People pay their Tribute to a few of the Nobility; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Dignity at their Command, and Riches moſt exorbitant in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet took little notice of their exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe unequal Uſurpations with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. And thus at length the Laws, your Dignity, all things Divine and Human were deliver'd up into the hands of Enemies; yet neither are they that acted thoſe Enormities aſham'd or peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but trample over your Faces mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently, boaſting their chief Pontificates, their Conſulſhips, and many their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs; as if they lookt upon thoſe things as Honours, and not Rapines ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Servants bought with Money, brook not the unjuſt Commands of their Lords and Maſters: And will you, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, born to Empire, patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Servitude? But who are They, who have thus got Poſſeſſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34632:84"/>
The moſt abominable among Men; their Hands beſmear'd with Blood; inſatiably covetous, moſt injurious, and the Same moſt lofty. By whom Fidelity, Honour, Piety; laſtly, All things honeſt and diſhoneſt are put to Sale. Some of 'em have plac'd their chiefeſt Safety in murdering the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the People, others in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſt Puniſhments; but the greateſt part in committing bloody Violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves. Thus, by how much every one acted moſt facinorouſly, ſo much the more ſecure he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They transferr'd their Dread from their own Crimes upon your Remiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And all theſe the ſame Deſires, the ſame Hatred, and the ſame Fears combin'd together. But this ſame Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip among good Men, is Faction among the wicked. But had you the ſame care of your Liberty, as they are vehemently inflam'd with Love of Dominion, upon my word, neither the Commonwealth would be laid waſte, as now it is, and the moſt worthy, not the moſt audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would reap the benefit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Your Anceſtors, to obtain their Right, and to eſtabliſh their Dignity,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34632:84"/>
twice in a divided Body from the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, fortify'd themſelves upon the <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Mountain: and will not you with all your might endeavour the Recovery of that Liberty which you receiv'd from them? and ſo much the more eagerly, by how much the greater Ignominy it is to loſe what once you have atchiev'd, then never to have won it? It may be ask'd me, What is my Opinion then? That they be ſeverely puniſh'd who have betray'd the Commonwealth to the Enemy; not by ſtrength of Arms, nor force, which had been more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for you to have done, then diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for them to ſuffer, but by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations  Confeſſion of <hi>Jugurth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for if he have ſurrender'd himſelf, certainly he will be obedient to your Commands: but if he contemn your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, then you your ſelves may judge, what that ſame Peace or Surrender is, from whence <hi>Jugurth</hi> obtains the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of his Crimes; whence ſome few Powerful Noblemen heap ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to themſelves,; whence ſo much Loſs and Shame befals the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But perhaps you have not had enough of their Lordly Domineering;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34632:85"/>
and thoſe then theſe Times pleaſe your humor better, when Kingdoms, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Laws, Privileges, Judgments, War and Peace, all things Divine and Human were in the power of a few; but You, that is to ſay, the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to your Enemies invincible, and Lords of ſundry Nations, thought it a ſufficient happineſs to breath. For who among ye durſt refuſe to be a Slave? But for my part, though I do think it the moſt hainous thing in the world for a man to have an Outrage done him, and yet the Malefactor go unpuniſh'd; yet could I willingly endure, that you ſhould pardon the moſt abhorr'd of Men, provided they were Citizens, did I not think your Clemency might prove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. For They, whatever vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interruptions they may meet with, will never lay to heart their doing miſchief, unleſs they be depriv'd of the power of acting, but your Fears will be eternal, when you find that either you muſt be Slaves, or vindicate your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by force of Arms. For what hope is there either of Fidelity or Concord? They reſolve to domineer, and you deſire your Freedom; they to do
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34632:85"/>
Injuſtice, you to prohibit 'em: Laſtly, They uſe your Allies as Enemies, and your Adverſaries as Friends. Can there be Peace and Friendſhip in Minds ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically oppoſite? Wherefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and exhort ye not to ſuffer an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious piece of Violence to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. The public Treaſury is not robb'd; nor Money violently extorted from your Friends, which though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of a high Nature, yet now adays are lookt upon as meerly Trifles. No—the Authority of the Senate is betray'd to a moſt bitter Enemy; the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is ſet to ſale both at home and abroad, which unleſs they be narrowly examin'd, unleſs the Guilty be brought to condign Puniſhment, what remains, but that we muſt live in Servitude to thoſe that have committed theſe notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crimes? For to act without fear of puniſhment, that's to be a King. Not that it is my meaning you ſhould be glad to ſee your Fellow-Citizens were all involv'd in equal Crimes; but that you ſhould diſtinguiſh, and be careful how ye pardon the wicked, leſt thereby you occaſion the deſtruction of the Good. Beſides that it is much more beneficial
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34632:86"/>
to the Commonwealth, to forget a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then an injury: For good men only grow more careleſs if neglected; but bad men more audacious. To which we may add, That if Offenders were but duly puniſh'd, you would not ſtand ſo frequently in need of Tribunitial Aid.</q>

            <p n="32">32. By theſe, and ſuch like Reaſons often urg'd, <hi>Memmius</hi> perſwades the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome,</hi> That <hi>Caſſius</hi> who was then <hi>Pretor,</hi> might be ſent to <hi>Jugurth;</hi> and that he ſhould bring him to <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Public Faith, to the end that by the Confeſſion of the King, the Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of <hi>Scaurus,</hi> and the reſt, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded upon the ſcore of taking Bribes, might be made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were thus tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Rome,</hi> they who were left by <hi>Beſtia,</hi> to command the Army in <hi>Numidia,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Example of their General, committed many and moſt facinorous Enormities. Some there were, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Gold, deliver'd back the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants to <hi>Jugurth;</hi> others ſold the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; others robb'd and ſpoyl'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that were at Peace: Such a violent
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34632:86"/>
rage of Avarice had canker'd their very Minds, like a general Contagion. But <hi>Caſſius</hi> the <hi>Pretor,</hi> the Choice being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>C. Memmius,</hi> to the Terror of the Nobility, goes to <hi>Jugurth,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him, fearful, and guiltily miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as he was, in regard he had ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd himſelf to the <hi>Roman</hi> People, to make trial rather of their Clemency, then their Force; and privately gave him his own Word, which he thought to be equal to the Public Faith. Such was the high Reputation of <hi>Craſſus</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Upon that, <hi>Jugurth</hi> contrary to the Grandeur and Majeſty of a Prince, comes to <hi>Rome</hi> in pitiful and ſordid Habit: And though he were endu'd with a vaſt Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Confidence above meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirm'd by all whoſe Power or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety had encourag'd him to act what he had done, however he made ſure of <hi>M. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Tribune</hi> of the People, to the end that by his Impudence he might be ſafe from all dangers of Popular violence. But <hi>Memmius,</hi> ſummoning an Aſſembly of the People together, though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty were hainouſly incens'd againſt the King, and ſome commanded him to

be laid in Irons; and others, unleſs he reveal'd his Confederates, threaten'd him with Capital Puniſhment, according to the Cuſtom of their Anceſtors; yet conſulting more their Honour, then to gratify their Fury, he made it his buſineſs to qualify their Heats, to appeaſe their Indignation; and laſtly to convince 'em that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Faith was to be obſerv'd. Then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence following and <hi>Jugurth</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, <hi>Memmius</hi> made a Speech, wherein he rips up all his Miſdemeanors both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Numidia,</hi> lays open his Crimes committed againſt his Father and his Brothers; telling him withal, That altho the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> were well inform'd already who were his Agents and Aſſiſtants, yet they were deſirous of farther proof, and diſcovery from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that if he confeſs'd the Truth, he had great Encouragement to rely upon the Clemency and Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> People; but that if he would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, he would do his Confederates no kindneſs, but would certainly ruin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Hopes.</p>

34. When <hi>Memmius</hi> had made an end, and that <hi>Jugurth</hi> was commanded to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>C. Bebius</hi> the Tribune, whom <hi>Jugurth</hi> had largely Brib'd, as we told ye before, commands the King to hold his Tongue; and although the Multitude who were preſent at the Aſſembly, being highly incens'd, threaten'd the Tribune not only with their Looks and hideous Clamors, but with all thoſe other acts of Violence that Anger makes uſe of; yet nothing could deter his Impudence, ſo that the People brake up their Aſſembly contemn'd and ſcorn'd: on the other ſide, <hi>Jugurth, Beſtia</hi> and the reſt, whom that ſame Examination ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſorder'd, reſum'd freſh hopes, much more enliven'd then they were before.</p>
            <p n="35">35. There was at that time at <hi>Rome</hi> a certain <hi>Numidian,</hi> by name <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> the Son of <hi>Guluſſa,</hi> and Grand-child to <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> who becauſe he was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Jugurth,</hi> when the three Kings were at variance, upon the Surrender of <hi>Cirta,</hi> and murder of <hi>Adherbal,</hi> fled out of <hi>Africa.</hi> This Man was perſwaded by <hi>Sp. Albinus,</hi> who was Conſul the next year after <hi>Beſtia,</hi> with <hi>Quintus Minucius Rufus,</hi> in regard he was Deſcended in a direct Line from <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> to lay claim
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34632:88"/>
in the Senate to the Kingdom of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> while <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s fears and the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Crimes lay heavy upon him. The Conſul, thirſting after War, was clearly for creating any diſturbance rather then lie idle. More eſpecially becauſe <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia</hi> was fall'n to his Lot, as <hi>Macedonia</hi> to that of <hi>Minucius.</hi> So that when <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> began to beſtir himſelf, and <hi>Jugurth</hi> found he was not ſafe enough in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Friends, for that in ſome their Guilt of Conſcience; in others their loſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Apprehenſions of Mind had extinguiſh'd the heat of their Solicitations, he orders <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> his near Kinſman, and his intimate and truſty Agent, with a round ſum of Money, the main Inſtrument with which he had brought to paſs all his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Deſigns, to procure certain Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to watch <hi>Maſſiva,</hi> and hurry him out of the City, with all the privacy they could; or if that Plot fail'd, to murder him out-right. <hi>Bomilcar</hi> ſwiftly puts in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the Kings commands, and by fellows that underſtood their Trade, obſerves his walks, his goings out, and commings in, his haunts, and ſeaſons of being abroad; and then, when every thing was fix'd, he lies perdue. At what time, one of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34632:88"/>
thoſe that were hir'd for the Murder, ſomewhat over haſtily ſetting upon <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiva,</hi> ſtruck off his Head: ſo that being apprehended, at the perſwaſions of many, and chiefly of <hi>Albinus</hi> the Conſul himſelf, he makes a Confeſſion; upon which <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> who accompany'd <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the Public Faith, is adjudg'd Guilty, rather by the Law of Nature then of Nations, by which he ſeem'd to be exempted from Puniſhment. But as for <hi>Jugurth,</hi> though no man were ſo well acquainted with the Fact as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet would he never give over la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring againſt the certainty of Truth, until he found that the Abhorrency of the Fact had got the upper hand of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and his Gold. Therefore though upon the former Information, he had given in Fifty of his friends as Sureties for <hi>Bomilcar</hi>'s forth-coming, however being more mindful to ſecure his Kingdom, then careful to diſcharge his Bail with honour, he privately ſent away <hi>Bomilcar</hi> into <hi>Numidia,</hi> afraid leaſt Popular fears might ſhake the Loyalty of the reſt, if once they heard that he were put to death: and he himſelf within a few days after follow'd, being commanded by the Senate
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34632:89"/>
to depart <hi>Italy.</hi> Of whom it is reported that as he was upon the Road ſtill in view of the Walls, he frequently turn'd his head not ſaying a word, till at length, caſting a wiſtful look upon the City, he brake forth into this Exclamation; <hi>Adieu fair City to be ſold, and ripe for ruin, could it find a Chapman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="36">36. In the mean time <hi>Albinus,</hi> the War being thus renew'd, ſends away Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Money and other neceſſaries for the Souldiers, into <hi>Africa,</hi> and ſwiftly alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in Perſon, that before the Election of new Magiſtrates which grew on apace, he might conclude the War, either by force of Arms, upon Compoſition, or by any other means. On the other ſide, <hi>Jugurth</hi> ſpun out the time, to the utmoſt of his power, pretending ſometimes one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another Excuſe for his delay, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Surrender, and then diſſembl'd his fears; ſometimes he retires, and by and by, for fear of diſcouraging his own Men, he makes a ſtand: thus lingring out the War, and ſometimes with propoſals of Peace he eluded and baffl'd the Conſul. And ſome there were who thought <hi>Albinus</hi> was not unacquainted with the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34632:89"/>
for conſidering the Haſt he made at firſt, they could not believe but that the War was rather prolong'd through the Remiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Conſul, then Policy of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But the ſeaſon being ſpent in vain; and the day of Elections at hand, <hi>Albinus,</hi> leaving his Brother <hi>Aulus</hi> Propretor in the Camp, departed for <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. At that time was <hi>Rome</hi> moſt terribly harraſs'd by the Mutinies and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Tribunes, <hi>P. Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>L.

Which contention Prorogu'd the Elections for a whole Year. Upon which delay, <hi>Aulus,</hi> who was left Propre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Camp (as we have already declar'd,) building fair hopes, either of putting an end to the War, or by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his Army to extort ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſum of Money from the King, in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> draws his Army out of their Winter Quarters into the Field; and with long Marches in a ſharp Seaſon, preſents himſelf before the Walls of <hi>Suthul,</hi> where the Kings Treaſure lay. Which although, in regard of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34632:90"/>
of the weather, and the Situation of the place, it could neither be taken nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd; for that a Boggy Plain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Winter ſhowers, now become a ſpacious Mariſh, ſurrounded the Walls, that were built upon the Point of a Crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Rock; yet either in a Bravado, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the King; or blinded with eager hopes of gaining the Treaſures of the Town, ſet up his <hi>Vines,</hi> open'd his Trenches, and in a word, omitted nothing that might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his deſign.</p>
            <p n="38">38. On the other ſide <hi>Jugurth,</hi> perceiving the vanity of the Legate,  his want of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary experience, craftily to heighten his Madneſs, ſent Meſſengers to him, with offers of ſubmiſſion, while he himſelf as it were to avoid his fury, leads his Army through the Woods and Places of moſt difficult acceſs. Laſtly upon hopes of Agreement he had ſo charm'd <hi>Aulus,</hi> as to make him raiſe his Siege and follow him ſtill feigning flight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Countries with which he was not in the leaſt acquainted; that ſo his overſights might be leſs ſubject to diſcloſure. In the mean time he employ'd moſt active and cunning Gameſters, Day and Night to ſound the Army; and to Bribe the <hi>Centurions,</hi> and Captains of Horſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34632:90"/>
to revolt, or upon Signal given to deſert their Stations; which when he had accompliſh'd according to his deſire, of a ſuddain in a Tempeſtuous night, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds <hi>Aulus</hi>'s Camp with a vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Numidians.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, amaz'd at ſuch an unuſual Alarum, ſome ſtood to their Arms; ſome ran to hide themſelves; others heartned up the Timerous; ſome ſtood quivering; while the Enemy thunder'd in upon 'em on all ſides. The Sky all over-caſt with Clouds and darkneſs; the danger doubtful; nor could the moſt daring well reſolve which was the ſafeſt courſe, whether to fight or fly. In this hurry, among thoſe whom the Kings Gold had poyſon'd, the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurian</hi> Cohort, with two Troops of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and ſome few Common Souldiers revolted to the King; and the <note n="*" place="margin">He was the chief of all the <hi>Centurions</hi> of the Legion, and had the guard of the Eagle: as being the Captain of the Triarij, one of whoſe weapons was a dart, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine call'd <hi>Pilum.</hi>
               </note> Primipile <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> of the third Legion gave admittance to the Enemy at that Quarter, which he had undertaken to defend: and there all the <hi>Numidians</hi> pour'd in like a Torrent. Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was the flight of our

Night, and the eagerneſs after Plunder prevented the Enemy from making that advantage of their Victory they might have done. The next day <hi>Jugurth</hi> entring into a perſonal Parley with <hi>Aulus,</hi> told him, that tho' he had him ſafe with all his Army Surrounded with Famin and the Sword, yet conſidering the Inconſtancy of humane Affairs, he was content upon condition of a League and Peace by him Confirm'd, and that they ſhould depart <hi>Numidia</hi> within ten days to ſave their Lives, firſt paſſing under the <note n="*" place="margin">The Yoke was two Spears fixed in the Ground, and a third faſtened overthwart from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like a Gallows, under which the Soldiers were to go one after another, and was the greateſt Ignominy that a vanquiſh'd Enemy could undergo.</note> 
               <hi>Yoke.</hi> Which Conditions tho' greivous and highly diſhonourable, yet becauſe the Souldiers totter'd under the Fears of Death, were accepted, and a peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded amply to the King's deſire.</p>
            <p n="39">39. But when this Fatal News arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> Fear and Mourning invaded all the City; part bewail'd the Honour of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34632:91"/>
the Empire; others not accuſtom'd to the various Events of War, trembled for the miſtruſted loſs of their Liberty. But all were offended at <hi>Aulus,</hi> eſpecially they who had been often Famous in the Wars, for that he, having ſtifl his Arms in his hands, had ſought to ſave his Life, rather with diſhonour, then by Dint of Sword. Therefore <hi>Albinus</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt the Miſcarriage of his Brother might procure him Hatred, and Danger in the next Place, conſulted the Senate concerning the Validity of the League.</p>
            <p>In the mean time new Recruites were liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reinforce the Army; and aid was ſent for from their Aſſociates and the <hi>Latines;</hi> and this with all the Expedition imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Moreover the Senate, as it was but reaſonable, paſs a Decree, that no League could be valid but by their Command and the Conſent of the People. The <hi>Conſul,</hi> tho' forbid by the Tribunes to tranſport his new Levies, in a few days, arrives in <hi>Africa.</hi> For all the ſhatter'd Army having quitted <hi>Numidia,</hi> by agreement winter'd in the Province.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34632:92"/>
beſides the diſcouragement of their Flight, were debauch'd by diſſolute Licentiouſneſs, ariſing from ſuperfluous Plenty, and want of good Government, he determined to lie ſtill that Year.</p>
            <p n="40">40. In the mean while, at <hi>Rome, C. Mami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Limitanus,</hi> Tribune of the People, publiſhes an Edict of the Commons, for calling to a ſtrict account all thoſe Perſons who had countenanc'd <hi>Jugurth</hi> to contemn the Decrees of the Senate; alſo ſuch as in their Embaſſies or Generalſhips had been corrupted by his Bribes; ſuch as had deliver'd back either Elephants or Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and laſtly all that had capitulated with the Enemy, either of War or Peace, without Warrant. Againſt this Edict, ſome conſcious to themſelves, others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting danger from the <hi>Odium</hi> they had drawn upon themſelves, becauſe they durſt not openly make oppoſition, they pretended to be well pleas'd, both with this, and all other Edicts of that Nature. But underhand by their Friends, eſpecially the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> they endeavour'd to give it all the obſtruction they could. On the other ſide, the Commons, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to think how earneſt and intent they were, with what noiſe and clamour
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34632:92"/>
they Commanded, decreed and urg'd the Execution of their Edict; more out of an Antipathy againſt the Nobility, againſt whom thoſe Miſchiefs were contriv'd, then out of any true Zeal for the publick good. So violent was the Rage of both Parties. Therefore while the reſt were ſtruck with fear and dread, <hi>M. Sc<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urus,</hi> who was <hi>Beſtia</hi>'s Confederate, as we have already related, between the Inſultings of the People, and the Frights of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the whole City at the ſame time being under a ſtrange Conſternation, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were three Commiſſioners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ordain'd for Execution of the Inquiſition, ſo ordered it that he got himſelf to be one of the Number. Beſides, the Inquiſition was urged with that violence and exaſperated malice accompany'd with clamour and rude Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, that whatſoever ſeverities the Senate had exercis'd in former times upon the People, they were now in their proſperity, no leſs inſolent in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p n="41">41. This cuſtom of Bandying Parties among the People, of Senate-Factions, and all other wicked and corrupt Practices deriv'd its Original in <hi>Rome,</hi> from Idle,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34632:93"/>
neſs and Superfluity of thoſe things which Mortals deem their chiefeſt Felicities. For before the deſtruction of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the People and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> manag'd the Public Affairs with Unity and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: no contentions for Honour and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority among Fellow-Citizens: Hoſtile Fears retain'd the City within the bounds of Juſt and Honeſt. But when thoſe Fears were once remov'd, immediately Wantonneſs and Pride, the bad Effects of Proſperity, took place. So that what they wiſh'd for in their mean Condition, after once they came to enjoy Tranquility and Eaſe, was a Burden and Diſturbance of their Quiet. For then the Nobility began to turn their Superiority into domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pride, the People their Liberty into Petulancy: Uſurpation, Rapine, tearing this way, rending that way, and every one for himſelf, was then the public Mode. So that the whole being rent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Factions, that which lay in the middle was ſure to be torn in pieces. But the united Faction of the Nobility was moſt prevalent, the Strength of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons disjoynted, and ſcatter'd into Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, could do little: And thus the Commonwealth, as well in times of Peace,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34632:93"/>
as War, was manag'd at the Pleaſure of a Few. The Public Chequer, the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all Offices, Honours and Triumphs were at their diſpoſal; the People were kept under by Poverty and Military Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Generals with a few ſhar'd all the Spoils and Booty taken in War. All this while the Parents and Children of the Souldiers, as every one lay neareſt Neighbour to the Potent Nobleman, were thruſt out from their Habitations. Thus Avarice in League with Power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, polluted, and made prize of all things, regarding neither Meaſure nor Moderation, trampling Morality, ſpurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sanctity under their feet, till it threw it ſelf headlong into Ruine. For ſo ſoon as there were found among the Nobility ſome that preferr'd true Honour before uſurp'd Dominion, then the City began to be all in Combuſtion, and Civil War, like a Confuſion of Heaven and Earth, began to break forth.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Thus, after <hi>Tib.</hi> and <hi>C. Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors, both in the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic</hi> and in other Wars, had much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd the Honour of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, began to vindicate the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſcloſe the wicked Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34632:94"/>
of a few; the Nobility, guilty, and ſtruck with Terror of Puniſhment, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the aſſiſtance of their Allies and the <hi>Italians,</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, whom Hopes of being admitted into equal Society, had drawn off from the Commons, oppos'd the Proceedings of the <hi>Gracchi;</hi> and firſt they ſlew <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> then in a few years after, <hi>Caius,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>M. Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> treading the ſame ſteps; the one a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People; the other a <hi>Triumvir</hi> for the <hi>Tranſportation of Colonies.</hi> Tho', to ſpeak Truth, the <hi>Gracchi</hi> were too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate and vehement in the purſuit of Victory. Since it is the wiſer way to yield in a good Cauſe, then illegally to revenge an Injury. Therefore the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, proſecuting that Victory, as they pleas'd themſelves, what by the Sword, and what by Exilement, deſtroy'd a great number of People: procuring for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more of Terror, the Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A ſort of rigorous Policy that many times becomes the Ruine of great Cities, while the Citizens ſtrive to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh one another, they care not how, and proſecute their Revenge to the utmoſt extremity upon the Vanquiſh'd. But
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34632:94"/>
ſhould I go about to diſcourſe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Heats and Animoſities of the Factions, and all the Encroachments of bad Cuſtoms into the City, Time would ſooner fail me then Matter; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I return to the Buſineſs in hand.</p>
            <p n="43">43. After the Peace agreed by <hi>Aulus,</hi> and the ignominious Flight of our Army, <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Silanus</hi> being deſign'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, ſhar'd the Provinces among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by which means <hi>Numidia</hi> fell to <hi>Metellus,</hi> a man altogether for Action, and though an Enemy to Popular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet of an untainted and unviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reputation, and ſo acknowledg'd by both Parties. At his firſt entrance into his Office, after he had ſetl'd all Affairs wherein his Colleague and he were equally concern'd, he wholly bent his Mind upon the War which he was to undertake. To that purpoſe, not daring to confide in the Old Army, he liſted New Souldiers, ſends for Auxiliaries from all parts, makes proviſion of Armor, Weapons, and all other Inſtruments of War; ſtores him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all manner of Proviſions, and all things requiſite in a dubious Conteſt, often ſubject to the want of freſh Supplies.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34632:95"/>
Toward all which great and vigorous Preparations, the Allies, the <hi>Italians,</hi> and Foreign Princes, nay the whole City it ſelf largely contributed, even to emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both Forces and Money. So that all things being now in a readineſs, to his own content, he puts to Sea for <hi>Numidia,</hi> fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the City full of fair Hopes, knowing him to be a Perſon of great Vertue, and more eſpecially bearing a Mind impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Aſſaults of Gold: Which they lookt upon then as a great Matter, conſidering, how before that time, through the Covetouſneſs of our Governors in <hi>Numidia,</hi> our Forces had been foyl'd and weaken'd, and the Strength of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my augmented.</p>
            <p n="44">44. When he arriv'd in <hi>Africa,</hi> the Army was reſign'd to his Command by <hi>Spuricus Albinus</hi> the <hi>Pro-Conſul;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd and out of heart, neither daring to look Danger in the Face, nor endure Labour; prompter of their Tongues then Hands; preying upon their Friends, but a Prey to the Enemy; under no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Diſcipline. So that the new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was more troubl'd to reform their corrupted Manners, then any way encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34632:95"/>
to expect Aſſiſtance or Service from their licentious Numbers. <hi>Metellus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determines, though the proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing the former Summer-Elections, had ſhorten'd his Time, and that he knew the Eyes of his Fellow-Citizens were all upon him, not to meddle with the War, till he had firſt enur'd his Souldiers to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Hardſhip, according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of their Anceſtors. For <hi>Albinus</hi> being terrify'd with his Brother's Diſaſter, and the Overthrow of the Army, after he had reſolv'd not to ſtir out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, during ſo much of the Summer-Seaſon as he commanded the Army, kept his Souldiers in ſtanding Camps, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſlodg'd, but when Stench or Want of Forage compell'd him to remove. And then alſo, neither were the Watches obſerv'd, and Sentinels plac'd according to the Cuſtom of Military Diſcipline. But every one at random left his Colours, and wander'd where he pleas'd; the Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Camp-Boys intermix'd with the Souldiers, roam'd about the Country day and night, laying waſte the Fields, pillaging the Villages, driving off great Booties of Pris'ners and Cattel, which they exchang'd with the Merchants for Wine
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34632:96"/>
and other Commodities. Moreover, their public Allowances of Corn they ſold, and bought their Bread every day as they us'd it. Laſtly, whatever Scandals of Sloth and Luxury could ever be utter'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, were all to be really found in this our Army, and more if poſſible.</p>
            <p n="45">45. In the midſt of theſe Difficulties I find <hi>Metellus</hi> to be a Perſon no leſs prudent and politic, then expert in Affairs of War; ſuch was his Temperance and Moderation, between an eager deſire of Reformation and Severity. For by his firſt Edict, he prohibits all the Incentives and Panda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms to Idleneſs; That no man within the Camp ſhould ſell any Bread or Fleſh ready dreſt; That no Sutlers or Camp-Boys ſhould follow the Army; and That no Common Souldier ſhould preſume to keep either in the Camp or upon a March, any Slave, or Beaſt of Carriage: what elſe remain'd, he limitted according to the Rules of Diſcretion. Moreover, he often diſlodg'd his Camp, marching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one way, ſometimes another, and (as if the Enemy had been at hand) ſtill fortify'd himſelf with Trenches and Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. He frequently reliev'd the Watches,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34632:96"/>
and often went the Rounds himſelf with the <hi>Legates.</hi> And when he was upon a March, ſometimes he would be in the Front, ſometimes in the Rear, and often in the middle, to prevent the ſtragling of the Souldiers from their Colours: and when they march'd in a full Body, they were order'd to carry their Proviſion, as well as their Arms: and by prohibiting, rather then by puniſhing Miſcarriages, he reduc'd the Army to perfect Diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="46">46. In the mean while <hi>Jugurth,</hi> when he heard by his Spies, the Courſes which <hi>Metellus</hi> took, as alſo being aſcertain'd from <hi>Rome</hi> of his Integrity, he began to miſtruſt the Iſſue of his Affairs, and then at length began to think of making a real Compoſition. To which purpoſe he ſent his Agents to the <hi>Conſul,</hi> with Offers of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and full Commiſſion to deſire on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own and his Childrens Lives, but refer all other things to the good will and pleaſure of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. But <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was not ignorant by former experience, that the <hi>Numidians</hi> were a perfidious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inconſtant in their Humor, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inclin'd to Novelty. And therefore diſcourſing the Agents every one apart by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34632:97"/>
themſelves, and ſounding 'em by degrees, when he found 'em ſincerely pliable, he perſwades 'em with large Promiſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up <hi>Jugurth</hi> into his hands alive, if poſſible, or ſlain, if otherwiſe it could not be accompliſh'd; but what farther Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage they had to carry to the King, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly informs 'em at a Public Audience. After this, he enters <hi>Numidia</hi> with a well reſolv'd and powerful Army; where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the count'nance of War, the Houſes were full of People, and the Fields of Cattel and Husbandmen. Then out of the ſeveral Towns and Villages the King's Officers came forth to meet and congratulate the <hi>Conſul,</hi> profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to furniſh him with Corn and Carriages for his Proviſion, and in a word, to do whatever he commanded. But notwithſtanding theſe fair ſhews, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> was never a jot the leſs circumſpect, marching in the ſame order and warineſs, as if the Enemy had been at hand, ſent his Scouts and Forlorns every way round about; believing all pretences of Surrender to be only Wiles and Stratagems to draw him into Miſchief. And therefore he march'd himſelf at the Head of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with ſome of the nimbleſt Cohorts,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34632:97"/>
and a ſelect Band of Archers and Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The Reer <hi>C. Marius,</hi> his Legate, brought up with his Horſe: and upon each Wing he had divided the Auxiliary Horſe at the Command of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Legions, and Captains of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts; to the end that the light Armed Foot and the Horſe being thus intermixt, they might be able to withſtand the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cavalry, which way ſoever they make an Impreſſion. For <hi>Jugurth</hi> was ſo politic, ſo well acquainted with the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Country, and the Art of War, that whether he were more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous abſent or preſent, treating Peace, or actually in War, was hard to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd.</p>
            <p n="47">47. There ſtood not far from the Road which <hi>Metellus</hi> took in his march, a Town belonging to the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which was call'd <note n="*" place="margin">Whatever it were, there is now no footſteps of it remaining.</note> 
               <hi>Vacca,</hi> the moſt famous for Trade of any in the Kingdom; and greatly frequented by the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants. Here the <hi>Conſul,</hi> as well for a Trial whether they would obey or no, as alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantages of the Situation,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34632:98"/>
places a Garriſon. Moreover he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Inhabitants to furniſh him with a Quantity of Corn and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries uſeful in War; believing, as it was moſt rational to think, That the great Concourſe of Merchants, and plenty of Proviſion would be a great Aſſiſtance to his Army: beſides that the Place lay convenient for a Magazine of neceſſary Preparations for the future. In the midſt of theſe Tranſactions <hi>Jugurth</hi> ſends again ſubmiſſive Meſſengers, and much more earneſtly then before ſues for Peace, with Offers to <hi>Metellus,</hi> to ſurrender all things to his Mercy but his own and the Lives of his Children; whom the <hi>Conſul,</hi> as he did the former, ſent back again with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to betray their Maſter; but as to the Peace which the King deſir'd, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave any poſitive Grant or Refuſal; delaying on purpoſe, in expectation of the Agents Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="48">48. But <hi>Jugurth,</hi> when he compar'd the Words and Deeds of <hi>Metellus</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and found himſelf match'd at his own Weapons of Delay and Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while Peace was diſſembl'd in Words, but actually a ſharp and vigorous War in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34632:98"/>
the Bowels of his Kingdom; one of his chiefeſt Cities in the Enemies Hands, the Country diſcover'd, and the People ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in their Allegiance, conſtrain'd by the Neceſſity of his Affairs, he reſolves to fight it out. And therefore by his Spies having throughly diſcover'd and obſerv'd the March of the Enemy, conceiving great hopes of Victory from the Opportunity of the Place, he raiſes all the Force he could make of all ſorts of People, and ſo by private ways, and ſhorter Cuts, he gets before <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Army. There was in that part of <hi>Numidia,</hi> which upon the Diviſion of the Kingdom, fell to <hi>Adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s ſhare, a River riſing Southward, which was call'd <hi>Muthul,</hi> from whence, at the diſtance of about a Thouſand and Twenty Paces, a great Mountain ſhew'd it ſelf, wild by Nature, and altogether untill'd and uninhabited: from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which, there grew as it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hill to a very great height, cover'd over with wild Olives, Mirtles, and ſuch other ſorts of Trees as delight in barren and ſandy Grounds. All the ſurrounding Plain for want of Water, lay deſart; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe parts that border'd upon the Stream, which were thick ſet with Buſhes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34632:99"/>
and Hedges, full of Cattel and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Upon this Hill, which ran croſs the High-way, as we have ſaid, it was, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> drew up the Vanguard of his Army thinly Marſhall'd, giving <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi> the Charge of his Elephants, and ſome part of his Forces, with full Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions what to do. He himſelf with his Cavalry, and ſome ſelected Battalions of Foot, plants himſelf nearer the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; then riding from Troop to Troop, and Rank to Rank, he exhorts, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and conjures them not to forget their priſtine Valour and victorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, but bravely to defend themſelves and his Kingdom from the Avarice of the <hi>Romans:</hi> That they were to deal with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as they had forc'd to paſs the Yoke already: That their Captain only, not their Courage was chang'd: That his Care and Foreſight had prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Accidents, as became an expert Leader: That he had taken the upper Ground, and intermix'd 'em ſo, Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes with the raw and undiſciplin'd, to the end that they might not be afraid to grapple a few in number with many, or leſs expert, with their Superiors in War: therefore that they ſhould be all in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34632:99"/>
and forward to aſſail the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Signal given: That this was the Day which would either prove the end of all their Toyls by glorious Conqueſt, or the beginning of unavoydable Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Then culling out by Name every particular Perſon, that for their Martial Deeds he had either enrich'd with Gold, or advanc'd to Military Honours, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes 'em to be mindful of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and bids 'em encourage others with the ſame Expectancies. Laſtly, as if he underſtood the particular <hi>Genius</hi> of thoſe he ſpoke to, ſome he promiſes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he threatens, but emboldens and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages all by all the ways imaginable. All this while <hi>Metellus,</hi> ignorant of the Enemies Approach, is diſcover'd march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Army down the Hill. Who ſuddenly deſcrying an unuſual ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider; for the <hi>Numidians</hi> kept themſelves and their Horſes ſnug within the Trees and Buſhes, which nevertheleſs were not ſo high as to ſhelter 'em ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from being ſeen; and yet the nature of the Place was ſuch, that they could not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcover'd, beſides that they had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly hid all their Military Enſigns. But in a ſhort time the Truth being fully found
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34632:100"/>
out, and the General made a ſteady halt, Then haſtning to embattel his Army, he chang'd the Order of his March, and in the right Wing which was next the Enemy, he places three Bodies of Reſerves. Between the ſmall Diviſions he diſperſes the Slingers and Darters, and plants all his Cavalry upon the Wings. Then after ſome few Exhortations to the Souldiers, for ſhortneſs of time would not permit him to uſe many words, he brings his Army thus Embatell'd into the Plain, only that the firſt Ranks chang'd their ground in Marching.</p>

But when he perceiv'd that the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi> lay ſtill, and would not come down from the Hill, fearing leſt his Men ſhould be diſtreſs'd for want of Water, he ſent <hi>Rutilius</hi> before with ſome of the nimbleſt Cohorts and part of the Horſe, to the River to ſecure a place for his Camp, believing that the Enemy would then powr down upon him, and by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him in Flank, endeavour to prevent him; and becauſe they durſt not rely upon their own Courage, would ſeek to tire out his Men with heat and drought. After Him, the Conſul follow'd, ſlowly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34632:100"/>
deſcending the Hill, as the nature of the Place would give leave. <hi>Marius</hi> brought up the Rear; himſelf march'd with the Cavalry upon the Left Wing. On the other ſide <hi>Jugurth,</hi> when he found that the Rear of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Army was juſt paſt by the Front of his own Men, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Guard of two thouſand Foot upon the Mountain, from whence <hi>Metellus</hi> had deſcended, to prevent the Enemy from regaining it, and fortifying themſeves in that place, ſhould they be put to a retreat; then giving the Signal, he flew upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Numidians</hi> ſoon made havock in the Rear, while others Charge in the Flank, ſome upon the right, others upon the left ſide: they preſs on, and lay about 'em, every where endeavouring to break the Ranks of the <hi>Romans;</hi> among whom, they who with greateſt reſolution labour'd to come to a cloſe Fight, were diſappointed by the uncertain Aſſaults of the Enemy, who fought and wounded at a diſtance thoſe that could reach to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves. For the Horſemen had been inſtructed before by <hi>Jugurth,</hi> that when they were purſu'd by any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, that they ſhould not retreat in a Body, but ſcatter ſeveral ways; by that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34632:101"/>
means, if they could not deter the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from purſuit, they were in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being Superior in number, to Charge 'em when diſſipated on all ſides, Rear, Front and Flanks: and then a gain, if the Hill were more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſecure their Flight then the Plain Fields, that then they ſhould retire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where their Horſes accuſtom'd to ſcoure through the Buſhes, could not be follow'd by our Men, eaſily incumber'd among the Shrubs and Thickets.</p>
            <p n="50">50. All this while the Event of things lookt but with an ill Aſpect; uncertain, various, bloody and miſerable; diſpers'd from their own, ſome fled, others purſu'd; neither Enſigns nor Orders obſerv'd; where-ever danger attacque'd any Man, there he made reſiſtance, Arms, Weapons, Horſes, Men, Enemies and Friends lay all intermingl'd together; nothing was acted by Counſel or Command, but Fortune go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd. And now the day began to be far ſpent, and then the Iſſue was alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; But at length, both ſides being ſpent with toyl and heat, <hi>Metellus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Numidians</hi> fury to abate, ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies his Men together by degrees, reduces
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34632:101"/>
'em into Order, and places four Legiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cohorts againſt the Enemies foot: To thoſe Cohorts, of which the greateſt part, weary and tir'd, had poſſeſs'd the upper Grounds, <hi>Metellus</hi> gave good words, and deſir'd 'em not to deſert their fellow Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers nor ſuffer an Enemy half vanquiſh'd to wreſt the Victory out of their hands; that they had neither Camp nor Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to retreat to, but all their hopes was in their Swords. Neither was <hi>Jugurth</hi> idle, he rode about, exhorted; entreated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd the fight, and in perſon with the ſelect Guards of his Body, try'd all places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd his own, preſs'd furiouſly upon thoſe that waver'd; and againſt thoſe he could not move, he fought at a diſtance. Thus theſe two famous Generals beſtirr'd themſelves, in Courage and Experience, in their Forces not ſo equally match'd. For <hi>Metellus</hi> had the more valiant Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, tho the Ground was diſadvantageous; <hi>Jugurth</hi> had all Advantages of his ſide but only Souldiers. At length the <hi>Romans</hi> underſtanding they had no place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and finding that the Enemy would not hazzard a cloſe Fight, beſides that it was now toward Evening, by the Generals Command they briskly charge up Hill;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34632:102"/>
and then it was that the <hi>Numidians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt their footing, were ſoon routed and out to flight, few were ſlain, in regard that the ſwiftneſs of their Heels, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try unknown to the <hi>Roman,</hi> protected their Lives.</p>
            <p n="51">51. In the mean time <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> to whom <hi>Jugurth</hi> had given the Command of his Elephants, and part of his Infantry, as we have ſaid already, when <hi>Rutilius</hi> was March'd paſt him, brings his own Men into the Champaign ground by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and whilſt the Legate haſtned to the River, whither he was ſent before, orders his Army with great ſilence, as it behov'd him, not neglecting however by his Spies to obſerve the Motions of the Enemy in every place. So ſoon as he underſtood that <hi>Rutilius</hi> was Encamp'd in a careleſs poſture; and found that <hi>Jugurth</hi> was engag'd by the hideous Noiſes that reach'd his Ears from the Battle, fearing leaſt the Legate when he underſtood the cauſe, would haſten to the Aſſiſtance of his own Party, he extends the Front of his Army, which before, upon diſtruſt of their Courage he had drawn up thick and cloſe, and to ſtop the March of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34632:102"/>
Marches directly toward <hi>Rutilius</hi>'s Camp. The <hi>Romans</hi> of a ſuddain perceive a prodigious Cloud of Duſt; for the fields being thick ſet with low Trees hindr'd a clear Proſpect: and believes at firſt that it was rais'd by the Wind; but afterwards when they ſaw it continue, and approach nearer and nearer to themſelves, then readily conjecturing what the matter was, they betake themſelves to their Arms, and range themſelves before the Camp according to command. When the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy drew near, both ſides joyn Battle, with a hideous clamour and noiſe: The <hi>Numidians</hi> ſtood faſt, ſo long as they thought there was any hope in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, but when they ſaw them entangl'd among the Boughs, and by that means overthrown and ſurrounded by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> they betook themſelves to their Heels, and throwing away their Arms, by the benefit of the Hill and the Night, which was then at hand, eſcap'd with little Execution. Four Elephants were taken, the reſt to the number of forty kill'd. But the <hi>Romans,</hi> though tir'd with their March, with raiſing the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of their Camp, and the heat of the Battle; yet becauſe <hi>Metellus</hi> ſtaid lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34632:103"/>
then was expected, they March for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Embattl'd, as they were, and with an extraordinary Reſolution to meet him. For the Craft of the <hi>Numidians</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of nothing negligent or remiſs. At firſt, through the darkneſs of the Night, when they came within hearing one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, being taken for Enemies, there was nothing but fear and hurry one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong another. And through impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a fatal Accident had like to have happen'd, had not the Forelorns on both ſides rectify'd the miſtake. But then their fears were chang'd of a ſuddain into joy. The Souldiers merrily call to one another, relate and hearken to one anothers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits; and every one extols his own Valour to the Skies. For ſuch is the Condition of human Affairs, that after Victory Cowards have leave to boaſt, but ill ſucceſs caſts a reproach on the moſt Valiant.</p>
            <p n="52">52. <hi>Metellus</hi> ſtay'd four days in the ſame Camp; orders the wounded to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look'd after; thoſe that had well deſerv'd in the Battle, he well Rewards according to the Military Cuſtom, applauds 'em all in general, and gives 'em thanks
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34632:103"/>
in a Public Aſſembly. As to what was behind, which would now prove eaſy, he exhorted 'em to behave themſelves with equal Courage; that they had already fought ſufficiently for Victory, their other Toyls woul'd only be for Booty. In the mean time he ſends the Fugitives and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper Spies to bring him News where <hi>Jugurth</hi> was, what he was doing, what force he had about him, and how he brook'd his loſs. But <hi>Jugurth</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd himſelf among the Woods and Places ſtrongly fortify'd by Nature; there he levy'd an Army more numerous that he had before; but ſuch as had neither Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle nor Strength. Which happen'd ſo, for this reaſon, becauſe unleſs it were the Royal Cavalry, not one of all the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> accompani'd the King in his Flight, but every one took his own Courſe, as his Fancy lead him; neither is it accounted any ſhame for a Souldier ſo to do, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cuſtom of the Country. <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> therefore, when he found that the Kings Courage was not yet cool'd; but that the War would be renew'd, which could not then be manag'd but as <hi>Jugurth</hi> pleas'd himſelf: Moreover that he fought upon unequal terms with an Enemy, to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34632:104"/>
whom it was leſs prejudice to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, then to overcome his Men, he determin'd to fight no more pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, but to carry on the War after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner. Therefore he Marches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Richeſt Parts of <hi>Numidia,</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes and lays waſt all the Country, takes and burns ſeveral Caſtles and Towns ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlightly fortify'd, or elſe without any Garriſons; puts all the Young men to the Sword, all other things he gives free Booty, to the Souldiers. Theſe ſevere Proceedings cauſe ſeveral to ſend Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the <hi>Romans;</hi> Corn and all other neceſſary Proviſions, are plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, and where ever need requir'd, there he plac'd a Garriſon. Which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Warlike management terrify'd the King much more then the ill ſucceſs of a Battle. For that be, whoſe hopes of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were all in flight, was now conſtrain'd to follow: And he that could not defend the Territories that were left him, was now forc'd to wage War in the Conqueſts of another. But in this diſtreſs and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of choice, he took that courſe which ſeem'd to him to be the wiſeſt.</p>
            <p>He orders the Body of his Army ſtill to lie in the ſame place: He himſelf with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34632:104"/>
a ſelect number of Horſe follows <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi> and in regard his Nocturnal Marches, and unfrequented ways were not ſubject to quick Diſcovery, he frequently met with the <hi>Roman</hi> Forragers and Straglers; of which the greateſt part were ſlain or taken; nor did one eſcape unwounded: which done, before Aſſiſtance could be ſent from the Camp, the <hi>Numidians</hi> were vaniſh'd to the next Hills.</p>
            <p n="55">55. In the mean time there was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary rejoycing at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the News of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s ſucceſs; that he had govern'd both himſelf and the Army ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom and Diſcipline of their Anceſtors; that in a diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground he had obtain'd the Victory by his Valour; that he was Maſter of the Enemies Country, and had conſtrain'd <hi>Jugurth,</hi> vain-gloriouſly puff'd up and grown inſolent through the Cowardice of <hi>Aulus,</hi> to hide his head in Deſerts, and to place all his hopes of ſafety in Flight. Therefore the Senate order'd Supplications to the Immortal Gods for the ſucceſs of their Arms: The City trembling before, and ſolicitouſly dreading the Event of the War, were all in Feſtivals and Jollity;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34632:105"/>
and <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Fame ſpread far and near. For this reaſon he labour'd more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly after Victory: He leaves no ſtone unturn'd; yet provident all the while how he fell into the Ambuſcado's of the Enemy; mindful that after Glory Envy follows. Therefore the greater his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was, ſo much the more Careful and Vigilant alſo was he; neither after the laſt Attempts of <hi>Jugurth,</hi> would he ſuffer the Army to forrage at random: and therefore when he wanted either Corn or Fodder, he ſent ſeveral Cohorts, and all the Cavalry to guard the Forragers. He himſelf led one part of the Army, and <hi>Marius</hi> the other: the Country was laid waſt, rather by Fire then driving of Booty; they Encamp'd in two ſeveral Places, not far diſtant one from the other. When there was occaſion for reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they joyn'd both together: and when they deſign'd to clear and ravage the Country, and ſpread the Terror of their Arms, then they acted aſunder. At the ſame time <hi>Jugurth</hi> follow'd cloſe at their Heels, but ſtill keeping the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. VVhere ever he could perceive the Enemy bent their March, there he deſtroy'd all the Forrage and poyſon'd
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34632:105"/>
the Wells and Fountains, of which there was great ſcarcity. Sometimes he would ſhew himſelf to <hi>Metellus,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Marius;</hi> by and by fall upon the Rear; neither engage in Battle, nor ſuffer 'em to be at reſt; only to obſtruct the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies deſigns.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> General, when he ſaw himſelf tir'd out by a crafty Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that would not be drawn to a fair Encounter, he determin'd to Beſiege a great City called <note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>Zamora</hi> a 120. miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and a 100. from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Zama,</hi> in that Quarter of the Country, the Key and Bulwark of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, believing as it was but rational, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> would come to relieve the Place, and ſo give him the Opportunity of a Battle: But he being inform'd by the Fugitives of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s deſigns, with long Marches gets before him; encourages the Townſmen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Walls, and leaves 'em all his Fugitives to re-inforce their Garriſon; which were a ſort of People the ſtouteſt and moſt reſolute of all the Kings Forces; as being under a conſtraint of being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: and having thus ſettl'd his Affairs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34632:106"/>
he ſlips into the moſt private lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holes he could meet with. Soon after he underſtood that <hi>Marius</hi> was upon his March, being commanded with ſome few Cohorts to Convoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of Corn from <note n="*" place="margin">Formerly a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> from <hi>Succoth Benoth,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> call'd alſo <hi>Sicca Venerea,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Temple therein Dedicated to <hi>Venus:</hi> but now utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd, without any footſteps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. Tho' ſome will have it to be the Town now call'd <hi>Antoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sicca.</hi> Which was the firſt Town that revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the King after his Defeat. Thither <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> haſtens in the Night time, with ſome ſelect Troops of Horſe, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the <hi>Romans</hi> as they were juſt Marching out at the Gate; and at the ſame time cry'd out to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to fall upon the Cohorts in the Rear; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all encouraging 'em, for that Fortune had put into their hands a noble Opportunity; which if they laid hold on, he ſhould for the future enjoy his Kingdom, and they their Liberty in Peace and Tranquillity. So that had not <hi>Marius</hi> fall'n on with all the fury imaginable, made his way out of the Town, and broke through the Enemy at the ſame time, either all or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34632:106"/>
moſt of the Inhabitants, had chang'd their Fidelity: ſo mutable and inconſtant is the <hi>Numidian</hi> Faith. But <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Souldiers being a while ſupported by the preſence of their Prince, when they felt the ſmart ſtrokes of the Enemy, who preſt in hard on the thickeſt and moſt forward, with the loſs of ſome few, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſpeedy flight; and <hi>Marius</hi> comes ſafe to <hi>Zama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="57">57. This Town was ſeated in a Plain, rather fortify'd by Induſtry then Nature, provided with all Neceſſaries, and ſtor'd with Men and Ammunition. <hi>Metellus</hi> therefore having prepar'd all things in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs ſo far as the Time and Place would permit, ſurrounds the Walls with his whole Army, and gives Orders to the Legates what Poſts to take. Then upon the Signal given, a hideous Clamour fills the Skies on every ſide: but all their noiſe nothing terrifies the <hi>Numidians;</hi> they ſtand reſolute and fix'd without any Tumult;  ſo the Aſſault begins. The <hi>Romans</hi> plaid their parts as they thought beſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſome fought with Slings and Darts at a diſtance, others make cloſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſome to undermine, and ſome reſolv'd to ſet their Ladders to the Walls,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34632:107"/>
and make a ſpeedier trial of their Swords. On the other ſide, the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> powr down Stones, pointed Stakes and Darts upon thoſe that were neareſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with flaming Fire-brands all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd with Pitch and Tar. Nor could their Fears protect thoſe that kept far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off: For the Darts continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from the Engines, or elſe flung out of Hand, both reach'd and wounded the greateſt part: Both the Timorous and the Valiant underwent the ſame danger, though not with equal Reputation.</p>
            <p n="58">58. While both Sides vigorouſly thus diſpute for <hi>Zama, Jugurth</hi> of a ſudden, and when leaſt expected, falls upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and forcing the Turn-pike, breaks in upon our Men. Who being amaz'd with ſudden Fright, ſhift every one for themſelves according to cuſtom; ſome fly, ſome betake themſelves to their Arms; and a great many are either wounded or ſlain. Of all the Number, not above Forty, remembring they were <hi>Romans,</hi> embody'd together, betake themſelves to a Riſing Ground, and made it good, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Force of the Aſſailants; the Darts thrown at 'em they return'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which from a few lighting upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34632:107"/>
crowded together, did never fall in vain: if the <hi>Numidians</hi> durſt approach 'em, then they ſhew'd their Courage, with a ſtrange Fury routing, killing, putting all to flight. At the ſame time <hi>Metellus</hi> in the heat of the Aſſault, hearing a great Noiſe and Tumult behind him, turn'd about his Horſe, and perceiving a Rout, and that they that fled, made toward him, he readily conjectur'd what the Matter was. Thereupon he ſends away all his Cavalry forthwith to the Camp, and after them <hi>Marius</hi> with the Cohorts of the Allies, conjuring him with Tears in his Eyes, by the Friendſhip that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, and by the Honour of the Commonwealth, not to ſuffer any Diſgrace to ſtain the Victories of his Army, nor to leave the Enemy ere he had had his full Revenge. <hi>Marius</hi> vigorouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Command. So that <hi>Jugurth</hi> being incumber'd with the Fortifications of the Camp, while ſome threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong over the Rampire, others crowding through the narrow paſſages to get out, hinder'd one another, with the loſs of many of his Men, retir'd to his Faſtneſſes. <hi>Metellus</hi> alſo at the ſame time, not able to prevail, in regard that Night
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34632:108"/>
drew on, retreated with his Army to the Camp.</p>
            <p n="59">59. The next day before he return'd to the Aſſault, he drew up all his Cavalry before the Camp on that ſide where he expected a ſecond Attempt from <hi>Jugurth,</hi> and commanded 'em there to keep a ſtrict Watch. The Turn-pikes and Places next adjoyning, he commits to the Guard of the <hi>Tribunes;</hi> and then ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding the Town, as he did the day before, gives a ſecond general Aſſault. Preſently <hi>Jugurth</hi> makes a ſecond Attempt likewiſe upon our formoſt Men; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat terrify'd at firſt, are ſoon diſorder'd; but the Reſerves fly ſpeedily to their Relief. Nor could the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have longer withſtood their Force, had not their Foot, being intermingl'd with the Cavalry, made a great Slaughter at the firſt Charge. For being aſſiſted by this intermixture, they did not, as it is uſual in other Charges of the Horſe, ſometimes preſs forward, ſometimes give Ground; but fell in pell-mell, Horſe Head to Horſe Head, thereby incumbring and diſordering the Ranks, at what time the Foot breaking in, had almoſt routed the Enemy.</p>
            <p n="60">
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:34632:108"/>
60. At the ſame time the Diſpute was no leſs deſperate at <hi>Zamara.</hi> Where every <hi>Legate</hi> or <hi>Tribune</hi> was poſted, there moſt vigorouſly they perform'd their Duties, no man confiding more in another, then in himſelf. On the other ſide, the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made a ſtrenuous Reſiſtance, they fought to wonder, and provided againſt all Accidents; more eager to wound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then mindful of their own Safety. Hideous and different were the Cries of both Parties, Encouragements, Shouts of Joy, and bitter Groans of Lamentation; the Clattering of Weapons fill'd the Skies; and Showers of Darts fell thick on every ſide. At length they who defended the Walls, when they perceiv'd the Fury of the enemy a little to ſlacken, ſtood ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Battlements to behold the Fight between the <hi>Roman</hi>  
               <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Cavalry; and as <hi>Jugurth</hi> either prevail'd, or loſt Ground, ſometimes you ſhould ſee 'em overjoy'd, then again all in conſternation. And as far as they could be ſeen or heard by their fellows, ſome they beſought, others they encourag'd, making Signs with their Hands, and Motions of their Bodies, like men avoiding or darting forward their miſſive Weapons. Which when <hi>Marius</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:34632:109"/>
perceiv'd, for he had the Charge of that Quarter, on purpoſe he ſlacken'd his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and diſſembl'd a Miſtruſt of the Event, ſuffering the <hi>Numidians</hi> to have an unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted Proſpect of their Princes Bravery. But at length, while they were buſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon their Fellows, <hi>Marius</hi> attacks the Walls with a more then ordinary violence. And the Souldiers by the help of their Scaling Ladders, had almoſt gain'd the Battlements, when the Townſmen embodying of a ſudden, ply'd 'em with Stones, Fire-works, and other Miſſive Weapons. Our men made ſtout reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at firſt, but after two or three of the Ladders were broken, they that ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em were miſerably mortify'd; the reſt, few ſafe, every one, as beſt they could, ſhifted for themſelves, and very few eſcaping unwounded, the moſt part hurt and maim'd, quitted the Aſſault: at length Night parted the bloody Fray.</p>
            <p n="61">61. When <hi>Metellus</hi> found ſuch ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Enterprize, and that neither the Town could be taken, nor <hi>Jugurth</hi> drawn to fight, but where he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Ground or Ambuſcado's, and that Summer was ſpent, he rais'd his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34632:109"/>
Siege from before <hi>Zama,</hi> and plac'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in thoſe Cities which had revolted from him, and were either naturally or artificially fortify'd; and the reſt of the Army he quarter'd in that part of the Province which borders upon <hi>Numidia.</hi> Nor did he ſpend that Time as others were wont to do, in Eaſe and Luxury, but finding Force ſo little prevail'd, he therefore betook himſelf to Stratagem: To this purpoſe, with fair Words and large Promiſes he attempts <hi>Bomilcar.</hi> This was he who accompany'd <hi>Jugurth</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and after he had given Sureties for his forth-coming, upon the Murder of <hi>Maſſiva,</hi> ſecretly made his Eſcape, for fear of being put to death; and therefore by reaſon of his intimacy with <hi>Jugurth',</hi> had the fairer opportunity to betray his Friend. The firſt thing <hi>Metellus</hi> did, was to bring him to a private Meeting: in the next place he gave him his word, That if he would deliver <hi>Jugurth</hi> into his hands alive or dead, the Senate ſhould not only grant him Impunity, but his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. The <hi>Numidian</hi> is eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being not only naturally treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but alſo miſdoubting, leſt if the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould make a Peace with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34632:110"/>
he might be excepted out of the Articles, and deliver'd up to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p n="62">62. He therefore, upon the firſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he could meet with, coming to <hi>Jugurth,</hi> and finding him troubl'd, and bewailing his Misfortunes, with Tears in his Eyes beſeeches and conjures him, that at length he would take pity of himſelf, his Children, and the miſerable Eſtate of the <hi>Numidian</hi> People, ſo well deſerving at his hands: further he put him in mind, That ſtill in all Encounters they were vanquiſh'd; the Country was laid waſte, numbers of his Subjects carry'd away Captive, or ſlain, and the Treaſures of the Kingdom utterly impoveriſh'd; That he had ſufficiently try'd his Fortune, and the Courage of his Souldiers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he ſhould take heed, leſt while he delay'd, the <hi>Numidians</hi> did not conſult for their own Safety. By theſe and other Arguments of this Nature, he mollifies the King's Inclinations to a Surrender. Commiſſioners are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent to the General, to let him know, That <hi>Jugurth</hi> was ready to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and without any Compoſition
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34632:110"/>
to ſurrender both himſelf and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Generoſity: <hi>Metellus</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſends for all that were of Senatorian Degree, from their Winter Quarters, and adviſes with them, and ſuch others as he thought convenient. Thereupon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient Cuſtom, by his Meſſengers He commands <hi>Jugurth</hi> to ſend him two hundred pound weight of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, all his Elephants, ſuch a number of Horſes, and ſuch a quantity of warlike Ammunition; which being done, he commands all the Fugitives to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up in Chains. The greateſt part of them were alſo ſent accordingly; only ſome few upon the firſt Report of a Surrender, immediately fled to King <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> into <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Thus was <hi>Jugurth</hi> deſpoyl'd of his Arms, the Flower of all his Forces, and his Money. But when he was ſummon'd to appear before the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then reſiding at <hi>Tiſidium,</hi> then he began to change his Mind, and through Guilt of Conſcience to dread what really he deſerv'd. At length, after he had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted many days in heſitation, ſometimes as it were tir'd with his Misfortunes, deeming all things to be endur'd before the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of War; then again reflecting with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34632:111"/>
himſelf, how terrible a Fall it would be from a Kingdom into Slavery, at laſt he makes choice of War. At <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> being mov'd concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, decree <hi>Numidia</hi> to <hi>Metellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="63">63. At the ſame time <hi>Marius</hi> being by accident at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and there making his Offerings to the Gods for his Succeſs in the laſt Expedition, the Soothſayer told him, That the Signs portended great and wonderful Events in reference to himſelf, and therefore whatever he had in his Mind, he might boldly act, in confidence of the Favour of the Gods; That he might venture Fortune as often as he pleas'd, for that he ſhould proſper in all his Undertakings.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Some time before this, a violent Ambition of the Conſulſhip had harraſs'd his Thoughts. For the Atchievement of which, beſide the Antiquity of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſtood fair in all other reſpects In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Probity, Military Experiennce, a vaſt Courage in War, great Frugality, a Contemner of Pleaſure and ſuperfluous Wealth, only impatient of Honour. He was born and bred up during all the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34632:111"/>
time of his Childhood at <note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>Arpino</hi> in the <hi>Terra di Lavoro</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Arpinum,</hi> where he firſt learnt to undergo the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of War, wherein he ſpent his Youth, ſerving all along for Pay; not in the Study of <hi>Grecian</hi> Eloquence, or City Courtſhip: and thus in a ſhort time he attain'd to a perfection in vertuous Exerciſes. And therefore when he firſt ſtood for the Military <hi>Tribuneſhip</hi> at an Aſſembly of the Commons, moſt People not knowing his Face, when once they heard his Name, he preſently carry'd it by the Voyces of all the Tribes. From that Office he advanc'd himſelf ſtill high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher by degrees, and in all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments ſo behav'd himſelf, that he was always deem'd worthy of a Nobler then that he poſſeſs'd at preſent. But till that time, notwithſtanding his matchleſs Bravery (for ſtill Ambition hurry'd him headlong) he durſt not ſtand for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip. For then the Commonalty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of other Offices, but the Conſulſhip the Nobility ſhar'd ſucceſſively among themſelves. No upſtart Perſon never ſo famous, never ſo celebrated for his great Atchievments, was thought worthy, but
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34632:112"/>
rather a Defilement of that Honour</p>
            <p n="64">64. <hi>Marius</hi> therefore, when he ſaw that the predictions of the Soothſayer tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame way that his Ambition car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd him, deſir'd <hi>Metellus</hi> to ſpare him from the Army, that he might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſtand for the Conſulſhip; who, though he were a Perſon in whom Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Honour, and all other Qualities, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſirable, were brightly eminent, yet were they accompany'd with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful Mind and lofty Pride, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Failings of the Nobility. Mov'd therefore at firſt with the Novelty of <hi>Marius</hi>'s Demand, he wonder'd at his Deſign, and as it were in Friendſhip ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him not to act ſo prepoſterouſly, nor to advance his Thoughts above his Fortune: That all things were not proper to be deſir'd by all men; That it became him to be contented with his preſent Preferments, which were ſufficient. Laſtly, That he ſhould conſider well before he made a Requeſt of ſo high a Nature to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that might be lawfully deny'd him. After he had given him theſe and many more Admonitions of the ſame Nature,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34632:112"/>
yet could not divert <hi>Marius</hi> from his ſetl'd Intentions, he made him anſwer, That ſo ſoon as the Public Affairs would permit, he would grant him his Deſires. And afterwards when <hi>Marius</hi> urg'd him with greater importunity, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, That he ſhould adviſe him, not to be too haſty, adding withal, That it would be time enough for him to ſtand for the Conſulſhip with his Son; who at that time was a private Souldier in his Fathers Pavilion, about twenty years of Age. Which Taunt of <hi>Metellus</hi> not only vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently incens'd him to proſecute the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he affected, but alſo againſt <hi>Metellus</hi> himſelf. For that reaſon he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Dictates of his Ambition, and his Wrath, the worſt of evil Counſellors: All his Words and Actions now tended to Popularity: The Souldiers which he commanded, he permitted to live more looſly then before: Among the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, of which there was a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> he ſcatter'd many ſcandalous and oſtentatious Reports concerning the War: That if he might have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but of half the Army, he would in a days time have <hi>Jugurth</hi> in Chains; and that the War was on purpoſe ſpun
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34632:113"/>
out by the General, as one that being a Perſon vain-glorious, and of Princely Pride, too much affected Power and Command. Which the Merchants more readily believ'd to be true, for that by the continuance of the War, their Trade was very much hinder'd; and to a Covetous Mind all Procraſtination ſeems a Crime.</p>
            <p n="65">65. There was at that time in our Army a certain <hi>Numidian,</hi> by Name <hi>Gauda,</hi> the Son of <hi>Manaſtabales,</hi> the Grand-child of <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> whom <hi>Micipſa</hi> by his Will had left the next Heir of the Kingdom, full of Diſeaſes, and for that reaſon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what craz'd in his Sences: to whom <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> upon two Requeſts, that according to the Cuſtom of Princes, he might have his Chair ſet next the General's Seat, as alſo a Troop of <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe for the Guard of his Body, had deny'd him both: The Honour, becauſe it repreſented that Majeſty, which the <hi>Romans</hi> term'd Regal, and could not endure to ſuffer always in their ſight: The Guard, becauſe it look'd diſgracefully for the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon a <hi>Numidian.</hi> This Perſon therefore thus repuls'd, and vex'd in his Mind, <hi>Marius</hi> attempts, and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34632:113"/>
him to take his Revenge upon the General for the Affronts he had put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as he ſhould direct him. He magnifies the Man diſtemper'd in Mind through bodily Diſtempers, with flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glozing Speeches, puts him in mind of his being a Prince, a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Grand-child of <hi>Maſſiniſſa:</hi> That if <hi>Jugurth</hi> ſhould be taken or ſlain, the Kingdom of <hi>Numidia</hi> fell immediately to him by right of Inheritance; which would ſuddenly come to paſs, if he might once be ſent as Conſul to manage the War. By this means he perſwades the <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, the Souldiers, and Merchants, ſome by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, others upon hopes of ſudden Peace, to write to their Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in their Letters ſharply to inveigh againſt the dilatory Proceedings of <hi>Metellus,</hi> and at the laſt to deſire <hi>Marius</hi> for their General. And thus it came to paſs, that by the fair Suffrages of many Men the Conſulſhip was labour'd for in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Beſides it ſo happen'd, ſeaſonably for him at that time, that the Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curb'd by the <note n="*" place="margin">By which it was provided, that when the Nobility in the management of warlike Affairs had any ill ſucceſs, that the Commonalty ſhould have power to elect new Men.</note>
               <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Law, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty had Power to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34632:114"/>
advance new Men: allthings fell out luckily for <hi>Marius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="66">66. In the mean time <hi>Jugurth,</hi> after he had falſify'd his promiſe of ſubmiſſion, and renew'd the War, with great Induſtry makes vaſt preparations, uſes all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Levies an Army; thoſe Cities which had revolted from him he ſolicites with Rewards, or regains by Terror; fortifies his ſtrong Holds; repleniſhes his Stores with Ammunition and Warlike Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; entices the <hi>Roman</hi> Slaves to revolt, and thoſe that were in Gariſons he tempts with ready Money: Laſtly he leaves no ſtone unturn'd, nor ſuffers any Soul to reſt in quiet; but caſts about every way to procure diſturbance. At <hi>Vacca</hi> therefore, where <hi>Metellus,</hi> when <hi>Jugurth</hi> firſt began to treat of Peace, had plac'd a Garriſon, wearied with the Importunities of the King, and never truly alienated in their Affections from him, the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Town conſpire together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, (for the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to their uſual Cuſtom, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Numidians,</hi> naturally fluctuating
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34632:114"/>
and inconſtant, ſeditious, and deſpiſers of Harmonious Concord, were ſtill thirſting after Novelty, and Adverſaries to Peace and Tranquillity) and having laid their Plot ſure, agree upon the third Day, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be one of their moſt Solemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and ſtrictly obſerv'd over all <hi>Africa,</hi> and therefore gave them an opportunity to aſſemble without ſuſpicion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Sport and Paſtime. Thereupon when the time came, they invited to their Houſes the <hi>Centurions,</hi> Colonels and the Governor himſelf <hi>F. Turpilius:</hi> all thoſe they ſlew in the midſt of their Cups, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Turpilius:</hi> which done they fell upon the Souldiers, ſtragling up and down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Arms, being then oblig'd to no duty, by reaſon of the day. The ſame did all the Rabble, part inſtructed before hand by their Superiors, others out of their natural Affection to diſorders; to whom Tumult and Novelty, though they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtood the Cauſe nor Motives, were things pleaſing and delightful. The <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers ſurpriz'd thus of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, uncertain and doubtful what Courſe to take, fled in a pannick fear to the Caſtle belonging to the Town, where their Enſigns and Targets lay: but the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34632:115"/>
Garriſon of the Enemies, having ſhut the Gates before, prevented their Flight, and to add to their Misfortune, the Women and Children flung down Stones and ſuch other Materials as the place would afford, continually upon their Heads from the tops of the Houſes. Thus there was no avoiding the uncertain Miſchief, neither was it in the power of the ſtouteſt to make reſiſtance againſt the weakeſt: Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and Cowards, ſtrong and feeble fell all together, and many were ſlain. In the heat of this Maſſacre, while the <hi>Numidians</hi> were exerciſing their utmoſt fury, and all the Gates were ſhut, <hi>Turpilius</hi> made a clever eſcape untouch'd, whether it were through the Civility of his Hoſt, or upon a Compoſition of Ranſom, or by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we never could diſcover. This is only to be ſaid, that becauſe in ſuch a Calamity, he preferr'd an ignominious Life before an unblemiſh'd Reputation, he appear'd to be a wicked and deteſtable Coward.</p>
            <p n="68">68. When this fatal Butchery at <hi>Vacca</hi> reach'd <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Ears, penſive for a while, he retir'd from Company. But when his wrath and ſorrow once were
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34632:115"/>
interblended he haſtens withall expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to revenge the Outrage. To that purpoſe, he draws forth the Legion that winter'd with him, and as many of the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe as he could, juſt about Sun-ſet. The next day; about One in the Morning, he arriv'd at a certain Valley ſurrounded with little Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks: there he reſts his Souldiers tir'd with a long Nights march, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring to go any farther: but he gave 'em good words, told 'em that <hi>Vacca</hi> lay not above a mile off; that it was their duty to endure patiently the remainder of their Toyl, until they had fully reveng'd the Deaths of their Fellow-Citizens, the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt but moſt unfortunate of Men: and then largely lays before 'em the Temptations of Plunder. And having thus inſpir'd 'em with new Courage, he places his Horſe in Front, and cauſes his Foot to March in cloſe Order, and to hide their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p n="67">67. The <hi>Vaccenſians</hi> when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an Army marching toward 'em, at firſt believing (as indeed it was) that <hi>Metellus</hi> was at hand, ſhut up their Gates; but then again, finding no waſt committed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34632:116"/>
upon their Lands, and beholding the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Horſe that March'd in the Front, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſur'd it was <hi>Jugurth</hi> himſelf, they pour'd forth with loud Acclamations to meet him. But then, upon the Signal given, Horſe and Foot fell on pell mell; ſome put the rabble to the Sword; others flew to the Gates, while others ſeiz'd upon the Towers. Thus provok'd Fury and hopes of ſpoil prevail'd above their inſtant Laſſitude. For the <hi>Vaccenſians</hi> enjoy'd the pleaſure of their perfidiouſneſs not above two days: while their City, large and oppulent, becomes a Sacrifice to Plunder or Revenge. As for <hi>Turpilius,</hi> who was Governor of the Town, as is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, he being Try'd by a Council of War, and having little to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was by <hi>Metellus</hi> Condemn'd to be firſt well Scourg'd, and then to have his head ſtrook off: for he was no more then a <note n="*" place="margin">That is to ſay an <hi>Italian</hi> only. Otherwiſe he could not have been whipt by the <hi>Portian</hi> Law.</note> Citizen of <hi>Collatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">70. At the ſame time <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> by whoſe perſwaſions <hi>Jugurth</hi> began to incline to that ſubmiſſion, which he afterwards through
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34632:116"/>
fear abondon'd, being ſuſpected by the King, and he no leſs ſuſpicious of him, projected new diſturbances; to ſeek the Kings deſtruction by Treachery; Night and Day to tire his reſtleſs thoughts; and laſtly after he had try'd all ways, he draws into the ſame Conſpiracy one <hi>Nab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalſa,</hi> a Nobleman, vaſtly rich, and greatly belov'd in his Country; who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Kings abſence was wont to Command the Army, and manage all Affairs, when <hi>Jugurth</hi> was either weary, or intent upon more important buſineſs: which got him not only great Honour, but infinite Wealth. Thereupon, by an agreement among themſelves, a day is appointed for execution of the Treaſon. But how it was to be done was left to time and opportunity. After this agreement <hi>Nabdalſa</hi> returns to the Army which he had under his Charge, and lay near the Winter Quarters of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their waſting the Country without oppoſition. But he, being terrify'd with the Enormity of the Fact, and diſſwaded by his fears, and not meeting again according to appointment, <hi>Bomilcar</hi> wavering between the eager deſire he had to expedite his Treachery begun, and the dread of his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34632:117"/>
Aſſociates diſcovery, yet unwilling to quit his firſt deſign for new Contrivancies, by truſty Meſſengers ſends him a Letter, wherein he upbraids his negligence and irreſolution; calls the Gods to witneſs by whom he had ſworn; admoniſhes him to beware leſt <hi>Metellus</hi>'s Bribes did not turn to his perdition; tells him withal, that <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s deſtruction was at hand; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Queſtion was, whether he ſhould periſh by theirs or the Courage of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="71">71. When theſe Letters were brought, <hi>Nabdalſa</hi> by accident, being weari'd with hard exerciſe, was a Bed. So that after he had read the Contents, at firſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cares diſtracted his thoughts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, as is uſual with men diſturb'd in Mind, ſleep ſeizes him. There attended upon him at that time, a certain <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> that carefully lookt after all his buſineſs, highly careſs'd by him, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of all his Secrets, but the laſt. Who hearing that a Letter was brought to his Maſter, and believing it ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that concern'd him according to his uſual Cuſtom went into the Chamber; and as his Maſter ſoundly ſlept, he takes
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34632:117"/>
the Letter, that lay careleſly upon his Pillow, reads it, and underſtanding the Treachery, haſtens forthwith to the King. <hi>Nabdalſa,</hi> waking ſoon after, and firſt miſſing both the Letter and his Servant, then by his Guards underſtanding how things ſtood, immediately he poſted after the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, thinking to overtake him, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be labour in vain, away he goes to <hi>Jugurth,</hi> and in hopes to make up the breach, tells him, That what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have done, the perfidiouſneſs of his Servant had prevented; and with tears in his Eyes, by all the friendſhip he had for him, and by all the faithful ſervices he had done him, beſought him not to think him Guilty of ſo foul a piece of Treaſon.</p>
            <p n="72">72. To which the King, contrary to what he had in his heart, return'd a ſoft and mild Anſwer, That <hi>Bomilcar</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, whom he had diſcover'd to be Confederates in the Conſpiracy, having ſuffer'd according to their deſerts, he had qualify'd and ſubdu'd his Indignation, that no further trouble might ariſe from any farther ſcrutiny. But from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Jugurth</hi> ne'er enjoy'd a quiet minute
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34632:118"/>
day or night. All Perſons, Places, Times and Seaſons were ſuſpected by him. All the night long he ſculk'd from place to place, beneath the Majeſty of a Prince: in the day time ſtarting out of his ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he would lay hold of his Sword, and diſturb all that lay near him; ſo like to Madneſs were the fears that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyl'd his thoughts.</p>
            <p n="73">73. <hi>Metellus</hi> therefore when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Fugitives of <hi>Bomilcar</hi>'s death, and the Diſcovery of the Conſpiracy, makes all the ſpeedy preparations he could, as for a War but newly begun. And for <hi>Marius,</hi> dayly importuning him for his diſmiſſion, he diſcharg'd him, as not deeming a Perſon that bore him a Grudge, and otherwiſe diſtaſtful to him, would do him any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. At <hi>Rome</hi> alſo; the Commons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what the Letters had diſperſ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in reference to <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> entertain'd with equal violence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of both. The Generals Nobility, which before was an Honour to him, was now a diſgrace: and the meanneſs of the other's Parentage procur'd him favour. However the Partialities of the Factions were ſo moderate, as never to queſtion
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34632:118"/>
their Vertues or their Vices. Moreover, the Seditious Magiſtrates exaſperated the the Common People; in all their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they accuſe <hi>Metellus,</hi> as worthy of Death, but the Courage of <hi>Marius</hi> they magnify as far above his deſert. Laſtly the Rabble were ſo incens'd, that all the Handicraft Tradeſmen and Ploughmen, whoſe Eſtates and Credit lay all in their hands, leaving their Shops and Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry never omitted a public Meeting to cry up <hi>Marius,</hi> poſtponing the dayly ſupply of their own Indigences to his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus the Nobility being cow'd and diſmay'd, the Conſulſhip, after many tempeſtuous contentions, is decreed to an Upſtart. And after that, the queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the People by <hi>L. Manlius Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> whom they would have to carry on the War with <hi>Jugurth,</hi> in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they commanded <hi>Marius.</hi>

            <p n="74">74. At the ſame time, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> having loſt his friends, the moſt of which he had put to death himſelf, the reſt, part out of fear, had made their peace with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or were fled to King <hi>Bocchus,</hi> knowing that a War could not be carry'd on without Aſſiſtants, and deeming it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34632:119"/>
to hazzard the fidelity of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, after he had found his old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſo unfaithful, was variouſly toſs'd and tormented with unquiet thoughts: neither the Deſign, nor the Counſel, nor the ſight of any Perſon could pleaſe him: every day he alter'd his Commanders, and vary'd his Marches, ſometimes towards the Enemie, ſometimes into the Deſerts; Sometimes he lookt upon flight as his ſecureſt Refuge; and then again he had ſome glimmering hopes of ſucceſs: yet ſtill in doubt, which leſs to truſt, whither the Courage or Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his People. And thus which way ſoe'er he turn'd himſelf, Adverſity ſtill frown'd upon him. At length in the midſt of theſe uncertainties and diſaſtrous Reflections, <hi>Metellus</hi> ſhews himſelf with his Army. Preſently <hi>Jugurth</hi> marſhals his <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi> as the time would give him leave, and the fight begins. Where the King was preſent in Perſon, there for a while was ſome reſiſtance; all the reſt of his Army, upon the very firſt Charge were routed and put to flight; leaving their Enſigns, their Arms, and a conſiderable number of their fellows in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> For in all Battles the <hi>Numidians</hi> were
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34632:119"/>
more beholding for their ſafety to their Heels then to their Swords.</p>
            <p n="75">75. After the loſs of the Battle, <hi>Jugurth,</hi> now more then ever deſpairing of ſucceſs, with the Fugitives and part of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, betakes himſelf into the Deſert; and from thence to <note n="*" place="margin">Now utterly unknown, and the place of its Situation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.</note> 
               <hi>Thala,</hi> a large and ſtately Town, where moſt of his Treaſure, and all the coſtly Wardrobe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onging to his Children lay. Of which when <hi>Metellus</hi> had Intelligence, though between <hi>Thala</hi> and the River adjoyning to his Camp, he knew there was nothing but vaſt and ſandy Deſarts for Fifty miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet in hopes of putting an end to the War, if he could but make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of that Town, he reſolves to break through all the difficulties, and to overcome Nature her ſelf. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he orders all the Beaſts of Carriage to be laden with the Baggage, except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flour for ten days, which the Souldiers were to carry in their Snapſacks: he alſo makes great Proviſion of Leathern Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Casks for his Water: He picks up all the Cattle he can find in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34632:120"/>
Parts, and them he orders to be laden with an infinite number of wooden Veſſels, which they found in the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Cottages. Moreover he orders the Borderers that had ſurrendred themſelves after the flight of the King what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water he expected at their hands, and appoints 'em a day and place where they ſhould be ready: and then fills his own Veſſels from the River, which we have already mentioned: and thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with all things neceſſary, he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches directly for <hi>Thala.</hi> When he came to that place where the <hi>Numidians</hi> were Commanded to tarry for him, after he had pitch'd his Tents and fortify'd his Camp, ſuch violent ſhowers of Rain are reported to have fallen on a ſuddain from the Sky, that there was Water enough and to ſpare for the whole Army. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions alſo were plentiful beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in regard the <hi>Numidians,</hi> as is uſual while the awe of a new Conqueſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, had been extreamly double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Upon the Souldiers, alſo the Rain had wrought a Superſtitious effect, while the ſeeming Miracle gave new boldneſs to their Courage; believing that now the Immortal Gods took care of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34632:120"/>
and favour'd their Enterprize; and thus the next day, they arriv'd before <hi>Thala,</hi> contrary to <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s expectation. The Townſmen, who thought themſelves ſecure by reaſon of their inacceſſible Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, amaz'd to ſee themſelves ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſurpriz'd, were nevertheleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious to prepare for ſtout Reſiſtance, and with the ſame alacrity did ours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the Aſlault.</p>
            <p n="76">76. But <hi>Jugurth</hi> now believing there was nothing impoſſible to <hi>Metellus,</hi> as one againſt whoſe Induſtry no Arms or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, nor inequality of Ground would prevail, but had overcome even Nature her ſelf, with his Children, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Treaſure deſerted the Town, and fled away in the Night; nor did he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards tarry in any one place above one day or a Night at moſt. Nevertheleſs that he might not ſeem to abandon the Town, he pretended urgency of Affairs and new Deſigns, but indeed becauſe he was afraid of Treaſon, which he thought to prevent by a ſpeedy retiring himſelf: for that ſuch contrivances of Treachery were hatch'd by leaſure and opportunity. On the other ſide <hi>Metellus,</hi> when he ſaw
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34632:121"/>
the Townſmen reſolv'd to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that the Town was alſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortify'd as well by Nature as by Art, he entrenches his Army round about the Walls, and then places his <hi>Vines,</hi> and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in ſuch places as he thought moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Behind them he alſo raiſes Bulwarks, and upon them Towers to deſend the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Pioneers. On the other ſide, the Townſmen labour might and main to fruſtrate his Approaches, neither was any thing of Art or Induſtry omitted on either ſide. At length after much toyl, and ſeveral Combats and Onſets, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> forty days after they ſate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, became Maſters of the Town on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in regard the Fugitives had ſet Fire to the Plunder. For they, when they perceiv'd the Walls began to totter through the fury of the Battering Rams, and that their Affairs were in a deſperate Condition, carry'd all their Gold, Silver and other precious moveables into the Kings Houſe, where after they had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify'd their Sences with Wine and good Chear, they ſet Fire to the Houſe, and burnt themſelves and all that was in it, of their own accords inflicting upon themſelves the ſame puniſhment, which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34632:121"/>
they dreaded at the hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p n="77">77. But at the ſame time that <hi>Thala</hi> was taken, certain Meſſengers ſent from <hi>Leptis</hi> to <hi>Metellus,</hi> arriv'd at the Camp, beſeeching him to ſend 'em both a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and a Governor. That there was one <hi>Hamilcar</hi> among 'em, a Perſon of Noble Extraction, but Factious, who went about to raiſe diſturbances in the City, and ſollicited the People to revolt. Neither was the Power of the Magiſtrate, nor the Authority of the Law ſufficient to put a ſtop to his Proceedings: and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he made great haſte, the Safety of the City, and their Allegiance to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would be in great danger. For the People of <hi>Leptis</hi> at the firſt beginning of the <hi>Jugurthine</hi> War, had ſent to <hi>Beſtia</hi> the Conſul, and afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting Amity and a mutual League. Which after they had obtain'd, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd juſt and faithful, and whatever they were commanded by <hi>Beſtia, Albinus</hi> or <hi>Metellus</hi> to do, they diligently and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſly perform'd; and for that reaſon the General readily condeſcended to their Deſires: ſending 'em a Garriſon of ſour
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34632:122"/>
               <hi>Ligurian</hi> Cohorts, and <hi>C. Annius</hi> for their Governor.</p>
            <p n="78">78. This Town was built by the <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who being forc'd to abandon their Native Country by reaſon of Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, came by Sea into thoſe Parts; ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between two vaſt Banks of Sand, and derives its Name from the Nature of the Place. For upon the utmoſt Limits of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> two Bays extend themſelves not far diſtant one from another; unequal in Bigneſs, but in Nature both alike. The Parts next the Land are very deep; the other Parts, as the Wind lies, ſometimes deep, ſometimes ſhallow; for when the Sea runs high, and the Wind blows hard, the Billows drive the Sand and Ouze, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the maſſy, looſe  rocky ſtones before 'em: and thus the whole Surface of the Bottom changes with the violence of the Wind and Tide: and therefore are they call'd <hi>Syrtes,</hi> from drawing the Stones and Sands from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Language of the City is now quite alter'd by their vicinity to the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians.</hi> The moſt of their Laws and Religious Ceremonies are <hi>Sidonian;</hi> the more eaſily retain'd, becauſe they live
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34632:122"/>
remote from the King's Court. Beſides that beween them and the inhabited Parts of <hi>Numidia,</hi> lie vaſt and unfrequented De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts.</p>
            <p n="79">79. And now ſince the Affairs of <hi>Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> have drawn us into theſe Parts, it will not be amiſs to rehearſe an Action of two <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Brethren, of which the Place it ſelf puts me in mind; there being few that more deſerve the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Hiſtory. At what time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were Maſters of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of <hi>Africa,</hi> the People of <hi>Cyrene</hi> likewiſe were both powerful and opulent. The Countrey between is ſandy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together level, not ſo much as a River or Mountain to aſcertain the Limits of their Territories; which was the occaſion of an outragious and laſting War between 'em. After many Armies defeated, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sea-Engagements with great Loſs on both ſides, when they had almoſt ruin'd one another, fearing at length, both Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Vanquiſh'd, their becoming a Prey to a Third Enemy, they make a Truce, and then an Agreement, That upon ſuch a certain day they would ſend their Ambaſſadors from home, and whereſoever thoſe Ambaſſadors met, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34632:123"/>
Place ſhould be the certain Bounds of both their Dominions. To this purpoſe, two Brothers being ſent from <hi>Carthage,</hi> both call'd by the Name of <hi>Philaeni,</hi> they made all the ſpeed they could; the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> travell'd flowly: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were through negligence, or by chance, I am not able to ſay. Yet in thoſe Places a contrary Wind is no leſs troubleſom to a Traveller then at Sea. For when Tempeſtuous Guſts blow hard, and bruſh thoſe level Sands, naked of all manner of Coverture, the Duſt  Pebbles ſo terribly moleſt the Sight and Faces of Travellers, that not daring to open their Eyes, they are no longer able to proceed in their Journey. Howere it were, the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> finding they had loyter'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and fearing Capital Puniſhment for their Negligence, at their Return, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and accus'd 'em of ſetting forward from home beford their Time; made a hideous Buſtle, ann reſolv'd whatere it coſt 'em, not to reture home Loſers. Whereupon, when thy <hi>Carthaginians</hi> proffer'd to accept of ane Condition that was but reaſonable, thr <hi>Greeks</hi> made this Propoſal, That eithes the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſhould ſuffer themſelve
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34632:123"/>
to be bury'd alive in that Place which they claim'd for the Limits of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or elſe upon the ſame Condition, That they would travel forward as far as they thought fit. Whereupon the <hi>Philaeni,</hi> accepting the Propoſal, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd themſelves and their Lives for the Good of the Commonwealth, and were bury'd alive without more ado. In remembrance of which pious Act, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> erected Altars, which they conſecrated to the Memories of the Two Brethren, beſides other Honours which were decreed 'em at home. Now I return to the Matter in hand.</p>
            <p n="80">80. <hi>Jugurth,</hi> after the Loſs of <hi>Thala,</hi> thought nothing ſufficiently ſecure againſt the Conduct of <hi>Metellus;</hi> and therefore croſſing vaſt Deſarts, with a ſmall Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, at length he comes to the <hi>Getulians,</hi> a fierce and barbarous ſort of People, and at that time unacquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi> Name. Of theſe, he muſters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a vaſt Multitude, and by degrees accuſtoms 'em to keep their Ranks, to follow their Enſigns, to obey Commands, and ſeveral other Points of Military Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Moreover, by great Gifts and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34632:124"/>
larger Promiſes he procutes the Favour of ſuch as had the Ear of King <hi>Bocchus,</hi> and by their Aſſiſtance addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King, he perſwades him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a War againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which <hi>Bocchus</hi> was the more eaſily inclin'd to do, in regard that at the beginning of the <hi>Jugurthine</hi> War he had ſent his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to deſire a League and Friendſhip with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture, moſt advantageous at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that War, ſome few obſtructed, blinded with Covetouſneſs, and according to their uſual Cuſtom, putting all things to Sale, both honeſt and diſhoneſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Jugurth</hi> but a little before had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the Daughter of <hi>Bocchus.</hi> But that ſame Tye of Relation is little valu'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Numidians;</hi> becauſe they marry ſeveral Wives, ſome Ten, and others more, according to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Princes conſequently a far greater Number: So that being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with variety, the King advances none to his Society particularly, but looks on all as equally vile, and equally inferior.</p>
            <p n="81">
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:34632:124"/>
81. Therefore at the Rendezvouz by both appointed, both Armies meet; and there both Princes giving and taking mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Oaths of Fidelity and Conſtancy, <hi>Jugurth</hi> in a ſet Speech, the more to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate <hi>Bocchus,</hi> tells him, That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were unjuſt, immenſely covetous, the common Enemies of all Mankind; That they would make the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſerve for an occaſion of War with <hi>Bocchus</hi> as with him, and other Nations, Ambition of Rule; as having a perfect Antipathy againſt Monarchs. That at preſent Himſelf; a little before the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> and King <hi>Perſeus</hi> were the Objects of their Fury; and that hereafter the Power and Opulency of any Prince would be a ſufficient Provocation for the <hi>Romans</hi> to quarrel with him. This ſaid, away they bend their March for <hi>Cirta,</hi> for that <hi>Metellus</hi> there had ſtow'd his Booty, Captives and his Baggage. Thence <hi>Jugurth</hi> conſider'd, That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the taking of the Place would be worth his while; or if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> attempted to relieve it, he ſhould have the opportunity to fight 'em. For it was his Policy, to make haſte; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>Bocchus</hi> beyond the Hopes of Peace,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34632:125"/>
leſt by delay his Mind might vary, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any Conditions rather then enter into a War.</p>
            <p n="82">82. But the General ſo ſoon as he had Intelligence that there was a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings, would not raſhly, not upon every ſlight occaſion proffer Battel, as he was wont to do after he had overthrown <hi>Jugurth;</hi> but having fortify'd his Camp not far from <hi>Cirta,</hi> there he waits the coming of the Kings, believing it his wiſer courſe to fight upon Advantage, after he had made Trial of the Courage of the <hi>Moors,</hi> as being an Enemy with which he had never yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. In the mean time he had Advice by Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Province of <hi>Numidia</hi> was given to <hi>Marius:</hi> for he had heard before that he was elected <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul.</hi> The News of which ſo ſtrangely mov'd him beyond all meaſure, and put him ſo beſide himſelf, that he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refrain from Tears, nor moderate his Tongue: a Man ſo excellent and ſo accompliſh'd in all other things, yet not able to brook his inward Vexations. Which ſome attributed to his Pride, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Generoſity of his Naturet
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34632:125"/>
that could not ſuffer an Affront: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to his Indignation, that the Victory now as good as won, ſhould be wreſted out of his Hands. But we are ſatisfy'd, that <hi>Marius</hi>'s Honour more tormented him, then the Injury done to himſelf, and that he would not have taken it ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently, had the Province when taken from him, been beſtow'd upon any other then <hi>Marius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="83">83. <hi>Metellus</hi> therefore ſick of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and becauſe he deem'd it a folly for him to procure Triumphs for another at the haxard of his own Life, ſends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to <hi>Bocchus,</hi> to caution him, how he quarrell'd with the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> without any provocation: That now he had a fair Opportunity to obtain the League and Alliance which he had before deſir'd, and which would be far more advantageous to him then War; That though he might rely upon his great Power, yet 'twas not the ſafeſt way to hazard Certainties for Uncertainties; That a War was eaſily begun, but not ſo ſoon ended; That the Beginning and Concluſion of it were not at the diſpoſal of the ſame Perſon, That any Coward
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34632:126"/>
might begin a War, but the End of it was at the pleaſure of the Victor only; and therefore that he ſhould conſult his own, and the welfare of his Kingdom, and not adventure his flouriſhing Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſame Bottom with <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. To which the King in mild and gentle Terms return'd for Anſwer, That Peace was his deſire, only he pity'd the miſerable Condition of <hi>Jugurth;</hi> ſo that if he might be included in the Articles, all things would be ſoon concluded. Again the General in Anſwer to <hi>Bocchus</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſends other Commiſſioners; ſome things he approv'd, others he refus'd; and thus by ſending to and fro, Time waſted, and the War was ſpun out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Blow ſtruck, to the great ſatisfaction of <hi>Metellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="84">84. But <hi>Marius,</hi> as I ſaid before, being made <hi>Conſul</hi> by the vehemency &amp; tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Affection of the Commonalty, ſo ſoon as the People had commanded him to undertake the Province of <hi>Numidia,</hi> if before he hated the Nobility, now he began to ſhew himſelf much more fierce and domineering; ſometimes affronting particular Perſons, ſometimes all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34632:126"/>
boaſting that he had carry'd the Conſulſhip from <hi>Them,</hi> as the Spoyls of a Conquer'd Enemy; caſting forth many other Expreſſions, great of himſelf, but full of bitter Sarcaſms in deriſion of their Honour. In the mean time his chiefeſt Care was to make ample proviſions of all things needful for the War, to require a Re-inforcement of the Legions; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Ayd of all the Neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and People in Alliance with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> to cull out of <hi>Latium</hi> all the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſons he could pick, moſt known to himſelf in particular Services, few by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and by fair Words and Promiſes to procure all the old Souldiers that had been diſcharg'd upon the ſcore of Age and long Service, to reſume their Arms, and accompany him in the Expedition. Nor durſt the <hi>Senate,</hi> though they mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated his Demeanor, contradict him in any thing; but joyfully decreed him all Supplies, whatever he demanded, in hopes that the Commonalty when they came go be preſs'd, would refuſe to ſerve, and ſo that <hi>Marius</hi> would loſe the Fruits of the War, or the Affections of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. But it fell out quite otherwiſe. For ſuch an eager deſire of going with <hi>Marius,</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:34632:127"/>
had poſſeſs'd the greateſt part, while eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man believ'd he ſhould return enrich'd with Plunder; and victorious home, that theſe Conſiderations and Expectancies dragg'd them headlong after the <hi>Conſul;</hi> beſides that, <hi>Marius</hi> did not a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their Courages with a ſet Speech. For after all his Demands were decreed him according to his hearts deſire, and he had compleated his Muſters, as well to curry Favour with the Commons, as to fret and gall the Nobility, he ſummon'd an Aſſembly of the People, where he thus deliver'd himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am well aſſur'd, moſt worthy <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that moſt men do not obſerve the ſame Method in procuring Places of higheſt Truſt at your hands; or manage 'em after the ſame manner when ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. At firſt, they are induſtrious, humble and moderate; then waſte their days in Sloth and Pride; but I am of vanother humour. For by how much the whole Commonwealth is of greater value then a Conſulſhip, or Praetorſhip, with ſo much the greater Care ought the one to be govern'd, then the other eagerly ſu'd for. Nor am I ignorant
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34632:127"/>
how great a burden I bear upon my Shoulders through your obliging favour. To provide for War, to be frugal of the public Treaſury, to compel thoſe to bear Arms, whom you are unwilling to offend, to have an Eye upon all things both at home and abroad; and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all theſe duties among ſo many envious, thwarting, and factious Spirits, is a task, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> far more difficult, then moſt men are aware of. Nevertheleſs if others miſcarry or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any foul Miſdemeanor, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their Deſcent, the famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of their Anceſtors, the Wealth of their Kindred and Relations, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Tenants and Followers, all theſe things are their Security and Protection, while my Relyance is only upon my ſelf: ſo that of neceſſity I muſt ſupport my ſelf by my Valour and my Innocency; ſince all other Dependances of mine are weak and inconſiderable: And this I likewiſe underſtand, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> that the Eyes of all Men are fix'd upon me; that good and juſt Men love me; as one whoſe Actions have tended to the good of the Public benefit; only the Nobility ly at lurch to procure my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34632:128"/>
For which reaſon it behoves me the more induſtriouſly to labour, that you be not deceiv'd, and that They may be diſappointed. From my Childhood until now, I have hitherto ſo liv'd, as to be inur'd to all ſorts of Hardſhip and all manner of dangers. What before your favours beſtow'd, I acted <hi>gratis,</hi> 'tis not my deſign, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> now to forego, as having receiv'd my vvages. 'Tis a difficult Thing for ſuch Men to tempt their paſſions in great Authority, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to advance Ambitious ends diſſembl'd Honeſty: but in Me, that have always lead my Life in vertuous Exerciſes, to do good is now by Cuſtom become a ſecond Nature. You have commanded me to wage War with <hi>Jugurth,</hi> a thing which the Nobility took moſt hainouſly. I beſeech you to conſider with your ſelves, whether you think it proper to alter your Reſolutions, or to ſend ſome one cull'd out from this ſame Croud of Nobility, a Perſon of ancient Deſcent; a Perſon whoſe Family is honour'd with many Statues, but himſelf a Man of no Conduct or Experience; ſuch a one as being ignorant what he has to do in ſuch a weighty undertaking, ſhall

tremble, make a buſtle, and at length chuſe out ſome paltry Confident, to be his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor and Adviſer. For ſo it generally falls out, that He whom you have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to Command, is to ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to command himſelf. Yet I could tell you of ſome Men, moſt worthy <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who after they have been choſen Conſuls, have then began to ſtudy the Actions of their Anceſtors, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Precepts of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> Prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People. For the knowledge of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in time ſucceeds Election, but in reality and practice ought to precede it. Compare me now, moſt worthy <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> an Upſtart of Yeſterday, with their preſumptuous Pride. What they are wont to hear and read, part of theſe things my ſelf has ſeen, and others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally perform'd: what they have learnt from their Books, the ſame have I by Military duty. They contemn my ſuddain Riſe; and I their Cowardice. They upbraid me with my Fortune, I them, with their Enormities. Though I believe one Nature common to us all, Yet I eſteem the ſtouteſt to be ſtill moſt Generous and Noble. So that if the Queſtion could be put to the Anceſtors of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34632:129"/>
                  <hi>Albinus,</hi> or <hi>Beſtia,</hi> which they would have rather choſen for their Off-spring me or them, what think ye would be their Anſwer, but that they deſir'd the beſt of Children? Therefore while they debaſe Me, they throw the ſame Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Anceſtors; who rais'd their Original Nobility, like my ſelf, by their Vertues. They envy my Honour; let 'em alſo envy my Innocency, the Hardſhip and the Dangers I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. But Men corrupted with Pride, ſo lead their Lives, as if they diſdain'd your Honours; but ſue for 'em, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that had always liv'd uprightly and juſtly. Certainly they are miſtak'n, who expect at the ſame time to enjoy two ſuch contrary ſatisfactions, the delights and pleaſures of ſloathful Eaſe, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Vertue. And when they make Speeches either to your ſelves or in the Senate, ſpend the greateſt part of their Time in magnifying their Anceſtors, believing themſelves the more famous for repeating their loud Atchievements; whereas quite the contrary, the more Illuſtrious was their Renown, the more ſordid and degenerate are they. For to ſay truth, the Renown of Anceſtors is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34632:129"/>
a Light that ſhines upon their Poſterity, and ſuffers not their Evil deeds to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd in Darkneſs. This is a thing I want, moſt worthy <hi>Romans;</hi> but that which is more noble, I can ſpeak of my own Actions to my ſelf. Now conſider, how unjuſt they are. What they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to themſelves from the Vertue of others, they will not allow me for the ſake of my own: becauſe forſooth I have no Statues, becauſe my Nobility is but of Yeſterday; which certainly is more worthy for me to have won, then for them to have corrupted. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that were they now to anſwer me, they have Eloquence enough, and would be flouriſhing with their lofty ſtrains and high flying Language. But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how in all places, for this your favour conferr'd upon me, they wound and tear both mine and your Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could not refrain ſpeaking my mind; leaſt any one ſhould traduce my Modeſty as an effect of Guilt. Though in my Opinion, theſe Orations can do me no prejudice. For if true, they muſt ſpeak well of me; if falſe, my Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners evince the contrary. But becauſe your Conſultations and Decrees are accus'd,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34632:130"/>
becauſe you have vouchſaf'd me the higheſt Honour, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of all our preſent Affairs; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ye conſider over and over again, whether you have any cauſe to repent. 'Tis true, I cannot, as a ſecurity and pledge for my worth, produce the Statues, or Records of the Triumphs and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of my Anceſtors: but if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, I can ſhew ye Spears, Enſigns <note n="*" place="margin">The reward of a Horſeman, that diſmounted his Adverſary.</note> Gold Chains, and other ſuch like Military guerdons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeveral Scars in my Body. Theſe are my Statues, this is my Nobility, not left, but which I have purchas'd by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, with many hardſhips and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. My words perhaps are not ſo Elaborately ſtudied: That I value not. Vertue ſufficiently diſplays it ſelf; but words want artifice to fucus over vile and ſhameful Actions. Neither did I ever learn <hi>Greek.</hi> For I had no deſire to learn a Language that ſo little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to reform the Vices of thoſe that had it ſo readily at their Tongues end. But I am learned in thoſe things that are much more beneficial to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34632:130"/>
I know how to fight an Enemy, to take Towns, to fear nothing but Infamy; to endure cold and heat; to lie upon the Ground; and at the ſame time to undergo both want and labour. This Learning alſo I ſhall teach the Souldiers: neither ſhall I harraſs them with hard and continual Duty, and yet indulge my Self: neither will I purchaſe my Honour by their Labour. This is a profitable and civil Government. Whereas to live in eaſe, and wallow in Effeminacy thy ſelf, and terrify thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with continual rigor, this is to play the Tyrant not the General. By theſe Actions and ſuch as theſe, your Anceſtors immortalliz'd both themſelves and the Commonwealth. On which the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity relying, though far different in their Manners, deſpiſe Us, with emulation tracing their renowned ſteps; and claim from you all Honours as their due and not by merit: But their lofty Lordſhips are very much out of the way. Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors left 'em all things that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Power, Wealth, Statues, Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and undying Memories, but they did not leave 'em Vertue, neither could they. That, is a gift neither to be given
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34632:131"/>
or receiv'd. They ſay I am a Slovenly fellow, and one that wants Breeding; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know not how to inſtruct a Bill of Fare; maintain no Buffoons and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies about me, nor give more Money for a Cook then I do for a Bavly: all which I muſt confeſs, moſt worthy <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> For I have been taught by my Father and other venerable Perſons that nicity and ſpruceneſs belong to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but that toyl and labour better become Manhood: and that all Heroic and generous Spirits, ought to value Fame above Wealth, and take a greater pride in their Arms then in their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Furniture. Therefore let 'em al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow their Pleaſures and Delights; let 'em keep their Miſſes, let 'em Drink and Revel; as they ſpent their Youth, ſo let 'em employ their old Age in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets and Riot, devoted to their Bellies; and the moſt ſhameful part of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; let 'em leave Sweat and Duſt, Induſtry and Toyl to Us, that prefer thoſe hardſhips far before the effeminacy of Junketting. But that they will not do: For when unworthy Bruits as they are, they have diſhonour'd themſelves, with all manner of Debauchery, nothing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34632:131"/>
will ſatisfy 'em but the Rewards of the Brave and Vertuous. So that Luxury and Sloth, the worſt of evils never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Adorers, which is a great piece of Injuſtice, but frequently prove baneful to the Commonwealth. Now then having as far as my own Modeſty would permit me, though not in ſo many words as the heinouſneſs of their abuſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, made anſwer to the objections of the Nobility; give me leave to ſpeak ſomewhat concerning the State of the Common-wealth. In the firſt place, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> hope well of <hi>Numidia;</hi> You have now remov'd all thoſe things which hitherto protected <hi>Jugurth,</hi> Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, ill Conduct and Pride. Then you have an Army there that underſtands the Country; but however more Stout then Fortunate. For the greateſt part of 'em have been very much harraſs'd through the Covetuouſneſs and Raſhneſs of their Captains. And therefore all you that are arriv'd at Souldiers Age, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with me, take the Common-wealth into your own hands, and let no Man be diſcourag'd at the Calamity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or the fooliſh Pride of preceeding Generals. I ſhall be as well your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34632:132"/>
in danger, as your Counſellor in all your Marches and Battels, and take the ſame care of you as of my ſelf. Nay, by the Aſſiſtance of the Gods, I make no queſtion, but all things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ripe for us to ſhare, Victory, Booty, Honour: which though they were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or remotely diſtant from our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; yet it behov'd all good Men to ſuccour the Commonwealth. For never Sloth rais'd any Man to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: neither did ever any Parent wiſh, that his Children might live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, only that they might live a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and honeſt Life. I would ſay more, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> were it in the Power of words to inſpire the Timerous with Valour; for to the ſtrenuous, I think I have already ſaid enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="86">86. This Oration thus Concluded, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People all in fury and mad to be at work, with all imaginable ſpeed he puts his Proviſion, Money and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries aboard, and with theſe Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſends away <hi>Aulus Manlius</hi> before. In the mean time he falls to liſting Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, not according to the antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, out of the ſeveral Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34632:132"/>
of the People, but only Volunteers, and ſuch as paid neither Scot nor Lot to the Commonwealth. Which way of proceeding, ſome imputed to the want of able Souldiers, others to the Ambition of the Conſul, becauſe he was cry'd up, and advanc'd by that ſort of People: for to a Man that aſpires to Power and Command, the more indigent are ſtill the fitteſt Inſtruments upon ſeveral occaſions; in regard they have nothing to care for of their own, and therefore look upon all things to be juſt and honeſt, by which there is any thing to be got. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> therefore, putting to Sea, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a larger Number then was Decreed him, landed in a few days at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica.</hi> The Army is deliver'd over into his hands by <hi>P. Rutilius</hi> the Legate. For <hi>Metellus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the ſight of <hi>Marius,</hi> that he might not ſee thoſe things which he could not endure to hear.</p>
            <p n="87">87. But the <hi>Conſul</hi> having recruited the Legions and auxiliary Cohorts, marches into a fruitful Country, where he might be ſure to find Booty enough. There he gave all the Pillage to the Souldiers. This done, he takes in all the Caſtles and Towns that were but ſlightly fortify'd either by
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34632:133"/>
Art or Nature, and leaſt able to make defence, and has ſeveral ſlight Skirmiſhes with the Enemy, ſome in one place, ſome in another: and all the while he order'd the raw Souldiers to ſtand and look on; to behold the Routed kill'd or taken; and thereby taught 'em how the moſt Valiant were ſtill in moſt Safety; That the Sword was the only Protection of their Country, their Liberties, their Wives and Children: and how Honour, not Riches, was the nobleſt Aim. Thus in a ſhort time both Raw and Veteranes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all one, and the Courage of all was equally alike. But the Two Kings, when they underſtood of <hi>Marius</hi>'s arrival, retir'd ſeveral ways into the Faſtneſſes of the Country. This was <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Deſign, in hopes that the <hi>Romans</hi> might be ſurpriz'd ſo ſoon as they thought themſelves a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more ſecure. For that the <hi>Romans,</hi> like moſt other People, grew careleſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in their Guards, when once their Fears were over.</p>
            <p n="88">88. In the mean time <hi>Metellus</hi> arriving at <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> contrary to his Expectations, was joyfully receiv'd: and ſo ſoon as once their Paſſion was over, equally belov'd as
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34632:133"/>
well by the People as by the Senate. But <hi>Marius</hi> indefatigably and with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prudence minded both his own Buſineſs, and the Motions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: he was ſtill conſidering what was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, what was prejudicial to both: he had his Spies continually abroad to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Marches of the Kings; thereby to prevent their Deſigns and Ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; ſuffering no remiſneſs in his own, nor any ſecurity in the Army of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. By which means he often met in his Marches with the <hi>Getulians</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> ravaging the Territories of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whom he aſſoon defeated, and not far from <hi>Cirta,</hi> forc'd the King himſelf to leave his Arms behind him. Which being only brave Exploits, but no way conducing to the Concluſion of the War, he determin'd to beſiege all ſuch Towns as either thro' the ſtrength of the Garriſon, or the ſituation of the Place were of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Enemy, and prejudicial to the <hi>Romans.</hi> By which means <hi>Jugurth</hi> muſt be deſpoyled of all his Garriſons if he lay ſtill, or elſe muſt come to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. For <hi>Bocchus</hi> had often ſent him word that he was for his part deſirous of a League and Friendſhip with the <hi>Romans;</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:34632:134"/>
and that he ſhould not need to fear any thing of Hoſtility at his hands. But whether he diſſembled in this particular, to the end his unexpected Onſet might give the greater Blow, or whether out of natural inſtability of Mind, it were his Cuſtom to make frequent Exchanges of War and Peace, could never be certainly known.</p>
            <p n="89">89. The <hi>Conſul</hi> however, according to his Determination, viſits all the Towns and ſtrong Holds: ſome he takes by force, ſome through fear ſurrender; and others upon the Offers of large Rewards ſet open their Gates. At firſt he dealt with thoſe that were leſs conſiderable, hoping that <hi>Jugurth,</hi> coming to the Reſcue of his Subjects, would give him the opportunity of a Battel. But underſtanding that he was gone a great way off, and buſily intent upon other Affairs, he thought it time to beſtir himſelf in greater and more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Enterprizes. On the other ſide of the Country, beyond ſeveral wide and ſpacious Deſarts, lay a large and ſtrong Town by name <note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>Capi,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not far from the Bay call'd <hi>Golfo di Capes.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Capſa;</hi> Of which the <hi>Libyan Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> is ſaid to have been the Founder. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34632:134"/>
enjoy'd great Privileges under <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi> free from Taxes, and therefore moſt faithful to him: being not only guarded by their Walls and a ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, well furniſh'd with all ſort of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ammunition; but much more by the difficult ſituation of the Place. For excepting thoſe Fields and Paſtures that lay round about the Town, all the Country round about lay barren, deſart, and unmanur'd, wanting Water, and much infeſted with Serpents; whoſe Fury, like that of all other Creatures, is the more exaſperated through ſcarcity of Food; beſides that, the pernicious Nature of thoſe Serpents is by nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked then by Drought. <hi>Marius</hi> was inflam'd with an eager deſire to take this Town, as well for the Service of the War, as for the Difficulty of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: beſides that <hi>Metellus,</hi> highly to his Honour, had won the City of <hi>Thala,</hi> not much unlike this Place, both for Strength and Situation; only that not far from the Walls of <hi>Thala</hi> there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Springs: They of <hi>Capſa</hi> had but only one Well of Fountain-Water; all the Out-parts ſupply'd themſelves as the Rain happen'd to fall. Which both there, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34632:135"/>
in all <hi>Africa,</hi> that lies remote from the Sea, and more uncultivated, is the more eaſily endur'd, for that the <hi>Numidians</hi> for the moſt part feed upon Milk and the Fleſh of wild Beaſts, wanting neither Salt, nor any other Sawces to whet their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Their Diet only ſerv'd 'em to prevent Hunger and Thirſt, not for Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor yet to pleaſe their Palats.</p>
            <p n="90">90. The <hi>Conſul</hi> therefore having made a full Enquiry into every thing, relying certainly upon the Favour of the Gods; (for humane Wiſdom could never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt ſo many Difficulties; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there being but ſmall ſtore of Corn in thoſe parts, in regard the <hi>Numidians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light more in Paſturage then Tillage, and what they had upon the Ground, by the King's Order was ſecur'd in their ſtrong Holds; beſides that, the Fields were at that ſeaſon parch'd up, without any Crop at all, for it was toward the latter end of Summer) however he makes ſufficient Proviſion out of that Plenty which he had; ordering the Auxiliary Horſe to drive before 'em all the Cattel, which they had made Booty of upon their laſt Incurſions. <hi>A. Manlius</hi> the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, he commands to march with the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34632:135"/>
Light-Armed Cohorts to <hi>Laris,</hi> where he had ſecur'd his Money for the Souldiers Pay, and his Proviſions, giving out that he would march that way himſelf within a few days, and meet him there. And thus concealing his Deſign, he ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, directly for the River <hi>Tana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="91">91. Upon his March, he made an equal diſtribution of his Cattel among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſo much to the Foot, and ſo much to the Horſe: of the Hides he caus'd Bottles or Water-Bags to be made. This he did, no man knowing his Deſign, to prevent the waſte of Corn, which was to ſtand him afterwards in ſtead. Upon the ſixth day, by that time he came to the River, he had an infinite number of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Bags ready made. There pitching his Tents, and ſlightly fortifying his Camp, he order'd his Souldiers to their Repaſt, and commands 'em to be ready to march ſo ſoon as the Sun began to ſet, leaving all their Baggage behind, only loading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Beaſts of Carriage with Water. Then at his time appointed he ſets forward, and having march'd all Night, he makes a Halt all the next day. Thus he did the ſecond Night; and the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34632:136"/>
third Night, long before Day-Break, he came to a Place full of Hillocks, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two Miles diſtant from the Town; where, as privately as he could, he lay cloſe with all his Army. But in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the <hi>Numidians,</hi> leaſt dreaming of an Enemy, began to ſtir abroad about their Occaſions, he commands all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and the ſwifteſt of his Foot to fly to the Town, and ſeize the Gates. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he himſelf follow'd, ſtrictly commanding the Souldiers to refrain from Pillage. Which when the Townſmen perceiv'd, their dangerous Condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Conſternation, Calamity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for, and beſides all this, a great part of the Inhabitants without the walls, in the power of the Enemy, conſtrain'd 'em to a ſpeedy Surrender. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Town was laid in Aſhes,  the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian</hi> Youth were put to the Sword; all others ſold, and the Booty divided among the Souldiers. Which ſevere Act of the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s, againſt the Law of Arms, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Avarice, nor his Cruelty urg'd him to commit. But becauſe ſo ſtrong a Place that lay ſo neceſſary and convenient for <hi>Jugurth,</hi> was no leſs difficult of Acceſs to the <hi>Romans:</hi> the People fickle and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34632:136"/>
neither to be <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urb'd by Fear, nor kept in Obedience by mild Uſage.</p>
            <p n="92">92. <hi>Marius</hi> having thus perform'd an Exploit ſo conſiderable without any loſs of his own Men, as he was great, and in high Repute before, ſo was he now ten times greater, and more famous then ever. Not only what he acted with Prudence and Foreſight, but whatever prov'd by Fortune ſucceſsful, was all aſcrib'd to his Vertue and Conduct. The Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gentle Command, and enrich'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, extoll'd him to the Skies: the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> dreaded him as if more then Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: in a word, both <hi>Allies</hi> and <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> believ'd, that either he was inſpir'd with a Divine Foreſight, or elſe, that he acted altogether by the immediate Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Gods. The <hi>Conſul</hi> therefore upon this Succeſs, haſtens to ſeveral other Towns; of which, ſome he takes after a ſmall Reſiſtance of the <hi>Numidians:</hi> others he finds deſerted by the Inhabitants, dreading the ſad Fate of the <hi>Capſenſians,</hi> all which he lays in Aſhes: nothing but Slaughter and Lamentation over the whole Country. Thus having made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of ſeveral Places, and moſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:34632:137"/>
without the Loſs of my <hi>Roman</hi> Blood, he undertakes another Enterprize, not ſo toilſom as that of <hi>Capſa,</hi> yet no leſs diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. Not far from the River <hi>Mulucha,</hi> which ſeparates the two Kingdoms of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> and <hi>Bocchus,</hi> ſtands a Rocky Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, of a prodigious height, in the midſt of a large Plain, upon the Top of which, where there was Space enough, ſtood an indifferent Caſtle; to which there was but one, and that a very narrow Aſcent. For every way elſe it was by Nature ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly ſteep, as if it had been the Labour of Art and Induſtry. Which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, becauſe it was one of the Places where the King's Treaſure lay, <hi>Marius</hi> reſolves to win, whatever it coſt him. But here his Fortune befriended him above his Conduct: For the Caſtle was furniſht with a ſtrong Garriſon, and all manner of warlike Ammunition and Proviſions, a Fountain of Water, but no way aſſailable by the help either of Bulwarks or Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and as it were, ſtanding in defiance of all ſorts of Engins whatever: beſides, the Paſſage to it was narrow and ſteep on both ſides. The <hi>Vines</hi> by which we make our Approaches, were brought and ſet up with vaſt Labour and Danger; for no
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:34632:137"/>
ſooner were they rais'd to ſomething of perfection, but they were preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd with Fire and Stones. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers could neither ſtand to their Labour, by reaſon of the ſteepneſs of the Place; nor work ſecure under the covertures; they that were moſt forward and couragious, were ſlain or wounded, others were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd and diſcourag'd.</p>
            <p n="93">93. <hi>Marius</hi> therefore after the Toyl and Labour of many days conſum'd in vain, perplex'd and penſive, began to conſider whether he ſhould draw off, or wait a favourable opportunity, ſince his Fortune had been hitherto ſo proſperous. Which while he was pondering for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days and Nights together, chaf'd and fuming in his Mind, by chance a certain <hi>Ligurian</hi> common Souldier in the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Cohorts, going out of the Camp to fetch water, not far from that ſide of the Caſtle which was oppoſite to that part where the Aſſaults and Defences were made, ſpy'd ſeveral Periwinkles creeping among the Rocks. Of which when he had taſted one or two, deſirous to have more, he was got up by degrees, ere he knew where he was, to the top of the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34632:138"/>
Rock; where obſerving nothing but Silence and Solitude, after the cuſtom of humane Curioſity, deſirous to ſee what he never had ſeen before, he ſtands and liſtens. By chance there grew in the ſame place a Holm-Tree, which had made its way through the Stones, ſtooping forward at firſt, then winding back, and ſhooting up to a conſiderable heighth, as it is the Nature of all Vegetables. By the help of whoſe Boughs, and the Stones jutting out from the Wall, the <hi>Ligurian</hi> clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd ſo high, that he diſcover'd the whole Platform of the Caſtle, and perceiv'd how the Defendants were all buſily employ'd where the Aſſailants forc'd 'em to make Reſiſtance. After he had thus taken a ſufficient view of all things that he thought requiſite, he returns the ſame way he got up, not in haſte, but leiſurely obſerving and taking notice of every Particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to his purpoſe. This done, away he comes to <hi>Marius,</hi> informs him of the Accident, and adviſes him to attempt the Caſtle on that ſide; and promiſes to lead the way, and be formoſt in the Danger. Immediately <hi>Marius</hi> ſends away with the <hi>Ligurian</hi> ſome of thoſe that were then preſent, to examin the Truth of his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34632:138"/>
who, according to their ſeveral Fancies, upon their Return, reported the Enterprize, ſome to be eaſie; others, difficult. However, the <hi>Conſul</hi> began to pluck up a good heart; and liking the Deſign, picks out of all, his Trumpets and Cornets, five of the nimbleſt and moſt active he could meet with; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points 'em for their Guard four Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with their Companies, commanding 'em to follow the <hi>Ligurian</hi>'s Inſtructions: and appoints the next day to put the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize in execution. And now the time appointed being come, and all things fix'd, away they go to the Place: at what time the Centurions, according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Guide, chang'd both their Arms and their Apparel, and went with their Heads and Feet bare; to the end they might the better look about 'em, and clamber with more eaſe. Their Swords and their Targets, which after the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Faſhion, were of Leather, as well for Lightneſs, as to prevent their ringing againſt the Stones, they ty'd at their Backs. The <hi>Ligurian</hi> alſo clambering formoſt, faſten'd Ropes to the Stones and Stumps of Trees and Shrubs that grew about the Rock, for the Souldiers to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34632:139"/>
eaſe themſelves in climbing: others that were not ſo well vers'd at the ſport, he pull'd up by the Hand; and where the Aſcent was more ſteep then ordinary, he order'd 'em to climb without their Arms, and carry'd their Arms after 'em. Thoſe Places which ſeem'd moſt difficult and dangerous he chiefly try'd; and by often aſcending and deſcending the ſame way, then by and by giving room, and ſtepping to another place, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd the reſt. At length long and very much tir'd, they got to the Caſtle, as it were abandon'd on that ſide; for that all the Garriſon, as at other times, were facing the Enemy. <hi>Marius,</hi> when he underſtood what Progreſs the <hi>Ligurian</hi> had made, though he had ply'd the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi> all that day, yet then encouraging his Souldiers, appearing formoſt himſelf without the Approaches,  running under the <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Teſtudo</hi> was when a Body of Souldiers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd to their cloſe Order,  ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Bodies, cover'd their Backs with their Shields, to bear off the Stones and other Inſtruments of Miſ. chief that were thrown upon 'em: and then mov'd forward under that ſhelter like a Tortoiſe in her Shell.</note> 
               <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudo,</hi> againſt the Wall, not only ſhook the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations below, but with his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34632:139"/>
Slings, and other Miſſive Engines, kept the Enemy hard at work above. On the other ſide, the <hi>Numidians</hi> having often burnt and deſtroy'd the <hi>Roman Vines,</hi> were grown ſo hardy, that as if they had no need of Walls, they would frequently in the day-time leap over the Battlements upon the Rock, and ſtanding there, defy the <hi>Romans,</hi> call <hi>Marius</hi> Coward in his own hearing, and threaten the Souldiers to make 'em <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Slaves, with all the Bravado's of proſperous Inſolence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. At laſt, while Aſſailants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants were eagerly exaſperated in ſight, the one contending for Conqueſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the other for Safety of their Lives, on a ſudden the Trumpets and Cornets began to ſound behind their Backs; and firſt the Women and Children that came to be Spectators of their Husbands and their Fathers Manhood; then ſuch as were next the Walls, and laſtly, the whole Company, as well thoſe that were arm'd, as thoſe that had none, betook themſelves to flight. Which the <hi>Romans</hi> obſerving, charg'd more furiouſly with their Slings and Engines, ſome they wounded, others they ſlew, and made Steps of their dead Bodies out of eagerneſs to aſcend the wall:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34632:140"/>
neither was there any one that made a ſtop for greedineſs of Spoyl. Thus For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune found a <hi>Salvo</hi> for the Raſhneſs of <hi>Marius,</hi> and procur'd him Honour from the Errour of his Conduct.</p>
            <p n="95">95. In the heat of this Action, <hi>L. Sylla</hi> the <hi>Queſtor,</hi> arriv'd at the Camp, with a great Body of Cavalry, which he was left at <hi>Rome</hi> to raiſe in <hi>Latium,</hi> and among the Confederate Allies. Now therefore ſince the opportunity puts us in mind of ſo great a Perſonage, it will not be amiſs, briefly to ſay ſomething of his Conditions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. For we ſhall have no occaſion in any other place to make any farther mention of his Actions. Beſides that <hi>L. Siſenna,</hi> who of all others that have written of him, has with greateſt Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Fidelity purſu'd his Hiſtory, ſeems to have been too ſparing of his Commendations. <hi>Sylla</hi> therefore, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from a Noble Patrician Family, but gone to decay, and near extinct, through the Sloth of his Anceſtors. He was equally skill'd and accompliſh'd both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Learning; of a lofty Courage, addicted to his Pleaſures, but more greedy of Honour; luxurious
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:34632:140"/>
at his vacant hours, yet his Pleaſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took him off from Buſineſs; only he might have better conſulted his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the choice of a <note n="*" place="margin">For he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd <hi>Valeria,</hi> one that over-wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly courted him in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Theater.</note> Wife. He was eloquent, ſubtil, nothing coy of his Friendſhip, but eaſily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; but for diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and diſguiſing his own Thoughts, the Depth of his Wit was incredible: liberal in his Gifts, but eſpecially of his Money. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Civil War, the moſt happy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon living, his Fortune never ſurmounted his Induſtry; ſo that it was a Queſtion which many could never decide, Whether he were more Fortunate or Vertuous. For as for his latter Actions, I am at a loſs whether to repeat 'em with greater Grief, or greater Shame.</p>
            <p n="96">96. <hi>Sylla</hi> therefore when he arriv'd in <hi>Africa,</hi> and came once to be converſant in <hi>Marius</hi>'s Camp; in a ſhort time prov'd to be one of the moſt ſedulous and expert of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders. Moreover, he treated the Souldiers affably and kindly: liberal to many that ask'd him, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his own accord: in thoſe things
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34632:141"/>
much more forward and willing then to pay his own Debts. He never demanded whatever he lent: making it his Study, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that others ſhould be beholding to him. His Cuſtom was to jeſt and be merry, and ſometimes to be ſerious with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. He lov'd to be preſent with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in all their Duties of working, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watching: neither would he all the while, according to the Cuſtom of deprav'd Ambition, ſpeak ill either of the <hi>Conſul,</hi> or any other Perſon. Neither in Direction or Execution of any Orders, would he ſuffer any man to be before him, but was generally the formoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And theſe were the Ways and Means by which he endear'd himſelf both to <hi>Marius</hi> and won the Affections of the Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="97">97. In the mean time <hi>Jugurth,</hi> after he had loſt <hi>Capſa,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns, ſtrongly fortify'd and of great importance to his Affairs, beſides a vaſt Treaſure, ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Boccbus,</hi> to haſten his Army into <hi>Numidia;</hi> for that now was the Time to decide the Controverſie by Battel one way or other. But when he perceiv'd him to procraſtinate and ſpin out
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34632:141"/>
the time, then full of doubts, he began to conſider the Advantages of Peace and War; and as before, renew'd his former Practices of Bribing his chiefeſt Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. He alſo promiſes the <hi>Moor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Third Part of <hi>Numidia,</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the <hi>Romans</hi> were either chac'd out of <hi>Africa,</hi> or that the War were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he might enjoy the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Kingdom. With this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>Bocchus</hi> allur'd, haſtens to <hi>Jugurth</hi> with a numerous Power of Men. Thus the two Armies being joyn'd, as <hi>Marius</hi> was Marching to his Winter Quarters, about what time, ſcarce the tenth part of the day remained behind, they fell on furiouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the approaching Night, would be to them a Security were they overthrown; or if the Victors, could be no Impediment, becauſe they were well acquainted with the Country: on the other ſide aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that whether Victors or vanquiſh'd, the dark Night would be equally trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the <hi>Romans.</hi> So that the Enemy was upon him ere the Conſul had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the approach of the Army; and before the Legions could be Embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell'd, or the Baggage diſpos'd of and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd; before he had time to give the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34632:142"/>
Signal, or give out his Orders, the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Getulian</hi> Cavalry had charg'd our Men, not rang'd in order, nor drawn up in warlike maner, but at a venture in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Troops and ſcattering Parties. The <hi>Romans</hi> thus ſurpriz'd with ſuddain Fear, and unprovided, yet calling to mind their wonted Valour, ſome betook themſelves to their Arms, others defended their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows while they made themſelves ready: The Cavalry mounted, and haſtned to ſtop the Enemies Career; ſo that the Fight lookt rather like a Rancounter of Free-booters then a Battel; obſerving nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enſigns nor Ranks, Horſe and Foot mix'd one among another; ſome giving ground, others being ſlain: many, while ſtoutly engag'd with their Adverſaries, had the Enemy upon their Backs; neither Valour nor Steel were a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; for that the Enemy was more numerous, and made their Attacks on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide. For remedy whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> as well <hi>Veteranes</hi> as the raw Souldiers being inſtructed by their fellows, as Chance or Place gave them an opportunity, threw themſelves into Oval Bodies, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Enemy every way ſubſtain'd their Fury with a much more ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34632:142"/>
All this while, <hi>Marius,</hi> thus hard put to it, was nothing at all dejected, nor ſhew'd the leaſt ſign of fear more then at any other time; but with his own Life-guard which he had made choice of, not for favour but for their Bravery and Stoutneſs, flew from one place to another, relieving thoſe that were over power'd, and ſometimes charging the Thickeſt of the Enemy, inſtructing 'em by acts of perſonal Examples; ſince as a General all Commands were vain in ſuch a terrible Confuſion. And now by this the day was well nigh ſpent, and yet the Enemy abated nothing of their Fury, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s inſtructions relying upon the darkneſs of the night, rather preſs'd on more eagerly. When <hi>Marius</hi> taking reſolutions from the neceſſity of his Affairs that he might have a place of Retreate orders his men to take poſſeſſion of two ſmall Hills that lay cloſe adjoyning one to another. Upon the leaſt of theſe Hills, which was not ſpacious enough to pitch his Camp, there was a large Fountain of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the other more for his purpoſe, for that being high and ſteep, it wanted the leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. Therefore upon the firſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Sylla</hi> to keep a ſtrict Guard with
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34632:143"/>
the Cavalry all the Night; He himſelf takes care to rally his Men, and to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage 'em from among the Enemy who were in no leſs confuſion then the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which done he retreats in a full Body to the ſecond Hill. The two Kings being thus diſcourag'd by the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the place from making any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempts however would not leave the Conſul ſo, but lay all Night ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding both the Hills with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Multitude. All the Night long the Enemy made great and many Fires, were merry and jocond, skipp'd and daunc'd about and made ſeveral ſtrange noiſes with their feet and throates, after their Barbarous Cuſtom. The Kings themſelves were pufft up, and full of high thoughts, becauſe they had not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to fly, but like Victors lay Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the <hi>Romans.</hi> But all theſe things were eaſily deſcernible by the light of the Fires to our Men from the higher ground, and gave them no ſmall encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
            <p n="99">99. <hi>Marius</hi> therefore embolden'd to ſee the Enemies defect of Diſcipline, commands a moſt exact Silence in his own Camp;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34632:143"/>
not ſuffering the Trumpets to ſound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relieving the Watches, as they were wont to do, but as ſoon as Day began to peep, when the Enemy tyr'd with their Jollity were gone to their repoſe, and all in a profound Sleep, of a ſuddain he cauſes all the Tributary Trumpeters, and all the Trumpeters of the ſeveral Cohorts, Troops and Legions all to ſound together, and the Souldiers at the ſame time with loud ſhouts and Military clamours to rend the Air, and pour out of the Camp upon the Enemy. On the other ſide, the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Getulians,</hi> waken'd with the unuſual and horrid noiſe, could neither fly, nor ſtand to their Arms; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolve nor prevent. In ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were they ſtupify'd and har'd with noiſe, clamour, tumult, terrour, fright, amazement, want of ſuccour, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the Enemy: and at length all routed and put to flight; moſt of their Arms and Military Enſigns taken, and more ſlain in that Battel then in all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters before: for being ſcarce awake, and ſcar'd out of their Wits, they had not ſence enough to fly.</p>
            <p n="100">100. <hi>Marius</hi> thus a Victor, according to his firſt determination, haſten'd to his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34632:144"/>
Winter Quarters, which he reſolv'd to take up in the Sea Towns, for the conveniency of Proviſion. Yet in the heighth of his ſucceſs ne'er the more negligent or puff'd up, but as if ſtill the Enemy had been in the field he March'd with his Army di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four Battalions. Upon the Right-wing <hi>Sylla</hi> lead the Horſe; the Left was guarded by <hi>A. Manlius</hi> with the Slingers and Darters, and a Cohort of <hi>Ligurians.</hi> In the Front and Rear he plac'd the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes with certain Bands of light Armed foot. The Fugitives, as being little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd, and exactly acquainted with the Country, were put upon the Forlorns to to obſerve the Motion of the Enemy. The Conſul, confin'd to no Place, as if there had been no other Overſeers but himſelf, had an eye every where, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with all, prais'd or reprov'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Deſert. He rode about compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arm'd, and made it his buſineſs to keep the Souldiers from ſtragling; no leſs vigilant, then as if he had been upon a March, to fortify his Camp, to ſet the Sentinels to order what Cohorts, what Auxiliary Horſe ſhould be upon the Guard without the Trenches, which to watch upon the Breſt-works, within the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34632:144"/>
Fortifications; and go the Rounds in Perſon, not ſo much miſtruſting diſobedience of his Commands, but that the Souldiers might be the more willing to endure hardſhip, when they beheld the General himſelf ſo painfully ſharing their labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Toyl. And indeed <hi>Marius</hi> may be ſaid both then and at other times, during the <hi>Jugurthin</hi> War, to keep his Army in awe rather by ſhame, then ſeverity of Puniſhment, which many attributed to his Ambition; but others more ſoft in their cenſures, aſcrib'd to his being enur'd to Hardſhip from his Cradle, which made him take pleaſure in thoſe things, which others lookt upon as Tribulations. However it were, this is certain, He was no leſs profitable and ſucceſsful to the Commonwealth, then if he had been the ſevereſt Commander in the World.</p>
            <p n="101">101. Upon the fourth day, being not far from <hi>Cirta,</hi> the Scouts came all thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering into the Body of the Army: which was a certain ſign the Enemy was at hand. But becauſe they had been all ſeveral ways, and all brought the ſame Intelligence, the Conſul uncertain which way to Embattel his Army, would not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34632:145"/>
change any thing of his Order, as being already prepar'd to attend the Enemies coming with a Front every way.</p>
            <p>By this means he diſappointed <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Expectations; for having divided his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into four Battalions, he made full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that one or other of the Four, would have an opportunity to fall upon the back of the Enemies. In the mean time <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was firſt Attacqu'd, after ſome few Exhortations to his Men, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſingle Troops, joyning Horſe head to Horſe head, he and ſeveral others, charge the <hi>Moors:</hi> the reſt keeping firm in their Places, cover their Bodies from the Darts, that were flung at a diſtance; and if any of the Enemy came within their reach, he was ſure to pay for his ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. While the Horſe were thus engag'd, <hi>Bocchus</hi> with the Forces which his Son <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> had brought to reinforce his Army, and which were not in the laſt Fight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtay'd by the way, charges the Rear of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Then was <hi>Marius</hi> in the Front, where <hi>Jugurth</hi> found him play with a numerous Body; but the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian,</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Bocchus</hi> had charg'd the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Rear, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34632:145"/>
with a ſmall Company conveighs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Foot, and their crys out in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> which he had learnt to ſpeak at <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia,</hi> that our Souldiers fought to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for that he had ſlain <hi>Marius</hi> but a little before with his own hand, and at the ſame time brandiſh'd his Sword all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear'd with the blood of a Common Trooper, whom after he had long fought him hand to hand, at length he ſlew. Which when the Souldiers heard, they were more aſtoniſh'd at the Cruelty of the Fact, then the Relation of the Meſſenger: at what time the Enemy reſuming freſh Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, preſs in more eagerly upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> And indeed they were within a very little of betaking themſelves to their Heels, when <hi>Sylla,</hi> returning from the Rout of thoſe which he firſt encounter'd, and charging the <hi>Moors</hi> in Front, put <hi>Bocchus</hi> immediately to flight. As for <hi>Jugurth,</hi> while he labours to ſupport his own Men, and to keep the advantage of a Victory almoſt gain'd, being ſurrounded on every ſide by the Horſe and all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſlain, breaks through the thickeſt of his Enemies alone. <hi>Marius</hi> in the mean time, having put the Horſe to flight, haſtens to the Relief of his own Men, who as he
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34632:146"/>
was told were ready to give ground. But then the Enemy being utterly broken and routed on every ſide, hideous was the Tragic Spectacle that preſented it ſelf over all the Field; Purſuing, flying, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, taking: many wounded, bleeding, ſtriving and ſtaggering along, till fainting, down they fell: the ſurface of the Earth, as far as you could ſee, all ſtrew'd with Weapons, Arms, and mangl'd Carcaſes; and all the ſpaces between fill'd up with clotted gore.</p>
            <p n="102">102. Thus the Conſul after two great Victories obtain'd, arriv'd at <hi>Cirta:</hi> where about five days after the laſt Battel, he was attended by Embaſſadors from <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who in the Name of the King their Maſter, requeſt the General to ſend him two Commiſſioners of his moſt faithful Friends, with whom he had a deſire to treat of ſeveral things that concern'd both his own and the welfare of the <hi>Roman</hi> People. Thereupon the Conſul preſently orders <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> and <hi>A. Manlius</hi> to go along with the Embaſſadors. Theſe Gentlemen though they were ſent for by the King, and ought firſt to have heard his propoſals, yet they were clearly for ſpeaking firſt,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34632:146"/>
either to abate his Courage, if they found him incens'd againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> or elſe render him more plyable to their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they perceiv'd him inclinable to Peace. Whereupon <hi>Sylla,</hi> to whoſe Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, not his years, <hi>Manlius</hi> gave the precedency, in few words deliver'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>King <hi>Bocchus,</hi> more then ordinary has been our joy, for that the Gods have inſpir'd the Breaſt of ſuch a Man, at length rather to make choice of Peace then War, nor any longer to contaminate thy Dignity, by intermixing Intereſts, thy ſelf the beſt of Men with the worſt of Caitiffs, <hi>Jugurth:</hi> while we at the ſame time are freed from a bitter neceſſity of proſecuting as well Thee beguil'd and led aſtray, as Him debauch'd in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, Beſides that from the very Infancy of their State, the <hi>Romans</hi> have always deem'd it much more noble to covet Friends then Slaves: as thinking it more ſafe to Rule the wilingly ſubmiſſive, then ſuch as they conſtrain'd to forc'd Subjection. Nor can any Mortal reap a greater benefit from our Friendſhip then thy ſelf: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firſt place far remote: So that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34632:147"/>
the occaſions of injury can ſeldom or never happen, but the opportunities of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſiſtance will be as equally balanc'd as if we were near at hand: In the next place we have Subjects enow; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we nor any Potentate living, can boaſt to have more friends then are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And I wiſh to Heav'n thou hadſt follow'd thoſe determinations at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for certainly by this time thou hadſt reap'd far greater Advantages from the <hi>Roman</hi> People, then hitherto thou haſt ſuffer'd prejudice. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Fortune governs the greateſt part of human Affairs, and ſince it has been her Pleaſure, Thou ſhouldſt make tryal as well of our Force as of our Favour; now, ſince ſhe affords the Opportunity, make haſt to embrace it, as thou haſt begun, proceed. Thou haſt many and fair Advantages, to redeem thy former over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights by ſucceding Kindneſſes. Laſtly, let this deſcend into thy Breaſt, that the <hi>Roman</hi> People were never out-done in Gratitude. For what their Courage is in War, thou knoweſt thy ſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Bocchus</hi> briefly returns a fair and plauſible Anſwer, in extenuation of his
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34632:147"/>

Theſe he ſends his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors firſt to <hi>Marius,</hi> and from thence, if he thought fit, orders likewiſe to go in the ſame Quality to <hi>Rome:</hi> with Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary power upon any Terms to put an end to the War, and in all other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to act and conclude at their Diſcretion. They make haſt to the Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But being met upon the Road by certain <hi>Getulian</hi> Free-booters and rob'd of all their Equipage, frighted as they were, and meanly habited, they fly to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Quarters, whom <hi>Marius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his March into the Deſarts, had left <hi>Pretor</hi> in his room.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men did <hi>Sylla</hi> treat not as vain and fickle Enemies, but Genteelly and Bountifully ſupply'd their wants. So that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> finding <hi>Sylla</hi> ſo muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and ſo friendly withal, readily alter'd their Opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. For in thoſe very days many there

were that underſtood not the reaſon of expenſive Liberality; only a Man was accounted munificent, becauſe his Bounty ſeem'd his voluntary Act, and all Gifts were lookt upon as Retalliations, or in expectation of Kindneſs. Therefore they diſcover <hi>Bocchus</hi>'s Inſtructions to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and withal beſeech him to ſtand both their Friend and their Adviſer. They extol the Strength, the Integrity, and Grandeur of the King their Maſter, not omitting any thing that might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to their Negotiation, or to gain the good will of the Pretor. Nor did <hi>Sylla</hi> ſcruple to promiſe 'em all Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but gave 'em full Inſtructions how to manage their Affairs, how to behave themſelves as well toward <hi>Marius,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of the Senate, and thus recruited and directed, they waited about forty days for the Conſuls return.</p>
            <p n="104">104. At what time <hi>Marius</hi> not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his Deſign, return'd for <hi>Cirta;</hi> where being inform'd of the arrival of the Embaſſadors, he ſends for them, and <hi>Sylla,</hi> together with <hi>L. Bellienus</hi> the Pretor from <hi>

In their preſence he makes known the Commands of <hi>Bocchus</hi> to his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and gives 'em leave to repair to <hi>Rome;</hi> but in the mean while the Conſul demands a Ceſſation of Arms. Theſe Proceedings were approv'd by <hi>Sylla</hi> and the greateſt Part: ſome few were more hot and furious in their Opinions, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Human Affairs, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and ſubject to a thouſand Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, often alter for the worſe. At length the <hi>Mows</hi> having obtain'd all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, three of 'em ſet forward toward <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Octavius Bufo,</hi> who being Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer at War, had brought the Money into <hi>Africa,</hi> which was to pay the Army. The other two return'd back to the King; and gave him an account of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; in Concluſion highly magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sylla</hi>'s great civillity and kindneſs. At <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Embaſſadors had ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively confeſs'd the Kings overſights, as being lead away by the Inſinuations of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi> and humbly deſir'd a League and mutual Amity, the following Anſwer was return'd.</p>

Injuries. But as for</hi> Bocchus, <hi>becauſe they find him Penitent, they pardon his Offence. A League and Friendſhip ſhall be granted him, when he deſerves it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being made known to <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> by Letters he deſires <hi>Marius</hi> to ſend <hi>Sylla</hi> to him, that according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and good liking, there might be a final Concluſion of all differences. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was diſpatch'd away with a Guard of Horſe and Foot, the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earic</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Which were taken from the Iſlands of <hi>Major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and <hi>Minorca;</hi> accounted the beſt Slingers in the World; for that they never miſs'd their Aim, and ſlung their Darts with that force, as if they had been ſent out of an Engin.</note> Slingers; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Archers, and the <hi>Pelignian</hi> Cohort, with their <note n="b" place="margin">Which were only a Sword a Javelin, and a light Buckler.</note> Light Arms, for expeditions ſake: with thoſe ſlighter Arms as well defenſive as offenſive, no leſs ſecur'd, then by Arms of greater Force, from the Darts of the Enemy, which were as ſlight and eaſily avoided. Upon the Road, after they had travell'd five days, of a ſudden <hi>Volux</hi> ſhew'd himſelf in the open Field with about
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34632:151"/>
a Thouſand Horſe, who riding ſcatter'd and without any Order, not only ſeem'd to be more then they were, but begot a kind of miſtruſt of Hoſtile Treachery both in <hi>Sylla</hi> and all the reſt. Thereupon every one began to make ready, to fix their Weapons, and put themſelves into a Poſture of defence. Something of Fear, but more of Hopes, as being Victors, and to fight againſt thoſe whom they had often vanquiſh'd. But in the midſt of this hurry, the Vancurriers that ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, returning brought word, that all were friends. Then <hi>Volux</hi> coming up call'd to ſpeak with the <hi>Queſtor,</hi> and told him, that he was ſent by his Father <hi>Bocchus</hi> to meet him and attend him as his Convoy. So that the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and March'd all the next day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any miſtruſt one of another. But in the Evening ſo ſoon as the Camp was pitch'd, <hi>Volux</hi> with fear and diſorder in his Countenance, comes galloping to <hi>Sylla</hi> and informs him, that he was aſcertain'd by his Spies, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> was at hand, and therefore with great Importunity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats and beſeeches him privately in the dead of the Night to conſult his own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by ſpeedy flight. But <hi>Sylla</hi> with an
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34632:151"/>
undaunted Courage denies that he fear'd the <hi>Numidian</hi> whom he had ſo often van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd; that he was ſufficiently aſſur'd of the Valour of his Souldiers; and though certain deſtruction ſtar'd him in the face, he would rather ſtand his ground; then deſerting thoſe that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Conduct, by ſhameful flight endeavour to ſpare a frail and uncertain Life, which perchance ſoon after, ſickneſs might deprive him of. However he follows his advice to diſlodg by Night: and to that purpoſe orders the Souldiers to take their Suppers, make a great number of Fires, and at the firſt Watch without Noiſe or Tumult to be ready to March. The next morning by Sun riſe, the Souldiers being weari'd with travelling in the dark, <hi>Sylla</hi> pitches his Tents; at what time the Mooriſh Scouts bring Intelligence, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> lay within two Miles before 'em. Which news being ſpread in the Camp, our Men were not a little terrify'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves betray'd by <hi>Volux,</hi> and brought into an <hi>Ambuſcado.</hi> And ſome there were who cry'd out that ſuch a Peice of Treachery ought not to eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd, but that they ſhould revenge themſelves upon the Traytor with their
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34632:152"/>
own hands. But <hi>Sylla,</hi> though he thought the ſame, however he protected the <hi>Moor</hi> from any Injury: encourages his Men to behave themſelves Valiantly; that it was not the firſt time a few Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and brave had Fought againſt a Multitude with Succeſs; that the leſs they ſpar'd themſelves in Battel, the more ſecure they were; and that it no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came any Man, who had Arms in his hands to expect ſafety from his unarmed feet; or in the midſt of certain danger to turn the naked part of his Body toward the Enemy. After that, invoking the mighty <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be a witneſs of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and Falſhood of <hi>Bocchus,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Volux</hi> to depart the Camp, as one that might aſſiſt the Enemy. He on the other ſide with tears in his Eyes, beſeeches the Legate not to have ſuch miſtruſtful thoughts of him; that there was nothing of deceit in <hi>Bocchus,</hi> but that all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſubtilty of <hi>Jugurth,</hi> who had by his Spics diſcover'd his March: and therefore, in regard that <hi>Jugurth</hi> had no great Forces with him, beſides that all his hopes and welfare depended upon his Father, deſir'd him to believe the <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> durſt not make any open Attempt,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34632:152"/>
where the Son of ſuch a Father was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For which reaſon he thought it the beſt way to March boldly through the middle of his Camp: and that for his part, he would accompany <hi>Sylla</hi> alone, either ſending his <hi>Moors</hi> before, or leaving 'em behind in the ſame Place. This Counſel, as it happens in caſes of the like nature, was approv'd, and ſo marching forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, becauſe they came of a ſudden, while <hi>Jugurth</hi> was doubtful and heſitating what to do, they paſs'd without any oppoſition. After that, within a few days they arriv'd at their Journeys end.</p>
            <p n="108">108. At the ſame time a certain <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Aſpar</hi> by Name, was very frequent and familiar with <hi>Bocchus,</hi> being ſent before by <hi>Jugurth,</hi> cunningly and cloſely to pry into <hi>Bocchus</hi>'s ſecret Reſolutions. Beſides him, there was alſo another, whoſe Name was <hi>Dabar,</hi> the Son of <hi>Maſſugrada,</hi> and Kinſman of <hi>Maſſiniſſa</hi> by the Mother's ſide (for his Father was the Son of a Concubine) highly careſs'd and favour'd by the <hi>Moor,</hi> for his many excellent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, whom <hi>Bocchus</hi> had alſo upon many occaſions before found very faithful to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Him therefore he ſends
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34632:153"/>
to <hi>Sylla,</hi> to let him underſtand, That the King was ready to perform whatever the <hi>Roman</hi> People commanded: That he himſelf ſhould appoint the Day, the Place and Time for Conference: That he intended to keep all his Conſultations with him entire and private: That he had no reaſon to be afraid of <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Ambaſſador: for that he was ſent for on purpoſe, to the end the Common Good might be debated with more freedom; there being no other way to prevent the Frauds and Wiles of <hi>Jugurth.</hi> But in my Opinion <hi>Bocchus</hi> kept the Treaty afoot both with <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Numidians,</hi> rather out of a Punic Piece of Treachery, then upon thoſe Pretences which he publickly ſpred abroad: and that he had frequently Combats in his Mind, whether to deliver up <hi>Jugurth</hi> to Us, or <hi>Sylla</hi> to Him; while his Natural Inclinations pleaded againſt Us, but his Fears perſwaded for Us. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, <hi>Sylla</hi> made Anſwer, that he ſhould ſay little before <hi>Aſpar;</hi> the reſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, none or very few being preſent. He likewiſe tells <hi>Dabar</hi> what Anſwer he expected. After this, both meeting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment, <hi>Sylla</hi> tells the King, That he was ſent by the <hi>Conſul,</hi> to know
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34632:153"/>
whether he were for Peace or War. Then the King, as it was agreed between 'em, deſir'd him to return again the Tenth day after, That he could determine nothing at that time, but that then he would give him his Anſwer. Thus both departed to their ſeveral Camps. But when the Night was far ſpent, <hi>Sylla</hi> was privately ſent for by <hi>Bocchus,</hi> and faithful Interpreters made choice of on both ſides. Or rather, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> with conſent of both Parties, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of clear Integrity, was ſworn to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret truly between 'em: and then the King thus began.</p>
            <p n="110">110. <q>I never thought it would have come to paſs, that being a King, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all within this Continent and of all the moſt Powerful that I know of, ſhould ever have been reduc'd to be oblig'd to a private Perſon. And truly, <hi>Sylla,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knew Thee, I have ſuccour'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſu'd to me, others of my own accord, never in need of Relief my ſelf. This Diminution of my Dignity which others are wont to lament, makes me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. It is my Happineſs to ſtand in need of thy Friendſhip, then which there can be nothing dearer to my Soul. Of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34632:154"/>
this make Trial: Arms, Men, Money, whatever thou haſt a mind to, take and uſe: and as long as thou liv'ſt, ne'r think thy Friendſhip ſufficiently remunerated: which I ſhall always deem a Debt that never can be repay'd: for in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is leſs diſhonourable to a Prince to be overcome by force of Arms, then in Munificence. Now as to the Affairs of your Republic, in the behalf of which you here are come to Treat, thus much in ſhort. I never made War upon the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ever conſented to a War. Only in defence of the Confines of my Kingdom, the Arm'd I oppos'd with Arms. But let that paſs: Continue as you pleaſe your ſelves, the War with <hi>Jugurth.</hi> I will never ſo much as ſtir over the River <hi>Mulacha,</hi> the Bounds between me and <hi>Micipſa,</hi> neither will I ever ſuffer <hi>Jugurth</hi> to paſs it. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if there be any thing farther that you require of me fit for me to grant, or you to ask, you ſhall not return with a Repulſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="111">111. To this <hi>Sylla,</hi> as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd himſelf, made Anſwer conciſely and modeſtly: in reſerence to the Peace,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34632:154"/>
and the Common Affairs, he diſcours'd at large. Laſtly, He gave the King to underſtand, that the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> would not take it for any obligation what he had laſt promis'd, as being much ſuperior to him both by Sea and Land: That there was ſomething to be done, that might ſeem to ſhew him more zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their Welfare then his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Which he had an Opportunity to do, as having <hi>Jugurth</hi> in his Power: who, if he were by himſelf ſurrender'd up to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there could not be a greater Obligation laid upon a grateful People: beſides that the League, the Friendſhip, and that part of <hi>Numidia</hi> which he now ſu'd for, would then be freely offer'd him. At firſt the King made a kind of ſlight Denial; pleaded Kindred, Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the League between 'em: then pretended his Fears of incurring the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the People, to whom <hi>Jugurth</hi> was dear, the <hi>Romans</hi> no leſs odious, ſhould he falſifie the Confidence repos'd in him. At length orecome by Importunity, he ſubmits, and promiſes to do whatever <hi>Sylla</hi> deſir'd him. Then they ſettle all things which were thought neceſſary to make a ſhew of including the <hi>Numidian</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:34632:155"/>
within the Peace, which he moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſir'd, as being quite weary of the War. And ſo the Plot being laid, they take their Leaves for that time.</p>
            <p n="112">112. The next day the King ſends for <hi>Aſpar,</hi> who was <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Agent, and tells him, That <hi>Dabar</hi> had fiſh'd out of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that the War might be compos'd upon Conditions: and that therefore he ſhould do well to know the King's Mind. Thereupon, he haſtens with great Joy to <hi>Jugurth</hi>'s Camp. From whom after he had taken full Inſtructions, away he poſts again, and in eight days returns to <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and aſſures him, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> was ready to yield obedience to whatever was impos'd upon him; only that he durſt not confide in <hi>Marius:</hi> for that formerly Articles of Peace concluded with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Generals had been voted ineffectual. And therefore if <hi>Bocchus</hi> intended the Welfare of Both, and deſir'd a firm Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Agreement, that he ſhould make it his Buſineſs, that they might meet all three together, under pretence of concluding the Peace, and then that he ſhould deliver <hi>Sylla</hi> into his hands; for that when he had ſuch a Perſon at
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34632:155"/>
his diſpoſal, the League would of neceſſity be confirm'd by the Command of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> who were not wont to ſuffer a Perſon of his Dignity, (not enſlav'd by his own Overſight, but in the Service of the Commonwealth) to lie long in the Power of the Enemy.</p>
            <p n="113">113. This the <hi>Moor,</hi> revolving dayly ſeveral Imaginations in his Mind, at length promis'd to do. But whether Fraud or Ingenuity were the Motives that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd his delay, we never could be fully ſatisfy'd. For as the Determinations of Princes are quick and haſty, ſo are they no leſs inconſtant, and frequently repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant one to another. Soon after, the Place and Time being fix'd where they were to meet all three together for the Concluſion of the Peace, <hi>Bocchus</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſends for <hi>Sylla,</hi> ſometimes for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi>'s Agent; entertains both with equal. Civility, and promiſes to both the ſame thing: on the other ſide, they are both well pleas'd, and both alike full of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Expectations. But upon the Night preceding the Day appointed for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the <hi>Moor,</hi> ſending for his Friends, and by and by altering his reſolutions,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34632:156"/>
and diſmiſſing 'em again, was a long time in a great Agitation of Mind alone by himſelf; by his Looks the going and coming of his Colour, by his Actions and Geſtures ſhewing no leſs Diſturbance of Body then of Mind; which during the ſilence of Utterance, he diſplay'd in the alterations of his Countenance. However, at length he ſends for <hi>Sylla,</hi> and by his Direction layes the Plot to entrap the <hi>Numidian.</hi> To which purpoſe, when the Day was come, and that News was brought him, that <hi>Jugurth</hi> was not far off, as it were to honour his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, accompany'd with ſome few Friends together with our <hi>Queſtor,</hi> he rides up a little Hillock in view of thoſe that lay in Ambuſh: Whither the <hi>Numidian</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching with ſome few, the moſt of his Kindred unarm'd, upon the Signal given, he is ſurrounded by the Ambuſcado. The reſt were all cut in pieces; <hi>Jugurth</hi> in Chains is deliver'd to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and by him guarded to <hi>Marius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="114">114. At the ſame time, two of our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, <hi>Q. Coepio</hi> and <hi>M. Manlius</hi> fought with bad Succeſs againſt the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or rather the</hi> Cimbrians.</note>

               <hi>Italy</hi> into a great Conſternation.

Sylla</hi>'s Tyranny, leaſt while you nere ſuſpect in others, what in your ſelves you deem abominable, you be beguil'd and circumvented (eſpecially ſince all his hopes are grounded upon Villany and Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that he does not think himſelf other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſafe, then by proving far worſe and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable then you can fear him to be, that ſo your Miſeries may exempt ye, his Slaves as he accounts ye, from the care of your Liberty) or if ye provide for your ſelves, that ye may be employ'd rather in fending off your apparent dangers then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34632:158"/>
of offer'd violence. The Penſioners of his Guard, Men that make a great Figure in the world, and no leſs eminent for imitating the worthy Examples of their Anceſtors, I cannot too ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire, to ſee how they enſlave themſelves, to tyranize, over you; chooſing Both out of a natural inclination to Injuſtice, rather then uprightly and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally to live in Freedom. Moſt noble Off-spring of the <hi>Brutus</hi>'s, the <hi>AEmilius</hi>'s, and the <hi>Lutatii;</hi> born to ſubvert thoſe things which their Fore-fathers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by their Vertue and their Courage. For then, what elſe did They defend, but their Liberty and their native Manſions from the Violence of <hi>Pyrrhus, Hannibal, Philip</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that we might not be obedient to any but our own Laws? All which, this ſame cruel <hi>Romulus,</hi> as if wreſted from Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, holds faſt in his own Poſſeſſion; not ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with the ſlaughter of ſo many Armies, nor of the Conſul, nor of ſo many others of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Nobility whom the Fortune of the War had deſtroy'd; but then more cruel, when proſperity turns the hearts of other Men from Fury to Compaſſion: The only Perſon in the World, ſince the memory of Man, that ever invented puniſhments for thoſe that were to come; who were certain to be wrong'd before they were born: and became moſt wickedly ſecure in the Inhumanity of his barbarous proceedings, while you, for fear of more grievous ſervitude, were deterr'd from the recovery of your Liberty. But you muſt to work, and make head againſt this Torrent, leaſt your ſpoyls come once to be at his Command. 'Tis now no time to dally, or to ſtay for Succour in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of our Prayers. Unleſs you hope, that either a weary, or aſham'd of his Tyranny, he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to quit with danger, what he has raviſh'd into
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:34632:158"/>
his Poſſeſſion by violence. But he has gon ſo far' that he accompts nothing Honourable but what is ſafe, and deems all things juſt and honeſt that ſerve to uphold his Uſurpation. Therefore that ſame Reſt and Tranquillity with freedom, which many good Men rather choſe then labour accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with Honour, are now quite vaniſh'd from the World. At this time we muſt either ſerve, or domineer, Moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> be afraid our ſelves, or be a terror to others. For what is more to be expected? What is there, either Human or Divine that has eſcap'd without Pollution? The <hi>Roman</hi> People, ere while the Lords of Nations deſpoil'd of all Command, their Glory and their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, without life or motion, and contemn'd as uſeleſs, have hardly left 'em the allowances of Slaves: a great number of our Allies and all the <hi>Latines,</hi> whom you for many and important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, made pertakers of your Franchiſes, are now prohibited by one; and a few Life Guard-Penſioners poſſeſs the hereditary Habitations of the Innocent Commonalty, as the wages of their Villanies. Our Laws, our judicial Proceedings, the Publick Treaſures, the Provinces, nay Kings themſelves, are all at the Diſpoſal of one man's Will: in a word, abſolute Power of Life and Death lies proſtrate at the Pleaſure of a ſingle Tyrant. Ye have beheld at the ſame time human Victims offer'd to his Fury, and the Sepulchres of the ſlain beſmear'd with Civil Blood. Does there any thing then more remain for Men to act; then either to diſſolve the Injuſtice, or to dye Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? For Death has ſtill determin'd the ſame end to all Men, though environ'd and immur'd in Steel; nor is there any Man that waits the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Fate, afraid to dare, unleſs effeminately
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:34632:159"/>
abject. But I am Seditious, as <hi>Sylla</hi> terms me, becauſe I ſeem to affect the rewards of Tumult and Faction; and a promoter of War, for rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Privileges and Rights of Peace. That is to ſay, becauſe you never will be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſecure, or ſafe in your Empire, till <hi>Vettius Picens,</hi> and the Notary <hi>Cornelius</hi> have made a waſtful ſale of other Mens Eſtates acquir'd by Pains and Induſtry: unleſs you approve all the Proſcriptions of the Innocent, becauſe they were wealthy; the Tortures of Illuſtrious Men; the City lay'd Deſolate by Baniſhment and Slaughter: and the Eſtates of your Afflicted Fellow-Citizens, either ſold or given away in Recompences, like the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> ſpoils.</p>
               <p>But he Objects againſt me Poſſeſſions bought with the Plunder of Perſons proſcrib'd. Which was indeed the moſt enormous of all. his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Crimes, that neither my ſelf, nor any man elſe could be ſafe, if we acted fairly and honeſtly. However what I then purchas'd out of fear, when I had pay'd down my money, I reſtored to the Right Owners: Neither is it my deſign to make a prey of any of my Fellow-Citizens. Certainly, thoſe Calamities might have been ſufficient, which infected with the ſame Fury, we ſuffer'd for a while; <hi>Roman</hi> Armies ſharply encountring one another, and Foreign Weapons turn'd upon our own Breaſts. Let there be end of all theſe Injuries and Oppreſſions. Of which <hi>Sylla</hi> is ſo far from repenting, that he glory'd in what he had done, and might he but have been permitted, would have far more greedily perpetrated. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now do I fear, what your Opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, but how far you dare adventure: leaſt while ye ſtand gaping one upon another, who
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34632:159"/>
ſhould lead ye on, ye be prevented (not by his Forces, which are inconſiderable and weak, but by your own Cowardice) ere you are prepar'd to anticipate him, and be ſo far happy as you ſhall dare to act. For ſetting aſide the Debauch'd Penſioners of his Guard, who takes his part? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who does not deſire a Change of all things, excepting Victory? Surely not the Souldiery that have only ſpilt their blood to enrich <hi>Tarrula</hi> and <hi>Scyrrus,</hi> the worſt of Slaves: Certainly, not they, before whom <hi>Fuſidius</hi> was preferr'd when advanc'd to ſeveral Offices; a Beaſtly <hi>male-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid,</hi> a defilement and Scandal to all Honours. And therefore I have a great Confidence in the Victorious Army, who after all their Wounds and Hardſhip, have only gain'd a Tyrant. Unleſs they went about to ſubvert the Tribunitial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which their Anceſtors erected by force of Arms; or to wreſt out of their own hands their Laws and Privileges. Rarely well repay'd indeed, when ſent back again to the Bogs and Woods, they found their wages, I mean contempt and hatred, to be at the Diſpoſal of a few. Why then does he March with ſuch a Body, and ſo elated in mind? Becauſe Proſperity wonderfully obſcures and mantles Vice. But when this Proſperity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fail, then as formidable as he was before, as much will he be afterwards contemn'd and ſcorn'd unleſs pretence of Peace and Concord give him Confidence, which has appropriated Names to his Villany and Parricide. For, ſays the Tyrant, the <hi>Roman People</hi> otherwiſe can have no end of War, unleſs the Commonalty, expell'd from their Inheritances, to Him become a Civil Booty; unleſs the Right and Arbitrement of all things be at his diſpoſal, which formerly belong'd to the <hi>People of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:34632:160"/>
Rome.</hi> Which if you acknowledge to be Peace and Concord, approve the moſt pernicious plagues and grievances that can befal the Common-wealth: embrace Leiſure with Servitude; and tranſmit to Poſterity a Preſident, that once the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were deluded and fool'd at the expence of their own Blood. For my own part, though as you ſee, By this ſame High Command I have as much as in reaſon I can well deſire, to keep up the Grandeur of my Anceſtors, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my own Reputation, and to ſecure my ſelf, 'twas never my deſign to Study my Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as preferring a dangerous and hazardous Liberty before quiet ſervitude. Which if it be your opinion likewiſe, reſume your wonted Courage, and with the Favour of the Gods follow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul <hi>M. Aemilius,</hi> your Captain and Leader, for the recovery of your Liberty.</p>

               <p>THere is nothing which I more eagerly deſire, Conſcript Fathers, then the Tranquillity of the Common-wealth; or that it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when in danger, by the Stouteſt and moſt forward of its Members. In a word I heartily wiſh, that all wicked enterprizes may prove the ruin of the Contrivers. On the other ſide, all the whole Frame of Government is unhing'd by Factions; and theſe Factions encourag'd by thoſe whom it rather became to endeavour their total Suppreſſion and Extirpation: and what the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34632:160"/>
worſt and moſt extravagant of Mens decree, the moſt vertuous and moſt prudent are oblig'd to execute. A War at preſent you believe unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, yet you muſt take Arms, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, tis <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s pleaſure; but perhaps there may be ſome that love Peace beſt, yet can endure War. Good Gods! that Men ſhould rule this City, yet lay aſide all Care of Governing. <hi>M. AEmilius,</hi> of all Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious Caitiffs the moſt wicked, and whether more Villain or more Coward cannot well be determin'd, has got an Army to oppreſs your Liberty, and he that was contemn'd has made himſelf more formidable while you ſit whiſpering together, and regardleſs of the ſayings and the Propheſies of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> ſeem rather to wiſh for Peace then to defend it: not underſtanding, that by the Lenity of your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees you leſſen your own Authority, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him exempt from fear. And that deſervedly: ſince he has obtain'd the Conſulſhip by Rapine, and a Province together with an Army, to carry on Sedition and Faction. What would he have receiv'd for his good Services, whoſe vile miſdeeds ye have ſo liberally rewarded? It was perhaps, becauſe that they who even to the laſt, gave up their Votes for Legates, Peace, Concord and the like, were favour'd and promoted by him. No; for They, deſpis'd, and thought unworthy of the Common-wealth, were lookt upon as only fit to be made Booty of; as ſuing again for Peace with the ſame fears which they had about 'em when they loſt it. Truly at the very beginning, when I ſaw <hi>Hetruria</hi> in Rebellion, the proſcrib'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons recall'd, and the Republic rent and torn with Bribes and Penſions, I thought it high time to haſten, and with ſome few others follow'd the advice of <hi>Catulus.</hi> But they who extoll'd the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:34632:161"/>
                  <hi>Aemilian</hi> Family for their good Services, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd the <hi>Roman</hi> People for augmenting their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur by Pardoning and Clemency, never diſcern'd that <hi>Lpidus</hi> alſo was a Branch of the ſame Stock: when he took up Arms as a private Perſon to ſubvert their Liberty, every one labouring after wealth, or the Protections of great Perſonages, deſtroy'd the Public Intereſt. And then was <hi>Lepidus</hi> a meer Robber ſurrounded with Camp-Boys, and ſome few Ruffianly Bravoe's: among whom there was not one that did not value a days wages above his life. Now he is a <hi>Proconſul</hi> in high Command, not purchas'd; but conferr'd upon him by your ſelves, with Leiutenants as yet Legally obedient: and to him reſorted Men of all Degrees the moſt corrupt and vicious; inflam'd with luſt and want: whirl'd to and fro with the Guilt of their Crimes: people never at reſt but in Sedition; in peace moſt turbulent: ſowing Tumult upon Tumult, and War upon War; the Penſioners of <hi>Saturninus</hi> formerly, afterwards of <hi>Sulpitius;</hi> then of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Damaſippus,</hi> and now of <hi>Lepidus.</hi> Beſides <hi>Hetruria</hi> up in Arms, and all the Embers of extinguiſh'd Wars now breaking forth again: Both <hi>Spains</hi> Sollicited to Inſurrection, <hi>Mithridates</hi> the next Neighbour to our Tributaries, by whom we are as yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, watches round about an Opportunity for Invaſion: ſo that there is nothing but a proper Captain wanting to ſubvert the whole Body of the Empire. Which I beſeech and implore ye, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Fathers, to conſider; and that you will not ſuffer Licentious Villany like a peſtilence, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion to infect the ſound. For when Rewards attend the wicked, there's no man eaſily will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf to vertue <hi>gratis.</hi> Do ye think it fit to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:34632:161"/>
wait till with a new embody'd Army they once more invade the City with Fire and Sword? Which ſeems much more like and nearer to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition, then from Civil War to Peace and Concord. A War which he has inflam'd in contempt of all things both Divine and Human; not for any wrong done either to himſelf or at leaſt as he pretends to others, but for the Subverſion of our Laws and Liberties. For he is tortur'd and harraſs'd in his mind with Ambition, and dread of ill ſucceſs, void of Counſel and Reſtleſs; Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, attempting that, he fears Tranquillity, hates War, foreſees a Curb upon his Luxury and Licentiouſneſs, and in the mean time makes an Abuſive Advantage of your Remiſſneſs. Which I know not what to call, whether Fear, or Sloath or Madneſs. While every one ſingly ſeems to pray that the threatning miſchief, may not like Lightning dart upon himſelf, but no man ſtirs an inch to prevent the gathering Cloud. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ye conſider how the Natural Order of things is ranvers'd. Formerly public Contrivances of miſchief againſt the State were ſecretly carry`d on; the Remedies openly provided; and by that means good Men had the Advantage of the Wicked: Now Peace and Concord are openly diſturb'd, but ſecretly defended. They who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in War and public Calamity are up in Arms, and you in fear and Conſternation. What are your Hopes? unleſs perhaps you are aſham`d, or look upon it as an irksome Toyl to do your Duty. Do the Commands of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> appeaſe your Indignation? Who tells ye, `tis his pleaſure that every Man ſhould have his own, yet has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what belongs to other Men: who would have all Claims of War cancell`d, yet all the

while compels by force of Arms: who deſires the Freedom of the City to be confirm'd, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Citizens their Franchiſes of which they were depriv'd; who for Concords ſake would have the Tribunitian Power reſtor'd to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, from maintenance of which all our Diſcords have deriv'd their Original. Moſt villanous and impudent of all Mankind, canſt thou be thought to mind the wants, the grievances and lamentations of thy Fellow Citizens, who canſt call nothing thy own, unleſs what forcibly thou haſt gain'd by Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Rapine? Thou ſtandeſt for a ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, as if thou hadſt reſign'd the Firſt. Thou ſeek'ſt for Peace by that ſame very War, by which it was diſturb'd when fairly once obtain'd: Traytor to Us, faithleſs to Them; the Enemy of all good People; regardleſs both of Gods and Men whoſe Laws Divine and Humane thou haſt viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Treaſon and Perjury. Who being what Thou art, I adviſe thee to continue thy Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to quit thy Arms; nor to keep Us in continual Cares and Anxieties, thy ſelf ſo reſtleſs when Seditions are delay'd. Neither Provinces nor Laws nor Houſhold Gods allow thee for a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen? Go on then, as thou haſt begun, that ſo thou mayſt the ſooner meet with thy Reward. But as for You, <hi>Conſcript Fathers,</hi> how long will you by tedious lingring ſuffer the Commonweath to be in jeopardy, and only talk of taking Arms in its Defence? Souldiers are dayly liſted againſt ye; vaſt ſums both publickly and privately extorted: The Laws commanded to be ſerviceable to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Will and Pleaſure, while you ſit voting Lieutenants, and conſidering what Decrees to make. And upon my word, the more earneſtly you ſue for Peace, ſo much the ſharper the War
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34632:162"/>
will be, when he finds himſelf more ſtrongly ſuported by your fears, then by the Juſtice of his Cauſe. For they that tell ye they abominate Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and the Slaughter of their Fellow Citizens, and for that reaſon detain ye unarm'd from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Lepidus</hi> in Arms, believe you will more readily, ſuffer what the vanquiſh'd muſt endure, when ye ſo looſely brook what might be in your power to chaſtiſe. Thus they diſſwade him from Peace with you, and you from War with him. If theſe things pleaſe ye; if ſuch a Lethargy benum your Sences, that forgetful of <hi>Cinna</hi>'s Devaſtations, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe return to the City, all Majeſty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Dignity were trampl'd under foot, you will nevertheleſs ſurrender up your ſelves, your Wives and Children to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> what need of more Decrees? to what Purpoſe the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus?</hi> in vain both he and all good men take care to ſupport the Commonwealth. Do as you think fit; ſue to <hi>Cethegus</hi> and other Traytors for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, that long to glut themſelves with new Rapines and Conflagrations, and to brandiſh once more their naked Swords againſt their Houſhold Gods. But if Liberty and Juſtice be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; Let your Decrees become your Grandeur; and fortify the Commonwealth with men of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Courage. There is a new rais'd Army at hand; moreover Colonies of Veterane Souldiers, all the Nobility, moſt expert Commanders, and Fortune ready to attend the Beſt. In a ſhort while the Forces already muſter'd together will disband and melt away through our Remiſsneſs.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the good Hopes which I have in you, This has overcome all my fears, that the Misfortunes of Contending are far more ſatisfactory to a generous Courage, then never at all to have conteſted. Tho all others who have been created Tribunes to ſecure your Franchiſes, have turn'd all their Power and Authority to your prejudice, o'er ſway'd by Favour, Hopes, or by Rewards; and rather choſe to ſin for Hire, then do juſtly <hi>Gratis.</hi> For theſe reaſons they all ſubmitted under the Domination of a Few, who by their Reputation in War have got Poſſeſſion of the public Treaſure, Armies, Kingdoms, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and make your ſpoils their Towre of ſafety: while you, the Multitude, like to many Sheep ſurrender your ſelvs in Vaſſalage to this and t'other Paramounting Lord, diſpoyl'd of all thoſe Bleſſings which your Fore-fathers left you. But perhaps it is, becauſe as formerly you gave your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages for Rulers, now you give the ſame for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Therefore all your Tribunes flock to them; and if it be your chance to recover your own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you ſhall ſee 'em upon the Turn of the Tyde return to you again. For few have the Courage to defend what beſt they like; the t'other are the ſtonger Party that fight in their own wrong. But can you dream of meeting an Obſtruction when unanimous and reſolute, from thoſe that fear'd ye when remiſs and negligent? unleſs you think
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34632:165"/>
that <hi>Cotta,</hi> a Conſul of the middle Faction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd ſome certain Privileges to the Tribunes for any other reaſon then out of fear: for tho <hi>L. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> firſt adventuring to open his Mouth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Tribunitian Power, was diſappointed while you only mutter'd at it, yet they that oppos'd him firſt began to dread your Hatred, 'ere you would be brought to reſent the Oppreſſion. At which I never can ſufficiently admire, moſt worthy <hi>Romans.</hi> For you knew it was a vanity to tire your Expectations. After the Death of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who impos'd that heavy Bondage, you thought that then the end of all your Miſchiefs was at hand? But there ſprung up a far more Cruel <hi>Catulus.</hi> A Tumult brake out when <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Aemilius Mamerous</hi> were Conſuls; But then <hi>C. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> play'd the Tyrant, even to the fatal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the innocent Tribune. You ſaw laſt year how furiouſly <hi>Lueullus</hi> threatned <hi>L. Quinctius,</hi> and wrought him from his Purpoſe. And laſtly now, how I am plagu'd and harraſs'd among 'em! A needleſs Trouble, would they but once ſurceaſe their Uſurpation before you made an end of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Eſpecially, ſeeing whatever are the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for their civil Broils, the main Conteſt on both ſides is for Dominion over you. Thoſe other Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Licentiouſneſs, Hatred or Avarice are but Flaſhes that extinguiſh in a ſhort Time. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing continues permanent, the end at which both ſides with ardour drive at: and that is to diſpoilye perpetually of the Tribunitial Power, the only Buckler which your Anceſtors provided to ſhield your Liberty, which I admoniſh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ye to conſider: and that you would not, od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changing the Names of things to favour ſloth, call Servitude Tranquillity; which it were not now a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34632:165"/>
Seaſon to enjoy, if Wickedneſs have vanquiſh'd Truth and Honeſty; but had been, had You been altogether lull'd aſleep. Now therefore mind your Buſineſs: for unleſs ye overcome, ſince all Oppreſſion is by its weight the more ſecure, they will be ſure to preſs more bard upon ye. What's my Opinion, then, ſome one will ſay? Firſt then, you muſt lay aſide your preſent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Behaviour; Tongues let looſe at random, Hearts of Mice; no longer mindful of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, then in the Public Place of Meeting. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I exhort ye to thoſe Maſculine Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as when your armed Anceſtors obtain'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritian Magiſtracy to be conferr'd upon the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes by the free and unextorted Votes of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators: altho, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> it be in your Power that what you ſuffer commanded now for others, you may either diſpoſe or not diſpoſe of for your ſelves. Expect ye then great <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or ſome other Deity to be your Adviſer? Thoſe high Commands of the Conſuls and Decrees of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers you confirm by Execution; and haſten of your own accords, that Licence that is made uſe of to your prejudice. Nor do I adviſe ye to the revenge of Oppreſſion, but rather to ſit ſtill and be quiet upon that Account. Neither deſirous of diſcord as they recriminate upon me, but wiſhing an end of all diſorders, do I repeat and recal to your Memory their Miſcarriages; which is no more then the Law of Nations allows me: yet if they obſtinately perſiſt, 'tis neither Force of Arms, not a Seceſſion that I encourage; only I exhort ye, that ye will no longer afford 'em the Advantage of ſhedding your Blood. Let 'em rule, and manage the Government after their own manner, let 'em hunt after Triumph; Let 'em proſecute <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34632:166"/>
Sertorius,</hi> and the remainder of the Exiles, to dignifie their Illuſtrious Statues. Let not them incur the hazard and the danger that have no part of the Profit: unleſs you think your Services re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid by that ſame ſudden Frumentarian Law. A mighty purchaſe, to value your Liberty at Five Buſhels of Wheat, which is no more then the Allowance allotted to the Priſoners in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Goal. For as that ſame ſorry Pittance keeps 'em from ſtarving, yet decays their ſtrength; ſo neither is ſo ſmall a Portion ſufficient to ſupport Your Families; but fruſtrates the ſlender hopes of every Coward. Which, tho large and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent, conſidering it to be the Hopes of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet what a peice of ſottiſhneſs it is to be deluded, and to be thankful for your own dues, ſo parſimoniouſly ſcatter'd among you? For any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way they neither could prevail, nor durſt they ſtrive againſt ye all in General. Nor are you leſs to guard your ſelves againſt their cunning Artifices. For therefore it is they give ye good words on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amuſe and put ye off, till the return of <hi>Pompey.</hi> Whom though they reverence and dread at preſent, and carry about exalted upon their Shoulders, yet when thoſe fears are over, you ſhall hear, how they will rend and mangle his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Neither are theſe Aſſertors of Liberty, as they pretend themſelves, aſham'd to acknowledge their own weakneſs, ſo many without one, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daring to forgive an Injury, nor being able to defend their Rights. For I am certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that as for <hi>Pompey,</hi> a young Gentleman of ſuch high and early Renown, will rather chooſe to be your Chieftain with your own Conſent and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, then aſſociate with them in Tyranny and Uſurpation; and that you will find him no leſs
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34632:166"/>
forward to aſſert the <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Authority. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> in former times, 'twas the Cuſtom for particular Citizens to have Protection of many; never did the entire Body of the People relie upon one ſingle Perſon: neither was it in the Power of any one particular Man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by Gift, or tear away ſuch Privileges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have ſaid enough. Neither is it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clos'd up in Ignorance. But I know not what Stupidity has ſeiz'd your underſtandings, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Honour, nor vile Oppreſſion can move ye: you have made a baſe Exchange of all your former Bravery, for a little preſent Idleneſs; believing you enjoy ſufficient Liberty, becauſe your Backs are ſpar'd or elſe becauſe you are admitted to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhews, the Munificences of your wealthy Lords and Maſters, Privileges indeed not granted to the Country Peaſants; who are ſlaughter'd and cruſh'd to death between the Contentions of the Potent; or beſtow'd in free Gift upon the Magiſtrates in their Provinces. Thus a few both fight and vanquiſh: But the Victory, whatever happens, lights heavy upon the Commons: and dayly will do more and more: while they are ſo induſtirous to defend their Uſurpations, you ſo negligent to redeem your Liberty.</p>

And what the Proſperous wiſh for moſt, Me you ſhall have day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before your Eyes a Preſident, what to embrace, what to refrain in all your future Conduct.

Canſt thou be ignorant, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the Ocean had ſet limits to their Weſtern Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, turn'd the fury of their Arms upon theſe parts? That from the begining they ne'er had any thing but what they got by violence, not ſo much as their Wives and Houſes, much leſs their Lands and Empire? A medley of Vagabonds, having
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34632:169"/>
neither Country nor Kindred, born to be the Plague and Deſtruction of the whole World. Whom neither Laws divine nor human, no fear of Gods or Men can reſtrain from Ranſack, Ravage and Deſtruction both of Friends and Allies, whether remote or neighbours, Powerful or Indigent; profeſs'd and mortal Enemies of all Mankind, that are not Vaſſals to themſelves; of Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more eſpecially.

But thou, the Monarch of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> the biggeſt of Cities, and Soveraign Lord of <hi>Perſia,</hi> what canſt Thou from Them expect, but Treachery at the Preſent, and War hereafter? The <hi>Romans</hi> draw their Swords againſt all Nations, and People, yet moſt keenly ſharpen'd againſt thoſe, who being vanquiſh'd yield the richeſt ſpoils.

               <p>MAny dangers, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me in Peace, and as many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have I met with in War; of which, ſome I have been forc'd to undergo, others I have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded off by the Aſſiſtance of the Gods and my own Vertue. In all which, neither my Courage was wanting to my Buſineſs, nor my Induſtry fail'd my Reſolutions. Adverſity and Proſperity made an Alteration in my Eſtate, but not of my Natural Inclinations. On the other ſide in theſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties all things deſerted me, when Fortune left me. Moreover Old age, cumberſom of it ſelf, re-doubles my cares: conſidering my ſelf in that miſerable Condition, that it is not permitted Me to hope for ſo much as an honeſt death. For if I have been the Parricide of your ſecurity, and being born by Reſtoration from Exile, have diſhonour'd my Houſhold Gods, my Country and the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Magiſtracy, what Torment can be thought ſufficient for Me living, or what puniſhment after my Deceaſe? From my firſt years of Adoleſcency, your Eyes were ſtill upon me both a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a Public Magiſtrate: They who deſir'd it had all my Elocution, my Advice, my Money at their Service; nor did I ever make a Crafty uſe of Eloquence to uphold the Knacks of Law, or Exerciſe my Parts in Miſchief. But covetous of private favour, was forc'd to bow under the weight of ponderous Animoſities for the good of the Commonwealth. At what time depreſs'd when ſhe was quite ſubdu'd, and expecting dayly
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34632:170"/>
nothing but utter ruin, You, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> reſtor'd me to my Country, and my Houſhold Gods, with accumulations of Dignity. For which exceſs of Favours, I could not ſhew my ſelf too grateful, ſhould I for every ſingle Kindneſs expend as many Lives. For Life and Death are only Claims and Rights of Nature; but for a Man to live blameleſs among his fellow-Citizens, entire in his Fortunes and his Reputation, that's a gift kindly as well beſtow'd as acceptably receiv'd. You have made us Conſuls, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> now that the Commonweath is in a moſt diſtracted Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Generals in <hi>Spain</hi> demand Money, Souldiers, Arms and Proviſions: and 'tis but what neceſſity conſtrains 'em to: For that by reaſon of the revolt of our Allies, and the Flight of <hi>Sertorius</hi> among the Mountains, they neither can come to blows, nor get the neceſſary ſupports of Nature. The Exceſſive Power of <hi>Mithridates</hi> compels us to maintain great Armies both in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Cilicia. Macedonia</hi> is crouded with Enemies. Nor are the Maritime Coaſts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Provinces leſs infeſted. In the mean time our Tributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmall, and by reaſon of the Wars, but ill and uncertainly paid, hardly defray a part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences: So that we are forc'd to leſſen the number of our Ships that us'd to carry and convoy our Proviſions. Theſe things whether they befal Us through fraud or negligence do you conſider; and as you find it, puniſh the Offenders. But if it be a general Misfortune and Calamity that attends Us, wherefore is it that ye enterprize things both unworthy of your ſelves, of Us and the Commonwealth. For my own part, whoſe years are near the Precipice of death, I do not wiſh one minute longer of Life, if that might
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34632:170"/>
prove the leaſt Advantage to your ſafety: not deeming this ſame free-born Body of mine can more be honour'd, then by ſubmitting to its diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for your welfare. Here then behold the Conſul <hi>Caius Cotta</hi> ready: ready to do what oft our Anceſtors have done in times of dubious War. I freely devote and offer up my ſelf a Victim for the Commonwealth. Of which, to whom you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall recommend the Care, your ſelves be circumſpect. For no good Man will be covetous of ſuch an Honour, when either he muſt give an account of the ſucceſs of Peace or War by others carry'd on, or ſuffer ignominious death. Only remember this, that I was not cut off for acts of Villany or Avarice, but willingly ſurrendred up my Life in gratitude for exceeding favours. For your own ſakes therefore, moſt worthy <hi>Romans,</hi> and by the Glory of your Anceſtors I conjure ye, a while to be patient in your adverſity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the welfare of the Commonwealth. Great is the Care and many are the toyles that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſupream Command; which in vain ye refuſe, yet ſeek the Opulency of Peace; when all our Provinces, Kingdoms, Seas and Lands are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd and tyr'd with the Calamities and Hardſhips of War.</p>

                  <p>IT was the Common Opinion that formerly the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> people by Fortune had Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, in her Gift, beſides thoſe other things which
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34632:171"/>
Mortal Men ſo greedily thirſt after; becauſe they are frequently poſſeſs'd by Perſons without Deſert, conferr'd as it were at Will and Pleaſure, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Man could boaſt 'em ſtable and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf. But experience has taught us how true it is what <hi>Appius</hi> tells us in his Verſes, <hi>That every Man is the Architect of his own Fortune.</hi> A ſentence more eſpecially verify'd in Thee, who haſt ſo far out-gone all others, that Men are tyr'd firſt with applauding thy Atchievements, ere thou art weary of performing Deeds deſerving Praiſe. But vertuous Acquiſitions like ſumptuous Edifices, are ſtill to be preſerv'd with ſedulous Induſtry; leaſt through negligence they run to decay, or fall to the ground, while the foundations fail. For no Man willingly ſurrenders Empire and Command to another; And though he be Juſt and Mild who is in Power, yet becauſe it is at his Choice to be rigorous and tyrannical, he is dreaded. This comes to paſs, becauſe the moſt that are in high Authority take wrong Meaſures, believing themſelves ſo much the more ſecure, by how much the more puſillanimous and ſervile the People are whom they Command. But quite the contrary to this ought chiefly to be aim'd at; that is to ſay, being Vertuous and Brave thyſelf, thou ſhouldſt endeavour to Command the beſt of Subjects: for he that is lewd himſelf impatiently brooks a Ruler. But thou haſt a more difficult Task then all that were before thee, to ſettle what thou haſt won by force of Arms. For thou haſt wag'd a War more ſoft and gentle then the Peace of others: beſides the Victors demand their Booty; and the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd are thy fellow-Citizens. In the midſt of theſe difficulties there is an honeſt <hi>Medium</hi> to be found out, that the Public Welfare may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34632:172"/>
not by force, as a Foreign Enemy is curb'd, but which is more noble and much more difficult, by the profitable Arts of Peace. Therefore is this a Matter of ſuch importance, as ſummons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Men, as well thoſe of great as of moderate Wiſdom, for every one to give the beſt advice he can. And indeed it is my Opinion that as the Victory is compos'd, the ſettlement of all other things will be the ſame. Now therefore that thou maiſt more readily and firmly order this Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accept of ſome few Notions that occur to my mind.</p>
                  <p>Thou hadſt a War, moſt Noble Emperour, with a Man Illuſtrious for his Birth, of vaſt Riches, moſt greedy of Superiority more <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Contrary to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of</hi> Lucan <hi>and</hi> Cicero, <hi>who ſay that</hi> Pompey <hi>had a good Cauſe, but that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the Gods were againſt him.</hi>
                     </note> Fortunate then Wiſe. Of his Party were but few: ſome through their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice became thy Enemies; others whom Affinity or other Obligations drew to his ſide. For never was any man a ſharer with him in the Supream Authority, which if he could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, the whole, Terreſtrial Globe had never been ſo violently ſhaken with War. The Inferiour Multitude, more out of Cuſtom then judgment flock'd after him as, the more prudent Perſon.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, upon the ſcandalous rumors daily ſpread abroad, inflam'd with hopes of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Commonwealth, many men contaminated with Lewdneſs and Luxury, reſorted to thy Camp; and openly threatned thoſe that were at Peace with Murders, Rapines, and all the worſt of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages to which their impious Minds could prompt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34632:172"/>
'em. Of whom the greateſt part, when they ſaw that neither their debts were paid, nor Fellow-Citizens by thee deſpoil'd and harraſs'd like Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deſerted Thee: only ſome few remain'd, who thought the Camp would be a ſafer Place then <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were continually Dunn'd and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by their Creditors. But for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, incredible it is to relate, both the Quality and the Number of Perſons that troop'd after <hi>Pompey;</hi> whom All that were in debt made uſe of, during the whole time of the War, as of a moſt ſacred and inviolable Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſince now both War and Peace fall under thy Conſideration as the Victor, to the end thou mayſt gently and mildly ſurceaſe the one, and that the other may be juſt and permanent, meditate ſeriouſly with thy ſelf, at whoſe diſpoſal the Compoſition is, and what is moſt proper to be done. For my part I am apt to believe all cruel Dominations more oppreſſive then Diuturnal, not that any one ſingle Perſon can be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, but that the ſame fear returns from many to himſelf. Such a Life wages a continual and doubtful War within a Man; for that being neither ſafe before, behind, or on either ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thy Lot will be to live ſurrounded with fears and dangers: on the other ſide they who have tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd the Severity of Command with Humanity and Clemency, to them all things have appear'd with a joyful and ſmiling Proſpect; by their Enemies more cheerfully obey'd and reverenc'd, then others by their own Subjects. Be there any who for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will deem me a Depraver of thy Conqueſt, or count me a well Wiſher to the Vanquiſh'd? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, becauſe it is my Judgment that what both we and our Fore-fathers have granted to Foreign
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:34632:173"/>
Nations, naturally our Enemies, are equally to be allow'd to Fellow-Citizens; and that neither Slaughter with Slaughter, nor Blood is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd with Blood after the manner of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Has Oblivion cancell'd thoſe Cruelties, that before this War were condemn'd in <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Victory? He ſlew <hi>Domitius, Carbo, Brutus,</hi> and others that were Weaponleſs; not ſlain in Battel, according to the Laws of War, but Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd afterwards when Suppliants with the greateſt Impiety imaginable: the Commonalty of <hi>Rome</hi> were Slaughter'd like Sheep in the Public Palace ordain'd for the Reception of Embaſſadors. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! What hugger mugger Funerals of Citizens, what ſudden Maſſacres committed in the very Arms of Parents and Children! What flights of Women and Infants! What devaſtations of Houſes! Before the Victory by Thee obtain'd, nothing but Outrage, nothing but Cruelty enrag'd. To which the ſame Perſons exhort and ſpur thee on: inſinuating as if the Conteſt between you two had been, which ſhould have the abſolute diſpoſal of Oppreſſion and Injuſtice: that thou didſt not recover, but win the Commonwealth by force of Arms, and for that reaſon, the ſtouteſt and the oldeſt of the Souldiers were ſtill ready to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Fathers, Brothers, nay their very Children; that ſo the moſt wicked of Mortals, from the Miſeries of others, might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſupply the Expences of their Gluttony and exorbitant Luſt, or rather to be the Scandals and Reproaches of thy Victory; as being ſuch, whoſe Debaucheries were a Contamination to the Praiſes of good Men. For I cannot forbear to mind thee, what was their Behaviour and their Modeſty, even

when it was <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>For</hi> Caeſar <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that in</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey<hi>'s Camp the Tents of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ſpread with</hi> Perſian <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and great Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards of Plate expos'd to view, That the Pavilions of</hi> Lentulus <hi>and others were cover'd with</hi> Ivy; <hi>perfect demonstrations of their Luxury and confidence of Victory.</hi>
                     </note> dubious which way Victory would encline and how, when the Enemy was in the field thoſe very Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd themſelves to Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Luxurious Banquets, whoſe Age in times of Peace could not without Reproach have pretended to the Taſt of ſuch immoderate Pleaſures. Thus much concerning War.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the Eſtabliſhing a ſecure Peace; which is the preſent main Deſign of Thee and all thy Followers; Conſider I beſeech thee in the firſt place what it is thou art about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult: for ſo, by ſeparating the Good from the Bad, thou wilt proceed in the open way to Truth. 'Tis my Opinion, ſince all things that have a Beginning muſt have an End, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Fate of <hi>Romes</hi> deſtruction ſhall happ'n to approach her Walls, Citizens ſhall be engag'd in Civil Broyls with Citizens; at what time exhauſted and languiſhing for want of Blood, they will become a Prey to ſome Prince or Nation. Otherwiſe not the whole Globe of Earth, nor all the People of the World united and muſtred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, can either move or bruiſe this Empire. Therefore the Bleſſings of Concord are to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd upon ſure Foundations, and the Miſchiefs of Diſcord to be expell'd. That will ſo come to paſs, if you remove the Licence of expenſive Riot and Rapine. Not recalling antiquated Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtutions,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34632:174"/>
which upon the general Corruption of Manners are now become contemptible; but if you limit the Expences of every particular Family to the Condition of their Fortunes. For now, 'tis the prevailing Cuſtom for Young men to think nothing more brave and generous, then prodigally to waſt their own and the Eſtates of others; to deny nothing to their Pleaſures, or that they take for Gallantry and Magnanimity; deſpiſing Continency and Reſervedneſs, as the Effects of Cowardice.</p>
                  <p>Therefore a Haughty Diſpoſition, once launch'd into deſtructive Courſes, when his accuſtom'd Allowances fail, flies out, inflam'd with inconſiderate fury, ſometimes upon Allies, ſometimes upon his Fellow-Citizens; unſettles the compos'd Order of things, and by Old Practices of Villany ſeeks for New Diſturbances. Wherefore let not the Uſurer for the future be ſufferr'd any longer; that every one may mind his own affairs. That's the true and Plain way, to Officiate in the Magiſtracy for the Benefit of the People, not the Profit of the Creditor; and to ſhew Magnanimity in augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not diminiſhing the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I know how difficult a thing this will be to accompliſh at firſt; eſpecially with thoſe who thought, when Conquerors, to have liv'd with greater Liberty and Licence, not under a more ſtrict Controul. For whoſe ſafety if you rather provide then to uphold their Luxury, you will ſecure both Them and Us and our Allies in a firm and laſting Peace. But if you ſtill connive at the ſame Practices and Debaucheries of our Youth, aſſuredly that High Renown of thine, and that Great City of <hi>Rome,</hi> will in a ſhort time fall to Ruin both together.</p>

In the laſt place, Prudent Men make War for the ſake of Peace, and undergo hardſhips in hopes of reſt and leiſure. Until you fix and aſcertain that Tranquillity what matter is it, whether we are vanquiſh'd or Victors. Wherefore in the name of all the Gods, hold faſt the Helm of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and boldly break through all Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſition as you were wont: for either you muſt heal us, or all Men elſe muſt lay aſide all thought of Cure. Neither does any Man incenſe ye to cruel Puniſhments, or diſmal Executions, by which a City is rather depopulated, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; but rather to reſtrain the vicious Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and luxurious Debaucheries of the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry. That will be real Clemency, to have put a curb upon their Folly and falſe Pleaſures, that Citizens may not come to be deſervedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd their Native Country; to have eſtabliſh'd Peace and Concord; not to have been always a Conniver at their preſent Enjoyments, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sorrow follows at the heels; indulgent to Vice, and remiſsly permitting Offences. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch is my Courage, that it chiefly relies on that which ſcares and daunts moſt undertakers, the Difficulty of the Buſineſs. And becauſe you are now to reform the Diſorders both of Sea and Land and reſtore Tranquillity to the whole World (for ſuch a ſoaring Mind can never ſtoop to little things) the greater the care, the greater will be the recompence. Therefore your Care is mainly to be expended, that the Commonalty, corrupted with Bribes, and public diſtributions of Corn, may be ſo employ'd and kept from Idleneſs, as neither to have Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor Opportunity for Public Miſcheif: but that the Young Men may be enur'd to Probity and Induſtry, and not to hanker after vain Expence,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34632:175"/>
and Riches. Which may be effected, if you take away the abuſe and Reputation of Money, the chiefeſt Plague and Deſtruction of Human Kind. For often revolving in my Mind, by what means the moſt renowned Men attain'd their Greatneſs; what things had rais'd People and Nations to their moſt flouriſhing Eſtates; and laſtly what had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the Ruin and Deſtruction of mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Empires, I ſtill obſerv'd that the ſame things were good, the ſame things Evil; and that always the Victors were Diſpiſers, the Vanquiſh'd always Covetous of Money. Neither can any Man exalt his groveling Thoughts, or Mortal as he is, attain Divine Perfections, unleſs neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Delights of Gold and Bodily Enjoyments, he forbear to Flatter and pamper the Vanity of his Mind, to gratifie perverſe Deſire; but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it in Labour, Patience, wholeſom Precepts, and magnanimous Atchievements. For to build a City Houſe, or Country Palace, and furniſh 'em with Statues, Pictures, Perſian Hangings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſumptuous Ornaments; and tomake a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Shew of all things but Himſelf; This is not to enjoy Riches as an Ornament, but for the Owner to make himſef a Reproach to his Wealth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over they, whoſe Cuſtom it is twice a day to ſtuff their Paunches, and not a Night to ſleep without a Curtezan, when they have oppreſs'd with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude the Mind which ought to Command, in vain expect to make uſe of it as duly exercis'd, when lame and drowſie. For through Imprudence they precipitate themſelves and moſt of their deſigns. But theſe and all other Miſchiefs will ceaſe with the Adoration of Money, when neither theſe Gaudy Pomps, nor any other Things ſo much thirſted after by Magiſtrates and Vulgar are any longer ſet to ſale.</p>

Morever care is to be taken that <hi>Italy</hi> and the Provinces may be more ſecure: wherein there is not ſo much difficulty neither. For the ſame Men lay all the Countries deſolate, deſerting their own Habitations, and through Oppreſſion ſeizing thoſe of other Perſons. Moreover let not the Stipends of the Souldiers, or their years of ſervice be either unjuſtly or impartially num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd. While ſome are <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Moſt men have wit enough, or think they have, to cenſure others; and every one is forward and quick to find fault with the deeds and ſayings of other Men; their Mouths are ſcarce wide enough, nor their Tongues ſufficiently nimble to troul out the haſty Conceptions of their Envy or their private diſguſt; Though notwithſtanding all the Blaſts of their cenſorious Deſcants, I do not at all repent me of the Enterprize; rather it would have been a trouble to me to have been ſilent.

                  </argument>
                  <p>I Am not ignorant, how difficult and dangerous and Attempt it is to give Counſel to a Prince or Emperor. or indeed to any Man, who ſits in the Upper Region of great Authority; Conſidering that they can neither want Adviſers, and that no man is ſufficiently circumſpect or prudent to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee future Events. Beſides, oft-times it ſo falls out that precipitate and evil Counſels are attended with more proſperous ſucceſs, then the moſt grave and ſerious of deliver'd Opinions, by reaſon For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune rules the World at Pleaſure. I muſt confeſs, when I was Young, my Inclinations lead me to the management of Public Affairs; and my greateſt Care and Study was to underſtand the depth of thoſe Myſteries. Not only that I might appear great in Offices and Employments of high Dignity, which many had obtain'd by wicked and corrupt means; but that I might be acquainted with the true State of the Commonwealth both at home and abroad, and what her intrinſic ſtrength might be of Warlike Proviſions, of Men and Money. At length revolving many things in my Mind, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to prefer your Dignity before my own Reputation and Reſerv'dneſs, and to run any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard that might be advantageous to your Honour. Nor did I make this Reſolution raſhly, or in Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34632:176"/>
of your good Fortune; but becauſe in you I obſerv'd, one particular Excellency above all the reſt, to be egregiouſly admit'd; I mean, a greater Courage always in Diſaſter, then in Proſperity. But this is ſtill no more then what is yet more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from other men, who are tyr'd with applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admiring your Munificence, before you are weary of performing Deeds deſerving Fame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. And I am firmly perſwaded there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſublime or ſo profound, but what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the eaſy reach of your thoughts. Nor have I ſent ye my Opinion and Judgment concerning the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Commonwealth, as having a higher conceit then becomes me of my Advice and Parts; but becauſe I thought it neceſſary in the midſt of Military Toyls, in the hurry of Battels, Victories and high Command, to retrieve back your thoughts, ſometimes to the Conſideration of Civil Affairs.</p>
                  <p>For if it be your only deſign to ſecure your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the violence of your Enemies, or how to retain the favour of the People, that you may be able to cope with the Conſul, you harbour thoughts unworthy of your Courage. But if your Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity ſtill continue ſuch, as from the beginning diſturb'd the Faction of the Nobility; recover'd the <hi>Roman</hi> People out of heavy Bondage into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; that during your Pretorſhip, unarm'd and naked as you were, out-brav'd and daunted the inſulting Fury of the Enemy; and both at home and abroad perform'd ſo many and ſuch far fam'd Exploits, that your very Adverſaries have nothing to object againſt ye but your Greatneſs; vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to accept theſe few Notions of Mine, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grand Concerns of the Commonwealth, which you will find to be true, or at leaſt not far
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:34632:177"/>
remote from Truth. For ſince that <hi>Pompey</hi> either through overſight, or elſe becauſe he car'd not what he did to obſtruct your Proceedings, fell into ſuch a Fatal Error, as to put Weapons into the hands of his Enemies, by the ſame means that he brought all things out of Order, the ſame Courſes muſt you take to reſtore Tranquillity to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place he reſign'd his abſolute Power of diſpoſing of the Imperial Revenue, the Public Expences and the Penal Laws into the hands of a Few Senatours: but as for the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonalty, in whom the Supream Power was veſted before, he left 'em without ſo much as the Relief of Common Juſtice. For Cauſes and Actions are ſtill committed to the determination of the three <hi>Orders,</hi> yet the ſame ſmall Number of Tyrants are above all, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all, place and diſplace as they think fit; They circumvent and oppreſs the Innocent; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own Tools and Favourites to Honour. Neither Iniquity nor Scandal, nor the moſt hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous of Crimes are any obſtruction, to debar their aſſuming Offices of Truſt and Dignity: Whatever is commodious and profitable they haul and tear away by violence: Laſtly, as if the City were taken by Aſſault, abſolute Will and licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Domineering are the only Laws they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. And yet it would not grieve me much thus ſervilely to be enthrall'd, according to their uſual Practice, had they obtain'd the Victory by their Bravery and Valour. But it perplexes me to ſee the moſt ſloathful among Mortals, all whoſe Vigor and Courage lies in their boaſting Tongues, inſolently exerciſing a Tyranny offer'd 'em by Chance, and through the Remiſſneſs of another. For what Civil Sedition and Diſſention ever extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:34632:177"/>
ſo many and ſuch Illuſtrious Families? Or whom did ever Victory ſo precipitate and render ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normouſly Outragious? <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> who had ſome pretence as a Victor, to plead the Laws of War in juſtification of his Cruelty, though he knew his Intereſt, could no way better be ſecur'd then by the Capital Puniſhment of his Enemies; yet after he had put ſome few to death choſe rather to reſtrain the reſt by Clemency then Fear. But now, beſides <hi>Cato, L. Domitius</hi> and others of the ſame Faction, above Forty Senators, and many Young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of great Hopes have been ſlaughter'd like Victims on the Altar; and yet the moſt cruel of all Mankind, cannot be ſatiated with the Blood of ſo many miſerable Fellow-Citizens. Neither Orphans, nor aged Parents, not the Moans of Men; nor the Lamentations of Women could mollify their inexorable Inhumanity: but every day more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then other, and raging both in Word and Deed, ſome they degraded from their Dignities, while others were expell'd their Native Country. Nay what ſhall I ſay of You your ſelf, whoſe ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fall the baſeſt of Men, were it permitted 'em, would purchaſe with the loſs of their own Lives? Whoſe Tyranny is not ſo great a Pleaſure to 'em (though it befel 'em unexpected) as your high Dignity a Grief and Diſturbance to their Minds. Men that would rather chooſe to bury their own Liberty in your Calamity, then that the Empire of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould by your means of Glorious be made the moſt Glorious in the World: So much the more then it ought to be your daily care to fortify and eſtabliſh your own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. For my part what my own thoughts are, I will not be afraid to utter: 'tis in your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only to make Trial of what you think moſt probable and beneficial.</p>

The City, according to what I have heard from my Anceſtors, I take to be divided into two Parts; the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Common People.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Chief Authority reſted in the <hi>Fathers;</hi> but the greater Force by far was in the People. Thence frequent Seceſſions in the City, and ſtill the Power of the Nobility leſſen'd; but the Privileges of the People were enlarg'd. By that means the Commonalty liv'd in Freedom, becauſe the Power of no Man was above the Law: the Noble ſurpaſs'd the ignoble not in Wealth or Pride, but in Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and valiant Exploits. Every one alike hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Plough or in War, wanting nothing of honeſt and neceſſary accomodation, thought he had ſufficient to ſerve himſelf, enough to ſerve his Country. But when expell'd by degrees from their Poſſeſſions, Lazineſs and Poverty compell'd 'em to ſeek uncertain Habitations, then they began to thirſt after other Mens Eſtates, and to ſet to ſale, both their Liberty and the Commonwealth. Thus inſenſibly the People, then the Lords of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dwindl'd into Contempt; and inſtead of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in Common, every particular Perſon procur'd his own Slavery.</p>
                  <p>This Multitude therefore, firſt infected with ill Manners, then diſpers'd into ſundry Trades and Courſes of Life, no way united among themſelves, ſeems to Me by no means fit to manage the Commonwealth. But being intermixt with new Citizens, my mind gives me, that ſo, they may be all awaken'd and rouz'd up to Liberty; while the one would be careful to preſerve their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the other glad to ſhake off the Fetters of their Servitude. Theſe Citizens thus blended, old and new together, my Judgment is, you ſhould diſtribute into <hi>Colonies.</hi> By which means your
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:34632:178"/>
Militia will become more Numerous, and the Common People, honeſtly employ'd, will forbear crowding after Miſchief and Sedition.</p>
                  <p>But yet I am not ignorant, when this is put in Execution, what Storms and Tempeſts the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will raiſe; how they will rage and clamour, that things are turn'd Topſie Turvy; that the antient Citizens are enſlav'd; and laſtly that there will be a change of the Government, from a Free State into a Monarchy, when by the favour of one ſingle Perſon an infinite Multitude ſhall be admitted ſharers of the City Privileges. However I am firmly convinc'd that he admits a wicked Crime into his Boſom, who to the diſadvantage of the Public welfare ſtrives for the favour of a Private Faction. More eſpecially where the Public good redounds to particular Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to heſitate in ſuch an Enterprize, I look upon to be the greateſt mark of Sloath and Cowardice immaginable.</p>
                  <p>It was always the Deſign of <hi>M. Livius Druſus,</hi> in his Tribuneſhip, to contend with all his might, for the Nobility: nor did he intend at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to have acted any thing of Importance but in purſuance of their Decrees. But certain Factious Perſons prizing Fraud and Malice above Honeſty and Fidelity, when they underſtood that by the Means of one Perſon ſo great a Benefit would accrue to ſuch a vaſt number of People, every one, Conſcious to himſelf of his own wicked and Treacherous Diſpoſition, had the ſame ill O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Druſus</hi> as of themſelves. Therefore afraid, leaſt by ſo great a Favour he ſhould get the ſole Power into his hands, contriving all they could to hinder him, they broke the Neck of his and their own Deſigns together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:34632:179"/>
Therefore, Noble Emperor, 'tis your Buſineſs to make a more Induſtrious Proviſion of Friends and Guards, all Perſons of approv'd Integrity. 'Tis no great difficulty for a Man of Courage and daring Boldneſs to ſuppreſs an Open Enemy; but the beſt of Men as they ſcorn the Contrivance, ſo are they leſs eaſily induc'd to ſuſpect, and conſequently ſhun occult and treacherous Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon when you have introduc'd thoſe new Members into the City, becauſe the Commonalty will be then recall'd, ſtudy to your utmoſt the Introduction likewiſe of good and laudable manners; and by Concord to Unite the new and old together. But a far greater Benefit will accrue to your Country, your Citizens, your ſelf, your Offspring, and laſtly to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if you can but quench that Immoderate Thirſt of Gold, or at leaſt abate it to that degree that the Seaſon of Reformation will bear. Otherwiſe it will be impoſſible to regulate either private Miſdemeanors or public Abuſes, either at home or abroad. For where the raging Deſire of Riches has once got Footing, neither Diſcipline, nor Vertuous Induſtry, nor Generous Ingenuity can ever Flouriſh; but early or late, at laſt the Soul will Flag, and Languiſh under the Burthen of looſe Temptations.</p>
                  <p>I have often heard what Kings, what Cities and Nations once grown Opulent, have loſt great Empires, which when Indigent, they won by their Courage: which is no Miracle at all. For when a ſtout man ſees another weaker then himſelf more Illuſtrious for his Wealth; more cring'd to and courted, he's chaf'd at firſt; and with a thouſand Agonies torments his mind:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:34632:179"/>
At length, as every day more and more Deſire of Glory vanquiſhes Honour, and Opulency over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Vertue, the Mind revolts from Truth to Pleaſure. For Glory is cheriſh'd by Induſtry; take that away, Vertue of it ſelf, becomes bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unpleaſant. Laſtly, where Riches are in high Eſteem, all things good and ſacred then are undervalu'd, Fidelity, Integrity, Shame and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. For to Vertue there's but one, and that a ſteep and rugged Paſſage: to Money, every Body chuſes the Road that likes him beſt; for Wealths acquir'd as well by honeſt as by evil Practices.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place take away the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Authority of Money: for no Man will make a Judgment this or that way in Point of Life or Honour; when 'tis apparent that neither Pretors or Conſul are created according to their wealth, but as they Merit. However in the choice of Magiſtrates let the Election of the People be free. Where the Judges are approv'd by few, it is an Argument of Royalty; to chooſe 'em for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is diſhoneſt. Wherefore I could wiſh that all the Judges were of the firſt Claſſis, but more in number then at this time. For neither the <hi>Rhodians</hi> nor any other Cities ever repented of their Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, where Rich and Poor promiſcuouſly, as they came into Court, debated as well the moſt Important as the ſlighteſt Affairs. But as to the Creation of Magiſtrates, I think I may without abſurdity commend the Law, which <hi>C. Gracehus</hi> propounded to the People in his Tribuneſhip, that the <hi>Centuries</hi> ſhould be ſummon'd out of the five <hi>Claſſes,</hi> without any premeditated Choice or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; by which means being alike equal in Dignity and Wealth, they would ſtrive to excel one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Vertue; and theſe I deeme to be the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34632:180"/>
Remedies againſt Riches. For all things are applauded or deſir'd, according to the Uſe which is made of thoſe things: Rewards are the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Wickedneſs; take away the Hire, there's no Man will do an evil Act for nothing. But A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice is a Savage, cruel and intolerable Monſter; wherer'e it bends its Bulky force, it tramples and lays waſte whole Cities, Fields, Temples, Houſes; turns all things both Divine and Humane into a Chaos and Confuſion; neither Armies nor Walls can withſtand its Fury: in a word it robs all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of their Reputation, Chaſtity, Children and Parents. But take away the Glory of Money, and that impetuous Force of Avarice will ſoon be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by good Manners. And tho all Mortal men both juſt and unjuſt, know theſe things to be true, nevertheleſs you will have a ſharp Combat with the Faction of the Nobility; whoſe Wiles and Stratagems if you can warily eſcape, the reſt will ſucceed of courſe, according to your Wiſhes. For theſe Men, had they but ſo much Courage, would rather emulate, then envy the brave and generous. But being totally poſſeſſed with Idleneſs, Stupidity, and Cowardice, they make a noiſe, detract and look upon the Reputation of another to be their Diſgrace. But wherefore ſhould I make more words as if I ſpoke of Men that were unknown to the World? The Fortitude and Valour of <hi>M. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> made open way to the Conſulſhip; one that ſcarce had the uſe of his Tongue; and for his Parts, more wicked then crafty. How far can ſuch a one preſume to dare, to whom the Conſular Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the higheſt of Commands was but a meer Diſgrace? Can greater Abilities be aſcrib'd to <hi>L. Domitius,</hi> a Man that has not a Member, but what is contaminated with Villany and laſcivious Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance?
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34632:180"/>
A boaſting Vain-glorious Tongue; Hands embru'd in Blood; Heels nimble and ſpeedy in flight; beſides his other Incontinences not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be nam'd. <hi>Cato</hi>'s the only Perſon among 'em, whoſe Parts are not to be contemn'd, a Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Talkative, Double-dealing Fox, the Effects of <hi>Grecian</hi> Education: but neither Induſtry, Vertue or Vigilancy are to be found among the <hi>Greeks.</hi> For can it be imagin'd, that they who have loſt their Liberty through ſloth at Home, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inſtruct others to command? The reſt of the Faction are a Crew of noble Drones; who Statue-like, beſides the Name, can Challenge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe of worth but Form and Feature. <hi>L. Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius,</hi> and <hi>M. Favonius</hi> ſeem to me like the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Lading of ſome great Fly-boat, which if the Veſſel arrive ſafe in Harbour, may be ſome way uſeful, but in a Storm are the firſt undervalu'd things thrown over-board. And now, having thus far, to my own thinking, ſufficiently diſcours'd the Point of renewing and reforming the Commonalty, I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat of what may ſeem proper to be done in reference to the Senate.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as I grew Ripe in years and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I was not ſo much for Exerciſe of Arms, or managing of Horſes, but rather for the ſtudious part of Learning: that is to ſay, finding where my ſtrength lay, I betook my ſelf to the Labours of the Brain. During which retirement, by reading and hearing much, I found that all Kingdoms, Cities, Nations, were proſperous ſo long, and flouriſh'd in Command, while they were guided by True and uncorrupted Counſels: but that when thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels came to be tainted once by Favour, fear or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſoon after their Power decay'd; in the next place, they loſt their Dominion, and laſtly were
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:34632:181"/>
enſlav'd. And therefore 'tis my abſolute Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that whoever is advanc'd to a more Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and Illuſtrious degree in his City, above all things, ought to be more eſpecially careful of the public Welfare. For all the reſt are only ſafe in their Liberty, ſo long as the City is ſecure: They who by their Vertue have acquir'd Riches, Honour, and Authority, when they perceive the Common-wealth in a declining Poſture, they are preſently alarm'd, and their reſtleſs Minds are vex'd with various Cares and Toyls: they are preſently for defending their Honour, their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or their Eſtates: they beſtir themſelves, they are here and there, all in a hurry; The more they flouriſh'd in Proſperity, the more grievouſly and impatiently they brook Adverſity. Therefore when the Commonalty obeys the Senate, as the Body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the Soul, and reſpectfully execute their Commands, it behoves the Fathers to be able in Councel; for ſubtilty and cunning are ſuperfluous in the People. Our Anceſtors therefore, when low reduc'd by dangerous and cruel Wars, after they had loſt their Men, their Horſes, and their Money, were never weary of contending with their Swords in their hands for the Empire. Neither want of Treaſure, nor the prevailing Power of the Enemy, nor threatning Calamity could ſubdue their generous Courages, but that what they had won by their Valour they reſolv'd to defend to the laſt drop of Blood. Which they did rather by ſage and prudent Counſels, then fortunate in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. For among them there was but one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for the Welfare of that they all conſulted: Faction was contriv'd and ſow'd among their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. All Men exercis'd their Bodies and their Wits for the good of their Country, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own private Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:34632:181"/>
But now the Caſe is alter'd; the Nobility, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with ſloth and Cowardice, knowing neither what Hardſhip, Enemies or Warfare mean, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating nothing but Faction at home, proudly Lord it over all the Nations. Thus the Fathers, by whoſe prudence the tottering Eſtate of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was formerly re-eſtabliſh'd, now under Oppreſſion, are driven fluctuating this way and that way, with the Tyrannick blaſts of Will and Pleaſure; ſometimes they decree one thing, then another: as if they thought there were no other public Good or Evil, but what the private Grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or the Arrogancy of their Lords and Maſters dictated. Whereas if all had equal Liberty, or the Decrees were render'd leſs Authentic: The Commonwealth would grow more powerful; the Nobility leſs potent. But becauſe it is impoſſible to pleaſe all Men, or to level the Degrees of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Birth, while the Nobility enjoy the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſts of their vertuous Anceſtors, Honour, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and numerous Tenants; on the other ſide the multitude are for the moſt part ignorant and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, let 'em be free in the Delivery of their Opinions. Thus the Power of others no way rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching themſelves, and conſequently leſs diſcernable, will be the more eaſily brook'd. The good as well as the bad, the Coward and the Valiant, all are deſirous of Liberty. But the more ſilly ſort of Men, which are the greateſt part, deſert it out of Fear: and while the conflict is dubious, before the Victory be won, baſely ſubmit their Necks as vanquiſh'd to the Yoke of Servitude.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in my Opinion, there are two ways to reſtore the dignity of the Senate: Firſt, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons being augmented, they may be order'd
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:34632:182"/>
to deliver their Votes in <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Of theſe Tables two were to be given to every Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; in the one of which were written theſe two Letters</hi> U. R. <hi>or, Let it be as you ask: in the other a great Roman</hi> A. <hi>They that lik'd the Decree threw into a little Cheſt for that purpoſe the firſt Tablet; they that diſlik'd it the latter with the</hi> A. <hi>that is,</hi> Antiquo, <hi>I deny it. The Tables thus caſt in were number'd, which and which, and then the difference of both ſides ſet down in another void Table in little Pricks or Dots: Thus neither could any Man recal his Vote; nor could it be known who was for or againſt the Decree.</hi>
                     </note> Tables.</p>
                  <p>The Tables will be a means that every Man may be bold to uſe his Freedom: In multitude there will be more aſſurance, and ampler Benefit. For now adays it falls out ſo, that many being taken up in hearing public Controverſies, others employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſoliciting their own and the private Affairs of their Friends, there are few that attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Public. Beſides that many times it is not buſineſs ſo much, as the Commands of their domineering Superiours, which deter 'em from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Appearances. The Grandees forſooth, with ſome few of the <hi>Senatorian</hi> Order, Chips of the ſame Block, They are the Men that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere they pleaſe to approve, revoke, anull, decree, and then at Pleaſure put in execution. But when after the number of the Senators ſhall be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they ſhall be forc'd to give their Votes by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, you ſhall find they will lay their Loftineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, when they muſt be obedient to thoſe, o'er whom before they Tyrannouſly domineer'd.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, moſt noble Emperour, upon reading theſe Letters, you may deſire to know, what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:34632:182"/>
of Senators I think ſufficient, and how they may be diſtributed into ſundry and various Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and becauſe 'tis my Opinion that the Judgments of the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> ought to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what number of Judges, what Method of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection may be moſt convenient? To every one of which particulars, it would be no difficult thing to return an Anſwer; but it behoves Us firſt to diſcharge our ſelves of the grand Concern of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and to aſcertain the Truth of what we have deliver'd in that Point. If you reſolve to make uſe of this Method of proceeding; there will be little Difficulty in what comes after. 'Tis my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that my Advice may be both wholſome and profitable. For then according to your Succeſs my Reputation will extend it ſelf. But that which I am much more zealous for at preſent is this; that the Commonwealth may be reliev'd and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſoon as may be, let the Manner and the Methods be what they will, Liberty is that which I more highly prize then Honour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt renowned Emperour, I beſeech and beg it of ye, that ſince the Gallic Nation is ſo happily ſubdu'd, you will not ſuffer the mighty and invincible Empire of the <hi>Roman</hi> People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume away with Age, or by Diſcord and Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be diſſolv'd. For ſhould that come to paſs, aſſuredly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Day or Night would eaſe the Anguiſh of your Mind; but ſtill a reſtleſs Fury, that were would give ye leave to cloſe your Eyes, would be the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your latter days.

obſerv'd by the All-ſeeing Eye of the Divine Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that there is an account taken of all the good or evil Deeds of Men: and that naturally vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rewards attend the good and bad. Perchance they move with a ſlower pace; yet every man hopes according to his Conſcience. Certainly had your Country and your Progenitors the Liberty to diſcourſe ye, they would uſe no other then theſe Expreſſions.

                  <p>For theſe moſt extraordinary Kindneſſes we do not require from thee, any Act of Lewdneſs or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; but to reſtore our Liberty ſubverted.

For as yet, tho thy Atchievments have been famous both in Peace and War, however thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is but equal with that of many other illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons. But if thou doſt reſtore almoſt from utter Ruin, a City the moſt celebrated for its Name and large extent of Empire, who will be more renown'd, who more illuſtrious upon Earth? But if otherwiſe it befal this Empire through thy lingring Sickneſs or Death, who ſo ſtupid not to dread the Devaſtations, Wars and Slaughters that will ravage all the Nations of the World.</p>
                  <p>Thus if you have an honeſt Intention to gratifie your Country and your Anceſtors, ſucceeding

But he that could do nothing, he was ſure to be accus'd; ether he came to ſtorm thy Houſe; or he had plotted to Murder the Senate; in ſhort, thou hadſt evidence enough againſt him. If I accuſe thee falſely, give an account how thou cam'ſt by ſuch an Eſtate; what were thy Gettings by bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wrangling at the Bar? where thou hadſt the Money to erect thoſe ſumptuous Edifices, the <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> and the <hi>Pompeianum?</hi> Or if thou haſt nothing to ſay, who can be ſo ſilly as to doubt, thou didſt rake thy Wealth out of the Blood and Bowels but of thy fellow Citizens?</p>
               <p>But perhaps this Upſtart of <hi>Arpinum,</hi> deſcended from the Family of <hi>C.

But is this an Argument of his Amity and Verture? A very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Story: the moſt inconſtant of Men, a Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his Enemies, contumelious to his Friends; ſometimes of this, ſometimes of that ſide; faithful to no body; a Shuttlecock of a Senator; a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinary Patron; no part of whoſe Body is free from the Contamination of Lewdneſs: a vain Tongue, rapacious Hands, an Abyſs like Throat, and ſpeedy

Fortunate when thou wert Conſul, <hi>Cicero!</hi> rather unhappy and miſerable, which ſuffer'd the moſt cruel Proſcription of her Citizens; when thou, in the Diſtractions of the Commonwealth, conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned'ſt all good Men, diſmay'd with fear to obey thy Tyranny; when all Penal proceedings, all the Laws were in thy hands; when after thou hadſt abrogated the <hi>Porcian</hi> Law, and made a Rape upon our Liberty, Thou hadſt aſſum'd to thy ſelf the Power of all our Lives and Deaths.</p>
               <p>But 'tis not enough that thou haſt done what thou haſt done unpuniſh'd; thou put'ſt us always in Mind of it; and throweſt it in our Teeths: we are not permitted to forget our Slavery. Prethee, Good <hi>Circero,</hi> be contented with what thou haſt acted; Pride thy ſelf in what thou haſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd: 'tis enough that we have been the ſufferers. But why ſhouldſt thou ſtill load our Ears with what we hate, thy odious Name? Wilt thou perſecute us with thy preſumptuous ſurquedry?</p>

               <p>As if thou hadſt perform'd thoſe things of which thou boaſts, not arm'd, but with thy hands in thy Gown ſleeves; or that there were any difference between thee and <hi>Sylla</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> but only the Title of Command.</p>

whom <hi>Minerva</hi> inſtructed in all the Sciences, the Mighty <hi>Jupiter</hi> admitted into the Council of the Gods; and <hi>Italy</hi> when baniſh'd, brought back upon her Shoulders. I beſeech thee, dear <hi>Romulus</hi> of <hi>Arpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> who haſt ſurmounted in Valour all the <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s, <hi>Fabius</hi>'s, and <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, what Office doſt thou hold in this City? what Faction Suits with thy Humour beſt? What Friends, what Enemies haſt thou? The lewdeſt in the City are thy Friends, thy Enemies all thoſe that love the Commonwealth. The Perſons, whom fain thou would'ſt have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd in the City, thou courteſt like a Courteſan. Elſe, returning out of Exile from <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> wherefore didſt thou follow them? They who were Tyrants formerly, their Grandeur now delights thee: They who were thy Patriots before, are now Mad-men, and Lunaticks. Thy Tongue is oyl'd for <hi>Vatinius: Sextius</hi> is a Knave. Thou mak'ſt nothing, ſawcily to wound the Reputation of <hi>Bibulus:</hi> but <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s extoll'd. Him whom thou couldſt have eaten once, obſequiouſly now thou fawn'ſt upon. Thou think'ſt one thing ſitting, another ſtanding; of the Commonwealth: a Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Fugitive, that knows not where to put his Confidence.</p>
