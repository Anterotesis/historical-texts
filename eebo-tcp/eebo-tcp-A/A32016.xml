            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are here met this day to keep a day of humiliation, to out-cry the cry of our sinnes by the cry of our Prayers, and teares, to wrastle with God, with our hearts, and with the devill: With God for a blessing upon England &amp; Ireland; with our hearts, to get and keep them in a frame sutable to the worke; with the devill, least he steale away the benefit of this day. Now as the <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 1</note> Wiseman saith, <hi>Who knowes what a day may bring forth?</hi> Who knows what a mercy such a day as this may bring forth? Who knows what a rare successe this day may have throughout all England? The Lord give a blessing unto it.</p>
            <p>To help you in the work of this day, I have chosen this Text. It is the skill of a workeman, not only to make good work, but <hi>fit</hi> worke. A garment is not well made, though never so good, if not <hi>fit</hi> made: This hath been my care to choose a <hi>fit text.</hi> It

cannot be denyed but that God hath done much for England, and that England hath done much against God. Now my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to lay the sins of England against God in one scale, and the mercies of God to England in the other scale, and to call upon you this day to be humbled, and ashamed, and broken in heart before the Lord, that ever you should sinne against such a God. There are but two wayes to breake a stony heart: As there are two wayes to cure a stone in the bladder: either by cutting out the stone, or by dissolving it with soft medicines; So there are but two wayes to cure a stony heart: either by the <hi>heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting</hi> threatnings of the Law, or by the <hi>heart-melting</hi> mercies of the Gospell; I have this day chosen the latter way. I will not carry you up to <hi>Mount Eball,</hi> or <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi> But to the <hi>Mount of Blessings.</hi> And I shall labour by the heart-dissolving mercies of the Gospell to breake your stony hearts: It is the duty of a Minister to follow God in his providence. When God sends judgements upon a Nation, then must we preach judgements to that Nation; But when he sends mercies, then must we preach mercy: Now God hath brought England into the <hi>schoole of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and hath placed it <hi>in the highest forme,</hi> and hath made it Captaine of the schoole. And it is my duty to teach you what lessons you are to learne in this schoole. This Text holds forth one lesson, which is the proper lesson for this day, and that is, to be confounded and ashamed, that ever we should sinne against such a God. I read in the second of Judges, that there came an <hi>Angell of the Lord from Gilgall, to the people of Israel in Bochim,</hi> and preached a Sermon of mercy, in which he commemorates, First Gods kindnesse in bringing them out of Egypt, and into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; and secondly, Their unkindnesse in disobeying of God: And all the people when they had heard this Sermon, <hi>lifted up their voyces and wept,</hi> in so much as the very place was called <hi>Bochim, that is, Weepers.</hi> This Angell was not an <hi>Angell properly so called,</hi> but a <hi>Minister,</hi> as most thinke: And therefore he is said to come <hi>from Gilgall,</hi> not <hi>from beaven:</hi> The Rabbines say it was <hi>Pbine has the sonne of Eleazar:</hi> God hath sent me hither this day as his Angell upon the same Embassage, I am to reminde you of Gods merci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This is apparent out of the text: When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> wrote these words, the house of Israel was in the house of bondage, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Babylon.

            <p>My desire is that this Doctrine may be a <hi>Looking-glasse</hi> for this Nation, in which we may behold the severall miracles of mercy that God hath bestowed upon us: A Nation not worthy to be beloved, and yet beloved above all Nations of the world; God hath made us like <hi>Saul,</hi> taller by the head in mercies than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations: There was indeed a time when this Island was called <hi>Albion, ab albis Rupibus;</hi> but at that time it was black, and defiled, worshipping of stockes and stones, even the Devill in stead of God: We had our <hi>Druides,</hi> our <hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiflamines;</hi> We offered our Sonnes and daughters alive in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Non ad honorem, sed ad injuriam religionis:</hi> Our religion was <hi>Tristissimum superstitionum Chaos,</hi> as <hi>Cambden</hi> saith: but it pleased God, presently after the death of Christ to send the Christian Religion among us: Christ made haste to convert England; Some say that <hi>James</hi> the brother of <hi>John,</hi> some <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First, The <hi>bappy Pacification between<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Scotland and England;</hi> God hath freed us from <hi>Civill</hi> warres, which of all warres are most <hi>uncivill;</hi> from intestine warres, warres that would have eaten out our owne bowels; from warres of <hi>Protestant</hi> with <hi>Protestant,</hi> which of all warres are most cruell: <hi>Odia proximo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sunt acerrima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>mighty turne that God hath made in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the better;</hi> for wee were all upon the <hi>Tropicks</hi> turning to Popery, as some that are most moderate do now confesse: The ill affected party had got a mighty faction, men in authority &amp; power; pits were digged for the Righteous; Gallowses provided for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> because hee would not bow to <hi>Haman;</hi> dens of Lions for <hi>Daniel,</hi> because he would not leave praying; fiery sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces for the three <hi>children,</hi> because they would not worship the golden <hi>Image;</hi> dungeons for <hi>Jeremy,</hi> because he would preach the truth with boldnesse; We were like <hi>firebrands</hi> in the fire; like <hi>birds</hi> in the snare; but God Almighty hath made a blessed turne of things for the better: the enemies are throwne into the dens &amp; dungeons they prepared for the godly, the pits they digged for others they themselves are fallen into; the enemies of the Church hang downe their heads, and the godly begin to lift them up; Our <hi>Isaacs</hi> are delivered, and the <hi>Rammes</hi> are caught in the bush, and as the Wiseman saith, <hi>The Righteous</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 8</note> 
               <hi>is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked commeth in his stead; The wicked shall be a ransome for the righteous, and the transgressours for</hi>

               <hi>the upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Protestation against all Popery and Popish Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> next to that Protestation from which we beare the name of Protestants the greatest mercy; God hath brought a great deale of good to this Kingdome by it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>great hope we have of a reformation of the Church and State.</hi> We may now say in some good measure, as it is Canticles 2. 11. <hi>The winter is past, the raine is over and gone, the flowers appeare on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62122:7"/>
You know the birds sing early in the morning at the break of day, and the flowers appeare at the beginning of the Spring; Blessed be God, here is a faire spring towards, the day begins to dawne, Reformation begins to blossome, and we hope that the winter of adversitie is past and gone, unlesse our new sinnes do provoke God to repent of the good he intends to do unto us, as hee dealt with <hi>Saul</hi> for his new transgression, after hee had thought to have established him King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The <hi>many grievous yoakes that God hath freed us from,</hi> so many, as that the day would hardly suffice to repeat them: God hath delivered us from <hi>Civill yoakes,</hi> and from <hi>Spirituall;</hi> from Monopolies; from the late Canons mounted up against all good men, but now turned against themselves; from the Star-Chamber, and from the terrible High Commission, that wrack and torture of conscience, and conscientious men; which was appointed like the dogs in the <hi>Capito<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Sixthly, The <hi>discovery of the secret underminers that have for these many yeares laboured to blow up our Religion,</hi> and under the name of <hi>Puritan</hi> to scare all men from being <hi>Protestants:</hi> God hath done to us as he did to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he hath opened a <hi>doore in the wall</hi> to behold all the trecheries that are plotted in secret, &amp; there is nothing devised against Church or State, but God raises up one <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>isha</hi> or other to discover it; in so much as we may say of England, as <hi>Balaam</hi> of the Israelites, <hi>Surely there is no <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nchantment against England, neither is there any divination against the Houses of Parliament.</hi> Here are six mercies: Now there are also divers cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances with which these mercies are apparelled, that are as remarkeable as the mercies themselves; as we say of some things, that the curious workmanship of them is more worth than the things themselves, (as in a Watch or Clocke) so these circumstances are as glorious and as observable (if not more) than the mercies themselves; and these are likewise six.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62122:7"/>
First, for God to doe all this for England, and to doe it in a <hi>legall way, in a Parliamentary way.</hi> This is the first Circumstance. It was that which our enemies did much threaten that wee should never see Parliament more, but blessed be God, we doe see it to our great joy and comfort. It was the happines of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that in her <hi>first reformation</hi> she was acted by authority: Our reformation began from the <hi>head,</hi> and not from the <hi>feet:</hi> And it is now no little blessing, That this second reformation beginnes from the heads of our Tribes in the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>good way of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and not by a popular tumult.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to doe it in a <hi>peaceable way:</hi> It is with us as it was in the building of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; Here is no noise of ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, or axes, but all in a quiet way: Whereas other Nations have travailed through blood to a reformation, All things are managed among us without blood-shed, <hi>blessed be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to doe it <hi>in a praying way;</hi> not by the <hi>weapons of war,</hi> but by the <hi>weapons of the Church, Prayers and Teares;</hi> In stead of <hi>fighting,</hi> we have <hi>Fasting,</hi> and in stead of the enemies <hi>drummes,</hi> we have <hi>Aarons bels</hi> sounding in our eares: <hi>Our people have prayed up a reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, to doe all this for us, when we were in a most <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate condition;</hi> when all our <hi>faithfull Ministers</hi> with one lippe preached desolation and destruction, when thousands had left us as <hi>Rats</hi> &amp; <hi>Mice</hi> doe a house when it is ready to <hi>fall,</hi> when we <note place="margin">Psal. 63. 13.</note> 
               <hi>lay among the pots</hi> fullyed with superstition; for God then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to make us, <hi>as the wings of a Dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold;</hi> to make us a glorious Church, to purge out our drosse, and whatsoever gives just offence, and to make us <hi>white as the snow in Salmon;</hi> (It is reported of <hi>Salmon,</hi> That it is <note place="margin">Psal 63. 14.</note> an high hill shadowed with trees, darke, and full of pits, but when the snow is upon it, it is white. Our condition was like the hill of <hi>Salmon,</hi> we were in darke and dismall condition, full of pits and snares, but God is making us <hi>white as the Snow in Salmon,</hi> and all on the suddaine contrary to all expectation is opening <hi>a doore of hope</hi> for us, when we were in the <hi>valley of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor.)</hi> This is an admirable circumstance.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, to doe all this, <hi>for such a sinfull Nation as England:</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hath <hi>ingrossed</hi> all those sins for which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62122:8"/>

                  </gap>:</hi> crying up the <hi>holines of Churches,</hi> and at the same time crying downe the <hi>frequency of Preaching in these Churches:</hi> exalting the <hi>holines of places,</hi> and at the same time depressing the <hi>holinesse of persons,</hi> and the <hi>holines of the Christian Sabbath:</hi> A nation guilty of <hi>Apostasie, Opposition to Reformation, Bitternesse against the people of God,</hi> loaded with <hi>blood-guiltinesse, blasphemies, adulteries, oppression, drunkennes, covetousnes,</hi> and such like sinnes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, And to doe all this <hi>for such a Nation,</hi> and <hi>not for other Nations;</hi> Not for <hi>Germany,</hi> not for <hi>Ireland.</hi> Although we drinke as deepe of the cup of sinne as they, yet that God should give us no cup, but a cup full of mercy to drinke off; to make us like <hi>Goshen,</hi> when all other Protestant Nations are plagued as <hi>Egypt,</hi> O what a rare Circumstance is this!</p>
            <p>These mercies, and these circumstances are so great and so wonderfull, as that, if I had as many tongues as haires on my head, they would not all suffice to set out the praises of God for them: And indeed I can hardly forbeare from turning this day of humiliation, into a day of thanksgiving. Surely God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a <hi>thousand thousand Hallelujahs;</hi> And that we should blesse him upon a <hi>thousand stringed Instrument:</hi> Here is <hi>fewell</hi> enough. <hi>The Lord kindle a great fire in every one of our hearts, to burne out all our lusts: to infiame our cold hearts with the love of such a God: and to make us ashamed and confounded that ever wee should sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second part of the Text is the Author of these mercies, <note place="margin">2 Part.</note> in these words: <hi>I will doe this saith the Lord God.</hi> Here I observe, <hi>That the deliverances that come to a Nation, come from Jehovah A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donai. Nationall mercies come from the God of Nations;</hi> And that all <note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> the world may take notice that mercies come from God, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily doth two things.</p>

                  </gap>h times,</hi> and when they are in <hi>such straites,</hi> as that <hi>none but a God can deliver them.</hi> Thus he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they were in their worst

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r lateres, tunc venit Deus:</hi> thus he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his people out of Babylon, when they were as <hi>dry bones in the grave</hi> past hope; this is a time fit for a God to worke, as it is <hi>Deut. 32. 36. The Lord shall judge his people, and repent himselfe for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and that there is none shut up, or left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee delivers Nations by such wayes and such meanes that <note place="margin">2.</note> none but a God can doe.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>By little meanes:</hi> Thus he tels <hi>Gideon, The people that are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 7. 2.</note> 
               <hi>with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine owne hand hath saved me;</hi> and therefore he brings the Army from 32 <hi>thousand,</hi> to <hi>ten thousand,</hi> and from <hi>ten thousand,</hi> to <hi>three hundred;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards delivers them without the helpe of these <hi>three hundred, by Trumpets, Pitchers,</hi> and <hi>Lamps:</hi> Thus he delivered Israel from a huge hoast of Philistims, by the help of <hi>Jonathan and his Armor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam 14.</note> And in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 22, 23. he makes a fancy to be the foundation of a great victory, the <hi>Sun shines</hi> upon the water, and the Moabi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>es <hi>conceive it to be the blood of the Israelites,</hi> and by this fancy were vanquished.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>By unlikely meanes:</hi> Thus God preserved <hi>Noah</hi> by an <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  <item>If either you consider the mercies themselves;</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, If we <hi>consider the mercies themselves,</hi> they are so super-su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative, as that we may say of them, as <hi>Protog<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> could draw this line; so <hi>none but a God could doe such great things: These mercies declare the glory of God, and these deliverances s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Secondly, <hi>If we consider the time when we received them,</hi> for God suffered us to be at the very pits brinke, and betweene the very teeth of the Lions, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was, and like <hi>Isaac</hi> ready to be slaine even <hi>Tantum n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The manner how God hath brought about these mercies is so rare,</hi> as that we may not onely say (as <hi>David</hi> to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) <hi>Is not the hand of Joab in all this?</hi> but we may certainely conclude, <hi>The hand of God is most conspicuous in all Englands mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; Never since the first day of the creation of the world, when God brought light out of darknesse, hath God more appeared in the workes of his providence in bringing good out of evill, than in these last yeares,</hi> wherein he hath suffered the enemies of the Church and State to dig pits, and then he hath caught them in the pits that they themselves have digged; <hi>In the net which they bid is their owne</hi>

            <p>The many <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>great mercies</hi> that God hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation in generall, and upon our persons in particular.</p>
            <p>And there is great reason why the mercies of God should make us ashamed for sin, and ashamed to sin.</p>
            <p>Because to sin against God <hi>after mercy</hi> is a sin of such a <hi>crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son die,</hi> as that it must needs make us <hi>blush,</hi> if any grace be in our hearts. <hi>The greater the sin is we commit, the greater is our shame to commit it.</hi> Now it is a sinne of a very high nature to sinne after mercie, for these reasons.</p>

               <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> and the more <hi>kindnesse</hi> we sinne against, the more <hi>unkind</hi> it is to sinne, and the more shame to be so <hi>unkind</hi> to that God that is so <hi>kind</hi> to us. <hi>Caesar</hi> tooke it very <hi>unkindly</hi> at the hands of <hi>Brutus,</hi> upon whom he had bestowed so many favours, when hee came to stab him: <hi>What thou my son Brutus!</hi> God takes it very unkindly when a Nation upon whom hee hath bestowed great mercies, commits great sinnes.

This makes the least sinne of us in <hi>England</hi> greater than the greatest sin of <hi>Germanie, or of Ireland,</hi> because God hath dealt more mercifully with us, than with them: therfore Christ saith, <hi>Woe be to thee Chorazin, woe be to thee Bethsaida; for if the mightie works which have been done in thee, had beene done in Tyre and Sidon,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This makes the sins of England greater than the sin of the Devils, though not simply, yet in three respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Devils never sinned against the blood of Jesus Christ;</hi> Christ never dyed for them, but he dyed for us. For verily hee tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but he tooke on him the seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Devils never sinned against Gods patience.</hi> God was not patient towards them, but as soone as ever they sinned, hee cast them into hell. <hi>Deus non expectabat Angelos,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith: but we sinne against the blood of Christ, and the patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering of God, which is very great towards mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Devils never sinned against any example.</hi> For they were the first that sinned, and were made the first example; but wee have had divers examples of Gods wrath against sinne, the example of the Devils, and of the punishment of the old world, of Sodom and Gomorrah, &amp; many hundred such like, and yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62122:17"/>
we sin notwithstanding al these examples. In these three respects to sin against the <hi>mercies of God, is more than diabolicall.</hi>

            <p>It is a <hi>sinne that takes away all excuse,</hi> and will so confound a <note place="margin">Reas. 8.</note> man at the day of Judgement, that it will make him speechlesse. This is excellently set out in the 9 chapter of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10. verses, <hi>O my God, saith Ezra, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, O my God: for our iniquities are in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And now O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> What excuse shall we bring? What shift shall we plead? What shall we say? That is, we have nothing to say. <hi>This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation is an emphaticall negation.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The greater the person is we sin against, the greater the sin;</hi> as to offer an affront to a King, is a greater offence than to injure a common Gentleman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The better the person is against whom we sin, and the more good we expect from him, or have received from him, or the more need we have of him, the greater is the offence to offer wrong unto him.</hi> Now mercy is the <hi>greatest and chiefest of Gods attributes.</hi> In themselves Gods attributes are all equall, but in regard of our necessities, as oyle swims above all other liquors, as the Eagle is the chiefe of birds, the Lion of beasts, gold of metals, so mercy is the chiefe of all Gods attributes, and therefore to sin with mercy must needs be a horrible sin. <hi>Mercy</hi> is an <hi>attribute</hi> that we al <hi>stand in need of;</hi> the best of men need mercy as well as the worst of men.

If a Chirurgeon should freely bestow paines and charge to cure a man of a lame hand, and he should as soone as ever he is cured kill this Chirurgeon with his cured hand, this were a horrible ingratitude, and a provoking sin. Thus do they, that when they are delivered from sicknesse and made whole, fall presently to sinning against God with their health. This sin is so great, that the Apostle cries out, <hi>Shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an Harlot?

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62122:20"/>
&amp;c.</hi> this did so far incense <hi>David,</hi> as it made him destroy them al after a rigid manner. <hi>Gods mercies are like Davids messengers messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of love.</hi> God lookes we should improve these messages to his glory. But if we despise them, and abuse him with them, he will utterly destroy us. <hi>O consider this, you that forget God, You that undervalue his mercies, You that contemne his mercies, You that sin with his mercies.</hi> How angry was <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Peter,</hi> because he would not suffer him to <hi>wash his feete?</hi> he seemes to be more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him than when he <hi>denyed</hi> him, because he refused an act of Christs love. Christ tooke it unkindly, at <hi>Peters</hi> hands. When <hi>God</hi> comes <hi>in love</hi> to us, and offers to wash us, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us, if we refuse to be washed, and choose rather to wallow in the mire of sin and superstition, this will provoke God more than if we did flatly deny him. <hi>We would have healed Babylon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 51. 9.</note> 
               <hi>but she is not healed, forsake her, and let us goe every one into his owne Countrey, for her judgement reacheth unto Heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.</hi> Which words tell us, <hi>That those that sin with mercies, shall be lifted up as high in judgement as they are in mercy.</hi> Thus it is likewise said <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 24. ver. 13. <hi>Because I have purged thee and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not bee purged from thy filthinesse any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</hi> Oh that the Lord <hi>would give us hearts to lay these things to heart!</hi> Oh let us be ashamed and confounded, ashamed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, that ever we have sinned, <hi>after mercies, under mercies, and with mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed when I consider seriously <hi>how the mercies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are abused by England,</hi> I am possessed with exceeding great feare, lest all our mercies should be but <hi>forerunners of some greater miseries,</hi> and all our <hi>preservations, reservations</hi> to some greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

            <p>The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were <hi>delivered by Abraham,</hi> but because they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> 
               <hi>after their deliverance,</hi> their <hi>preservation</hi> was but a <hi>reservation</hi> for a greater destruction by fire and brimstone. <hi>Lots</hi> wife was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but because she looked backe towards <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> her <hi>preservation</hi> was but a <hi>reservation</hi> to be turned to a pillar of salt. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was often delivered by the prayer of <hi>Moses,</hi> but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62122:21"/>
because he hardned his heart after deliverance, his <hi>preservation</hi> was but a <hi>reservation,</hi> till he was drowned in the Red Sea. The <hi>people of Israel</hi> had deliverance upon deliverance, but because they continued to sin after deliverance, God at last destroyed them with a wofull destruction. The Lord open our eyes to consider these things, and to be confounded and ashamed for our evill doings, and to loath our selves for our former abominations, and to be humbled exceedingly for our sins against mercy, that God may continue his deliverances to us, and our posterity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, as long as the Sun and Moone endureth.</p>

            <p>So when we consider how neare we have beene to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how often God hath spared us, when he might have destroyed us; let us lift up our voyces and weepe for our sins against such a God. Observe how <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was affected with <hi>Davids</hi> mercy, in 2 <hi>Sam 9. David</hi> had cause to be revenged upon the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> but he freely shewed kindnesse to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth, restoring him all his fathers lands, and causing him to eate bread at his Table continually.</hi> And this Mercy did so melt his heart, that he cryes out, <hi>What is thy servant, that thou shouldest looke upon such a dead Dog as I am?</hi> O let the contemplation of Gods love towards us, make us to loath our selves for our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, and say, <hi>What am I, a dead Dog, an impure Swine, an uncleane Leper, that the Lord my God should doe so much for me!</hi> Beloved in the Lord, it is my comfort that I preach this day to those that are <hi>Noble and ingenuous.</hi> My humble suite is, That you would appeare to be such indeed and in truth.

Judgements of God may break a hard heart, but it will remain hard still, as a Rocke broken in peeces remaines a Rocke; But the Sun-shine of Gods mercy, and the consideration of Gods love to us in Christ will breake the heart to powder, and make it not onely a <hi>broken heart,</hi> but a <hi>soft and contrite heart.</hi> Have you not seene a Malefactor at his condemnation and place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, when without hope of mercy, carrying himselfe despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and obdurately in sinne, and afterwards, when inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there was a pardon provided for him, hath beene excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly melted and broken in heart, at the consideration of the graciousnesse of the King towards him?</p>

            <p>Let us study the duty of this Text, let us be ashamed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed for our sins. There be many men, saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that are <hi>ashamed of what they should not be ashamed,</hi> and not <hi>ashamed of what they should be ashamed:</hi> are ashamed to <hi>confesse their sins,</hi> but not to <hi>act their sins,</hi> not ashamed to be seene at a <hi>Play-house,</hi> but ashamed to be seene at <hi>Gods House</hi> upon a weeke day, ashamed of Christ and his cause, ashamed to be accounted precise, but not ashamed to be <hi>wicked</hi> and ungodly. And as the same Author saith, many men are not <hi>ashamed to sin,</hi> but ashamed to be known to <hi>sin,</hi> not ashamed to commit adultery, but to be knowne to commit it, not ashamed to be sinners, but to be called sinners, not ashamed to be covetous, but ashamed to be called covetous. <hi>This shame comes from the Devill,</hi> and <hi>will bring us to the Devill.</hi> Let us pitch the act upon the right object.

the day of smal things.

               <note place="margin">Answ. 2</note> &amp; what <hi>God</hi> in his word hath threatned to a Nation guilty of such sins as ours are. <hi>But God hath dealt with</hi> England, <hi>not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ordinary rule, but according to his Prerogative.</hi> England (if I may so speake with reverence) is a <hi>Paradox to the Bible.</hi> The Bible tels us what sinnes will make a Nation ripe for destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we finde these sinnes in our Nation. But if <hi>God</hi> will leave his ordinary road, and except us from the generall rule, and miraculously save us by Prerogative, and free grace, who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62122:24"/>
can hinder a free agent? This is a rare act of his Prerogative, <hi>&amp; the more mercy there is in it, the more ought we to be confounded for our apostasies, whoredomes, abominations, and rebellions against this God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men, brethren and fathers, if all that I have said this day, wil not worke upon your hearts, give me leave to name some other kind of mercies unto you. For I am all for mercy this day.</p>
            <p>1. Consider, <hi>What a mercy it is for God to make you men,</hi> when he might have made you toads. I doubt not but you have heard the story of the two Bishops, that being riding to the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> and espying by the way a poore Country man weeping, turned towards him, and asked him, <hi>why he wept,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>I weepe to see t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>is toad</hi> (that lay upon the ground before him) <hi>because I never blessed God sufficiently, for that he made me a man and not a toad.</hi> This answer made them goe away astonished and ashamed for their owne unthankfulnesse. And it may justly worke the like effect in us.</p>
            <p>2. Consider, <hi>What a mercy it is to be not onely a man, but a rich man, a Gentleman, Knight, or Lord, &amp;c.</hi> There is none here, but such whom <hi>God</hi> hath lifted up above thousands in outward mercies. What a shame is it for a poore Cobler to doe more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for <hi>God,</hi> than it may be some of you doe, that have received so much from <hi>God.</hi> May not Christ say to you as he did to the Jewes? <hi>I have done many great workes among you, for which of these doe you stone me?</hi> I have done many great things for you, <hi>I have given you health, wealth, credite, wit, and honour, and for which of these is it that thou blasphemest my name, and despisest my Sabbaths, and refusest to obey my Commandements?</hi> It is said of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> that he provided silken halters to hang himselfe withall, and ponds of <hi>sweet water</hi> to drowne himselfe withall, gilded <hi>poysons</hi> to poyson himselfe withall. O let not your honors and riches, &amp;c. be silken <hi>halters to strangle your soules!</hi> let not your <hi>pleasures</hi> be ponds of <hi>sweet water</hi> to drown your soules! let not your <hi>prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> be gilded <hi>poysons,</hi> to poyson your soules! Say as <hi>Nabal</hi> did (but in a better sense) <hi>shal I take my health which God hath given me, to sin against my God with it?</hi> God forbid. <hi>Shall I take the wit that God hath given me, to plot against God and his cause with it? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Consider, <hi>the patience of God towards us.</hi> This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that should drive us to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. There is no <hi>sin,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62122:24"/>
but it is committed in the very bosome of God.</hi> For <hi>God fils Heaven &amp; earth,</hi> and sees all your <hi>curtaine abominations.</hi> And he is able to destroy you, he is <hi>just, and must wound the bairy scalpe of those that goe on in their wickednesse,</hi> and he is a holy and a pure <hi>God,</hi> that hates your iniquities from his very heart. And yet behold how patient this <hi>God</hi> is towards you! At such a time, when thou wert in the act of adultery, he might have sent thee to hell in the very act, he might have <hi>made thy tongue to rot, the last oath thou sworest.</hi> Nothing with-held him but pure mercy. <hi>O let this melt our hearts.</hi> What <hi>a mercy is it to be out of hell?</hi> Many in hell have not sinned the sinnes that we have done. It is his free grace that we are delivered. We might have been weeping in hell at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant: And then <hi>our teares should have beene our hell, but now they will prove our heaven, if God worke them in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Consider, <hi>the Lord Jesus Christ, and his love in dying for thee.</hi> If thy heart be as hard as an Adamant, the blood of this <hi>scape Goate</hi> will soften it. There were five men met together, that asked one another what meanes they used to abstaine from sinne. The first answered, <hi>That he continually thought upon the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of the time of death, and that made him live every day, as if it were his last day.</hi> The second <hi>meditated of the severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he was to give at the day of judgement, and of the everlasting torments of hell, and this kept him from sin.</hi> The third, <hi>of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and loathsomenesse of sin, and of the excellency and beauty of grace,</hi> and <hi>this made him abhorre</hi> sinne. The fourth, <hi>of the everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and pleasures provided for those that abstaine from</hi> sinne, and <hi>this prevailed with him.</hi> The fifth and the last, <hi>continually medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of his love,</hi> and this made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to sin against <hi>God.</hi> This last is the <hi>greatest motive of all.</hi> If the pacification betweene the two Nations of England &amp; Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land will not affect us, let the <hi>great pacification that Christ hath made for thee</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>thy soule move thy heart to be ashamed to</hi> offend <hi>God.</hi> It is the greatest argument I can use, to say, <hi>For Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ his sake be ashamed</hi> and <hi>confounded for your evill waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Consider, <hi>the long enjoyment of the Gospel,</hi> the powerfull and plentifull preaching of it, joyned with peace and plenty. And let us mourne for our Gospel sins for our unprofitablenes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulnesse under such <hi>fruitfull meanes,</hi> that we have beene like
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62122:25"/>
a barren ground which no plowing will make good. Let us mourne for our unbeliefe, and impenitency. Let <hi>Gospel</hi> sins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Gospel</hi> sorrow. <hi>Teares are made onely for sin.</hi> If we mourne our eyes out for worldly losses; we cannot profit our selves. But if we <hi>weep for sin, this will quench the fire of hell.</hi> There are 2 sorts of sins, and 2 sorts of curses: legall sins &amp; Gospel sins, legall curses and Gospel curses: Legall sins will bring legall curses; But Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel sins (unlesse there be Gospel sorrow) will bring a Gospel curse, <hi>which is above al legal curses.</hi> Of this curse the Apostle speaks 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema Maranatha:</hi> that is, accursed for the present, &amp; reserved for the vengeance which Christ will render to all unbelievers, when he comes to judgement. This is <hi>curse upon curse.</hi> And this is the curse due to them that abuse <hi>mercies. The Lord deliver us from this curse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Let every man consider <hi>the personal mercies that God hath bestowed upon him in particular,</hi> &amp; take all these mercies, &amp; lay them to his heart, &amp; they wil dissolve the stone in his heart; let our hearts be as <hi>wax,</hi> &amp; these <hi>mercies</hi> as the <hi>sun</hi> to melt them into godly <hi>sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Make a double Catalogue: One of thy <hi>sins;</hi> The other of <hi>Gods mercies</hi> to thee, &amp; binde them about thy heart to bring it into a religious frame. Thus I have named six other mercies. My hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble suit is, That you would <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nder &amp; consider seriously what hath been said</hi> unto you. <hi>Consider what I say, saith the Apostle, and the Lord give you understanding.</hi> The <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <note place="margin">2 Thes. 4.</note> what <hi>Paul</hi> had said, if they had not considred it. No more shall we profit by this Sermon, if we do not consider what hath bin said. And this consideration must have foure ingredients.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must consider these mercies <hi>distinctly,</hi> and <hi>deliberately.</hi> If a man hath a sweet <hi>Cordiall</hi> in his mouth and <hi>swallow</hi> it downe whole, he wil not taste the sweetnes of it, but if he <hi>chew</hi> it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it wil be <hi>very pleasant</hi> to his taste. So these mercies will doe us no good, if we swallow them <hi>down</hi> without <hi>serious meditation.</hi> But if we chew them and consider them distinctly and <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,</hi> one mercy after another, they will exceedingly affect us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must consider them with <hi>reflexion upon our selves, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our selves.</hi> As it is reported of <hi>Plato</hi> that when he did walk in the streets, if he saw any man disordred in his speech, or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62122:25"/>
any other way he would say to himselfe: <hi>Num ego talis?</hi> Am I such a one as this is? So must we say, <hi>Num ego talis? Have I abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these mercies? Have I sinned with these mercies?</hi> And as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles severally asked Christ, <hi>Master, is it I?</hi> So m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t we aske our hearts, <hi>Am not I the man that ought to be ashamed, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nfoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did for my sins against mercies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We must consider <hi>these mercies in as neere a propinquity as we can possible.</hi> It is a true saying of the Philosoper, <hi>Things that are seen far off, are as if they were not: A great man a far off seems little or nothing: An enemie a farre off, or a serpent a farre off, doth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e trouble us.</hi> So it is with mercies. If we looke upon them at a distance they will seeme little, and little affect us, but if we take them neere to us, they will seeme (as they are) very great, and will mightily worke upon us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider <hi>these mercies devoutly with prayer unto God to make them heart-melting mercies.</hi> Pray to <hi>Christ to looke upon thee, as he did on Peter;</hi> The Cock crew once and <hi>Peter wept not,</hi> the Cock crew twice, and <hi>Peter wept not,</hi> because (saith <hi>Ambrose) Christ did not looke upon him.</hi> But as soone as ever <hi>Christ</hi> looked upon him, then he wept, <hi>Aspexit Christus &amp; flevit.</hi> We <hi>Ministers</hi> are as the <hi>crowing of Peters Cocke,</hi> we cannot make you ashamed and confounded for your evill doings, unlesse <hi>Christ</hi> looke upon you. <hi>The Lord Jesus in his mercy cast his eye upon us this day, that we may all of us goe out and weep bitterly, as</hi> Peter <hi>did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very brute beasts have bin wrought upon by mercie. Some write (though others contradict it) of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> that because it wants joynts it cannot kneele, &amp; if it once fall it cannot rise, and therefore when it sleeps it sleepes leaning upon a tree. Now the <hi>hunts-man</hi> observing upon what tree it sleeps, desirous to take it, comes in the day time, and sawes that tree almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and when the <hi>Elephant</hi> comes to leane upon it, the tree falls, and the <hi>Elephant</hi> with it; Then comes the <hi>hunts-man,</hi> and lifts up the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which he takes so kindly, that ever after he followes the <hi>hunts-man where ever be pleaseth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This story may be applyed divers wayes. When we were all <hi>fallen in Adam</hi> by eating the fruit of the forbidden tree, unable to rise againe, <hi>Jesus hath lifted us up from hell:</hi> O let this <hi>mercie melt</hi> us into obedience. When we were all falne of late yeares
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62122:26"/>
in this Kingdome into a <hi>desperate condition:</hi> God by the <hi>King and Parliamant</hi> hath raised us up to a hope of better dayes. O let us be <hi>ashamed</hi> to be <hi>disobedient</hi> to this God. There is another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous story of one <hi>Androdus</hi> dwelling at <hi>Rome,</hi> that fled from his Master into the wildernesse, and tooke shelter in a Lions Den; The Lion came home with a thorne in his foot, and seeing the man in the den reached out his foot, and the man pulled out the thorne; which the Lion tooke so kindly, that for three yeares he sed the man in his den. After three yeares the man stole out of the den, and returned backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> was apprehended by his Master and condemned to be devoured by a Lion. It hapned that this very <hi>Lion</hi> was designed to devour him; The Lion knowes his old friend, and would not hurt him. The People wondred at it, the man was saved, and the Lion given to him, which he carried about with him in the streets of <hi>Rome.</hi> From whence came that motto, <hi>Hic est homo medicus leonis: hic est leo hospes hominis.</hi> Beloved in the Lord, the great <hi>God</hi> by the help of you, and the House of the <hi>Lords</hi> hath <hi>plucked many thorns out of our feet.</hi> O let us not now <hi>bring forth thornes and briers.</hi> Let not our hearts be drie and barren as the <hi>thorny ground.</hi> Let us not <hi>kicke against God with our feete while be is plucking out the thornes that trouble us.</hi> Let us not be worse than the brute beasts. But if all this will not prevaile, suffer me I beseech you to remind you under new expressions of what hath beene before said, and to offer some new motives unto you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the beginnings of hope that now appeare, and these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinings of better dayes will not work upon us to <hi>bumble</hi> us <hi>for, and from sin:</hi> God will take away all our hopes, &amp; all his mercies from us, and give them to a Nation that will make better use of them. And as I said in my last Sermon which I preached before this Honourable assembly) <hi>he will repent of the good things which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jet. 18. 10</note> 
               <hi>he intended to bestow upon us.</hi> Remember what I hinted before of <hi>Saul,</hi> that if hee had tarried for <hi>Samuel,</hi> God would have esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 14.</note> the kingdome unto him, <hi>But now, saith</hi> Samuel, <hi>thy Kingdome shall not continue.</hi> How do we know but that if we <hi>humble our selves,</hi> and <hi>enter into covenant to be G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62122:26"/>
and his wayes, <hi>God will say unto us t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>is day, I thought to have made you a happy kingdome, but now your happinesse shall not continue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When God hath done much for a Nation, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sinnes with his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ercies, God will not onely <hi>take away his mercies,</hi> but will send <hi>curses instead of blessings.</hi> For so it is said, <hi>Josh. 24. 20. If yee seeke the Lord, and serve strange gods, then will he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 20.</note> 
               <hi>turne and do you hurt and consume you, after he hath done you good.</hi> God may out of his free mercy <hi>prorogue,</hi> and <hi>demurre our ruine, but be will never remove it,</hi> till our <hi>Nationall sinnes be removed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If God should heale us, help us, and lengthen out our tranquillity, and make a reformation among us, yet it would be but a <hi>lame cure,</hi> if we be not confounded and ashamed for our evill wayes. It will be but a <hi>skinning over of our disease,</hi> and a <hi>daubing of us up with untempered morter,</hi> a smothering of the fire, which will breake out the more afterwards. But a <hi>perfect cure can never be expected from God, till th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>re be a Nationall humiliation, and refo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Adde lastly, if God should shew us mercy, <hi>this mercy will be accursed unto us, if we be not humbled and reformed. A mercy abused is no mercy.</hi> Mercy <hi>turned to sinne,</hi> takes away the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the mercy,</hi> and turneth the <hi>mercy into a curse;</hi> As the <hi>raine, that falls upon the Sea, is made salt by the salt water.</hi> And that which falls upon moorish grounds, breeds <hi>Toads and Serpents:</hi> So all the goodnesse and mercies of God falling upon wicked, impenitent, and irreformed hearts, breed nothing but the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For the conclusion of all, I will do two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will name some particular sinnes, which are most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the mercies God hath done for England, and beseech the representative House of England, to be confounded and ashamed to commit such sinnes any more.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ashamed, to contenme and despise the mercies you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from God.</hi> There are many like the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> that liked their habitations in <hi>Babylon</hi> so well, that when <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave them leave to goe to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they would not leave <hi>Babylon</hi> to goe to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> So there are many that like their former condition under the innovation so well, that they had rather continue in <hi>Babylon</hi> still, than accept of the reformation offered. That begin to say of <hi>Mannah, We have nothing but this</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Mannah;</hi> and to wish for the <hi>Garlicke and Onions of Egypt againe.</hi> This is a grievous abomination. God was very angry with the Israelites for this sin, he sent plagues upon plagues among them for it. And when at last they brought an evill report upon the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and (as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106) despised the holy land, refusing to go into it, God was so provoked with this sin, <note place="margin">Psal. 106.</note> that he would not pardon it, but set them back again 40. yeares, and destroyed their carkasses in the wildernesse. Would to God I could not say, that there are some among us, that raise up an ill report upon the reformation intended, as if the Parliament had a purpose to bring in an <hi>Anarchie,</hi> to reduce every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its first Chaos, to leave every man to do what is good in his owne eyes, as when there was no King in Israel: And upon this false rumour they <hi>despise</hi> the <hi>blessed Canaan</hi> that we are going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Oh let us be ashamed and confounded to commit this sinne. This will make <hi>God</hi> carry us backe againe to the <hi>wildernesse.</hi>

This is a <hi>horrible sinne after so many mercies.</hi> As <hi>Austin</hi> saith of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> He that will not beleeve in Christ after so many <hi>miracles,</hi> without a <hi>new miracle,</hi> he himselfe is a <hi>great miracle.</hi> So he that will distrust God, after so many <hi>miraculous mercies,</hi> is himselfe a <hi>miracle of unbeliefe.</hi> How often hath <hi>God appeared in the mount these two last yeares,</hi> as if he had <hi>resolved to take up his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there?</hi> How many mountaines of opposition have melted before you, as mountaines of snow before the Sun?

               <hi>God, that hath so mightily appeared for us.</hi> I remember the storie of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 6. It is there said, That when the enemies heard that the worke of the building of the Temple prospered beyond their expectations, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

And all this was done to make him afraid. But he was above all feare (shall such a man as I fly? (saith he) shall such a man as I feare?) and finished the worke, insomuch as that when the enemies heard thereof they were much cast downe, <hi>for they perceived that this worke was wrought of God.</hi> Remember that the fearfull are <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.

Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to incounter difficulties. <hi>When Peter came up to the iron gate, it opened to him of its owne accord.</hi>

It is a great mercie that God hath kept us from blood. God hath left our blood in our veines, let it boyle up in the cause of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Be ashamed to injure the instruments by which God conveyes these mercies unto us.</hi> When <hi>Corah and his company rebelled against Moses and Aaron, then came the plague.</hi> As we must not <hi>idolize,</hi> so we must not <hi>injure</hi> the <hi>golden pipes,</hi> through which these mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies flow unto us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Take heed of being ashamed of the cause of Christ.</hi> God hath not beene ashamed to appeare for us, let us not be ashamed to appeare for him. Remember that thundring speech, <hi>Mark. 8. 38. Whosoever shall be ashamed of mee and my words, in this adulterous</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Let us neither pride our selves in our mercies, nor waxe wanton in our mercies.</hi> It is recorded in the <hi>French</hi> History, that when the <hi>Protestants of France began to grow wanton of their peace and prosperity, and began to affect a vaine and frothy way of preaching, the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I will briefly name some speciall and heroicall Uses, which we are to make of Gods mercies, besides this use in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do something, O house of England, for the honour of the Lords day,</hi> which hath beene much prophaned, not onely in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, but in our Doctrines. Christ Jesus hath two dayes, <hi>The day of the Lord,</hi> which is the day of judgement, <hi>And the Lords day.</hi> If you looke to appeare with comfort at the <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> honour the <hi>Lords day;</hi> There is a <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> for those that abuse the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Do something to make this day more honourable by way of <hi>spirituall satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Do something to purge the Land more and more of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood of the Martyrs in Queene Maries dayes, by the Lawes that were then established.</hi> Oh that in our publike Fasts a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62122:28"/>
clause might be interlaced, <hi>To command the Land to be humbled for that bloody sinne,</hi> that so the Nation might be freed from the guilt of that blood. This will be an heroicall worke, worthy of a people endeared to God by such mercies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Do something for the reformation of Gods house.</hi> Mistake mee not, I do not forget to remember with thankfulnesse, what you have already done, but goe on, I beseech you, to perfect what you have begun to do. And consider what some say of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That it was his <hi>great fault,</hi> that he bestowed more time in <hi>buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>is owne house,</hi> than he did in <hi>building the house of God.</hi> He was but seven yeares in building the house of God, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in building his owne house. And it is observed he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prospered after. The Scripture seems to give a little hint of this. For it is said in the 1 <hi>King. 6. 38. So was he seven yeares in building the house of the Lord.</hi> And in the next verse it is added, <note place="margin">1 King. 6. 38 1 King. 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>But Solomon was building his owne house thirteene yeares.</hi> This <hi>(but)</hi> may seeme to be a secret kind of reproofe. O let not the like blame be cast upon you! Make haste to repaire the ruines of Gods house. And be sure to repaire it according to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> not according to humane policie. Let mee desire you never to forget the story of <hi>David,</hi> who when he went to bring home the <hi>Arke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with great joy, because he brought it not home <hi>in due order,</hi> but suffered it to be carried in a <hi>Cart,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it should be carried upon the <hi>Priests shoulders,</hi> there was a great breach made, and a great stop of the worke. As it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, 1 <hi>Chr. 15. 13. Because he did it not at the first, therefore</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chr. 15. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord our God made a breach upon us, for that wee sought him not after the due order.</hi> A reformation made according to the rule will abide, when all others will molder away, and the <hi>blessing of God will be upon it, and upon the maker of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Do something for the setting up of a Preaching Ministrie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdome;</hi> That the light of the <hi>Gospell of Jesus Christ</hi> may shine in the dark corners of the Land. And provide a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance for the Ministrie, for feare lest <hi>scandalo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>us Livings, make scandalous Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Do something to purge out all the defilements that are in the pure worship of God,</hi> that the <hi>pure and holy God</hi> may be worshipped with <hi>pure worship, purely, by pure worshippers.</hi>
