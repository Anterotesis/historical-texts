            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Reasons and Use of this BOOK.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN is born without Knowledge, but not without a Capacity and faculty of Knowing, this is his Excellency and Essence: Nature, Experience, and Gods Word tell us the great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Knowledge. As the Souls essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial form is the virtue of vital Action, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Will conjunct, so Holiness is Holy Life, Light and Love conjunct. The wisest men are the best, and the best the wisest, but a Counterfeit of Knowledge is the great deceiver of the World. Millions take the Knowledge of bare <hi>Words,</hi> with the Gramatical and Logical sence, instead of the Knowledge of the things themselves which by these are signified; as if the Glass would nourish without the Wine, or the Dish without the Meat, or the Cloathing or Skin were all the man; God and Holiness and Heaven are better known by many serious unlearned Christians that cannot accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispute about them, than by many Learned men, who can excellently speak of that which their Souls are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with: The Hipocrites Religion is but an Art, the true Christians is a Habit, which is a Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>But yet the Words are signs, by which we are helpt to know the things, and must diligently be learned to that end; and though men cannot reach the Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:60383:3"/>
God hath appointed Parents and Masters, and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Instruct their Inferiours by words, and hath written the Scripture to that use, that by them his Spirit may teach or illuminate the Mind, and renew the Heart: God worketh on man as man, and we must know by Signs, till we know by intuition.</p>
            <p>It is a thing well known, that the Church abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Catechisms, and Systemes of Divinity, and doth there yet need more? their scope and Substance is the same; they differ most, 1. In Choice of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there be nothing left out that is needful, nor needless uncertainties and disputes put in. 2. That the Method or Order of them be True, agreeable to the matter and Sacred Scripture. 3. And that they be not blotted with any drops of disgraceful Errour. These are the requisites to desirable Catechisms.</p>
            <p>No doubt but they should be sorted into three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, suited to the Childhood, Youth and maturer Age of Christians. <hi>I.</hi> The Essentials of Christianity are all contained generally in Baptism; this must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and therefore expounded; the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue, the Summaries of things to to be <hi>Beleived, Desired,</hi> (in Hope) and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> were from the beginning taken for a good Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to those that were to be Baptized: These three as Expounding Baptism, are themselves a good Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, the understanding of the Lords Supper being added for Communicants. <hi>II.</hi> But here also Children will be childish, and learn the words while they are mindless of the sence; therefore an Explication of these in other words, hath ever been thought a great part of the work of a Teaching Ministry; whence the Ancients have left us their Expositions of the Creed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60383:3"/>But here the difficulty is made insuperable by the Learners indisposition; if such a Catechism be short, and much put in few words, the vulgar cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it; if it be long and in many words, they cannot learn and remember it. <hi>III.</hi> For Remedy of this, a Larger Catechism yet is needful; not to be learnt without Book, but to be a full Exposition of the Shorter which they learn; that they may have recourse to this for a more full and particular under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of a Shorter, whose general words they can remember.</p>
            <p>Accordingly having in my <hi>Poor Mans Family Book,</hi> written two Catechisms of the former rank, I here adde the third, for those that have learned the two first: Far am I from thinking that I have done any one of these to perfection; I never yet saw a Catechism without some notable imperfection: And no doubt mine are not free from such. But while I avoid what I see amiss in others, I hope God will illuminate some to do yet beter, and to avoid what is amiss in mine. The degree which yet pretendeth to greater accurateness in Method, I have given in a Latine <hi>Methodus Theologiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Uses for which I have written this, are these. <hi>I.</hi> For Masters of Families, who should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to raise their Children and Servants to a good degree of Knowledge: I have divided it into short Chapters, that on the Lords dayes, or at nights when they have leisure, the Master may read to them one Chapter at a time, that is, the Exposition of one Article of the Creed, one Petition of the Lords Prayer, and one Commandement Expounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> For School-masters to cause their riper rank of Scholars to learn: I am past doubt that it is a
<pb facs="tcp:60383:4"/>
heinous Crime in the School-masters of <hi>England,</hi> that they devote but one hour or two in a week to the learning of the Catechism, while all the rest of the week is devoted to the learning of <hi>Lilly, Ovid, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, Livy, Terence,</hi> and such like; besides the loss and sinful omission, it seduceth Youth to think that common Knowledge (which is only Subsidiary and Ornamental) is more excellent or necessary than to know <hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Gospel, Duty,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> besides which, all Knowledge (further than it helpeth or serveth this) is but fooling and doting, and as dangerous diversion and perversion of the mind, as grosser sensual delights. He is not worthy the name of a Christian School-master, who maketh it not his chief work to teach his Scholars the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and Life Everlasting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> But if they goe from the Countrey Schools before they are capable of the Larger Catechisms, (as to their great loss most make too much hast away,) why may not their next Tutors make it their chief work to train up their Pupils as the Disciples of Iesus? (and yet not neglect either <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any natural light;) To our present Universities I am not so vain as to offer such Instructions, (though to some small part of them I directed my <hi>Methodus Theologiae;</hi>) I learnt not of them, and I presume not to make my self their Teacher: Their late GUIDES, their WORLDLY-INTEREST, and their GENI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US, have made my Writings odious to many, even that which they like they will not read. But I have oft with Lamentation wondered why Godly Ministers do no more of the work now appropriated to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, for their own Sons? Those men whose Church zeal would ruine Non-conformists if they Teach many,
<pb facs="tcp:60383:4"/>
either <hi>Boyes</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> have no Law against Parents teaching their own Children.</p>
            <p>1. Are you fit for the Ministry your selves? If so, cannot you teach others what you know? if you are defective in some useful Knowledge, let them else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where learn that afterwards.</p>
            <p>2. Is there any so greatly obliged to take care of them as your selves? will you be like those Parents who set God-fathers at the Font, to Vow and Promise to do the Parents part? and how do such Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers use to perform it? Or will you be like the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this unnatural Age, who get Children, and (not through disability, but <hi>Wealth, Pride,</hi> and Coyness) disdain to Nurse them, but cast that on hired Women, as obliged more by <hi>Money,</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by <hi>Nature,</hi> to all that Care.</p>
            <p>3. Cannot you do more at least to ground them well in Religion, before you send them from you for other Learning? or are you of the mind, that to cant over the Catechism is Divinity enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have read <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or Studied the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? and that they must be Proficients in Logick and Philosophy, before they make sure of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and must read <hi>Smiglecius, Ariago, Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el, Suarez,</hi> or be fooled by <hi>Cartesians, Gassendus</hi> or <hi>Hobbs,</hi> before they will Study the Gospel and Cross of Iesus Christ?</p>
            <p>I am no undervaluer of any Academical advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: when the Stream of Academies runs pure and holy, they are blessed helps to mens Salvation; when their Stream is SENSUAL, WORLDLY, CORRUPT and MALIGNANT, they are Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for Hell, and the Devils Schools to train up his most powerful Souldiers, to fight against serious
<pb facs="tcp:60383:5"/>
Godliness in Christs own Livery and Name, and to send Youth thither, is worse than to send them to a Brothel-House, or a Pest-house.</p>
            <p>4. Are there not fewer Temptations in your own Houses, than they are like to find abroad in the World? you can keep them from the company of sensual voluptuous Lads, and of Learned Reverend Enemies of serious Christianity, and of worldly men whose Godliness is gain, and would draw them ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously to Study Preferment, and espouse them to the World, which in Baptism they renounced; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep them from such Snares, how shall they be kept where such abound?</p>
            <p>5. And one of the greatest motives of all, for your keeping them long enough at home, is, that you will thereby have time to judge whether they are like to become fit for the Ministry or not: Oh, how many good men send Plagues into the Church, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting unproved Lads to the Ministry, <hi>hoping</hi> that God will hereafter give them Grace, and make them fit, who never promised it? When you send them at fifteen or sixteen years of Age to the University, from under your own eye, you are unlikely to know what they will prove, unless it be some few that are very early sanctified by Grace; and when they have been a few years at the University, be they never so unmeet, they will thrust themselves into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and (miserable men) for a Benefice take the charge of Souls; whereas if you will keep them with you till twenty years of Age, you may see what they are like to prove, and dispose of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>If you say, <hi>They will lose the advantage of their Degrees,</hi> it's an Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unfit for a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb facs="tcp:60383:5"/>
mouth; will you prefer Names, and aiery Titles before Wisdom, Piety, and mens Salvation and the Churches good? must they go out of their way for a Peacocks feather, when they are in a Race as for Life or Death?</p>
            <p>If you say, <hi>They will lose their time at home,</hi> the shame then is yours, or they are like to lose it more abroad; Teach them to read the Scriptures (at least the Gospel) in the Original Tongues, and to understand and practise things necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which all Arts and Sciences must subserve, and they do not lose their time; and at ripeness of Age they will get more other Learning in a year, than before they will do in many; and what they learn will be their own, when Boyes learn words without the sence.</p>
            <p>If you say, <hi>They will want the Advantage of Academical Disputes;</hi> I Answer, if Reading fill them with matter, nature and common use will teach them how to utter it: the World hath too many Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Books may soon teach them the true order of Disputing, and a few dayes experience may shew the rest.</p>
            <p>If you say, <hi>You have not time to Teach them;</hi> I answer, you have no greater work to do, and a little time will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> serve with willing teachable Youth, and no other are to be intended for the Ministry; what Boyes get by hearing their Tutors, they oft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow small labour to digest, but take up with bare words and second notions: but when they are set to get it from their Books themselves, harder Study better digesteth it; it is they that must bestow much time, the Teacher need not bestow very much: Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Schools may teach them Latine, Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,

let them stay there till they attain it; you may then teach them the common rudiments of Logick, and see them well settled in Divinity and serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and then if Academies prove safe and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they will go out better fortified against all the Temptations which they must expect.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that Inconveniencies are not so bad as Mischiefs, and it's certain that all our Natures as Corrupt, are <hi>Dark, Carnal</hi> and <hi>Malignant,</hi> and need the sanctifying Grace of Christ: and its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that as Grace useth all things to its increase, so this serpentine nature will turn Studyes, Learning and all such things to serve it self; and that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Sensual, Malignant Nature</hi> cultivated by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, is too usually ripened and sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Diabolism, and maketh the most potent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Devil against Christ: And if this be but guilded with sacred Ornaments and Titles, and pretences of the Churches Peace and Order, it is Garisoned and fortified, and a stronger hold for sin and Satan than open Vice: And it is certain that as the Rage of Drunkards is raised in their rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Meetings, and as Conjunction, Example and Noise put more Valour into Armies than seperated Persons have, so combined Societies of Learned Reverenced Malignity do Confirm the Individuals, and raise them to the height of Wiekedness: So that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities are either, if holy, a Copy of Paradise, or if malignant, the chief Militia of the malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of man, except a malignant Hierarchy or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, who are malignant Academies grown up to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>

               <hi>Augustine,</hi> and most of the great Lights of the Church for four hundred years attained their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and whether the <hi>Scaligers, Salmasius, Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Selden,</hi> and such others, got not more by labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous secret Reading, than by Academical Tutors and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; and whether such famous men as <hi>John Reignolds, Blondel,</hi> &amp;c. even in the Universities, got not their great Learning by searching the same Books which may be read in another place. If any say, that I speak against that which I want my self, I only desire that it may not be those who cast by my <hi>Catholick Theologie, Methodus Theologiae,</hi> &amp;c. with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accusation, but because they are <hi>too Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Accurate and hard for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I here bewail it as my great sin against God, that in the Youth of my Ministry, Pride made me often blush with shame for want of Academical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but usually God will not have us bring our own humane honour to his Service, but setch honour from him, in faithful serving him: Fringes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must be last set on, when the Garment is made, and not be the ground or Stamen of it. There have been men that have desired their Sons to learn all the Oriental Tongues, and the rare Antiquities and critical applaud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d sort of Learning, not for its own worth, but that they might Preach the Gospel with the advantage of a greater name and honour: And this course hath so taken up and formed such Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents into the quality of their Studies, when their Souls should have been taken up with Faith and Love, and Heavenly Desires and Hopes, that it hath overthrown the end to which it was intended, and rendred such Students unfit for the Sacred Ministry, and caused them to turn to other things: When others,
<pb facs="tcp:60383:7"/>
who (as <hi>Usher, Bochart, Blondel,</hi> &amp;c.) have first taken in a digested Body of saving Truth, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter added these Critical Studies at full maturity, have become rare Blessings to the Church.</p>
            <p>Let those that think all this digressive, or unmeet for the <hi>Preface</hi> to a Catechism, Pardon that which the Worlds Miscarriages and Necessities bespeak.</p>
            <p>If at least Masters of Families, by such helps diligently used, will keep up Knowledge and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their Houses, it is not publick failings in Ministers, nor the want of what is desirable in the Assemblies, that will root out Religion from the Land: But if the faithful prove few, they must be content with their Personal Comforts and Rewards; there is nothing amiss in the heavenly Society, and the World which we are entering into: Come Lord Iesus, Come quickly. Amen.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60383:13"/>
3. And a Power of <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> about things above Sense, proper to a Man; three Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in one spiritual Substance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What else do you find in your self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I find that my spiritual Substance as Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, hath also a <hi>Threefold Power</hi> in one, that is, 1. <hi>Intellectual Life,</hi> by which I move and act my faculties, and execute my purposes. 2. <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 3. And <hi>Will,</hi> and that these are marvellously diverse, and yet one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What else find you by your self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I find that this unseen Spirit is here United to a humane Body, and is in Love with it, and careth for it, and is much limited by it, in its Perceivings, Willings and Workings; and so that a Man is an Incorporate Understanding Spirit, or a humane Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What else perceive you by your self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I perceive that my higher Powers are given me to rule the lower, my Reason to rule my Senses and Appetite, my Soul to rule and use my Body, as Man is made to rule the <hi>Beasts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What know you of your self as related to others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I see that I am a Member of the World of Mankind, and that others are better than I, and multitudes better than one; and that the Welfare of Mankind depends much on their Duty to one another; and therefore that I should Love all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their worth, and faithfully endeavour the good of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What else know you of your self?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know that I made not my self, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not my self in Life and Safety, and therefore
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60383:13"/>
that another made me and maintaineth me; and I know that I must Die by the Separation of my Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> And can we tell what then becomes of the Soul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I am now to tell you but how much of it our Nature tells us, the rest I shall tell you afterward; we may know, 1. That the Soul being a <hi>Substance</hi> in the Body, will be a <hi>Substance</hi> out of it, unless God should destroy it, which we have no cause to think he will. 2. That <hi>Life, Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> being its very <hi>Nature,</hi> it will be the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, and not a thing of some other kind. 3. That the Soul being <hi>naturally Active,</hi> and the World full of Objects, it will not be a sleepy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active thing. 4. That its <hi>Nature</hi> here being to mind its Interest in another Life, by <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Fears</hi> of what will follow, God made not its Nature such in vain, and therefore that Good or Evil in the Life that's next will be the Lot of all.</p>

                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> YOu have told me how we know the things which we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> without us and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: But how can we know any things which we neither see nor feel, but are quite above us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By certain <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> which notifie them: How little else did man differ from a Beast;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60383:14"/>
if he knew no more than he seeth and feeleth? Besides what we know from others that have seen; you see not now that the Sun will rise to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or that Man must die: you see not <hi>Italy, Spain, France;</hi> You see no mans Soul: And yet we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that such things are and will be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> How know you that there is any thing above us, but what we see?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We see such things done here on Earth, which nothing doth or can do which is seen. What thing that is seen can give all Men and Beasts their life and sense and safety? and so marvellously form the bodies of all, and govern all the matters of the World? 2. We see that the spaces above us, where Sun, Moon and Stars are, are so vast, that all this Earth is not so much to them, as one Inch is to all this Land: And we see that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions above us, excel in the glory of purity and splendor: And when this dark spot of Earth hath so many millions of Men, can we doubt whether those vast and glorious parts are better inhabited? 3. And we find that the grossest things are the basest, and the most <hi>invisible</hi> the most Powerful and Noble; as our <hi>Souls</hi> are above our Bodies: And therefore the most vast and Glorious Worlds above us, must have the most invisible, powerful, noble inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But how know you what those Spirits above us are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We partly know what they <hi>are,</hi> by what <hi>they do</hi> with us on <hi>Earth.</hi> 2. We know much what they are, by the Knowledge of our selves. If our Souls are <hi>Invisible Spirits, essentiated by</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Life, Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> the Spirits
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60383:14"/>
above us can be no less, but either such or more excellent. And he that made us, must needs be more excellent than his work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> How know you who made us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He that made all things, must needs be our Maker, that is, GOD; <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 19, 20, 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What mean you by God? And what is He?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I mean, <hi>The Eternal, Infinite, Glorious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> most <hi>Perfect</hi> in <hi>Active Power, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> and <hi>Will, Of whom, and by whom,</hi> and <hi>to whom are all things; being</hi> the <hi>Creator, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and End of all.</hi> This is that God whom All things do declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> How know you that there is such a God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By his works; (And I shall afterwards tell it you more fully by his Word.) Man did not make himself; Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Trees and Plants make not themselves: The Earth, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Air made not themselves: And if the Souls of men have a maker, the Spirits next above them must have a Maker: and so on, till you come to a first Cause that was made by none. There must be a first Cause, and there can be but one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Why may there not be many Gods, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that were made by none, but are Eternally of themselves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because it is a Contradiction; The same would be both perfect and imperfect: Perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is of himself Eternally, without a cause, and so dependent upon none: And yet <hi>Imperfect,</hi> because he hath but a <hi>Part</hi> of that <hi>Being</hi> that is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60383:15"/>
said to be perfect: For <hi>many</hi> are more than <hi>One,</hi> and all make up the absolute, perfect being, and <hi>One</hi> of them is but a <hi>Part</hi> of all: And to be a <hi>Part</hi> is to be Imperfect. However, many subordinate Created Spirits may unfitly be called Gods, there can be but <hi>one uncreated</hi> God in the first and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> How know you that God is Eternal, without Beginning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because else there was a time when there was Nothing; if there were a time when there was no God. And then there never would have been any thing: For nothing can make nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> But how can man conceive of an Eternal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caused Being?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That such a GOD there is, is the most certain easie Truth, and that he hath all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection before described: But neither Man nor Angel can know him Comprehensively.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What mean you by his <hi>Infiniteness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That his <hi>Being</hi> and Perfection have no limits or measure, but incomprehensibly comprehend all Place and Beings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is this GOD to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is our <hi>Maker;</hi> and therefore our <hi>absolute Owner,</hi> our <hi>Supream Ruler,</hi> and our <hi>Chief Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Ultimate End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> And how stand we related to him? what duty do we owe him? and what may we expect from him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are his Creatures; and all that we are and have is of him; we are his Subjects, made with Life, Reason and Free-will, to be ruled by him: He is the Infinite Good, and Love it self.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60383:15"/>
Therefore we owe him perfect Resignation, perfect Obedience, and perfect Complacency and Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All that we are, and all that we have, and all that we can doe, is due to him in the way of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; to pay which, is our own Rectitude and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity as it is our Duty: But all this you must much better learn from his <hi>Word,</hi> than Nature alone can teach it you. Though Mans Nature and the frame of Nature about us, so fully proveth what I have said, as leaveth all the Ungodly without excuse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 1. I</hi> Perceive that nothing more concerneth us, than to know GOD and our Relation and Duty to him, and what hope we have from him; Therefore I pray you open it to me more fully: And first tell me <hi>Where God is?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> GOD being <hi>Infinite</hi> is not confined in any <hi>Place,</hi> but all <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>things</hi> are in GOD; and he is absent from none, but as near to every thing, as it is to it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Why then do you say that <hi>he is in Heaven;</hi> if he be <hi>as much</hi> on Earth, and every where?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> GOD is not more or less in one place than another in his Being, but he is apparent and known to us by his <hi>Working,</hi> and so we say <hi>He is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as he there <hi>Worketh</hi> and <hi>Shineth</hi> forth to the most blessed Creatures in <hi>Heavenly Glory.</hi> As we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60383:16"/>
say the Sun is where it shineth; Or, to use a more apt Comparison, the Soul of Man is indivisibly in the whole Body, but it doth not <hi>Work</hi> in all parts alike; it understandeth not in the Foot, but in the Head; it Seeth not, Heareth not, Tasteth not, and smelleth not in the Fingers or lower parts, but in the Eye, the Ear, and other Senses in the Head; and therefore when we talk to a man, it is his Soul that we talk to, and not his Flesh, and yet we look him in the Face; not as if the Soul were no where but in the Face or Head, but because it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worketh and appeareth there by those Senses and that Understanding which we Converse with: Even so we look up to Heaven when we speak to God; not as if he were no where else, but because Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the place of his glorious Appearing and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and as the Head and Face of the World where all true Glory and Felicity is, and from whence it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth to this Earth, as the Beams of the Sun do from its glorious Center.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> You begin to make me think that GOD is the SOUL of the WORLD, and that we must conceive of him in the World, as we do of the Soul of Man in his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You cannot better Conceive of GOD, so you will but take in the points of Difference, which are very great; for no Creature known to us, doth resemble God without vast Difference.</p>
               <p>The Differences are such as these. First, The Soul is <hi>part</hi> of the Man, but God is not a part of the World, or of Being: For to be a part, is to be less than the whole, and so to be Imperfect. Secondly, We cannot say that the Soul is any where out of the Body, but the World is Finite, and God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60383:16"/>
is Infinite, and therefore God is not Confined to the World. 3. The Soul ruleth not a Body that hath a distinct Understanding and Free Will of its own to receive its Laws, and therefore ruleth it not by proper Law, but by despotical Motion: But God ruleth men that have Understanding and Free Will of their own to know and receive his Laws, and therefore he ruleth them partly by a Law. 4. The Soul doth not use another Soul under it to rule the Body, but GOD maketh use of Superiour Spirits to move and rule things and Persons below them, so that there is great difference between Gods ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the World, and the Souls ruling the Body.</p>
               <p>But yet there is great likeness also. 1. God is as near every part of the World, as the Soul is near the Body. 2. God is as truely and fully the Cause of all the Actions and Changes of the World, (except sin which Free Will left to it self com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth) as the Soul is the Cause of the Actions and Changes of the Body. 3. The Body is no more lifeless without the Soul, than the World would be without God. Yea, God giveth all its Being to the World, and without him it would be nothing, and in this he further differeth from the Soul, which giveth not material being to the Body.</p>
               <p>So that you may well conceive of GOD as the SOUL of the World, so you will but put in that he is <hi>far more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Is it not below God to concern himself with these lower things? Doth he not leave them to those that are under him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is below God to be unconcerned about any part, even the least of his own works. Men are narrow Creatures, and can be but in one place
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60383:17"/>
at once, and therefore must do that by others which they cannot do themselves, at least without trouble: But God is infinite, and present with all Creatures; and as nothing is in being without him, so nothing can move without him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> By this you make God to do all things Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, whereas we see he works by means and second causes: He giveth us light and heat by the Sun; he upholdeth us by the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The word <hi>Immediate</hi> sometime signifieth, <hi>A cause that hath no other cause under it:</hi> So the Sun is the immediate cause of the emanation of its beams of Light. And so God is not alwaies an Immediate Cause; that is, He hath other causes under him: But sometime, <hi>Immediate</hi> signifieth that which is <hi>next</hi> a thing, having nothing between them. And so God doth all things <hi>Immediately:</hi> For he is, and he acteth as near us as we to our selves, and nothing is between him and us: He is as near the person and the Effect, when he useth Second Causes as when he useth none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But is it not a debasing GOD to make his Providence the cause of every motion of a Worm, a Bird, a Fly, and to mind and move such contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things: and so to mind the thoughts of man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a debasing God to think that he is like a finite Creature, absent, or insufficient for any of his Creatures. That there is not the least thing or motion so small, as to be done without him, is most certain to him that will consider, 1. That Gods very Essence is every where: And wherever he is, he is himself, that is, most Powerful, Wise and Good: And if such a God be as near to every Action as the most immediate Actor is, so that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60383:17"/>
in him they all Live, and Move, and Be, how can he be thought to have no hand in it, as to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or causality?</p>
               <p>2. And it's certain that God upholds continually the very Being of every thing that moveth, and all the Power by which they move: For that which had no Being but from him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an have none continued but by him: That which could not make it self, cannot continue it self: Should not God by his causality continue their being, every Creature would turn to nothing. For there can be nothing without a Cause, but the first Cause which is GOD.</p>
               <p>3. And it is all one to <hi>Infiniteness</hi> to mind eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature and motion in the World, and to cause and rule the least, as it is to cause and rule but one. God is as sufficient for all the World, even every Fly and Worm, as if he had but One to mind. Seeing then that he is as present with every Creature as it is with it self, and it hath not the least power but what he continually giveth it, and cannot move at all but by him, and he is as sufficient for All as for One, it's unreasonable to think that the least thing is done without him. Is it a dishonour to the Sun that every Eye, even of Flies, and Ants, and Toads, and Snakes, as well as Men, do see by the light of it? or that it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at once upon every p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le of Grass and Atome? This is but the certain Effect of Gods Infinitene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> How doth God Govern all things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He Governeth several things according to their several Natures which he hath made: Lifeless things by their natural Inclinations, and by moving
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60383:18"/>
force; Things that have <hi>sense</hi> by their sensitive Inclinations, and by their objects, and by constraint; And Reasonable Creatures by their Principles, and by Laws and Moral Rules: And all things by his Infinite Power, Wisdom and Will, as being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one parts of one World, which is his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> Especially Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is <hi>Gods Kingdom?</hi> and why do you call him our King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I call him our <hi>King,</hi> because, 1. He only hath absolute <hi>Right, Power</hi> and <hi>Fitness</hi> to be our Supream Ruler: 2. And he doth actually Rule us as our Soveraign. And in this KINGDOM, 1. GOD is the Only Supream King and Head. 2. Angels or Glorified Spirits and Men are the Subjects: 3. All the Bruits and lifeless Creatures are the Furniture, and goods and utensils. 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Rebellious Wicked men, are the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be opposed and overcome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> How doth GOD govern Man on Earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The <hi>Power</hi> of God, our Lord, Owner and Mover, moveth us, and disposeth of us, as he doth of all things, to the fullfilling of his Will. 2. The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God our <hi>King,</hi> doth give us sound Doctrine, and holy and just Laws, with Reward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Penalties, and he will Judge men and execute accordingly. 3. And the Love of our Heavenly Father doth furnish us with all necessary blessings, help us, accept us, and prepare us for the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Why is man Ruled by Laws rather than Beasts and other things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because man hath <hi>Reason,</hi> and Free-will, which maketh them Subjects capable of Laws, which Beasts are not.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is that Free-will which fits us to be Subjects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a Will made by God able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it self, by Gods necessary help, to choose Good and refuse Evil, understood to be such, without any necessitating Predetermination by any other.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60383:19"/>
sence which we are speaking of, whatever you Call it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What is it then that you Call A <hi>Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Any</hi> Signification of the Will of the Ruler purposely given to the Subject, that thereby he may know and be bound to his Duty, and know his Reward or Punishment due. Or any signification of the Rulers will for the Government of Subjects, constituting what shall be Due from them, and to them. A Rule to live by, and the Rule by which we must be judged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What then is Gods Law of Nature, made for man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the signification of Gods Governing Will, by the Nature of man himself, and of all other Creatures known to man, in which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth to man his Duty and his reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How can a man know Gods Will and our duty by his <hi>Nature,</hi> and by all other Works of God about us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In some things as surely as by words or writings; but in other things more darkly. I am sure that my <hi>Nature</hi> is made to Know and Love Truth and Goodness, and to desire and seek my own Felicity: My <hi>Nature</hi> tells me that I was not made by my self, and do not live by my Self, and therefore that I am not my own, but his that made me: All things shew me that there is a God who must needs be <hi>Greater, Wiser</hi> and <hi>Better</hi> than all his Creatures, and therefore ought to be most Honoured, Feared, Loved and Obeyed: I see multitudes of persons of the same Nature with me, and therefore obliged to the same duty to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60383:19"/>
God; I see much of Gods work in them which is Good, and therefore to be Loved: And I see that we are all parts of one World, and made to be useful to one another: These and many such things the Reason of man may discern in himself and other works of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But I thought the Law of Nature had been every mans natural temper and disposition, which inclineth him to action: And you make it to be only a notifying sign of duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Figuratively, some call <hi>every Inclination</hi> a Law, but it's no such thing that we are speaking of: Only a mans natural Inclination among other signs may notifie his duty. But I hope you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that a mans vicious Inclination is Gods Law: Then you would make Original sin, and the work of the Devil to be Gods Law. One mans sinful distemper of Soul, and another mans bodily distemper (the fruit of sin) inclineth him to wrath, to lust, to idleness, to sinful sports, or drinking, or gluttony: And these are so far from being Gods Law of Nature, that they are the contraries, and the Law of Satan in our members, rebelling against the Law of God. And though the good Inclinations of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature (to Justice, Peace, Temperance) be by some called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> it is not as they are <hi>Inclinations,</hi> but as from them we may know our duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Hath God any <hi>Natural Officers</hi> under him in governing man? I pray you tell me how far Mans Power is of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God hath set up divers sorts of humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Powers under him in the World, which all have their place and order assigned them; some
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60383:20"/>
by Nature, as entire; some by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture since the Fall, and some by supernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, (which is not to be here spoken to, but afterward.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Because I have heard some say that God made no Government, but men do it by consent for their necessity, I pray you shew me what Government God made by Nature, and in what order?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Next to Gods own Governing Right which is the first, God hath made every man a Governour of himself. For God made him with some faculties which must <hi>be ruled</hi> (as the Appetite, Senses, and Tongue, and other bodily members, yea and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions too,) and with some which must <hi>Rule</hi> the rest, (as the Understanding by guidance, and the Will by command.) And this <hi>self-governing</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is so necessary and Natural, that no man can take it from us, or forbid us the due exercise of it, any more than they can bind us to sin or to self-destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Which is the next humane Power in order?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 2. The Governing power of the Husband over the Wife; whose very <hi>nature</hi> as well as Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal shews that she was made to be Subject, though under the Law of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But is not this by <hi>consent</hi> rather than by <hi>nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is by Consent that a woman is married: but when she hath made her self a Wife, <hi>Nature</hi> maketh her a Subject; unless madness or disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty make the man unmeet for his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Which is the next sort of Natural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 3. The <hi>Parents</hi> Government of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60383:20"/>
Nature maketh it the duty of Parents to rule, and of Children to obey. And though some have been so unnatural as to deny this, and say that Children owe nothing but reverence and gratitude, yet there is no danger of the common prevalency of such a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which the nature of all mankind confuteth, save that licentious Youth will take advantage of it to disobey their Parents to please their lusts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What is the humane Government which Gods Law of Nature hath instituted to man since his fall and corruption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 4. That is to be afterward explained: But Magistracy, or Civil Government is certainly of Natural Institution, though it is uncertain how God would have governed Man in such Societies by man, if they had not sinned. The Law of Nature teacheth man the necessity of Civil Society, and of Government therein; and therefore obligeth man thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> This seemeth to be but the effect of mens own perceived necessity, and so to be but their arbitrary choice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Their <hi>Necessity</hi> is <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>notice of it</hi> is Natural, and the <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>Remedy</hi> is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the <hi>fitness</hi> of <hi>Magistracy</hi> to its use is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: Therefore it is the Law of God in Nature that bindeth them to choose and use it: And if any Countrey should choose to live without Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, they would sin against the Law of Nature, and their own good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> But I have heard that God hath made no Law what Form of Civil Government shall be used, but left it to every Countreys choice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God hath by nature made it necessary that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60383:21"/>
there be Magistracy; that is, some men in power over Societies to enforce the obedience of Gods own common Laws, and to make their subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Laws about undetermined mutable matters to that end, for the honour of God and the Good of the Society.</p>
               <p>But, 1. Whether this Government shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by one or many: 2. And who shall be the Persons, Gods Law hath left undetermined to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Liberty: The <hi>Form</hi> and the <hi>Persons</hi> are chosen, neither by the said <hi>persons,</hi> nor by the People only, but by the mutual consent and contract of both: 3. And also by this contract the Degree of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and order of the exercise may be Stated and limited: But for all that, when humane consent hath chosen the persons, the essential Power of Governing in Subordination to Gods Laws, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (not from man, but) immediately from Gods Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> But what if these sorts of Government prove cross to one another; and Reason commandeth one thing, an Husband another, a Parent another, and the Magistrate another; which must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Each have their proper <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> which none of the other can forbid. Self-Government is the Reasonable management of our own Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and actions in obedience to God, for our own Salvation. And no King or other can take this from us: And if they forbid us any necessary duty to God, or necessary Means of our Salvation, they do it without Authority, and are not to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in obeyed.</p>
               <p>A Husbands power to govern his Wife, is for the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60383:21"/>
necessary Ends of their Relation, which the King hath no power to forbid. A Parents power to rule his Children, is for the Necessary Education of them for the welfare of Soul and Body; and the King hath no power to forbid it. Should he forbid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to feed their Children, or teach them Gods Laws, or to choose for them Orthodox fit Tutors, Pastors, and Church-Communion where God is lawfully worshipped; and should he command the Children to use the contrary, it is all Null and powerless.</p>
               <p>But it belongeth to the <hi>Magistrate only</hi> (though not to <hi>destroy</hi> any of the three former Governments, which are all before his in Nature and Time, yet) to <hi>Govern</hi> them all, by directing the exercise of them in <hi>lawful things</hi> to the <hi>common good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> How far doth the Law of Nature assure us of Gods rewards and punishments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As it assureth us that perfect man owed God perfect Obedience, Trust and Love, so it certifieth us, 1. That this performed must needs be acceptable to God, and tend to the felicity of the Subject, seeing Gods Love is our Felicity. 2. And that sinning against Gods Law deserveth Punishment. 3. And that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Justice must make such a difference between the obedient and the sinner, as the Ends of Government require. 4. And seeing that before mans obedience or sin, God made mans Soul of a Nature not tending to its own mortality, we have cause to expect that mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments should be suitable to such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. For though he can make Bruits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and can annihilate mans Soul or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet we see that he keeps so close to his Natural Establishments, that we have no reason to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60383:22"/>
think that he will cross them here, and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Souls to shorten their Rewards or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> But doth Nature tell us what kind of Rewards and Punishments men have?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Faculties of the Soul being made in their Nature to know God in our degree, to Love him, to please him, and to rest and rejoice herein, and this in the society of wise and good and blessed joyful fellow Creatures, whom also our Nature is made to Love; it followeth that the Perfection of this Nature in these Inclinations and Actions, is that which God did make our Natures for, to be obtained by the obeying of his Laws.</p>
               <p>And sin being the Injurious contempt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of God, and the most hurtful malady of the Soul, and of Societies, and to others, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that those that have finally forsaken God, be without the happiness of his Love, and Glory, and under the sence of their sin and his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and that their own sin will be their misery, as diseases are to the Body; and that the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Persons that by sin they injured or infected, will somewhat contribute to their punishment. Happiness to the good, and Misery to the bad, the Light and Law of Nature teacheth man to expect: But all that I have taught you, is much more surely and fully known by <hi>Supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. God himself gave them the Evidence of this also in the Revelation, that it was from him and no deceit. But it is no more possible for any of us that never had such a Revelation our selves, to know sensibly and formally what it is, and how they knew it, than it is for a man born blind to know how other men see, or what seeing is. 2. But moreover, they also were sure that it was of God, by the proofs by which they make us sure of it: And this leads us up to the other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. <note n="g" place="bottom">Heb. 2. 3, 4.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> And a question of unspeakable moment it is, <hi>How we can be sure of such prophetical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations delivered to us by others?</hi> viz, <hi>That they were not deceived, nor deceive us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is of exceeding consequence indeed, and therefore deserveth to be understandingly considered and handled.</p>
               <p>And here you must first consider the difference of Revelation. Some were but made or sent by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60383:24"/>
Prophets to some particular Persons about a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal particular business, (as to <hi>Abraham</hi> that he should have a Son, that <hi>Sodom</hi> should be burnt; to <hi>David,</hi> that his Son should be his punishment, his child die; to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he should reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) These none were bound to know and believe, but the persons concerned to whom they were revealed and sent: (Till they were made publick afterwards.) But some Revelations were made for whole Countreys, and some for all the World, and that as Gods Laws or Covenants, which Life and <hi>Death dependeth</hi> on: And these must be accordingly made known to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> I perceive then that before we further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Certainty, I should first ask you of the <hi>Matter;</hi> what things they be that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally revealed to man,</hi> especially for us all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The particular <hi>Revelations</hi> to and about particular mens matters, are <hi>many of them</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us for <hi>our notice:</hi> But there may be <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands more</hi> in the World, that we know not, nor are concerned to know: What Revelation God ever made to any persons throughout the World (as what should befall them, when they should die,) what Wars or Plagues or Famine should come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> little do we know: But what is recorded by God we know.</p>
               <p>2. But as for his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> which we are all concerned to know, I shall now but name and afterward open what God hath Revealed.</p>
               <p>I. He revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> besides the Law of Nature (which was perfecter and clearer to him than it is now to us) a trying Prohibiton to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, adding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60383:24"/>
the Penalty of death to restrain him. <note n="h" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 16, 17. Gen. 3. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>II. He judged him after his Fall to some degree of Punishment, but declared his pardoning Mercy, and promised Victory to and by the Womans Seed in the War which they now engaged in with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the Serpent and his seed. And he instituted Sacrificing to typifie the Means. <note n="i" place="bottom">Gen 4. 4. Gen. 9. 1, 2, to 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>III. He renewed this Covenant with <hi>Noah</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood.</p>
               <p>IV. He made a special Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be the God of his Seed, as a Peculiar people chosen to him out of all the World; and that all Nations should be blessed in his <hi>seed:</hi> And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Sacramant of Circumcision to be the Seal and Symbole. <note n="k" place="bottom">Gen. 12. 2, 3. &amp; 17. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>V. When his Seed were multiplyed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he brought them out, and in performance of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made them a Holy Common-wealth as their Soveraign, and gave them at large a Law and Sub-governours; which as Political was proper to the people. <note n="l" place="bottom">Exod. 2. &amp;c. 20. &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>VI. In the fulness of time God sent his Son to reconcile man to God, to reveal his Love and Will most fully, and to make and Seal the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace in its last and best Edition, and as King to Rule and Judge the Redeemed, and Sanctifie, Justifie and Glorifie the Faithful.

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Is it equally necessary to us to believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word in the Bible? or is every word equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Truths are Truths, which is, to be <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True</hi> in themselves: And so if by <hi>certainty</hi> you mean nothing but <hi>infallible Truth,</hi> every Truth is so certain; and all Gods words are True: But if by [<hi>certain</hi>] you mean that which is so <hi>evident to us</hi> that we may our selves be fully certain of the Truth, so the parts of Gods word have different degrees of Certainty. We suppose false Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and false Printings are none of Gods Word: Nor the Words of Satan or fallible men recited in the Bible, save only the historical Assertion that such words were spoken by them. But that which is Gods Word indeed, is none of it so far void of proof, but that we may come to a certainty that it's true: And if we had equal evidence that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word is Gods Word, we should have equal Evidence that all is true. For that God cannot Lie, is the foundation Truth of all our certainty. But God did not Reveal every Truth in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with equal evidencing attestation from Heaven. Some of them much more concern us than others, and therefore were more fully sealed and attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <note n="n" place="bottom">Heb. 7. 22. &amp; 9. 15, 16, 17, 18. 9. 13. &amp; 8. 10. &amp; 10. 16.

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> How are we sure of the Law that was given
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60383:25"/>
to <hi>Adam,</hi> and that he sinned, as is written, and had after a pardoning Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Law of Nature given him is yet Gods common Law to the World, saving the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it as a Condition of Life. 2. The fall of Man hath too full proof in all the pravity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the Birth. 3. The Pardoning Act is evident in the Execution, God giveth all Men Mercy contrary to their deserts, and useth none in the utmost rigour. 4. The notorious Enmity between Christ and Satan, and their Seeds, through all Ages and Places of the World doth prove the Sentence, and the Law of Grace. 5. The universal Curse or Punishment on Mankind, sheweth somewhat of the Cause. 6. The Tradition of Sacrificing was so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received over all the World, as confirmeth to us, that God delivered it to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol and a Type of the Grace then promised. 7. But our fullest proof of all that History, is that which after proved the Word that revealed it to us. <note n="o" place="bottom">Psal. 14. Rom. 3. Psal. 145.9. Act. 14. 17. 1 Ioh. 3.8.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> How are we certain that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was God's Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By a Course of wonderful Miracles wrought to prepare them to receive it, and to attest it. The Ten marvellous Plagues of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the Passage through the Red Sea, the opening of the Rock to give them Water; feeding them with Manna, raining twice Quails upon them, the sight of the flaming Mount, with the terrible concomitants: The sight of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Fire by Night, and Cloud by Day, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60383:26"/>
conducted them: The sight of the Cloud and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of God's presence at the Door of the Tabernacle; the miraculous Destruction of the Rebellious, even by the opening of the Earth, and the performance of God's Promises to them. All these were full proofs that it was of God. 2. But we have yet fuller proof in Christs latter Testimony, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth all this to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> These were full Proofs to those that saw them. But are we certain that the Records of them in the Scripture are true?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Consider that they were written by <hi>Moses</hi> to that very People who are said to see them. <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 1. 31. &amp; 3. 21, 22. &amp; 4. 3. 9. &amp; 5. 24. &amp; 10. 21. &amp; 11. 7. &amp; 29. 3. Ios. 24. 7.</note> And if one should now write to us <hi>English-men,</hi> that God brought us out of another Land by Ten such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miracles, as the Frogs, the Flies, the Lice, the Darkness, the Waters turned Blood, the Death of their Cattel, and of all their first Born, that he opened the Sea and brought us through it on Foot, that he opened Rocks, fed us with Manna, rained Quails for a Months food, spake from a flaming Mount, and opened the Earth to swallow up Rebells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when we know all this to be false, would not all Men deride and abhorr the Reporter? Would any of us receive a Law, and that of such operous, numerous, costly Services, by the Motive of such a report as this?</p>
               <p>2. Consider, that this Law so delivered was on this ground entertained, and unchangeably kept by them from Generation to Generation, it being taken for an heinous Crime to alter it in one word <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 12. 32.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60383:26"/>3. Consider, that <hi>Practised Sacramental Symbols</hi> from the first Day were so uninterruptedly kept, as was a fuller proof of the Fact than the bare Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. 1. All their Males from the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were constantly Circumcised (save in the Wilderness Travels) and are to this Day. 2. From the very Night that the First-Born were kill'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they driven hastily out; they yearly continued the Eating of the Passover with unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread, as in a hasting posture. 3. Since the Law given in the Wilderness, they constantly used the Sacrifices, the Oblations, the Tabernacle, the Priesthood and Ceremonies as that Law prescribed them. And the National constant use of these was an ascertaining Tradition of the matters of Fact which were their cause. 4. Yea, so tenacious were they of this Law, that (as they taught the very Syllables of it to their Children, and kept in the Ark the very Tables of Stone that had the Ten Commandments, so) they were Enemies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity because the Christians were against the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> Observation of their Law, and for its abrogation.</p>
               <p>4. Consider again, that the Matter of Fact, and the Divine Institution is since made certain to us by Christs Testimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But seeing this Law doth not bind us now, nor the particular Messages of the Prophets were sent to us, is it any of our Concern now to know or believe them? It belonged to those that they were made for, and sent to; But what are they to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is not the same necessity to know them, and so to be such that they were all of God, as there is to know and believe the Gospel: But it is greatly our Duty and Concern to believe them;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60383:27"/>
1. Because they were preparatory to the Gospel, and bore an antecedent Testimony to it. 2. Because the Gospel it self beareth witness of their Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which therefore if we believe it, we must believe. 3. Because by the Holy Ghost's direction all now make up our Books of Sacred Records, which is the certain Word of God, though not all of the same Necessity and Evidence.</p>
               <p>And here I must tell you a great and needful Truth, which ignorant Christians fearing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, by overdoing tempt Men to Infidelity. The Scripture is like a Mans Body, where some parts are but for the preservation of the rest, and may be maimed without death: The Sence is the Soul of the Scripture, and the Letters but the Body, or Vehicle. The Doctrine of the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Decalogue, and Baptism, and Lords Supper, is the Vital part, and Christianity it self. The Old Testament Letter (written as we have it about <hi>Ezras</hi>'s time) is that Vehicle which is as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as the Revelation of those times was: But as after Christ's Incarnation and Ascension, the Spirit was more abundantly given, and the Revelation more perfect and Sealed, so the Doctrine is more full, and the Vehicle or Body, that is, the Words are less imperfect, and more sure to us; so that he that doubteth of the Truth of some Words in the Old Testament, or of some small Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials in the New, hath no reason therefore to doubt of the Christian Religion, of which these Writings are but the Vehicle or Body, sufficient to ascertain us of the Truth of the History and Doctrine. Be sure first that Christ is the very Son of God, and it inferreth the certainty of all his Words, and enforceth our whole Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60383:27"/>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> I perceive then that our main Question is, both as to <hi>Necessity and Evidence, How we are sure that the Gospel is true? and the Records of it the very Word of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is so: And as it is this that must Rule and Judge the Church, so we have to us fuller proof of this than of the Old Testament: Because that the narrowness of the <hi>Iews</hi> Countrey in comparison of the Christian World, and the many Thousand Years distance, and a Language whose Phrase and Proverbial speeches, and the very sence of the common words of it, must needs make it more unknown to us than the Language that the Gospel is Recorded in. And it is not the least proof of the Truth of the Old Testament, that it is attested and confirmed by the New.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> Will you first tell me, How the Apostles and that first Age were sure that the Gospel of Christ was the very Word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Here I must first tell you that the great Mystery of the Blessed Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, being One God, is made necessary to us to be believed, not only as to the Eternal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable Inexistence, but specially for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods three great sorts of Works on Man: That is, As our Creator, and the God of Nature; as our Redeemer, and the God of Governing and and reconciling Grace; and as our Sanctifier, and the Applyer and Perfecter of all to fit us for Glory. And so the Son as Redeemer, is the way to the Father, (to know him and his Love, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him:) And the <hi>Holy Ghost is the Witness</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> The proof therefore of the Gospel of Christ in one word is the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> that is, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60383:28"/>
certain Testimony of God's Spirit. And this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony consisteth of these several parts: I. The foregoing Testimony of the Spirit by all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of the Old Testament, and the Typical Prefigurations; which became a fuller proof than before, when they were seen all to be fulfilled in Christ: Yet many were fulfilled before. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had no Child, he was promised the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of his Seed, and that all Nations should be blessed therein, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. &amp; 13. 16. &amp; 15. 5. &amp; 17. 2. &amp; 18. 11, 12.

So was <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Prophesie of <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Scepter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 8, 9, 10. And <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s dreams: And verily <hi>Balaams</hi> last Prophesie was marvellous; who when he had blessed <hi>Israel</hi> and foretold their Victories, foretold also the Scepter of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and the success of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and after that of <hi>Chittim</hi> against the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.

               <p>II. The second part of the <hi>Spirits Testimony,</hi> or the certain proof of Christian Truth is, <hi>The Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent constitutive Proof or Testimony</hi> in the unimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excellency of the <hi>Person and Gospel</hi> of Christ; which is the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>superscription</hi> of God. The Person of Christ was of such excellency of <hi>Wisdom, Goodness and power,</hi> apparent in his Doctrine, Works and Patience, all sinless, and full of Holy Love to God and Man, as is not consistent with being the Deceiver of the World. His Gospel in the very Constitution of it, hath the impress of God. He that hath the Spirit of God, will find that in the Gospel which is so suitable to the Divine Nature, as will make it the easier to him to believe it. Angels preached the Summ of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 14.

               <p>Indeed the Holy Scriptures do bear the very Image and Superscription of God in their Ends, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Manner, and prove themselves to be his Word: For God hath not given us external proofs that such a Book or Doctrine is his, which is it self no better than humane Works, and hath no intrinsick proof of its Divine Original: <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 20. 2 Tim. 3. 15. 2 Tim. 3. 16.

he turned Water into Wine, he fed twice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thousands by Miracle, he walkt on the Sea, and made <hi>Peter</hi> do the same, the Winds and Sea obeyed his Command; he raised the Dead: This course of Miracles were the most evident Testimony of God.</p>
               <p>And he was brought into the World by Miracle: Born of a Virgin: Foretold and Named <hi>Iesus</hi> by an Angel: Preached to Shepherds by Angels from Heaven; a Star conducting the <hi>Eastern</hi> Wise-men to the place; <hi>Iohn</hi> his foregoer named by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and <hi>Zacharias</hi> struck dumb for not believing it: Prophesied of by <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon;</hi> owned at his <hi>Baptism</hi> by the visible descent of the Spirit in the shape of a Dove, and by a Voice of God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the like again at his Transfiguration, when <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared with him, and he did shine in Glory: And at his Death the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Sun was obscured, and the Air darkened, and the Vail of the Temple rent: But the fullest Evidence was Christs own Resurrection from the Dead, his oft appearing to his Disciples after, and conversing with them at times for Forty Dayes, and giving them their Commission, and promising them the Spirit, and ascending into Heaven in their sight. And all this was the fuller Testimony, in that he had oft over and over foretold them of it, that he must be put to death and rise again the Third day, before he entered into his Glory: and the <hi>Iews</hi> knew it, and were not able to prevent it, Angels terrifying the Souldiers on the Watch.: Yea the Disciples understood it not, and therefore believed it not, and <hi>Peter</hi> disswaded him from such talk of his Sufferings, till Christ called him Satan (doing

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, IV. There was the <hi>Consequent Testimony</hi> of the Spirit by the Apostles, and other first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers of the Gospel: Christ bid them wait at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for this Gift, and promised them that when he was ascended, he would send that <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete, Advocate</hi> or <hi>Comforter,</hi> that should be better than his visible presence, and should lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth, and bring all things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and teach them what to say; that is, to Enable them to perform the work to which he had Commissioned them, which was to go into all the World, and preach the Gospel, and Disciple the Nations, Baptizing them, and teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all things that he had commanded them; which they performed partly by <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> by <hi>writing,</hi> and partly by practice, Baptizing, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Churches, establishing Offices and Officers: And he promised to be with them to the end of the World; that is, with their <hi>Persons</hi> for their time, and with their Doctrine, ordinary Successors, and the whole Church ever after. (<hi>r</hi>)</p>
               <p>On the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> even the Lords Day, when they were assembled, this Promise was so far performed to them, that the Holy Ghost sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly <note place="bottom">(q) Ioh. 16. Act. 2. Matt. 28. 20. The whole Book of the Acts of the Apostles is the History of these Miracles. Gal. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. Ioh. 7. 3. 9. Rom. 1. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13.</note>

fell on all the Assembly, in the likeness of fiery cloven Tongues, after the noise as of a rushing Wind, and they were filled with the Spirit, and spake in the Tongues of all the Countreys near them, the Praises and wonderous works of God. After which they were endued with the various miraculous Gifts of the Spirit; that is, the use of the Tongues which they had never learnt; the Interpretation of them, Prophecying, Miracles, healing all Diseases, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that those that came but under the shadow of <hi>Peter,</hi> and those that had but Cloaths from the Body of <hi>Paul,</hi> were all healed; the Lame and Blind cured, Devils cast out, the dead raised, some Enemies struck blind, some sinners struck dead; and which was yet greater, by their Preaching, or Praying, or laying on of Hands, God gave the same miraculous gift of the Spirit to others; and that not to a few, but ordinarily to the faithful, some having one such Gift, and some another.</p>
               <p>And as Christ had promised that when he was lifted up, he would draw all Men to him, so he blest the labours of the Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists accordingly; many Thousands being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at a Sermon, and multitudes still added to the Church. And when the Preachers were forbidden and imprisoned, Christ strengthened them, and Angels miraculously delivered them. When <hi>Peter</hi> was in Prison designed for Death, the Angel of God loosed his Bolts, and open'd the Doors, and led him forth. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had been Scourged and were in the Stocks in the Prison, an Earth quake sets them free, and prepareth for the Conversion of the Jaylor and his House. And Christ himself had before appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> in glory when he was going on in Persecution, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60383:32"/>
struck him down in blindness, and preached to him with a Voice from Heaven, and converted him, and sent him as his Apostle into the World. By these Miracles was the World Converted.</p>
               <p>And as Christ had promised them that they should Greater Works than those which he himself did, so indeed their Miracles did more to Convert the World than the Works of Christ in Person had done. For, 1. Those which were wrought by <hi>One Man</hi> would leave suspicious Men more doubtful of the Truth, than that which is done by many, at a distance from each other, and in several places. 2. And that which was done but in one small Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey would be more doubted of, than that which is done in much of the World. Sometimes indeed Thousands, but usually Twelve Men were the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of what Christ said and did: But what these Witnesses said and did to prove their Testimony, Thousands in many Lands did see and hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> But why was it that Christ forbad some to declare that he was the Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because the time was not come, till the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences were given by which it must be proved: It was not a matter to be rashly believed, and taken upon the bare word of himself or any other: That a Man living in a mean Condition was the Son of God, and Saviour, and Lord and Teacher of the World, and the Judge of all Men, was not to be believed without good proof: And the Chief proof was to be from all Christs own Miracles, and his Resurrection, and Ascension, and the great gift of the Holy Ghost, and Tongues and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Apostles and other Disciples: And these were not all done or given then: Yet because the

                  <hi>Iews</hi> received <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times shewed how they Prophesied of him: Yea, his very Doctrine, whose frame had a self-eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Light, was not fully revealed till it was done by the Spirit in the Apostles. <note n="r" place="bottom">Luke 4. 22. &amp; 24. 27. 32. 45.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> But though all these Miracles were wrought, how could it be certain that they were the attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, when it is said that Magicians, false Prophets and Antichrist may do such things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I shall first mind you, that though we were never so uncertain of the Nature of a Miracle, whether it be wrought by any Created Cause, yet we are agreed that by Miracles, we mean such works which are wrought quite out of and against the common Course of Second Causes, called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And we are sure that as no work can be done without Gods premotion or permission at least, so specially the Course of Nature cannot be altered and over-ruled but by Gods <hi>Knowledge, Consent</hi> and <hi>Execution;</hi> what ever Second Cause unknown to us may be in it, certainly God is the first Cause.</p>
               <p>2. And it is most certain that the <hi>Most perfect Governour of the World,</hi> is not the great Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the World, and is not so wanting in <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> as to Rule them by a Lie; yea, and an unresistible and remediless deceit: This is rather the description of Satan.</p>
               <p>3. And Man must know the will of God by some signs or other, or else he cannot do it: And what signs can the Wit of Man devise, by which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60383:33"/>
they that would fain know the will of God, may come to be certain of it, if such a Course of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles may deceive us? Would you believe if some came from the dead as Witnesses? Or if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or many Angels came from Heaven? All these could give you no more certainty than such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles may do. <note n="t" place="bottom">2 Cor. 11. 4. Mark 16. 17. Exod. 4. 5. 8. &amp; 19. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. And you must note, that the proof of Miracles lyeth not on this, that Angels, or other Spirits, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes can do no such things, but that they cannot do it without God, and that God will not do it to confirm a Lie, or any thing which he would not have Man believe: For then either Man must believe nothing sent from God, though it were by an Host of Angels, or else he must say, I am unavoidably deceived by God himself; for I have no <hi>possible means left to know the Fallacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Therefore you must note, that whenever God permitteth a Magician or false Prophet to do any wonder or unusual thing, he never leaveth Man without a remedy against the Deceit, but doth control<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and confute the Words of the Deceiver: And usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he doth it but first to trie the Faith and steadfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Men, and then to bring Truth into the clearer light. And he controlleth false Miracles these wayes.</p>
               <p>1. He sealeth up the Truth which the Deceiver de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth, with a stream of most unquestionable Miracles; and so sheweth us that it cannot be a Truth and of God which is said against such Sealed Verity, while all <hi>his Miracles confute theirs.</hi> 2. Or if it be a Truth known to Man by the Common <hi>Light of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60383:33"/>
Nature,</hi> that Light confuteth the Pretenders Miracle. 3. If he do it to confirm a false Prediction, it's confuted by the thing not coming to pass. 4. In the case of <hi>Egyptian</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">Act. 8. Simon Magus's Case.</note> Magicians wonders, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them that his power might triumph over them, and confute them; As he may permit a Sophister to talk against the Truth, that he may be silenced and shamed. In none of all this doth God become the Worlds deceiver. But the Miracles of Christ, and his Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>les and Disciples, were never control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Light of Nature, by more prevalent Miracles, or any such means; but were the fullest Signification of Gods attestation that Man can have to save him from Deceit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> I confess if I had seen all these things my self, I should have made no doubt, but God and Reason bound me to believe: But how can we at this distance be sure that all these words of Christ were spoken, and these works done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Let us first consider how <hi>they</hi> were sure of it that lived in that Age with the Apostles, and then how <hi>we</hi> may be also sure. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. That Age, 1. Had the common Evidences of the best credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Men. 2. They had most infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it by their Senses; and 3. They had an immediate Testimony from God themselves. Of these let us consider in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> 1. What credible humane Testimony do you mean they had?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is supposed that some Persons are to be believed much above others; <note n="u" place="bottom">Io. 19. 35. &amp; 20. 31. 1 Io. 5. 13. 1 Cor. 15. 6.</note> else all humane trust
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60383:34"/>
and conversation would cease. He that will believe no Body, cannot expect to be himself believed.</p>
               <p>And, 1. The Witnesses of Christs words and works were not strangers to him, that took it by report, but those that had accompanyed him, and heard and seen them.</p>
               <p>2. They spake to Men of the same Generation, Time and Countrey, and mentioned things done before Multitudes of Spectators; so that had it been a false report, it had been most easie to confute it, and turn it all as a Lie unto their scorn.</p>
               <p>3. They sharply reproved the Rulers and Teachers for rejecting Christ, and provoked all their rage against them: So that no doubt they would do their best to have searcht out all deceit in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers.</p>
               <p>4. They were Men of no Carnal Interest, to tempt them into a deceiving Plot; but were foretold that they must be hated, persecuted and killed for their Testimony.</p>
               <p>5. They were purposely Chosen from among the meaner Unlearned sort, that there might be no Suspicion that it was a Work of carnal Craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>6. Though they heard and saw, so far were they from plotting it, that they understood it not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor believed that Christ must Die for Sin, Rise the Third Day, and Ascend into Heaven, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Catholick Church, and Reign Spiritually; till the time that Christ was Risen, and the Holy Ghost came down upon them.

               <p>8. <hi>Paul</hi> was called by a Glory and a Voice of Christ from Heaven, in the sight of other persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting company.</p>
               <p>9. Their Testimony all agreed, and they all spake the same Truth.</p>
               <p>10. Their Enemies never wrote a Confutation of them, nor decryed most of the matters of Fact, but imputed it to <hi>Beelz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>11. None of them ever repented of his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: Whereas, had they confederated to deceive the World, some ones Conscience living or dying would sure have forced him to confess it.</p>
               <p>12. Yea they sealed it with their great Labour, Sufferings, and Blood.</p>
               <p>13. When false Teachers turned some of their Followers to Heresies, and to forsake them, they still appealed for the matters of Fact, even to those Dissenters or opposers. <note n="y" place="bottom">Gal. 3. 3. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>14. Their Doctrine by its fore-described Light and Goodness testified of it self that it was of God: And that those Men that at so dear a rate divulged it, in design to Sanctifie and Save Mankind, were no such wicked Knaves as to Plot the Worlds Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. These were evidences of more than humane credibility.</p>
               <p>II. And the Disciples in <hi>Iudea</hi> heard and saw Christ and his Miracles, and so had as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the matter of Fact, as sense could give them.</p>

It was not a few Apostles only that had this extraordinary Spirit, but in one sort or other the generality of the Persons converted by them: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as the Apostles were Preaching, the Spirit came upon the Hearers, as it did on <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Assembly, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Usually by the laying on of the Apostles Hands the Holy Ghost was given: And this not only to the <hi>sincere</hi> Christians, but to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60383:35"/>
some <hi>unsound</hi> Ones that sell away: All that did Miracles in Christ's Name, were not saved.</p>
               <p>4. Yea those that accused Christ as casting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by Devils, might have seen their <hi>own Children</hi> cast them out, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. And those that were seduced, and quarrelled with the Apostles, could not deny but they themselves had received the Spirit by their Preaching: <hi>Paul</hi> appealeth to themselves when the <hi>Galatians</hi> were perverted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. <hi>O foolish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Galatians! <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the Truth, before whose Eyes Iesus Christ hath been evidently set forth Crucified among you? This only would I learn of you; Received ye the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? Are ye so foolish, having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the Flesh? He that ministreth to you the Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you, doth he it by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If these <hi>Galatians</hi> had not the Spirit, and such as work't Miracles among them, would not this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument have turned to <hi>Paul</hi>'s reproach, rather than to their Conviction? Even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was so convinced by the Spirit falling on the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that he was Baptized, and would have bought the Power of giving the Holy Ghost with Money, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.

                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> Now tell me how <hi>We</hi> may be certain that all this History is true, and that these things are not misreported by the Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I will speak first of the Gospel as such, and then of the Book.</p>
               <p>I. You must first know that the Gospel in the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, is the <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Christ, necessary to be believed to our Salvation; which is summarily contained in the Baptismal Covenant; For men were Christians when they were Baptized; and they were not adult Christians till they believed the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. You must know, that this <hi>Gospel</hi> was long preached and believed before it was written: St. <hi>Matthew</hi> began and wrote eight years after Christs Resurrection, and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was written about ninety four years after Christs Birth: <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel about fifty, and <hi>Marks</hi> about fifty nine, and St. <hi>Iohns</hi> about Ninety nine from the Birth of Christ. <note n="b" place="bottom">Mar. 16. 20. Act. 6. 8. &amp; 8. 6. 13. &amp; 15. 12. &amp; 19. 11. &amp; 4. 16. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. You must know, that all the foresaid Miracles were wrought to confirm this Gospel preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was written.</p>
               <p>4. And that while the Apostles lived their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had as much Authority as their Writing: But they being to die, were moved by the Spirit to write that they had preached, that it might be certainly without Change delivered to Posterity to the end of the World; For had it been left only to the Memory of man, it would soon have been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously reported and corrupted.</p>
               <p>5. And you must know, that this Scripture is so far from being insufficient as to the Matter of our Faith, as that it containeth not only the <hi>Essentials,</hi> but the <hi>Integrals</hi> and useful <hi>Accidents</hi> of the Gospel; as a compleat Body hath every part, and the very Ornament of Hair and Colour. So that a man may
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60383:36"/>
be a Christian that knoweth not many hundred words in the Scripture, but not unless he know and believe the Essentials of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>6. And you must note therefore, that the foresaid Miracles were wrought primarily to confirm the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that they do confirm all the <hi>Accidental passages</hi> in the Bible but by <hi>Consequence,</hi> because the same Persons by the same Spirit wrote them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> Proceed now to shew me the Proof which you promised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That there have been from that time <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in the World, is past all doubt, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the History of their Enemies that persecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed them. And all these Christians were <hi>Baptized;</hi> for Baptism was their solemn Christening. And every one that was Baptized (at age) did openly profess to receive this same Gospel; even to Believe in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Devil, the Lusts of the Flesh, and the Vanities of the World. <note n="c" place="bottom">The Acts of the Historical Tradition of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>el.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. Yea all that were Baptized were before taught this Gospel, by Teachers or Catechizers, who had all but one Gospel, one Faith and Baptism.</p>
               <p>3. And they were all tryed how they understood the foresaid General words; and therefore they were opened in more words, which we call the CREED; which in Substance and Sence was still the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame, though two or three words be added since the first forming of it. So that every Christian being instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gospel, and professing the Essence of it in the Creed and Baptism, we have as many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that this Gospel was then delivered, as there have been Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60383:37"/>4. And no man doubteth but there have been <hi>Ministers</hi> as long: And what was a Minister but a Preacher, of this same Gospel, and a Baptizer and Guide of them that Believe it?</p>
               <p>5. And none can doubt but there have been Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mblies</hi> from that time: And what were those Assemblies, but for the preaching, professing and practising this Gospel?</p>
               <p>6. And none doubteth but they celebrated the Lords Supper in those Assemblies: And the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Sacrament containeth practically the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               <p>7. And none can doubt but that the Lords day hath ever since been constantly kept by Christians in commemoration of Christs Resurrection, and in the performance of the foresaid Exercises: And therefore the very use of that day assureth us that the Gospel hath been certainly delivered us.</p>
               <p>8. And all grant that these Churches had still the use of Discipline, which was the censuring of such as corrupted this Sacred Doctrine by Heresie, or sinned against it by wicked Lives. And this could not have been, if the Gospel had not been then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them.</p>
               <p>9. Yea the Numbers and Opinions of Hereticks then, are left on Record: And they tell us what the Gospel then was, by telling us wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it.</p>
               <p>10. Yea the History of the Persecutors and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, tell us that this Gospel was then extant which they persecuted.</p>
               <p>11. The Old Testament was long before in the common possess on and use of the <hi>Iews:</hi> They read it every Sabbath day: And in that we see Christ
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60383:37"/>
foretold, and abundance of Prophecies which in him are since fulfilled.</p>
               <p>12. Lastly, the Sacred Scriptures, which contain all that God thought needfull to be transmitted to Posterity for History and Doctrine, have been most certainly kept and delivered to us; so sure and full is our Tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 24.</hi> That Christianity hath been propagated none can doubt: But how are we sure that those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of the first age did indeed see, or believe that they saw and heard those Miracles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To <hi>be a Christian</hi> was to be <hi>one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them.</hi> It was half their belief in Christ, and in the Holy Ghost, and so the very <hi>Essence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> to believe that Christ wrought his Miracles and rose again, and that the Apostles by the Holy Spirit did work theirs, and that Believers received the Spirit by their Ministry.</p>
               <p>2. They had not been made Christians but by these Miracles: They all professed that it was the Gifts of the Spirit that Convinced and Converted them.</p>
               <p>3. All the forementioned Professions of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity contained a Profession that they believed these Miracles. As the use of the Lords day, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the Eucharist, shewed their Belief of Christs Life, Death and Resurrection.</p>
               <p>4. They suffered Persecution and Martyrdom in the Profession of that Belief.</p>
               <p>5. They pleaded these Miracles in all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences against their Adversaries.</p>
               <p>6. The Writings of their Adversaries commonly acknowledge this Plea, yea and deny not the most of the Miracles themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60383:38"/>7. But most fully their receiving the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the Word of God, as indited by the Holy Ghost in the Apostles, sheweth that they believed the Miracles recorded in that Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> You are come up to the last part of the Doubt in the History, How are we sure that these Christians then commonly believed the Book as now we have it, and that it is the very same?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We have for this, full, infallible, historical Proof (premising that some parcels of the Book (the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the Epistle of <hi>Iude,</hi> the Second of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that of <hi>Iames</hi>) were longer unknown to some particular Churches than the rest.)</p>
               <p>1. The constancy of Christian Assemblies and publick Worship is a full proof, seeing that the Reading, Expounding and applying of these Books, was a great part of their publick work, as all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Friends and Enemies agree.</p>
               <p>2. The very Office of the Ministry is full proof, which lay most in reading, expounding and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these same Books. And therefore they were as much by Office concerned to keep them, as Judges and Lawyers are to keep the Statute-book.</p>
               <p>3. These Ministers and Churches which so used this Book, were dispersed over a great part of the World: If therefore they had changed it by adding or diminishing, they must have done it by Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, or by single mens errour or abuse. It was impossible that all Countreys should agree in such a Confederacy, but the meeting, motives and treaties would have been known: But no History of Friend or Foe hath any such thing, but the clean contrary: And that it should be done by all single Persons in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60383:38"/>
the Christian World, agreeing by chance in the same Changes, is a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d supposition.</p>
               <p>4. And it is the belief of all Christians, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a damnable Sin to add or alter in this Book: And the Book it self so concludeth: Therefore if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome had agreed so to do, the rest would have detected and decryed it. 5. They took this Book <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be the Charter for their Salvation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would never agree to alter it; when Men keep the Deeds, Evidences, Leases and Charters of their Estates, and Worldly Priviledges unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>6. When a few Hereticks rose up that forged some new Books, as Apostolical, and rejected some that were such indeed; the Christian Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and rejected them, and appealed to the Churches that had received the Apostles own Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and kept them.</p>
               <p>7. The many Heresies that rose up did so divide Men, and set them in cross Interests and Jealousies against each other, that it was impossible for any one Sect to have altered the Scripture, but the rest would have fallen upon them with the loudest Accusations. But all sorts of Adversaries are agreed that these are the same Books.</p>
               <p>And though the weakness and negligence of Scribes have made many little Words uncertain, (for God promised not infallibility to every Scribe or Printer) yet these are not such as alter any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith or Practice, but shew that no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hath been designedly made, but that the Book is the same.</p>
               <p>For instance, Let it be questioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether our <hi>Statute-Book</hi> contained really the same Statutes that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60383:39"/>
are there pretended? And you will see that the Historical certainty amounteth even to a natural cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the contrary being a meer impossibility: For, 1. They are the Kings Laws, and the King would not bear a fraudulent alteration. 2. Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not bear it. 3. Judges that succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively judge by these Laws would soon discover it. 4. So would all Justices and Magistrates. 5. Mens Lives and Estates are held by them, and therefore Multitudes would decry the Fraud. 6. Enemies have daily Suits which are tryed by these Laws, and each Party pleads them for himself, and their Advocates and Lawyers plead them against each other, and would soon detect the Forgery. So that to suppose such a Change, is, 1. To suppose an Effect that hath <hi>no Cause</hi> in Nature. 2. And that is <hi>against a stream of Causes</hi> Moral and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and so impossible.</p>
               <p>And to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eign such forgeries in the Book that all Christians have taken for Gods Laws, is just such another Case, and somewhat beyond it. That is but Moral Evidence which dependeth only on Mens Honesty, or any free unnecessary acts of Mans will. But Mans will hath also of Natural Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, such as the Love of our selves, and our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is a <hi>Natural Impossibility</hi> that all Men or many should agree in a Lie, which is against these Acts of Natural necessity. But so they must do, if all Men of cross Interests, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Dispositions should knowingly agree; <hi>c. g.</hi> That all our Statutes are counterseit, that there is no such place as <hi>Rome, Paris,</hi> or other such l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s. And so the <hi>Gospel</hi> History hath such Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of necessary Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60383:39"/>
                  <hi>Q. 26.</hi> You have made the Case plainer to me than I thought it had been: But you yet seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that some Words, yea, some Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have not the same Evidence a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the rest: can a man be saved that Believeth not all the Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All <hi>Truth</hi> is equally <hi>True;</hi> and so is all Gods Word: But all is not equally <hi>Evident:</hi> He that taketh any Word to be Gods Word, and yet to be false, believeth nothing as Gods Word: For he hath not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If God could lie, we had no certainty of Faith: But he that erroneously think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this or that word, yea, Epistle, or Text, or Book in the Bible is not Gods, but came in by mistake, may be saved, if he believe that which containeth the Essentials of Christianity: A lame Faith may be a saving Faith. And he may see how Miracles sealed the Gospel, that cannot see how they sealed every Book, Text or Word in the Bible. <note n="d" place="bottom">Rom. 14. &amp; 15.</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I have told you of four Proofs already: I. The Antecedent Testimony of the Spirit in the Old Testament. II.

               </p>
               <p>Here you must remember, 1. That the common experience of the World assureth us, that Mans Nature is greatly vitiated, inclined to known evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for some inferiour good, and averse to the greatest good by the prevalency of the lesser; hardly brought to necessary knowledge, and more hardly to the Love, Delight and Practice of that which is certainly the best. And that hence the World is kept in confusion and misery by Sin. <note n="f" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Io. 12. 39, 40. Act. 28. 26, 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. Experience assureth us that there is no hope of any great Cure of this, by the common helps of Nature and humane Reason: For it is that Reason that is diseased, and blinded, and therefore unapt to cure it self, as an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as Philosophers are a small part of the World (for few will be at the cost of getting such knowledge) so they are wofully Dark themselves in the greatest things, and of a Multitude of Sects, contradicting one another, and few of them have Hearts and Lives that are answerable to that which they teach others; and the wisest confess that they must expect few Approvers, much less Followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And every Mans own experience tells him, how hard it is to <hi>Inform the Iudgment</hi> about Holy things, and <hi>to conform the Will to them,</hi> and to <hi>Reform the life</hi> to a Holy and Heavenly State. <note n="g" place="bottom">Luk. 18. 34. 1 Cor. 13. 11.

               </p>
               <p>3. The Multitude of Temptations makes this the more difficult, and so doth the nature of a vicious habit,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60383:40"/>
and the privation of a good one; the self-defending and propagating Nature of Sin, and the experience of the World, tells us how wicked the World is, and how little the Labours of the wisest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Divines or Princes do to reform it, and to make Man better: And especially, how hard it is to get a Heavenly mind, and joy and conversation: And all this being sure, it is as sure that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of Souls is a great work, well beseeming God. 4. And it must be added, that this is the most necessary work for us, and the most excellent: <hi>Paul</hi> tells us but what Reason tells us in that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. how much Holy <hi>Love</hi> (which is the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and real Sanctity) excelleth all Knowledge, Gifts and Miracles: This is the Souls health and well-being: No man can be miserable so far as he is Good and Holy: And no Man can choose but be miserable that is not so: Many shall lye in Hell that cast out Devils, and wrought Miracles in Christ's Name; but none that love God, and are Holy. Christ wrought Miracles, but in order to work Holiness; (as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14. tells them, that strange Languages are below Edifying plainness:) His work as a Saviour is to <hi>destroy the works of the Devil.</hi> Holiness is incomparably better than the Gift of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles. <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Io. 3. 24. &amp; 4. 12. 15, 16.

               <p>This being considered, further think, 1. That <hi>All true Christians</hi> are <hi>Saints:</hi> Hypocrites have but the Name and Image: No one soundly and practically believeth in Christ, and consenteth to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but he is renewed by the Holy Ghost.</p>

Consider how great and excellent a Work this is; to set a Mans Hope and Heart on Heaven; to live by Faith on an unseen World; to place our chiefest Love and Pleasure on God, Holiness and Heaven; to mortifie fleshly Lusts, and be above the power of the Love of the World, and Natural Life; to love others as our selves in the measure that God appeareth in them; to love our Enemies, and to make it the work of our Lives to do the most good we can in the World; to bring every true Believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 29.</hi> But when we see so much Ignorance, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, Confusion and Cruelty, Pride, Lust and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness among Christians, and how they live in mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tearing one another, how can we know that their Goodness is any proof of the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I told you, Hypocrites have but the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Picture</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> of Christianity. If Custom, Prosperity, Laws or Carnal Interest bring the World into the visible Church, and make Men say, <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 1, 2. Act. 20. 32. &amp; 26. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>They believe,</hi> when they do not, is Christianity to be judged of by Dissemblers and Enemies? Mark any that are serious Believers, and you will find them all seriously Sober, Just and Godly: And though weak Believers have but weak Grace, and many Failings, they are sincerely, though imperfectly such as I have described. And though the Blind malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can see no Excellency in a Saint, he that hath either known Faith and Holiness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or hath but impartially observed Mankind, will see that Christians indeed are quite another sort of Men, than the Unbelievers, and that Christ maketh Men such as he teacheth them to be, and the <hi>Sanctifying Spirit</hi> is the sure Witness of Christ,

The Old Testament fulfilled in the New. II. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impress discernible on the Gospel. III. And the most excellent Effect of Sanctification on all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are Evidences of the truth of Christianity and the Scriptures, which all true Christians have still at hand. <note n="l" place="bottom">Ioh. 17. 17. 19.

               <p>Q. 30. But there are things in the Scripture of exceeding difficulty to believe: Especially that God should become Man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is folly to be stalled at the Believing of any thing, which we once are sure that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth, considering how unmeet our shallow Wit is to judge of the things of infinite Wisdom, to us unseen. <note n="m" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 9. &amp; 14. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>2. To Holy illuminated prepared Souls, Belief is not so hard: It's Blindness and Vice that make it difficult.</p>
               <p>3. God did not become <hi>Man,</hi> by any Change of his Godhead; nor by confining his <hi>Essence</hi> to the Manhood of Christ: But, 1. By taking the humane Nature into a special <hi>Aptitude</hi> for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Operations. 2. And so <hi>Relating it</hi> neerly to himself. 3. And <hi>Operating</hi> peculiarly in and on it, as he doth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60383:42"/>
not on any other Creature. And when all are agreed that God is essentially every where, and is as near us as we are our selves, and more the Cause of all good which we do than we our selves are; it will be harder to shew that <hi>he is not Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> united to every Man, than that <hi>he is so to Christ,</hi> (Though the foresaid <hi>Aptitude</hi> of Christ's humane Nature, and the <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, indeed make that vast difference.) If God can so peculiarly <hi>Operate</hi> in and by our humane Nature, where lyeth the Incredibility?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 31.</hi> But it is so transcendently above all the Works of Nature, that such condescension of God is hard to be believed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Great Works best beseem the Infinite God: Is not the make of the whole World as wonderful, and yet certain? Gods Love and Goodness must have wonderful products as well as his Power.</p>
               <p>But is it not very congruous to Nature and Reason, that God should have Mercy on lapsed man? And that he should restore depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature? And that he should do this great work like his Greatness and Goodness, and above Mans shallow reach? And that Polluted Souls should not have immediate access to the most Holy, but by a Holy Mediator? And that Mankind should have one Universal Head and Monarch in our own Nature? And that when even Heathens are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of the great need of some Divine revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, besides the light of Nature, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult their Oracles and Augurs, that God should give us a certain Menssenger from Heaven to teach us necessary Truth? Many such Congruities I have opened in the <hi>Reasons of the Christian Religion,</hi> Part 2. Ch. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60383:43"/>The Summ of all that is said, is This: I. If any History in the world be sure, the History of the Gospel is sure. II. And if the History be sure, the Doctrine must needs be sure. III. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Evidences: 1. In the Holiness of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And 2. In the Holiness of all true serious Believers, are a standing proof of both, as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were to all the beholders, who did not Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 32.</hi> But how comes it to be so hard then to the most to become serious Believers and Godly, when the Evidence is so clear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A Blind, Dead, Worldly, Fleshly Heart doth undispose them, and they will not <hi>Consider</hi> such things, nor use the means.</p>
               <p>Yea, they so wilfully sin against Knowledge and Conscience, and will not obey that which they know, that they forfeit further Grace. I will name you briefly many things which every Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason might know, and ask you whether you ever knew any Unbeliever that was not false to this Light of Nature.</p>
               <p>1. Doth not <hi>Sence and Reason</hi> tell men, how vile a thing that Flesh is which they preferr before their Souls? 2. Doth it not certifie them that they must die, and so that Fleshly Pleasure is short? 3. Doth it not tell them of the Vanity and Vexation of this World? 4. And that greatest Prosperity is usually parted with, with greatest sorrow? 5. Doth it not tell them, that Mans Nature can hardly choose but fear what will follow after Death? 6. Doth it not tell them that there is a God that made them, and Ruleth all? 7. And that he is infinitely Great, and Wise, and Good, and therefore should be Obeyed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60383:43"/>
Loved, and Trusted above all? 8. And that their Lives and Souls, and all are his, and at his will? 9. And that Man hath Faculties which can mind a God and a Life to come, which Bruits have not; and that God doth not make such Natures in vain. 10. Doth not experience tell them that humane Nature seeth a vast difference between Moral Good and Evil, and that all Government, Laws, and Converse shew it; And no Man would be counted false and bad? 11. And that Good Men are the Blessing of the World, and Bad Men the Plagues? 12. And that there is a Conscience in Man, that condemneth Sin, and approveth Goodness? 13. And that most Men when they dye, cry out against that which Worldly, Fleshly Men preferr; and wish that they had lived the Life of Saints, and might die their death? Are not these easily knowable to all? And yet all the ungodly live as if they believed none of this: And can you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if all such Men understand not, or believe not the Heavenly things, have no experience of the <note n="n" place="bottom">Io. 3. 7, 8. Rom 1. 19, 20. Act. 14. 17.</note> Sanctifying Work and Witness of the Holy Spirit, and have no delight in God and Goodness, no strength against Sin and Temptations, no Trust in God in their necessity, no suitableness to the Gospel, nor the heavenly Glory: But as they lived in sin, do die in a stupid or despairing state of Soul?</p>

               <p>I. Some of them deny some Essential Article of Faith or Practice: As the Immortality of the Soul, the Godhead, or Manhood, or Offices of Christ; or the Holy Ghost, or the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But the <hi>Laws</hi> being <hi>Sealed,</hi> the Second sort of Ministers are only to <hi>Teach</hi> and <hi>Apply</hi> these same Laws and Doctrines, and not to reveal New ones: And such were the Priests and Levites under <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and all the succeeding Ministers and Bishops of the Churches under Christ and the Apostles, who are the Foundation on which the Church is built. And though all Church Guides may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the undetermined Circumstances of Holy things, by the General Laws which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven therein: Yet to arrogate a power of making a new Word of God, or a Law that shall suspend our Obedience to his Laws, or any Law for the Universal Church, whether it be by Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is treasonable Usurpation of a Government which none but Christ is capable of: And as if one King or Council should claim the Civil Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the Earth (which is most unknown to them.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But I pray you tell me how the CREED comes to be of so great Authority, seeing I find it not in the Bible?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the very Summ and Kernel of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the New Testament, and there you may find it all, with much more: But it is Older than the <hi>writting</hi> of the New Testament, save that two or three words were added since.</p>
               <p>I told you before, 1. That Christ himself did make the Nature and Terms of Christianity, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioning his Apostles, to <hi>make all Nations his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, baptizing them into the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost:</hi> This is the Summ of the Creed first <hi>made</hi> by Christ himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60383:47"/>2. The Apostles were Inspired and Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to teach men all that Christ commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>3. To say these three Words [<hi>I believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi>] without understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, was easie, but would make no true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: Therefore if we had never read more of the Apostles Practice, we might justly conclude that those inspired Teachers, before they Baptized Men at Age, taught them the <hi>meaning</hi> of those <hi>three Articles,</hi> and brought them accordingly to <hi>Confess</hi> their Faith: And this is the Creed. And though a Man might speak his Profession in more or various <hi>Words,</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> was still the same; and the words made necessary, must not be too many, nor left too much at mens liberty to alter, lest corruption should Creep into the Common Faith. For the Baptismal Confession was the very Symbol, Badge or Test, by which all Christians were visibly to pass for Christians: And as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity must be a known certain thing, so must its Symbol be.</p>
               <p>4. And infallible historical Tradition assureth us, that accordingly ever since the Apostles dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any adult were Baptized, they were <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> and brought to understand and profess these same <hi>Articles</hi> of the Faith. And if the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines</hi> used not the <hi>same Words,</hi> they used Words of the <hi>same Signification</hi> (two or three words being added since.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> Do you not by this set the Creed above the Bible?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No otherwise than I set the Head, Heart, Liver and Stomach of a Man above the whole
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60383:47"/>
Body, which containeth them and all the rest: Or than I set the Ten Commandments above the whole Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which includeth them: Or than Christ did set, <hi>Loving God above all, and our Neighbour as our selves,</hi> above all that Law of which they were the Summ: We must not take those for no Christians, nor deny them Baptism, who understand and believe not particularly every word in the Bible; as we must those that understand not and believe not the CREED.</p>

Do you Trust him so as to <hi>Consent</hi> and <hi>Take</hi> him for your Physician? 3. Do you Trust him so as to come to him and take his Medicine, forsaking all others? I need not apply it: You can easily do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trust</hi> then, or <hi>Assiance</hi> is the vital or formal act of Faith: And <hi>Assenting, Consenting and Practice,</hi> are the inseparable effects, in which as it is a saving Grace it is alwayes found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But is all this meant in the Creed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: 1. The Creed containeth the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Matter revealed by God, which we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 2. And it mentioneth Him to whom we must Trust, in our Assent, Consent and Practice,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60383:49"/>
even God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But is this the Faith by which we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed? Are we justified by believing in God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles? Some say, It is only by believing in Christs Righteousness as imputed to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Justification is to be spoken of hereafter: But this one entire Christian Faith, is it which God hath made the necessary qualification, or Condition of such as he will justifie by and for the Merits of Christ's Righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Doth not <hi>[I believe]</hi> signifie that <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> that this God is my God, my Saviour, and my Sanctifier in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is an applying Faith: It signifieth, 1. That you Believe his Right to be your God. 2. And his offer to be your God. 3. And that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to this Right and Offer, that he may be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Relation be yours. 4. But it doth not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that every Believer is sure of the sincerity of his own Act of believing, and so of his special In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God; though this is very desirable and attainable.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It may be you think that you know nothing but what you <hi>see</hi> or <hi>feel</hi> by Sense: For so Mens long use of Bodies and Sense is apt to abuse them:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60383:52"/>
Or you think you know nothing, which you know not fully, and so no Angel knoweth God by an adequate comprehensive Knowledge. How far are we from knowing fully what <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are, and what is in them, and how they are ordered and move? And yet nothing is more easily and surely known than that there is a <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and that they are substances that have the power of <hi>Motion, Light,</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi> Yea Philosophers cannot yet agree what <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> are: And yet we know enough of them for our necessary use. And can it be expected then, that Man give a proper Definition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God?

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But what is the best Conception I can have of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I partly told you in the Third Chapter, and the Second. I now tell you further, that we see God here but as in a Glass: His Image on Mans Soul is the nearest Glass: How do you conceive of your own Soul? You cannot doubt but you have a Soul, while you perceive its constant acts: Yet, you see it not: You find clearly that [<hi>It is a Spiritual substance, that hath essentially the power of Vital-Activity, Understanding and Will.</hi>] By this you perceive what a Spirit is: And by this you have some perception what GOD is. All the World is far less to God than a Body to its Soul. And GOD is Infinitely more than a Soul to all

the World: But by the Similitude of a Soul you may most easily conceive of him.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> I hear some say, That Christ is not One God with the Father, but a kind of under-God, his first Creature, above Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Scriptures fully prove Christ to be God, and one God with the Father: The form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism proveth it. There be some Learned Men that to reconcile this Controversie, say, That Christ hath <hi>Three</hi> Natures, 1. The Divine: 2. A Super-angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: 3. A Humane. And that <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> did first of all produce the most perfect of all his Creatures, above Angels, like an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Soul, and the <hi>God-Head</hi> uniting it self to <hi>this,</hi> did by <hi>this</hi> produce all other Creatures; and at least did in and by <hi>this</hi> Unite it <hi>self hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> to the humane Nature of Christ. They think divers Texts do favour this threefold Nature; and that the <hi>Arrians</hi> erred only by noting the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelical Nature, and not noting the Divine united to it. But I dare not own so great a point, which I find not that the Universal Church ever owned; nor do I see any cogent Proof of it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <note n="p" place="bottom">Io. 1. 1, 2.

                  </gap>scension in God to unite the Nature of Man to himself, in Personal Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When you understand what it is, it will not seem incredible to you, though wonderful. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. That it doth not turn the humane Nature into Divine. 2. Nor doth it give it any of that part or work which was proper to the Divine Nature, and Second Person in the Trinity from Eternity. 3. The Divine Nature is united to the Humane, only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this to the excellent Office of Mediation, and that Christ in it may be Head over all things to the Church. 4. And it will abate your wonder if you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60383:58"/>
consider, that God is as near to every Creature as the Soul is to the Body: In Him we live, move and have our being. And he is more to us, than our Souls are to our Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> You now make me think that God is <hi>one with every Man</hi> and Creature, as well as with Christ. I pray you wherein is the difference?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Gods Essence is every where alike: but he doth not <hi>appear</hi> or <hi>work</hi> every where alike: As he is more in Heaven than on Earth, because he there operateth and appeareth in Glory, and as he is more in Saints than in the Ungodly, because in them he Operateth his Grace; so he is in Jesus Christ, otherwise than he is in any other Creature: 1. In that he by the Divine Power qualified him as he never did any other Creature. 2. And designeth him to that work which he never did any other Creature. 3. And fixeeth him in the honourable Relation to that work. 4. And communicateth to him by an uniting act, the Glory which he doth not to any other Creature: And though it's like there is yet more unknown and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to us, yet these singular Operations express a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Operative Union. The Sun by shining on a Wall, becomes not one with it: But by its influence on <hi>Plants,</hi> it becometh one with them, and is their Generical Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But how is the Second Person in the Trinity more United to the humane Nature, than the Father and the Holy Ghost? are they divided?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You may as well ask, Why God is said to make<note n="c" place="bottom">Io. 1. 3. 10.</note> the World by his WORD, and by his SON: Tho the Persons are undivided in their works on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60383:58"/>
yet <hi>Creation</hi> is eminently ascribed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Incarnation and Redemption to the Son, and Sanctification to the Holy Ghost. The Suns power of Motion, Light and Heat are inseparable: And yet it is the <hi>Light</hi> as such that with our Eye doth cause the same act of sight, as united to it. But the perfect Answer to this doubt is reserved for Heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But how was he conceived by the Holy Ghost, the Second Person by the third, when it is only the Second that was incarnate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Holy Ghost is not said to operate on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person in the Trinity, or the Godhead, for Christs Conception; but on the Virgins Body, and by miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous causing a humane Soul and Body, and their union with the Eternal Word. Gods perfecting Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are usually ascribed to the Holy Ghost: But the Father and Son, are still supposed Operating by the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> Was Christ's Flesh made of the substance of his Mother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Else how had he been the Son of Man?<note n="d" place="bottom">Gal. 4. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Was Christ's Soul begotten by his Mother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is certain that Man begetteth Man: But how Souls are generated is not fully known by Man: Some say, They are not Generated, but Created: Some say, That they are not Created, but Generated: And I think that there is such a concurrence of God's act and Mans, as may be called a Conjunction of Creation and Generation; that is, that as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams by a Burning-Glass may light a Candle, and that Candle light another, and another; yet so that the Light and Heat that doth it, is only from the Suns
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60383:59"/>
continual communication: But will not Light another but as <hi>contracted</hi> and made forcible by the Burning-glass, or the Candle: So all the Substance of new Souls is from the Divine Efflux, or communication of it, which yet will not ordinarily beget a Soul, but as it is first received in the Generative natural faculty, and so operateth by it, as its appointed Natural means. Thus it seems all humane Souls are caused (Pardon the defects of the Similitude.) But the Soul of Christ miraculously, not without all Operation of the Mothers (for then he had not been the Son of Man) but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a humane Father; the Holy Ghost more than sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that defect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> If Christ was <hi>Mary's</hi> Son, how escaped he Original guilt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By being conceived by the Holy Ghost, and so in his humane Nature made the Son of God, and not generated as other Men are.</p>

                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> WHy is there nothing said in the Creed, 1. Of Christ's overcoming the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil and the World?<note n="g" place="bottom">Matt. 4.</note> 2. Or of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1.

And that the rest were added, for the Exposition of these three. 3. And that the Errors that rose up occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the additions: Some denyed Christ's real Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and some his Death, and said that it was another in his Shape that dyed: and this occasioned these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository Articles. 4. But the Apostles and other Preachers expounded more to those whom they Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>echized, than is put into the Creed; and more is implyed in that which is expressed: And had any Hereticks then denyed Christ's perfect Righteousness, and Victory in Temptation, it's like it would have occasioned an Article for these. 5. But Christ would not have his Apostles put more into the Creed, than was needful to be a part of the Test of Christianity: And he that understandingly, consentingly and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically, believeth in <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> shall be saved. 6.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Historically to keep the remembrance of the time when Christ suffered: and to leave a just shame on the Name of an unjust Judge.<note n="l" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 13. Col. 1. 20. &amp; 2. 14. Eph. 2. 16. Gal. 3. 13.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Why was <hi>Crucifying</hi> the manner of Christ's death?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It was the <hi>Romans</hi> manner of putting vile Malefactors to death. 2. And it was a death espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially cursed by God; and Christ foretold it of himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Was it only Christs Body that suffered, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his Soul and Godhead?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Godhead could not suffer; but he that was God suffered, in Body and in Soul.<note n="m" place="bottom">Matt. 26. 38. Ioh. 12. 27.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What did Christs Soul suffer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It suffered not by any sinful Passion, but by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60383:61"/>
Lawful fear of what he was to undergo, and feeling of pain, and specially of God's just displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with Mans sin, for which he suffered; which God did express by such with-holdings of Joy and by such inward deep sense of his punishing Justice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to one that consented to stand in the place of so many sinners, and to suffer so much in their stead. <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 22. 44.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Did Christ suffer the pains of Hell, which the Damned suffer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The pains of Hell are Gods just punishment of Man for sin; and so were Christs sufferings, upon his consent. But, 1. The Damned in Hell are <hi>hated</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and so was not Christ. 2. They are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of Gods holy Spirit, and Grace, and so was not Christ. 3. They are under the Power of Sin, and so was not Christ. 4. They hate God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; and so did not Christ. 5. They are tormented by the Conscience of their Personal guilt, and so was not Christ: Christs Sufferings and the Damned's vastly differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Why must Christ suffer what he did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To be an Explatory Sacrifice for sin: God thought it not meet as he was the just and holy Ruler of the World, to forgive sin without such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his Holiness and Justice, as might serve as well to the Ends of his Government, as if the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had suffered</hi> themselves. 2. And he suffered to teach Man, what sin deserveth, and what a God we serve, and that we owe him the most costly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, even to the death; and that this <hi>Body, Life,</hi> and <hi>World</hi> are to be denyed, contemned and forsaken, for the sake of Souls, and of Life Everlasting, and of

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Mens sins were instead of a <hi>meritorious cause</hi> of Christ's Sufferings; he suffered for Mankind as the <hi>Saviour of the World:</hi> And as to the <hi>Effect,</hi> his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering purchased a <hi>conditional Gift of free pardon and life to all that will believingly accept it, according to the nature of the things given:</hi> But it was the will of the Father, and the Son, not to leave his death to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain success, but <hi>infallibly to cause the Elect to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be saved.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> How far were our sins imputed to Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So far as that his consent made it just that he suffered for them. He is said to be <hi>made sin for us,</hi> who knew no sin, which is, to be made a Curse or Sacrifice for our sin. But God never took him to be really or in his esteem a sinner: He took not our <hi>fault</hi> to become <hi>his fault,</hi> but only the <hi>punishment</hi> for our faults to be due to him.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are not fit to give God a Law: His works are done in infinite Wisdom. But we may see, 1. That they who had hardned their Hearts against all his Doctrine, and the Miracles of his Life, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously put him to Death as a Blasphemer, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, and a Traitor to <hi>Caesar,</hi> were unworthy and unmeet to be the Witnesses of his Resurection: And its like it would but have excited their rage to have

tryed a new Persecution. His Resurrection being the first act of his triumphant Exaltation, none were so fit to see him as those that had followed him in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: Even as wicked Men are not meet (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>2. The Witnesses whom he chose were enow and fit Persons for that Office, being to be sent abroad to Proclaim it to the World.</p>
               <p>And God confirmed their Testimony by such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Miracles, of which you heard before. <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 4. 6. Heb. 2. 3, 4, 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>3. And yet he left not the Infidels without convincing means: As he before told them, that he would raise in three Dayes the Temple of his Body, when they destroyed it; so they saw the Earthquake, the Sun darkned, the Vail of the Temple rent at his Death; and their Souldiers saw the Angels that terrified them, and told the Rulers what they saw: And after all, it was to <hi>Paul</hi> a Persecutor (and partly to his company) that Christ appeared. <note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 26. &amp; 27.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You may as well ask, Why he must be our Savior?</p>
               <p>1. If he had not risen, Death had conquered him, and how could he have saved us that was overcome and lost himself. <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 13, 14. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. He could not have received his own promised Reward; even his Kingdom and Glory: It was for the Joy that was set before him, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endured the Cross and despised the shame: Therefore

                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But are the Souls of the Wicked in no other Hell than the Devils are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Scripture tells us of no other: But it tells us not of their tempting and possessing Men as Devils do, but of their suffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Are Devils and Wicked Souls in the same Hell that they shall be in after the Day of Iudgment, and have they the same punishment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whether there shall be any change of the Place, it is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60383:68"/>
not needful for us to know: But the punishment is of the same kind: But it will be greater after Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it but because the Body joyned to the Soul, and the multitude of the damned joyned in the Suffering, will make every one more receptive of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Is there no middle place between Heaven and Hell? or a middle state of Souls that are in hope of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from their pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Hell it self is not all one Place, <note n="c" place="bottom">Luke 16. 22, 9.</note> seeing Devils are both in the Air and in the Earth, and where else we know not: And in <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 11, 12. Satan was among the Sons of God. But as for any hope of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to them that die unpardoned, the Scripture tells us of none, buth saith that [<hi>the Night cometh when none can work</hi>] and that <hi>This is the accepted time: this is the Day of Salvation:</hi> And that [<hi>every Man shall be judged according to what he had done in the Body, whether it be good or evil.</hi>] It is therefore mad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption for any one to neglect this Day of Salvation upon a hope of his own making, that they that die the Slaves of the Devil may repent and be delivered in their Airy Life, and be made the Children of God; or that any Purgatory fire shall refine them, or any Prayers of the Saints in Heaven or Earth deliver them. <note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 25, 26.

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But it seems by their pleading described by Christ, <hi>Mat. 25.</hi> that they will not be past hope till the Sentence be passed on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But the same Text, tells you what Sentence certainly shall pass; and therefore that if they keep any hope it is not of Gods making, but their own, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60383:69"/>
will be all in vain: But indeed those words seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to express their fervent desire to escape Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than their hope. The wicked may cry for Mercy when it is too late, but shall not obtain it: <hi>Dives Luke</hi> 16. may beg for a drop of Water, but not get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But will it not be a long work to judge all that ever lived from the beginning of the World unto the End?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Gods Judgment is not like Mans, by long talk and wordy Tryal, though Christ open the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of it after the manner of Men; Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisteth of full <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And he can convince all Men in a moment by his <hi>Light,</hi> shining at once into every ones Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: As the Sun can enlighten at once the Millions of Eyes all over the Earth.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Men, or most Men do not know it: Nor will it be known by a slight and sudden Thought; nor by blinded or self-flattering Sinners; nor by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort of true Believers, that sin as much as will stand with sincerity; nor yet by such ignorant Christians who understand not well the terms of the Covenant of Grace, or have true Grace, and know it not to be true: nor yet by such timerous Christians, whose fear doth hinder Faith and Reason.

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60383:69"/>For, 1. The difference between Heaven and Hell is so great, that there must needs be a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that shall go to each: And therefore it may be known: Christ's Spirit is not an undiscernable Mark and Pledge to them that have it. 2. And we are commanded to search and try our selves; and many Marks of difference are told us, and the Persons plainly described that shall be Justified and Condemned: And they are already here Justified and Condemned by that Law by which they shall be judged. 3.

                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> But I find some Scriptures, saying, That <hi>we are not justified by works,</hi> but by Faith in Christ; and yet in <hi>Mat. 25.</hi> Christ passeth the Sentence upon Mens <hi>Works</hi> as the <hi>Cause;</hi> and it's said, <hi>We shall be judged according to our works.</hi>

Question between him and the <hi>Iews</hi> was, Whether the Divine excellency of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law was such, as that it was given to justifie the doers of it as such? Or whether it was but an Index to point them to Christ the end of the Law, by whom they must be justified? But it is not <hi>Believing in Christ,</hi> nor begging his Grace, nor thankfully accepting it, that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by <hi>Works</hi> in his exclusion: It is this that he sets against these works. And as we are here made Justified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by meer Grace, giving us Repentance and Faith in Christ (that is, making us Christians:) so this obligeth us to live and die as Christians, if we will be saved. And therefore the final justifying Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at Judgment doth pass on us according to such works only as are the performance of our Covenant with Christ, without which we shall not be saved, and therefore not then justified; our Justification then being the justifying of our Title to Salvation, and therefore hath the same conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> What may we further learn by this Article of Christ's coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We must learn to Fear, and Obey him that must judge us: And to live as we would then hear of it, and to make it all the work of Our lives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for that day and final doom. And diligently to try our Hearts and Lives, that we may be sure to be then justified.</p>
               <p>2. We must not be discouraged that we see not Christ, but remember that we shall shortly see him in his Glory: In the Sacrament and all his worship, let us do it, as expectants of his coming. <note place="bottom">(i) Rom. 14. 10.

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> WHat is meant by believing in the Holy Ghost?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It meaneth our Believing what he is, and what he Doth: and our Trusting to Himself, and to his Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What must we believe of Himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That he is God, the Third Person in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, One in Essence with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What must we believe of his Works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must believe, 1. That the Holy Ghost is the great Agent and Advocate of Jesus Christ on Earth, by his works to be his Witness, and to plead his Cause and communicate his Grace.</p>
               <p>2. That the Holy Ghost was the Author of those many uncontrolled Miracles by which the Gospel of Christ was Sealed to the World: And therefore that <note place="bottom">(a) Mat. 28. 19. 1 Io. 5. 7. Acts 5. 3. Mat. 12. 31, 32.</note>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60383:71"/>
those Miracles were the certain attestation of God: <note n="b" place="bottom">Ioh. 14. 15, 16, 17. 26. &amp; 15. 26. &amp; 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15. Mark 1. 8.

               </p>
               <p>3. That the Holy Ghost was given by Christ to his Apostles, and Evangelists, to enable them to perform the extraordinary Office to which they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned, to teach the Nations to observe all things that Christ had commanded, and to lead them into all Truth, and bring all things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>4. That therefore the Doctrine of the said Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Evangelists, first preached by them, and after Recorded in the Sacred Scriptures for the use of the Church to the end of the World, as the full Doctrine and Law of Christ, is to be received as the Word of God, indited by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>5. That it is the work of the Holy Ghost to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all Gods Elect; that is, to illuminate their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, to convert their Wills to God, and to strengthen and quicken them to do their duty, and conquer Sin, and save them from the Devil, the World and the Flesh: And to be in them a Spirit of Power and Love, and a sound mind: And so that the Holy Ghost is an <hi>Intercessor</hi> within us to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate LIFE, LIGHT and LOVE, from the Father, and the Son, and excite in us those Holy Desires,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60383:71"/>
Thanks and Praise, which are meet for Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. All this is contained in our <hi>Believing in the Holy Ghost.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> If all this be in it, it seemeth a most necessary part of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Perfective works of God are used to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost: This is so weighty and necessary a part of Faith, that all the rest are insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without it: Millions perish that God created, and that Christ in a general sort (as aforesaid) dyed for; but those that are Sanctifyed by the Holy Ghost are saved. It is the work of the Holy Ghost to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to us the Grace of Christ, that the work of Creation and Redemption may attain their Ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> How is it proved that the Holy Ghost is God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that we are Baptized into the Belief of him as of the Father and the Son: And in that he doth the works proper to God, and hath the Attributes of God in Scripture: Which also expresly saith [<hi>There are Three which bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> I have oft marvelled that the Creed left out, 1. The Authority of the Apostles: 2. And their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Christs. 3. And the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and now I perceive that all these are contained in our <hi>believing in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No doubt, but it is a Practical Article of Faith, <note n="c" place="bottom">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> in which we profess to believe in the Holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his <hi>Relation and Works</hi> on <hi>Man;</hi> and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: But they were not Legislators, but sent with particular Mandates, Reproofs, or Consolations; save only <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> who had directions from God himself (not to make a new Law of God, but) to order things about the Temple and its Worship.</p>
               <p>So if any Man now pretend to a Prophetical Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it must not be Legislative to the Catholick Church, nor against Scripture, but about particular Persons, Acts and Events; and it must be proved by Miracle or by Success before another is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This Article hath not been alwayes in the Creed, in the same order and words as now. But the belief of [a Holy <hi>Church</hi>] was long before it was called [<hi>Catholick.</hi>] And it is joyned as part of our <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and the Redemption wrought by Christ: Christ by his death purchaseth, and the Holy Ghost gathereth the <hi>Holy Catholick Church:</hi> It were defective to believe Christs <hi>Purchase,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost's Sanctification;</hi> and not know for whom and on whom it is done. To <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> is to <hi>Sanctifie some Persons:</hi> and so to make them the Holy Society, or Christian Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What is a Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Name is applied to many sorts of Assemblies which we need not name to you. But here it signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>The Christian Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Why is it called Catholick?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Catholick is a Greek word and signifieth <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal:</hi> It is called <hi>Catholick</hi> because, 1. It is not as the <hi>Iews</hi> Church confined to one Nation, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all true Christians in the World. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Because it consisteth of Persons that have every where in the World, the same Essentiating qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, summed up <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. One Body, one Spirit, one hope of our Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Churches of Christ through the World, were called <hi>The Catholick Church,</hi> as distinct from the Sects and Heresies that broke from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:60383:74"/>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> How comes the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to call only his Subjects <hi>Catholicks?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The greatest part of the Church on Earth by far, was long in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and when Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors turned Christians they gave the Churches Power for the Honour of Christianity, to form the Churches much like the Civil State: And so a <hi>General Council</hi> of all the Churches in that Empire was their Supream Church Power. And three Patriarchs first, and five after were in their several Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, over all the rest of the Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. And so the Orthodox Party at First were called, <hi>The Catholicks,</hi> because they were the greater Concordant part: But quickly the <hi>Arrians</hi> became far greater, and carryed it in Councils, and then they called themselves, <hi>The Catholicks:</hi> After that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox under wiser Emperors got up again, and then they were the greater part called <hi>Catholicks:</hi> Then the <hi>Nostorians</hi> a little while, and the <hi>Eutychians</hi> after, and the <hi>Monothelites</hi> after them, got the Major Vote in Councils, and called themselves the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And so since then, they that had the greatest countenance from Princes, and the greatest number of Bishops in Councils, claimed the Name of the Catholick Church: And the Pope that was the first Patriarch in the Empire first called himself the Head of the Catholick Church in that Empire; and when the Empire was broke, extended his claim to the whole Christian World, partly by the abuse of the word [<hi>Catholick Church</hi>] and partly by abuse of the Name [<hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;</hi>] falsly pretending to Men that what was called [<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> and <hi>General</hi>] as to the Empire, had been so call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to all the World: And thus His Church was called <hi>Catholick.</hi>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Why is the Catholick Church called <hi>Holy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To notifie the work of our Saviour, who came to save us from our sins, and gather a peculiar People, a holy Society, who are separated from the unbelieving, ungodly World.</p>
               <p>2. To notifie the Work of the Holy Ghost, who is given to make such an Holy People.</p>
               <p>3. Yea, to notifie the Holiness of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who will be Sanctified in all that draw near him, and hateth the impure and unholy, and will have all his Children Holy as he is Holy.</p>
               <p>4. And to tell us the fitness of all Gods Children for his favour and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Wherein consisteth the Holiness of the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Christ their Head is perfectly Holy: 2. The Gospel and Law of Christ which is our objective Faith and Rule are Holy. 3. The Founders of the Church were eminently Holy. 4. All sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are truly Holy, and marked out as such for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 5. The common Ministers have an Holy Office. 6. The Church Worship as Gods Ordinances are Holy works. 7. All that are Baptized and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christianity, are Holy as to Profession, and so far separated from the Infidel World, though not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is it now that you call, <hi>The Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. <hi>Materially,</hi> their concord in the same quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: which is called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>The Unity of the Spirit:</hi> They are all, that are sincere, Sanctified by the same Spirit, and have the same Essentials of Faith, Hope, Baptismal Covenant, and Love: <note n="b" place="bottom">Io. 17. 21, 23. 1 Cor. 8. 6. 1 Cor. 12. 5, 27, 28, 29.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Is there no one Ministerial Head of all the Church <hi>on Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: neither One Man, nor one Council or Collection of Men: For, 1.

                  </gap>ne converse with them. And a Council gathered equally out of all the World as One such Supream, is a more gross Fiction of impossibles than that of a Pope.</p>
               <p>2. And Christ that never so qualified any, never gave any such power. But all Pastors are like the Judges, Justices and Mayors that rule subordinately

under one King, in their several Precincts; and not like an Universal Viceroy, Lieutenant, or Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But is not Monarchy the best Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and should not the Church have the best?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Yes: and therefore Christ is its Monarch, who is capable of it.</p>
               <p>2. But a Humane Universal Monarchy of all the World is not best: nor was ever an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Caesar,</hi> or any Man so mad, as soberly to pretend to it, or plead for it. Who is the Man that you would have to be King at the Antipodes, and over all the Kings on Earth.</p>
               <p>3. Yea, the case of the Church is liker that of Schools and Colledges, that rule Volunteers in order to Teaching them. And did ever <hi>Papist</hi> think that all the Schools on Earth of Grammarians, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Physicians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should have one humane Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Schoolmaster, or a Council or Colledge of such to Rule them?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But Christ is not a Visible Head; and the Church is Visible.</p>
               <p>

To tell us that God forsaketh not the Earth, though he permit Ignorance, Infidelity and Wickedness to abound, and Malice to persecute the Truth: still God hath a Holy Church which he will preserve and save. And though this or that Church may apostatize and cease, there shall be still a Catholick Church on Earth.</p>

               <p>5. To teach us to love the Unity of Christians, and carefully maintain it, and not to tear the Church by the Engins of proud Mens needless Snares, nor to be rashly censorious of any, or excommunicate them unjustly, nor to separate from any, further than they separte from Christ; but to rejoice in our common Union in Christian Faith and Love, and not let wrongs, or infirmities of Christians or Carnal

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. In their common Love to God, Faith in Christ and Sanctification by the Spirit. 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, that in a special manner is appropriated to Saints: Other parts of Communion (as eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, relieving each other, duties of Relation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are so far to be used towards Unbelievers, that they are not so meet to be the distinguishing Symbols of Christians: But the two Sacraments, Baptism for Entrance, and the Lords Supper for continuance of Communion, Christ hath purposely appointed for such Badges or Signs of his People as separate from the World.<note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 26. 1 Cor. 11. 21, 22, 24, &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must not put down all Government for fear of Tyranny; else Kingdoms, Armies, Colledges, Schools, must be all dissolved as well as Churches:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60383:78"/>
some body must be trusted with this Power; and who is fitter than they who are called to it as their Office, and therefore supposed best qualified for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What if none were trusted with it, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments left free to all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then Sacraments would be no Sacraments, and the Church would be no Church: If any man or woman that would, might baptize whom and when they would, they might baptize <hi>Turks</hi> and Heathens, and that over and over, who come in Scorn; and they might baptize without a Profession of true Faith; or upon a false Profession. And if every man might give the Lords Supper to another, it might be brought into Alehouses and Taverns in merrymerit, or as a Charm, or every Infidel or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might in scorn profane it: Do you think that if Baptism and the Lords Supper were thus administred, that they would be any Symbols or Badges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or of a Church, or any means of mens Salvation? No Christians ever dreamt of such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But why may not the Pastors themselves give them to all that will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Either you would have them<note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5. 2 Thes. 3. Tit. 3. 10. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 6. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 1. 1, 2. &amp; 2 Cor. 1. 1. Eph. 1. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>forced</hi> to do so, or to do it <hi>freely.</hi> If forced, they are no Judges who is fit; And who then shall be Judge? If the Magistrate, you make him a Pastor; and oblige him to teach, examine, hear and try all the Peoples Knowledge, Faith and Lives, which will find them work enough: And this is not to depose the Ministers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60383:79"/>
power, but to put it on another that hath more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready than he can do: And a Pastor then that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth the Sacrament to every one that the Magistrate bids him, shall be a Slave and not a free performer of the acts of his own Office, unless that Magistrate try and judge, and the Minister be but a Deacon that must give account for no more, than the bare delivering it. But if it be the <hi>Receivers</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> or the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> that shall be Judges, and may force the Pastor to give it them, I have shewed you already the profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will make it no Sacrament, nor Church.</p>
               <p>And if Pastors that are Judges shall freely give them to all, they will be the Profaners, and such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration will confound the Church and the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> I do not mean that they should give them to Heathens, but to all that profess the Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Therefore they: must judge whether they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the Christian Faith or not: And whether they speak as Parrots, or understand what they say And withall, <hi>Christian Love,</hi> and a <hi>Christian Life</hi> must be professed as well as Christian Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> What are the Terms on which they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men to Communion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They must Baptize them and their Infants, who with competent understanding, and seeming serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, profess a Practical belief in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and consent to that Covenant, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Creed, Lords Prayer, and Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And they must admit all to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Lords Supper, who continue in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and nullifie it not by proved Apostasie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent Profession or Practice. <note n="g" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 19.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Pastors as such have Power, as all Physicians have in judging of their Patients, and all School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of their Scholars. But great difference there is, <hi>Who shall Correct Mens injurious Administrations:</hi> Whether the Magistrace do it himself; or whether a Bishop over many Pastors do it; or many Pastors in a Synod do it, is no such great matter as will warrant the sad Contentions that have been about it, so it be done: Or if none of these do it, a People intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly injured may right themselves by deserting such an injurious Pastor.

God doth not Repute or Judge us to be such as never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for that were to judge fasly: Nor doth he judge that our sin is not related to us as the Actors, for that's impossible: Nor doth he judge that our sin did not deserve punishment: But only that the deserved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is forgiven for the Merits of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Sacrifice.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> To be Justified: 1. Sometimes signifieth to be Made <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Iustifiable</hi> in <hi>Iudgment:</hi> And then it sometimes includeth both the <hi>Gift</hi> of Saving Faith and Repentance, and the Gift of Pardon, and of Right to Life Everlasting: And sometime it presupposeth Faith and Repentance given, and signifieth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed Gift of Pardon and Life.</p>
               <p>2. Sometime it signifieth Gods Justifying us by his Sentence in Judgment which containeth both the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our Right to Impunity and Salvation, and the Justifying our Faith and Holiness as sincere, which are the Conditions of our Right. <note n="e" place="bottom">Isa. 53. 11. &amp; 45. 25. 1 Cor. 6. 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We could not possibly be pardoned as Sinners, if God reputed us to have fulfilled all Righteousness in Christ, and so to be no Sinners: Therefore it is no such Imputation that must be affirmed. But God just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputeth Christ's Holiness, and Righteousness, active and passive, dignified by his Divinity to be fully Meritorious of our Pardon, Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: 1. The punishment denounced in God's Sentence of <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> is not wholly forgiven: The Curse on the Ground, the Womans Sorrows, the pain and stroke of Death. 2. Temporal correcting punishments are not all forgiven. 3. Some measure of Sin is penally permitted in us. 4. The want of more Holiness and help of Gods Spirit and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, is to all of us a fore punishment. 5. The Permission of many Temptations from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Men, are punishments, specially when they prevail to hainous sinning. 6. To be so long kept out of Heaven, and to lie after in the Grave, are punishments. Sure few Men believe that Pardon is here perfect, that feel any of these. 7. And it is not perfect till we are Justified before the World, and put in possession of Salvation: That's the perfect Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <note n="h" place="bottom">I think no Man that felt what I feel at the writing of this in my Flesh, and for my Friends, can possibly think that Pardon is perfect in this Life.

I told you sin is not pardoned when it is no sin; we sin daily and therefore must have daily pardon: And this also proveth that Pardon and Justification are not perfect before Death, because there are more sins still to be pardoned. 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The meaning is, 1. That by Christ a certain Degree of punishment is taken off from all Mankind, and they are not dealt with according to the rigor of the Law of Innocent Nature. 2. And that a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Pardon is given to all in the new Covenant so far as it is revealed. 3. And that this Pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh actual to every one when he penitently and believingly consenteth to the (Baptismal) Covenant with Christ. <note n="o" place="bottom">2 Sam. 12. 12, 13.

But while I profess to <hi>Believe,</hi> it is supposed that I hope I do it sincerely, and therefore have some hope that I am pardoned. 6.

this is no <hi>Divine Faith</hi> save by participation, nor is it profest by all that profess the Creed. But it is an Effect of two Acts, 1. Of our Faith, 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I told you that sin is not forgiven even to stated Believers, before it is committed; and when it is committed the qualifying Condition must be found in us: And though our first true Faith and Repentance qualifie us for the Pardon of all Sin past, yet when more is committed more is required in us to our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that is, that we renew Repentance and Faith as far as Sin is known, and that we beg Pardon and forgive others. 2. Yet the future punishment is not so much unforgiven to the Faithful as to others, before renewed Repentance: For they have the main quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and want but an act for which they are habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, and have God's Spirit to assist them. 3. And though Sins unknown which are ordinary infirmities, are forgiven without express particular Repentance, yet in order of nature, the Desert of punishment go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the forgiveness: The very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh durable punishment due to durable Souls, till the dueness be remitted by forgiveness. <note n="p" place="bottom">Psal. 32. &amp; 25. &amp; 51.

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 1. I</hi> Have oft wondered why there is nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Creed of the Immortality of the Soul, and its state before the Resurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Article of <hi>Christ's Descent,</hi> tells us that his Soul was among the <hi>separated Souls,</hi> while his Body was in the Grave: as he told the Thief, that he <hi>should be that day with him in Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:60383:86"/>2. The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> is a thing not known at all by Nature, but only by <hi>supernatural Revelation,</hi> and therefore is an Article of meer belief: But the <hi>Immortality</hi> or <hi>future Life of Souls,</hi> is a point which the <hi>Light of Nature revealeth,</hi> and therefore <hi>was</hi> taken both by <hi>Iews</hi> and sober Heathens as a Truth of common Notice: Even as the <hi>Love of our</hi> selves is not expressed in the Ten <hi>Commandments,</hi> but only the Love of God and others, because it was a thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> is included in the Article of the Resurrection of the Body: For if the Soul continue not, the next at the Resurrection would be <hi>another Soul,</hi> and a new created one, and not the same: And then the Body would not be the <hi>same Souls Body,</hi> nor the <hi>Man</hi> the same <hi>Man,</hi> but another. Who was ever so unwise to think that God had so much more Care of the <hi>Body</hi> than of the <hi>Soul,</hi> as that he would let the <hi>Soul perish,</hi> and raise the <hi>Body from</hi> the dust alone, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d join it with another Soul.</p>
               <p>4. Very Learned and wise Expositors think that the <hi>Greek</hi> word (<hi>Anastasis</hi>) used for <hi>Resurrection,</hi> indeed signifieth the <hi>whole Life after this, both of Soul first, and Body also after,</hi> oft in the New Testament: It is a <hi>Living again,</hi> or <hi>after this Life,</hi> called, <hi>A standing up again:</hi> And there is great probability of of it in Christs Argument with the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and some passages of <hi>Pauls,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What Texts of Scripture do fully prove that the Soul <hi>liveth</hi> when it is separated from the Body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very many: 1. God <hi>breathing</hi> into <hi>Man the breath of Life, and making him a living Soul,</hi> is said thereby to <hi>make him in the Image of God,</hi> who is the Living God: And so the Soul is essentially <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60383:87"/>2. God's calling himself the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> is by Christ Expounded, as proving that he is the God of <hi>Living Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. None ever dreamt that <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had no company of humane Souls in Heaven: For <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Moses</hi> also appeared with them on the Mount, and shewed that his Soul did live.</p>
               <p>4. When <hi>Saul</hi> himself would have <hi>Samuel</hi> raised to speak with him, it plainly implieth that it was then the common belief of the <hi>Iews</hi> that separated Souls survive.</p>
               <p>5. When, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 22. <hi>Elias</hi> raised the dead Child of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. <hi>Elisha</hi> raised the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Child, and 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> dead Man was raised; all these proved that the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> was the same that came again: Else the Persons had not been the same.</p>
               <p>6. When Christ raised <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Iairus</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 41. 42. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 55. and another, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 12, 14, 15. The same Souls came into them.</p>
               <p>7. Many of the Dead rose and appeared at Christs Death: And <hi>Peter</hi> raised one from Death: which was by a reunion of the same living <hi>Soul</hi> to the same Body.</p>
               <p>8. Christ tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. that Men cannot kill the <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. He tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. that as the wise Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard when he was put out, was received by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom he had Obliged, so if we make us Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness, when these things fail us (which is at Death) we shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Everlasting Habitations.</p>
               <p>10. The Parable of the <hi>sensual Rich Man,</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> one going presently to Hell, and the other to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60383:87"/>
the Bosom of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Paradise, fully prove that Christ would have this believed, and would have all Men warned accordingly to prepare; and that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets were so sufficient for such notice, as that one from the Dead would have been less credible herein: Though it be a Parable, it is an instructing and not a deceiving Parable, and very plain in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The Name of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Bosom</hi> was according to the Common sence of the <hi>Iews</hi> who so called that State of the blessed, not doubting but that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was then in Happiness, and the blessed with him.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>Herod</hi>'s thought that <hi>Iohn</hi> had been risen from the Dead, and the <hi>Iews</hi> conceit that Christ had been one of the Old Prophets risen, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Christ's argument with the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> do put it past doubt that it was then taken for certain Truth, that the Souls of the Faithful do survive, by all except such as the Heretical <hi>Sadduces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know Thee the only true God, and</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>whom thou hast sent.</hi> How is it Eternal if it have as long an interruption as from Death till the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>13. It is the Summ of God's Gospel that <hi>whosoever believeth in Christ, shall not perish, but have Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. Therefore they perish not till the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>14. Christ hath promised that whoever drinketh of the Water which he will give him (the Spirit) <hi>it shall be in him a Well of Water springing up to Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. But if the Soul perish, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perisheth to that Soul.</p>
               <p>15. To be born again of the Spirit, fitteth a man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60383:88"/>
to enter into the Kingdom of God: But if the Soul perish, all that New Birth is lost to that Soul, and profiteth the Dust only.</p>
               <p>16. Joh. 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life.</hi> Joh. 5. 24. He <hi>is passed from death to life. Ioh.</hi> 6. 27. He giveth <hi>meat</hi> which endureth to everlasting life. <hi>V.</hi> 35. He shall never <hi>hunger or thirst</hi> (that is, be <hi>empty</hi>) that cometh to Christ <hi>V.</hi> 39. Of all that cometh to him he will lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Therefore will not lose all their Souls. <hi>V.</hi> 40, 47. They <hi>have everlasting life.</hi> 54, 56. He <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> in Christ, and Christ in him, and therefore is not extinct, 58. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 51. <hi>Verily, verily, I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, If a man keep my sayings, he shall never see death.</hi> Joh. 10. 28. <hi>I give unto them eternal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. Joh. 11. 26. <hi>Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</hi>

               <p>20. Luk. 23. 43. <hi>To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi>

To believe the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, and the Life hereafter. And, 3. To believe in Christ: And though it be this third that is known only by supernatural Revelation, yet to him that believeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Immortality of the Soul, and the Life hereafter, Christianity will appear so exceeding Congruous, that it will much the more easily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. And experience tells us that the Devils main Game, for the Debauching and Damning of fleshly, worldly, ungodly Men, and for troubling and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforting Believers, lieth in raising Doubts of the Souls Immortality, and the future Life of Reward and Punishment.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But what good will a Resurrection of the Body do us, if the Soul be in happiness before?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It will be for Gods Glory to make and bless a perfect Man: 2. It will be our Perfection: A whole Man is more Perfect than a Soul alone. 3. It will be the Souls delight:<note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. 21. &amp; 22.</note> As God that is perfectly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in himself, yet made and maintaineth a World, of which he is more than the Soul, because he is a Communicative good and pregnant, and delighteth to do good; so the Soul is made like God in his Image, and is communicative and would have a Body to act on. As the Sun, if there were nothing in the World

but it self, would be the same that it now is, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would receive its Motion, Light or Heat, or be the better for it: And if you did imagine it to have understanding, you must think that it would be much more pleased to enlighten and enliven so many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Creatures, and cause the flourishing of all the Earth, than to shine to nothing. So may you think of the Soul of Man: It is by God inclined to actuate a Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> If that be so, it is till then imperfect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its desire, and so in pain and punishment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not in its full Perfection; and it is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of punishment to be in a state of Separation: But you cannot call it a <hi>pain</hi> as to sense, because it hath an unspeakable Glory, though not the most perfect. Nor hath the will of the Blessed any trouble and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving against the will of God, but takes that for best which God willeth: And so the separated state is best while God willeth it, though the united State will be best (as more perfect) in its time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It shall not be raised in the shape of ugly Dust, or filth, nor of corruptible Flesh and Blood: But a Glorious and Spiritual Body; and a meet Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for a Glorified Soul.

                  <hi>A.</hi> What is hard to God that made Heaven and Earth of nothing, and maintains all things in their state and course? What was that Body a while ago? Was it not as unlikely as dust to be what it now is?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But the Body is in continual Flux or Change: we have not the same Flesh this Year, that we had the last: And a Man in a Consumption loseth before Death the Mass of Flesh in which he did good or evil: shall all that rise again, which every day vanisheth? And shall the new Flesh be punished for that which it never did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It's a foolish thing, from our Ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, to dispute against God and certain Truth: Will you know nothing, unless you know all things? Will you doubt of the plain Matter, because in your darkness you understand not the manner or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it? The Soul hath a Body consisting of various parts: The fiery part in the Spirits is it's most immediate Vehicle or Body: The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eminal tenacious Humour and Air, is the immediate Vehicle of the fiery part: Whether these Spirits do any of them depart as it's Vehicle or Body with the Soul; or if not, whether they be the identifying part that the Soul shall be reunited to first; or what or how much of the rest even the aqueous and Earthy matter which we had from our Birth shall be re-assumed, are things past our understanding: You know not how you were generated in the Womb, and yet you know that you were there made: And must God teach you how you shall be raised before you will believe it? Must he answer all your doubts of the Flesh that is vanished, or the Bodies eaten by other Bodies, and teach you all his unsearchable skill, before you will take his Word for true?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What should a Man do that he may live in a comfortable hope of the Resurrection, and the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and the Life to come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We have three great things to do for this end: 1. To get as full a <hi>certainty</hi> as is possible that there is such a Life to come. And this is done by strengthning a sound belief. 2. To get a <hi>suitableness of Soul</hi> to that blessed Life; and this is by the increase of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> and by a Spiritual heavenly conversation. And, 3. To get and exercise a joyful Hope and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that it shall be ours: And this is done by a Life of <hi>careful Obedience</hi> to God, and the Conscious notice of our sincerity and title, and by the increase and exercise of the foresaid Faith and Love: Daily dwelling on the Thoughts of God's infinite Goodness and Fatherly love, of Christ's Office and Grace, and the Seals of the Spirit, and the blessed state of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Souls, in the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and living as in familiarity with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> But when doubting Thoughts return, would it not be a great help to Faith, if you could prove the Souls Immortality by reason?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have done that largely in other Books: I will now say but this: If there be no life of retribution af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, it would follow that not only Scripture, but Religion, Piety, and Conscience were all the most odious abuses of Mankind: To set Mans Heart and Care
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60383:91"/>
upon seeking all his dayes a Life which he can never obtain, and to live honestly and avoid sin, for fear of an impossible punishment, and to deny Fleshly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and lust, upon meer deceit, what an injury would Religion, Conscience and honesty be? Men that are not restrained by any Fear or Hopes of another Life, from Tyranny, Treason, Murder, Perjury, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Deceit or any wickedness, but only by present Interest, would be the wisest Men. When yet God hath taught Nature to abhor these Evils, and bound Man to be Religious and Conscionable by common Reason, were it but for the probability of another Life. And can you believe that Wickedness is Wisdom, and all Conscionable Goodness is Folly and De ceit?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> WHere is it that we shall live when we go hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> With Christ in Heaven, called Paradise, and the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> How is it then that the Souls of Men are said sometimes to appear on Earth? Is it such Souls, or is it Devils?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Either is possible: For Souls are in no other Hell than Devils are, who are said to be in the Air, and to go to and fro, and tempt Men, and afflict them here on Earth: But when it is a Soul that appeareth, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60383:92"/>
when a Devil, we have not acquaintance enough to know: But though God can for just Causes let a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Soul appear, as <hi>Moses</hi> with <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did on the Mount, and perhaps <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> yet we have reason to suspect that it is the miserable Souls of the Wicked that oftenest appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But how come Devils or Souls to be visible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Spirits are powerful, and dwell in Airy and other Elementary matter, in which they can appear to us, as easily as we can put on our Cloaths. Fire is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible in its simple uncloathed substance; and yet when it hath kindled the Air it is visible Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why then do they appear so seldom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God restraineth evil Spirits, and keepeth them within their bounds that they may not either deceive or trouble Mankind: And the Spirits of the just are more inclined to their higher Nobler Region and Work: and God will have us here live by Faith, and not by seeing either the heavenly Glory or its Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But it seems that we shall live again on Earth, for it is said, that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> cometh down from above, and we look for a new Heaven, and a new Earth wherein dwelleth Righteousness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It greatly concerneth us to difference certainties from uncertainties. It is certain that the Faithful have a promise of a great reward in Heaven, and of being with Christ, and being conveyed into Paradise by Angels, and are commanded to lay up a Treasure in Heaven, and there to set their Hearts and Affections, and to seek the things that are above where Christ is at Gods right Hand; and they desire to depart and be with Christ as far better than to be here, and to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60383:92"/>
from the Body, and be present with the Lord: so that the Inheritance of the Saints in heavenly Light and Glory, is certain. But as to the rest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the New Earth shall be for new Inhabitants, or for us; and whether the descending <hi>Hierusalem</hi> shall be only for a Thousand Years before the final Judgment, or after for perpetuity, or whether it shall come no lower than the Air, where it is said, That we shall be taken up to meet the Lord, and so shall ever be with him, or whether Earth shall be made as Glorious to us as Heaven, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth be laid together in Common, when separating sin is gone; These matters being to us less certain, must not be set against that which is certain. And the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> coming down from Heaven, doth imply that it was first in Heaven, and it's said, that it's now above, and we are come to it in relation and foretast, where are the perfected Spirits of the Just, as it is described, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> But some think that Souls sleep till the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or are in an unactive potentiality for want of Bodyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Reason and Scripture confute this Dream. The Soul is <hi>Essential</hi> Life, naturally inclined to <hi>Action, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> or Volition, and it will be in the midst of Objects enow on which to operate: And is it not absurd to think that God will continue so noble a Nature in a state of idleness, and continue all its es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Faculties in vain, and never to be exercised? As if he would continue the Sun without Light, Heat, or Motion. What then is it a Sun for? And why is it not annihilated? The Soul cannot lose its Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Vitality, Intellection and Volition, without losing its Essence, and being turned into some other
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60383:93"/>
thing. And why it cannot act out of a Body, what Reason can be given? If it could not, yet that it taketh not hence with it a Body of those corporeal Spirits which it acted in, or that it cannot as well have a Body of Light for its own Action, as it can take a Body (as <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount) to appear to Man, is that which we have no reason to suspect.</p>
               <p>2. But Scripture puts all out of doubt, by telling us, that <hi>To die is gain,</hi> and that it's <hi>better to be with Christ,</hi> and that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <hi>comforted</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, and the converted Thief was with <hi>Christ in Paradise,</hi> and that the Souls under the Altar and in Heaven pray and praise God, and that the <hi>Spirits of the Iust are there made perfect:</hi> And this is not a state of sleep. It is a World of Life, and Light, and Love, that we are going to, more active than this Earthy, heavy World, than Fire is more active than a Clod. And shall we suspect any sleepy unactivity there? This is the dead and sleepy World: And Heaven is the place of Life it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is the Nature of that heavenly Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> It is the perfect activity and perfect fruition of Divine communicated Glory, by perfected Spirits and Spiritual Men, in a perfect Glorious Society, in a perfect Place or Region, and this Everlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Here are many things set together, I pray you tell them me distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Heaven is a perfect Glorious Place, and Earth to it is a Dungeon. The Sun which we see is a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place in comparison of this.</p>
               <p>2. The whole Society of Angels and Saints will be Perfect and Glorious. And our Joy and Glory will be as much in participation by Union and Communion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60383:93"/>
with theirs, as the Life and Health of the Eye, or Hand is in and by union and communion with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: we must not dream of any Glory to our selves but in a state of that union and communion with the Glorious Body of Christ. And Christ himself the Glorified Head is the chief part of this Society whose Glory we shall behold.</p>
               <p>3. Angels and Men are themselves there Perfect. If our <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> were not Perfect, our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fruition could not be Perfect.</p>
               <p>4. The Objects of all our Action are most Perfect: It is the Blessed God, and a Glorious Saviour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that we shall see and love and praise.</p>
               <p>5. All our Action will be pefect: Our Sight and Knowledge, our Love, our Joy, our Praise will be all perfect there.</p>
               <p>6. Our reception and fruition will all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. We shall be perfectly loved by God, and one another, and perfectly pleasing to him, and each other; and he will communicate to us and all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as much Glorious Life, Light and Joyful Love, as we are capable of receiving.</p>
               <p>7. And all this will be perfect in duration, being Everlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> O what manner of Persons should we be if all this were well believed? Is it possible that they should tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe all this, who do not earnestly desire and seek it, and live in joyful longing hope to be put into possession of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whoever truly believeth it, will prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Earthly treasure and pleasure, and make it the chief <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of his Soul and Life, and forsake all that stands against it rather than forsake his hopes of this. But while our <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are all imperfect, and we dwell in Flesh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60383:94"/>
where present and sensible things are still diverting and affecting us, and we are so used to Sight and Sense, that we look strangely towards that which is above them, and out of their reach: it is no wonder if we have imperfect desires and joy, abated by diversions, and by griefs and fears, and if in this darkness unseen things seem strange to us; and if a Soul united to a Body be loth to leave it, and be uncloathed, and have somewhat dark Thoughts of that state without it, which it never tryed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But when we cannot conceive how Souls act out of the Body, how can the Thought of it be pleasant and satisfying to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We that can conceive what it is to <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>Understand,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Rejoice</hi> in the Body, may understand what these acts are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whether out of a Body or in a more glorious Body: And we can know that nothing doth nothing; and therefore that the Soul that doth these acts is a Noble substance, and we find that it is invisible. But of this I spake in the beginning.</p>
               <p>2. When we know in general all before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we shall be in that described Blessedness with Christ and the Heavenly Society, we must implicitly trust Christ with all the rest, who knoweth for us what we know not: and stay till possession give us that clear distinct conception of the manner, and all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which they that possess it not, can no more have, than we can conceive of the sweetness of a Meat or Drink which we never tasted of: And we should long the more for that Possession which will give us that sweet Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Is not God the only Glory and Ioy of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Why then do you tell us so much of Angels and Saints, and the City of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60383:94"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God is all in all things; of him, and through him and to him are all things, and the Glory of all is to him for ever. But God made not any single Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be happy in him alone as separate from the rest; but an Universe which hath its Union and comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I told you as the Eye and Hand have no sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Life or Pleasure, but only in Communion with the whole Body, so neither shall we in Heaven. God is infinitely above us, and if you think of him alone, without mediate Objects for the ascent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of your Thoughts, you may as well think to climb up without a Ladder: We are not the Noblest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures next to God, nor yet the most Innocent: We have no access to him, but by a Mediator: And that Mediator worketh and conveyeth his Grace to us by other subordinate means: He is the Saviour of his Body, which is the fulness of him that filleth all: If we think not of the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the glorious City of God; the Heavenly Society and Joyful Chore that praise <hi>Iehovah</hi> and the Lamb, and live together in perfect Knowledge, Love and Concord, in whose Communion only we have all our Joy; to whom in this Unity God commnicateth his Glory; and if we think not of the Glorious Head of the Church, who will then be our Mediator of Fruition, as he was of Acquisition: nay, if we think not of those loving blessed Angels that rejoiced at our Conversion, and were here the Servants, and will be for ever the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of our Joy: And if we think not of all our old dear Friends and Companions in the Flesh, and of all the Faithful, who since <hi>Adam</hi>'s Dayes are gone before us, and if we think not of the attractive Love, Union and Joy of that Society and State, we shall not have sufficient Familiarity above, but make God as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60383:95"/>
inaccessible to us: Delight and desire suppose attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive suitableness: Inaccessible excellency draws not up the Heart. I thank God for the Pleasure that I have in thinking of the Blessed Society, which will shortly entertain me with joyful Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But may not <hi>[Everlasting]</hi> signifie only a <hi>long time,</hi> as it oft doth in Scripture, and so all may be in mutable Revolutions, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and some others thought?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. What reason have we to extort a forced sence against our own Interest and Comfort, without any warrant from God? 2. The nature of the Soul being so far Immortal as to have no Inclination to its own death, Why should we think it strange that its felicity should be also everlasting. 3. It can hardly be conceived how that Soul can possibly revolt from God and perish, who is once confirmed with that sight of his Glory, and the full fruition of his Love. Whether Nature be so bad as to allow such a revolt? If the Devils had bin as near God, and as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Sight and Sense of his Love and Glory, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I told you before, 1. If you so far believe the Promise of it as made by God, and purchased by Christ's Righteousness and Intercession, as to take this Glory for your chief felicity and hope, and to prefer it before all Worldly Vanity, Pleasure, Profit, Honour, or Life to the Flesh, and to make it your chief care and business to seek it, and rather let go all than lose it, and thus patiently wait and trust God's Grace in Christ and his Spirit, in the use of his appointed

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You may as wisely ask, what good any thing will do towards our Benefit or Salvation which we can do, seeing nothing changeth God. As God who is one, maketh Multitudes of Creatures; so God who is unchangeable maketh changeable Creatures; and the Effect is wrought by changing us, and not by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. You must understand these great Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Truths, that, 1. All things effect according to the Capacity of the Receiver. 2. Therefore the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects in the World proceed from the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Receptive Capacities. The same Sun-beams do cause a Nettle, a Thorn, a Rose, a Cedar, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the seminal Capacity of the various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers. The same Sun enlightneth the Eye, that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60383:96"/>
doth not so by the Hand or Foot, or by a Tree, or Stone: And it shineth into the House whose Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are open, which doth not so when the Windows are shut; and this without any change in it self. The Boatman layeth hold on the Banck, and pulls as if he would draw it to the Boat, when he doth but draw the Boat to it. Two wayes Prayer procureth the Blessing without making any Change in God. First by our performing the condition on which God promiseth his Mercy. Secondly, By disposing our Souls to receive it. He that doth not penitently confess his sin, is unmeet for Pardon. And he that desireth not Christ and Mercy, is unmeet to be partaker of them. And he that is utterly unthankful for what he hath received, is unmeet for more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Who made the Lords Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself, as he made the Gospel; some of the Matter being necessary yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> To whom and on what occasion did he make it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To his Disciples, (to whom also he first deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Commands) upon their request that he would teach them to pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> To what Use did Christ make it them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, To be a Directory for the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of their Love, Desires, Hope and Voluntary choice and endeavours; And, 2. To be used in the same Words when their case required it.</p>
               <p>As Man hath three Essential Faculties, the Intellect, Will and Vital executive Power; so Religion hath three Essential parts, <hi>viz.</hi> To direct our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to believe, our Will to desire, and our Lives in practice.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Lord's Prayer in General?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It containeth, First, What we must desire as our End: And Secondly, What we must desire as the Means; premising the necessary Preface, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a suitable Conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What is the <hi>Method</hi> of the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I. The Preface speaks, 1. To God as God: 2. As our reconciled Father in Christ, described in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, by the words [<hi>which art in Heaven</hi>] which signifie the Perfection of his Power, Knowledge, and Goodness, and the Word Father, signifieth that he is Supream <hi>Owner, Ruler and Benefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The word [<hi>Our</hi>] implieth our Common Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him as his Creatures, his Redeemed and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Ones, his Own, his Subjects and his Beneficia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Children.</p>
               <p>II. The Petitions are of two sorts (as the Commandments have two Tables:) The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the order of Intention, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the highest Notion of the ultimate End, and descending to the lowest. The Second part is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of Execution and Assecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the lowest means, and ascending to the highest.</p>
               <p>III. The Conclusion enumerateth the parts of the ultimate End by way of Praise, beginning at the lowest and ascending to the highest. The Method through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out is more perfect than any of the Philosophers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Why do we not read that the Apostles after used this Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is enough to read that Christ prescribed it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60383:97"/>
them, and that they were Obedient to him. We read not of all that the Apostles did.</p>
               <p>2. This is a Comprehensive Summary of all Prayer, and therefore must needs be brief in the several parts: But the Apostles had occasion sometime for one branch and sometime for another, on which they particularly enlarged, and Seldom put up the whole matter of Prayer all at once.</p>
               <p>3. They formed their Desires according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of this Prayer, though they expressed those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as various occasions did require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Is every Christian bound to say the Words of the Lords Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The same answer may serve as to the last. Every Christian is bound to make it the Rule of his <hi>Desires,</hi> and <hi>Hopes,</hi> both for <hi>Matter and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>der:</hi> But not to express them all in every Prayer. But the Words themselves are apt, and must have their due reverence, and are very fit to summ up our scattered less ordered Requests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But few Persons can understand what such generals comprehend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Generals are useful to those that cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly comprehend all the particulars in them. As the General knowledg that we shall be happy in Holy and Heavenly Joy with Christ, may comfort them that know not all in Heaven that makes up that happiness, so a General desire may be effectual to our receiving many particulars. 2. And it is not so General as [<hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi>] an accepted Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Publican, by Christs own Testimony. There are six particular Heads there plainly expressed.</p>

It is in Heaven that God is to be seen and enjoyed in Glory, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love and Joy: Though God be on Earth, he will not be our Felicity here on Earth: every Prayer therefore should be the Souls aspiring and ascending towards Heaven, and the believing exercise of a heavenly Mind, and Desire: For a Man of true Prayer to be unwilling to come to Heaven, and to love Earth better, is a contradiction.</p>

It is by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> that we are the Children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Why say we <hi>Our Father,</hi> and not <hi>My Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. To signifie that all Christians must pray as Members of One Body, and look for all their good, comfort and blessedness in Union with the whole, and not as in a separate State: Nor must we come to God with selfish narrow Minds, as thinking only of our own case and good, nor put up any Prayer or Praise to God, but as Members of the Universal Church, in one Chore, all seen and heard at once by God, though they see not, and hear not one another: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we must abhor the pregnant comprehensive Sin of <hi>selfishness;</hi> by which wicked Men care only for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60383:99"/>
themselves, and are affected with little but their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal concerns, as if they were all the World to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, insensible of the Worlds or the Churches State, and how it goeth with all others. 2. And therefore that all Christians must love their Brethren and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as themselves, and must abhor the Sin of Schism, much more of Malignant Enmity, Envy, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and must be so far from disowning the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other Christians on pretense of their various Circumstances and Imperfections, and from separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Heart from them on any account for which God will not reject them; as that they must never put up a Prayer or Praise, but as in concord with all the Christians on Earth, desiring a part in the Prayers of all, and offering up hearty Prayers for all: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of all Mens Prayers we must disown, and most our own; but not for that disown their Prayers, nor our own. They that hate, or persecute, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Gods Children, for not praying in their Mode, or by their Book, or in the Words that they write down for them, or for not worshipping God with their Forms, Ceremonies or Rites, or that silence Christ's Ministers, and scatter the Flocks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Kingdoms, that they may be Lords of Gods Heritage, and have all Men sing in their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Tune, or Worship God in their unnecessary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Mode, do condemn themselves, when they say <hi>Our Father:</hi> And to repeat the Lords Prayer many times in their Liturgy, while they are tormenting his Children in their Prisons and Inquisitions, is to worship God by repeating their own Condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> It seems this Particle, <hi>Our</hi> and <hi>Us</hi> is of treat importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Lord's Prayer is the Summary and Rule of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60383:100"/>
Mans Love and just Desires: It directeth him what to <hi>Will, Ask</hi> and <hi>Seek.</hi> And therefore must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that duty of Love which is the Heart of the New Creature, and the fulfilling of the Law: The Will is the Man: And Love is the Will. What a Man <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Loves,</hi> that he is in God's account, or that he shall attain. And therefore the Love of God as God, and of the Church as the Church, and of Saints as Saints, of Friends as Friends, and of Neighbours as Neighbours, and of Men (though Enemies and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) as Men, must needs be the very Spring of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Prayer, as well as the Love of our selves as our selves. And to pray without this Love, is to offer God a Carrion for Sacrifice, or a lifeless sort of Service. And Love to all makes all Mens Mercies and Comforts to be ours, to our great Joy, and that we may be thankful for all.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To use it Holily: That is, in that manner as is proper to God as he is God, infinitely above all the Creatures: That is Sanctified, which is appropriated to God by separation from all common use.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What doth this Hallowing particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God's <hi>Name</hi> is either, 1. His sensible or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible works objectively considered. 2. Or those words which signifie God or any thing proper to God. 3. And the inward light or conception, or notice of God in the mind. And all these must be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is it to Sanctifie God's Name as in our Redemption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Redemption is such a wonderful work of God, to make him known to sinners for their Sanctification and Salvation, as no Tongue of Man can fully ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To think of God, the Eternal Word first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking Man's Redemption, and then taking the Nature of Man, dwelling in so mean a Tabernacle, fulfilling all Righteousness for us, Teaching Man the knowledge of God, and bringing Life and Immortality to light, dying for us as a Malefactor to save us from the Curse, Rising the third day, Commissioning his Apostles, undertaking to build his Church on a Rock, which the Gates of Hell should not prevail against; ascending up to Heaven, sending down the wonderful and sanctifying Spirit, Interceding for us, and Reigning over all, who receiveth faithful Souls to himself, and will raise our Bodies, and judge the World: Can all this be believed and thought of, without admiring the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60383:102"/>
manifold wisdom, the unconceivable Love and Mercy, the Holiness and Justice of God! This must be the daily study of Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 11.</hi> How is this Name of God propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When this wonderful work of Mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not believed, but taken by Infidels to be but a deceit: Or when it is heard but as a common Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and affecteth not the Hearer with admiration, thankfulness, desire and submission to Christ: when Men live as if they had no great Obligation to Christ, or no great need of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> How is Gods Name as our Sanctifier to be hallowed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Therein he cometh near us, even into us, with <hi>Illuminating, Quickening, Comforting Grace,</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to his Nature, Will and Image: Marking us for his own, and maintaining the cause of Christ against his Enemies. And therefore must in this be specially notified, honoured, obediently observed, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and joyfully admired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> But how can they honour God's Spirit and Grace, who have it not: Or they that have so little as not well to discern it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The least prevailing sincere Holiness hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial excellency, turning the Soul from the World to God, and may be perceived in Holy desires after him, and sincere endeavours to obey him: And the beauty of Holiness in others may be perceived by them that have little or none themselves, if they be not grown to Malignant Enmity: You may see by the Common desire of Mankind to be esteemed Wise and Good, and their Impatience of being thought and called Foolish, Ungodly or Bad Men, that even cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> Who be they that prophane this <hi>Name</hi> of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Those that see no great need of the Spirit of Holiness, or have no desire after it; but think that Nature and Art may serve the turn without it: Those that think that there is no great difference between Man and Man, but what their Bodily temperature and their Education maketh; and that it is but Phanatick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulusion, or Hypocrisie to pretend to the Spirit: Those that hate or deride the Name of Spirituality and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and those that resist the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> How is God known and honoured in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By his Providence he so Governeth all the World, and particularly all the Affairs of Men, as shews us his Omnipotence, his Omniscience, and his Goodness and Love, ordering them all to his Holy End, even the pleasing of his good Will in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <note n="d" place="bottom">Mal. 2, 2.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> How can we see this while the World lyeth in Madness, Unbelief and Wickedness, and the worst are greatest, and Contention, Confusion, and Bloody Wars do make the Earth a kind of Hell, and the Wise, Holy, and Iust are despised, hated and destroyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Wisdom, and Holiness, and Justice are conspicuous and honourable by the odiousness of their contraries; which though they fight against them, and seem to prevail, do but exercise them to their increase and greater glory: And all the Faithful are secured
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60383:103"/>
and purified, and prepared for Felicity, by the Love and Providence of God.</p>
               <p>2. And as the Heavens are not all Stars, but spang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Stars, nor the Stars all Suns, nor Beasts and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Men, nor the Earth and Stones are Gold and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, nor is the Darkness Light, the Winter Summer, or Sickness Health, or Death Life: And yet the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Variety and Vicissitude contributeth to the Perfection of the Universe, as the Variety of parts to the Perfection of the Body, so God maketh use even of Mens Sin and Folly, and of all the mad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions and Cruelties of the World, to that perfect Order and Harmony which he that accomplisheth them doth well know, though we perceive it not, because we neither see the <hi>Whole,</hi> nor the <hi>End,</hi> but only the little <hi>Particles</hi> and the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of God's unsearchable works.</p>
               <p>3. And this dark and wicked World is but a little Spot of God's vast Creation; and seemeth to be the lowest next to Hell, while the lucid Glorious heavenly Regions are incomprehensibly great, and no doubt possessed by Inhabitants suitable to so glorious a place: And as it is not either the Gallows or the Prison that is a dishonour to the Kingly Government, so neither is Hell or the Sins on Earth, a dishonour to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>4. And as every Man is nearest to himself, it is the duty of us all carefully to record all the Mercies and special Providences of God to our selves, that we may know his Government and him, and use the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them to his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> How is the <hi>heavenly Glory</hi> as a Name of God to us that see it not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We see vast lucid Bodies and Regions above
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60383:103"/>
us: And by the help of things seen we may conceive of things unseen; and by Divine Revelation we may certainly know them: We have in the Gospel as it were a Map of Heaven, in its description, and a title to it in the Promises, and a notifying earnest and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast in our Souls, so far as we are Sanctified Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> How must we <hi>hallow</hi> this Name of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Firmly believing the heavenly Glory, not only as it shall be our own Inheritance, but as it is now the most Glorious and Perfect part of Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where Myriads of Angels and Glorious Spirits in perfect Happiness, Love and Joy, are Glorifying their most Glorious Creator; and as the Saints with Christ their most Glorious Head, shall for ever make up that Glorious Society, and the Universe it self be seen by us in that Glorious Perfection, in which the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creator will appear.</p>
               <p>2. And in the constant delightful Contemplation of this Supernal Glorious World, by Heavenly Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Conversation, keeping our Minds above while our Bodyes are here below, and looking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this Prison of Flesh, with desire and hope. As Heaven is the State and Place where God shineth to the understanding Creature in the greatest Glory, and where he is best known, so it is this heavenly Glory seen to us by Faith, which is the most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of all the <hi>Names</hi> or Notices of God to be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God made Man very good at first, and that was in his own Image: And so much of this is either left by the interposition of Grace in lapsed Nature, or by common Grace restored to it, as that all Men, till utterly debauched, would fain be accounted Good, Pious, Vertuous, and Just, and hate the imputation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60383:104"/>
of Wickedness, dishonesty and Badness: And on the Regenerate the Divine Nature is so renewed, as that their Inclination is towards God, and HOLINESS TO THE LORD is written on all their Faculties: And the Spirit of God moveth on the Soul, to actuate all his Graces; and to plead for God and our Redeemer, and bring Him to our <hi>Remembrance,</hi> to our <hi>Affections,</hi> and to subject us wholly to his Will and Love. And thus as the Law was written in Stone as to the Letter, which is written only on tender fleshy Hearts as to the Spirit and Holy effect and disposition; so the Name of God which is in the Bible in the Letter, is by the same Spirit imprinted on Believers Hearts, that is, They have the Knowledge, Faith, Fear and Love of God.<note n="g" place="bottom">Psal. 29. 2. &amp; 48. 10.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By Reverencing and Loving God, that is, God's Image and Operations in us: Not only God as glorified in Heaven, but God as dwelling by Grace in Holy Souls, must be remembred, and reverenced by us. 2. By living as in habitual Communion and Conversation with that God who dwelleth in us, and who hath made us his Habitation by the Spirit. 3. And by ready obeying the moving Operations of the Spirit for God.</p>
               <p>And to contemn or resist these inward Ideas, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Motions, is to prophane the Name of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> But what is all this to the Sanctfying of God himself?</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60383:105"/>

                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> WHy is this made the Second Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To tell us, that it must be the Second thing in our Desires. We are to begin at that which is highest, most excellent, and ultimate in our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that is, Gods Glory shining in all his Works, and seen, admired, honoured and praised by Man, which is the <hi>hallowing of his Name,</hi> and the Holy Exalting him in our Thoughts, Affections, Words and Actions above all Creatures. And we
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60383:105"/>
are next to desire that in which God's glory most eminently shineth: And that is his <hi>Kingdom of Grace and Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What is here meant by the Kingdom of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not that Kingdom which he hath over An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the innumerable glorious Spirits of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Regions. For these are much unknown to us, and we know not that there is any Rebellion among them which needeth a Restoration. But Man by Sin is fallen into Rebellion, and under the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due to Rebels<note n="a" place="bottom">Col. 1. 13. Mat. 12. 28. &amp; 21. 31, 43.

So that the Kingdom of God now is his Reign over fallen Man by Christ the Mediator, begun on Earth by Recovering Grace, and perfected in heavenly Glory.<note n="b" place="bottom">Luke 7. 28. &amp; 8. 1. 10. &amp; 10. 9. &amp; 11. 20. &amp; 13. 18, 20, 28, 29. &amp; 16. 16. &amp; 17. 21. &amp; 18. 3, 17, 29.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But the Scriptures sometimes speaks of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God as come already when Christ came, or when he rose and ascended to his Glory: and sometime as if it were yet to come at the great Resurrection Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the first case the meaning is, that the King of the Church is come, and hath established his Law
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60383:106"/>
of Grace, and Commissioned his Officers, and sent forth his Spirit, and so the Kingdom of healing Grace is come; But in the second case, the meaning is, that all that Glorious Perfection which this Grace doth tend to, which will be the Glory of the Church, the Glory of Christ therein, and the Glorification of Gods Love, is yet to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> What is it then which we here desire?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That God will enlarge and carry on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace in the World, and bear down all that Rebells, and hindereth it, and particularly in our selves: And that he would hasten the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Who is it then that is the King of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> GOD as the absolute Supream, and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the Son of God and Man, as the Supream Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent and Administrator.<note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 9. Luke 9. 27. &amp; 14, 15. &amp; 22. 16, 18. &amp; 23. 51.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Who are the Subjects of this Kingdom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are three sorts of Subjects: 1. Subjects only as to Obligation:<note n="†" place="bottom">Act. 14. 22. Gal. 5. 21. Eph. 5. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Thes. 5.

Subjects by meer Profession: And so all Baptized professing Christians though Hypocrites, are the Church-visible, and his professed Subjects. 3. Subjects by sincere Heart-consent: And so all such are his Subjects as make up the Church-mystical, and shall be saved.

                  <hi>A.</hi> No: He was Governour of none of the Eleven Apostles, nor of <hi>Paul;</hi> nor ever exercised any such Government: no nor it seems, so much as presided at their meeting, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> But is not a General Council the Universal Governour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: 1. Else the Church would be no Church, when there is no General Council, for want of its Unifying Government: And 2. There indeed never was a general Council of all the Christian World: But they were called by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, and were called General as to that Empire (as the Subscriptions yet shew). 3. And there never can be an Universal
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60383:109"/>
Council: It were madness and wickedness to attempt it: To send for the Aged Bishops from all Nations of the Christian World, (when none is Empowered to determine Whither or When) even from the Countreys of <hi>Turks,</hi> and other Infidels, or Princes in War with one another that will not permit them: And what room shall hold them, and what one Language can they all speak? And how few will live to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home with the Decrees? And will not the Countrey were they meet, by nearness, have more Voices than all the rest? And what is all this to do? To condemn Christ as not having made Laws sufficient for the Universal part of Government, but leave such a burden on uncapable Men: And to tell the Church that Christian Religion is a mutable growing thing, and can never be known to attain its ripeness, but by new Laws must be made still bigger, and another thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> But the Bishops of the World may meet by their Delegates?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Those Delegates must come from the same Countreys and distance: And how shall the whole World know that they are truly chosen? And that all the Choosers have trusted them with their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Consciences and Salvation, and will stand to what they do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> But if the Universal Church be divided into Patriarchates, and chief Seats, those can Govern the whole Church when there is no General Council; even by their Communicatory Letters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. And who shall divide the World into those chief Seats, and determine which shall be chief in all the Kingdoms of Infidels, and Christian Kings in the World? And which shall be Chief when they differ
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60383:109"/>
among themselves? How many Patriarchs shall there be, and where? There were never Twelve Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to succeed the Twelve Apostles: The <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had three First, and Five after within it self: But that was by Humane institution; and over one Empire; and that's now down; and those Five Seats have many Hundred Years been separated, and condemning one another; so far are they from being <hi>One Unifying Aristocracy</hi> to Govern all the World: And if they were so, then <hi>Europe</hi> is Schismatical, that now differs from the Major Vote of those Patriarchs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> But did not the Apostles as one Colledge Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the whole Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I proved to you before, that the Holy Ghost was given the Apostles to perfect <hi>Universal Ligisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as Christs Agent and Advocate, and that in this they have no Successors. 2. And it was easie for them to exercise Acts of Judicial Determination over such as were among them, and near them, when the Church was small. 3. And yet we read not that ever they did this in a General Council, or by the Authority of a Major Vote. For that meeting in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was no General Council, and the Elders and Brethren joyned with them that belonged to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and they were all by the same Spirit of the same mind, and none Dissenters. Every single Apostle had the Spirit of Infallibility for his proper work: And they had an Indefinite charge of the whole Church, and in their several circuits exercised it: <hi>Paul</hi> could by the Spirit deliver a Law of Christ to the World, without taking it from the other Apostles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were foundation Stones, but Christ only was the Head Corner-stone. They never set up a Judicial Government of all the Churches under themselves as a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60383:110"/>
constitutive Unifying Aristocracy, by whose major Vote all must be Governed: When they had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work of Universal Legislation, and settled Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Order, for which they stayed together at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they dispersed themselves over the World, and we never find that they Judicially governed the Churches either in Synods or by Letters, by a major Vote, but settled Guides in ever Church as God by <hi>Moses</hi> did Priests and Levites, that had no Legislative Power. <note n="m" place="bottom">Eph. 2. 20. 1 Cor. 3. 11. 1 Cor. 1. 11, 12. &amp; 3. 21, 22.

                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> But hath not Christ his Subordinate Official Governours?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Magistrates by the Sword, and Pastors by the Word and Keyes: These are Rulers in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circuits, as all the Judges and Justices, and Shool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters of <hi>England</hi> are under the King: But he that should say, that all these Judges and Justices are one Sovereign Aristocracy, to make Laws and Judge by them by Vote (<hi>as one Person political,</hi> though many Natural) would give them part of the Supream power, and not only the Official: All the Pastors in the World, Guide all the Churches in the World, by parts, and in their several Provinces, and not as One Politick Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 24.</hi> But how is the Universal Church visible, if it have no Visible Unifying Head and Government under Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is Visible, 1. In that the Members and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession are visible. 2. And Christ's Laws are visible, by which he ruleth them. 3. And their particular Pastors are visible in their places. 4. And Christ was visible on
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60383:110"/>
Earth, and is now visible in his Court in Heaven, and will visibly Judge the World e're long: And God hath made the Church no further Visible; nor can Man do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> But should not the whole Church be One?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is one: It is one Body of Christ, having one God, and one Head, or Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, one Spirit, one Hope of Glory. <note n="n" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 1, 3, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, as far as they are capable: Not by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Universal Legislative Power in Man, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Universal Head under Christ, but by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in the Faith and Laws that Christ hath left us: And Synods may well be used to maintain such Union as far as capacity reacheth, and the case requireth: But an Universal Synod, and a partial or National, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Synod, and a Synod for Concord of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, differ as much as doth a Monarch or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senate over all the World, and a Dyet, or an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Christian Princes met for mutual help and concord in the conjunction of their strength and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 27.</hi> What is the Pastoral Power of the Church Keyes?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 28.</hi> But have not Pastors or Bishops, a power of constraint by the Sword, that is, by Corporal punishments or mulcts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: That is proper to Magistrates, Parents and Masters, in their several places: Christ hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it to Pastors, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. and appointed them another kind of work.<note n="p" place="bottom">Luke 22. 24, 25, 26. 1 Pet. 5. 3, 4. 2 Tim. 2. 24.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 29.</hi> But if Bishops judge that Civil Magistrates are bound to destroy or punish Hereticks, Schismaticks or Sinners, are not such Magistrates thereby bound to do it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are bound to do their duty whoever is their Monitor: But if Prelates bid them sin, they sin by obeying them: Nor may a Magistrate punish a Man meerly because Bishops judge him punishable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trying the Cause themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 30.</hi> But if it be not of <hi>Divine Institution</hi> that all the Church on Earth should have one Governing Unifying Head (Monarchical or Aristocratical) is it not meet as suited to humane Prudence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Christ is the builder of his own Church or House, and hath not left it to the Wit or Will of Man,<note n="q" place="bottom">Heb. 3. 2, 5, 6.</note> to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60383:111"/>
make him a Vicegerent, or an Unifying Head or Ruler of his whole Church, that is, to set up an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per against him under his own Name, which is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally uncapable of the Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 31.</hi> But sure Unity is so excellent that we may conceive God delighteth in all that promoteth it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: And therefore he would not leave the Terms of Unity to the Device of Men, in which they will never be of a mind, nor would he have Usurpers divide his Church by imposing impossible Terms of Unity. Must God needs make one Civil Monarch or Senate to be the Unifying Governour of all the Earth as one Kingdom, because he is a lover of Unity? The World is politically Unified by one God and Soveraign Redeemer, as this Kingdom is by one King, and not by one Civil humane Supream Ruler, Personal or Collective: Men so mad as to dream of one Unifying Church Governing Monarch or Aristocracy, are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittest of all Men to pretend to such Government.<note n="r" place="bottom">Ioh. 17. 22, 23, 24.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 32.</hi> At least should we not extend this Unifying Government as far as we can, even to <hi>Europe,</hi> if not to all the World?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Try first one Unifying Civil Government (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical or Aristocracitical) for <hi>Europe,</hi> and call Princes Schismaticks (as these Men do us) for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to obey it, and try the success. 2. And who shall make this <hi>European</hi> Church-Soveraign? And by what Authority, and limit his Kingdom? 3. And what is all this to do? To make better Laws than Christs! When were any so mad as to say that all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> must have one Soveraign Person, or Colledge of Physicians, School-masters, Philosophers or Lawyers, to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60383:112"/>
avoid Schism among them. 4. Is not <hi>Agreement</hi> by <hi>Voluntary</hi> consent a better way to keep Civil and Ecclesiastical Unity in <hi>Europe,</hi> than to have one <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> King, Senate, or Synod over all.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No doubt but Christ would have Nations dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, baptized and obey him: And Kings to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them as Christian Nations, and all men should endeavour that whole Nations may be Christians, and the Kingdoms of the World be voluntarily the Kingdoms of Christ. But no man can be a Christian against his will: Nor hath Christ ordained that each Kingdom shall have one Sacerdotal Head, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical or Aristocratical. But Princes, Pastors and People, must promote Love, Unity and Concord in their several places.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is Christs Ruling us by the Laws which he hath made for all his Church, proclaimed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and applyed by his Ministers, and imprinted on the Heart by his holy Spirit, and judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It hath two degrees: The first is the Glorious reign of our Glorified Redeemer over this World,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60383:112"/>
and over the Heavenly City of God before its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; which began at the time of Christs Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (his Resurrection being the Proeme) and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the Resurrection. 2. The perfect Kingdom of Glory, when all the Elect shall be perfected with Christ, and his work of Redemption finished, which begins at the Resurrection and shall never end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 37.</hi> What will be the state of that Glorious Kingdom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It containeth the full Collection of all Gods Elect, who shall be perfected in Soul and Body, and employed in the perfect Obedience, Love and Praise of God, in perfect Love and Communion with each other, and all the blessed Angels and their Glorified Redeemer, and this is in the sight of his Glory and the Glory of God, and in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual joyful sence of his Love, and essential Infinite Perfection: All imperfection, sin, temptation and suffering being for ever ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 38.</hi> But some think this Kingdom will be begun on Earth a Thousand Years before the General Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and some think that after the Resurrection it will be on Earth.<note n="s" place="bottom">Rev. 20. 2 Pet. 3. 12, 13.</note>

For when Christ bids us pray that [<hi>His Name may be hallowed, his Kingdom come, and his Will done on Earth as it is done in Heaven,</hi>] we may well hope that some such thing will be granted; for he hath promised to give us whatever we ask according to his Will in the Name of Christ: And he hath not bid us pray in vain.</p>

                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> VVHy is this made the Third Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because it must be the Third in our Desires: I told you this Prayer in perfect Method <hi>beginneth</hi> at that which must be the first in our Intention; and that is, God's <hi>Interest</hi> as <hi>above</hi> our own, which is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent and exprest in these three gradations: 1. The highest Notion of it is, The Hallowing and Glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Name, and resplendent perfections. 2. The Second is that in which this is chiefliest notified to Man, which is his Kingdom. 3. The Third is the Effect of this Kingdom in the fulfilling of his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What will of God is it that is here meant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> His Governing and Beneficent will: expressed in his Laws and Promises, concerning Man's Duty, and God's Rewards and Gifts. <note n="a" place="bottom">Ioh. 4. 34. &amp; 6. 39, 40.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It may be included as the supposed matter of our <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>praise:</hi> And as Gods will is taken for the Effects and Signs of his will, we may and must desire that he will continue the Course of Nature, Sun, and Moon, and Stars, Earth, Winds and Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

till the time of their dissolution, and Mankind on Earth: For these are supposed as the subject or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Government.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. All shall be done which God hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or decreed to do himself, and not laid the Event on the will of Man: His absolute will of Events, is still fulfilled. But Man doth not alwayes do God's will; that is, he doth not keep God's Laws, or do the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which God commandeth him; and therefore doth not obtain the Rewards or Gifts which were but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally promised. 2. And even some things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed absolutely by God, must be prayed for by Man: For he decreeth the Means as well as the End; and Prayer is a means, which his Commands and Promises oblige us to.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What is it that we pray against in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Against all sin, as a Transgression of his Law, and against all distrust of his Promises, and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness with his Disposals: and so against every will, that is contrary to the will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What Will is it that is contrary to the Will of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Will of Satan, who hateth God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and Man, and willeth Sin, Confusion and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and who is obeyed by all the ungodly World.</p>
               <p>2. The Will of all blind Unbelieving wicked Men, especially Tyrants, who fill the World with Sin, and Blood, and Misery, that they may have their wills without controll or bounds.</p>
               <p>3. Especially our own sinful self-willedness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and disobedient dispositions. <note n="c" place="bottom">Io. 1. 13. Ioh. 5. 30. &amp; 6. 38. Luke 22. 42. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What mean you by our self-willedness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Man was made by the Creating Will of God, to obey the Governing will of God, and rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the disposing, rewarding and beneficent will of God, and his Essential Love and Goodness: by sin he is fallen from God's will to himself, and his own Will, and would fain have all Events in the power and disposal of his own Will, and fain be Ruled by his own Will, and have no restraints, and would rest in himself; and the fulfilling of his Will: Yea, he would have all Persons and things in the World, to depend
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60383:115"/>
on his Will, fulfill and please it, and ascribe unto it. And so would be the Idol of himself, and of the World. And all the wickedness, and stir, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the World, is but that every selfish Man may have his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What then is the full meaning of this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That Earth which is grown so like to Hell by doing the will of Satan, of Tyrants, and of self-willed fleshly wicked Men, may be made liker unto Heaven by a full compliance of the will of Man with the will of God, depending submissively on his disposing will, obeying his commanding will, fearing his punishing will, trusting, rejoicing and resting in his reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beneficent will, and renouncing all that is against it.<note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 12. 47.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As God himself doth Antecedently or Primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will that which is good without any evil to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and but consequently will their punishment on supposition of their wilful sin, and this but as the work of his Holiness and Justice for good; so he would have us to will first and absolutely, next his own Glory and Kingdom, our own Holiness and Happiness, and not our Misery; but to submit to his just punishments with a will that Loveth (not the hurt, but) the final good Effect, and the Wisdom, Holiness and Justice
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60383:115"/>
of our Chastiser. Which well consisteth with begging Mercy, Pardon, and Deliverance.<note n="q" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 42.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But is not Heaven too high a Pattern for our desires?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: Though we have much duty on Earth which belongs not to them in Heaven; and they have much which belongeth not to us, yet we must desire to obey God fully in our duty, as they do in theirs; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and seeking heavenly Perfection is our sincerity on Earth.<note n="r" place="bottom">Psal. 4. 80.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Unbelief of the Heavenly Perfection. 2. Fleshly Lusts and Wills, and a Worldly mind. 3. The ungodliness of them that would not have God have all our Heart, and Love, and Service, but think it is too much preciseness, or more ado than needs, and give him but the leavings of the Flesh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I told you that the Lords Prayer hath two parts: The first is for our <hi>End</hi> according to the Order of <hi>Intention,</hi> beginning at the top, and descending: The Second part is about the <hi>Means,</hi> according to the Order of <hi>Execution,</hi> beginning at the bottom, and

ascending to the top. Now this is the first Petition of the Second part, because <hi>Our Substance</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> is supposed to all accidents; and if God continue not our <hi>humanity,</hi> we cannot be capable of his <hi>Blessings.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All things necessary to sustain our Natures in a fitness for our duty and our Comforts.<note n="b" place="bottom">Ier. 45. 5. 1 Tim. 4. 8. 2 Pet. 1. 3.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> It seems then that we pray that we may not want, or be sick, or die, when God hath foretold us the contrary Events?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We justly shew that our Nature is against Death, and sickness, and wants, as being Natural evils: And God giveth us a discerning Judgment to know natural good from evil, and an Appetite to desire it accordingly: But because Natural Good and Evil, are to be estimated as they tend to Spiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Good or Evil, God giveth us Reason and Faith to Order our desires accordingly: And because our Knowledge of this is imperfect (when and how far Natural Good or Evil, conduceth to Spiritual and Eternal) it is still supposed that we make not our selves but God the Judge; and so desire Life, Health and Food and Natural Supplies, with submission to his Will, for time and measure, they being but means to higher things.</p>

but the first is the lowest, though it be first in place. Nature sustained is the first, but it will be but the subject of sin and misery without <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness:</hi> I told you that the three last Petitions go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Order of <hi>Execution,</hi> from the lowest to the highest step.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> But if God give us more than Bread, even Plenty for our delight, as well as necessaries, may we not use it accordingly?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> A Man is bound to labour in a lawful Calling that is able, and to desire and beg God's Blessing on it: But he must not desire Riches, or Plenty for <hi>it self,</hi> or for <hi>fleshly Lusts;</hi> nor be over importunate with God to make him his <hi>Steward</hi> for others.<note n="n" place="bottom">Prov. 10. 22.

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Because the Pardon of old Sins is but begun, and not fully perfect, till all the punishment be ceased: And that is not, till all sin, and unholiness, and all the evil effects of sin be ceased. No nor till the Day of

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> May not a tempted Man be delivered from Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, when the Temptation is not chosen by him, and cannot be avoided, and when it is not too strong for him, grace assisting him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> What duty doth this Petition oblige us to, and what sin doth it reprehend?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It binds us to a continual humble sense of our own corrupt dispositions, apt to yield to Temptations, and of our danger, and of the evil of Sin: And it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the unhumbled that know not, or fear not their pravity or danger.</p>
               <p>2. It binds us all to fly from Temptations as far as
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60383:122"/>
Lawfully we can; and condemneth them that rush fearlesly on them, yea, that tempt themselves and others. The best Man is not safe that will not avoid such Temptations as are suited to his corrupt Nature, when he may: While the bait is still near unto his Senses, he is in continual danger.<note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 18. 6, 7, 8, 9. 1 Cor. 8. 9.

               </p>
               <p>3. It binds us to feel the need of Grace, and God's deliverance, and not to trust our corrupted Nature, and insufficient strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> How doth God deliver us from Evil?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. By keeping us from over strong Temptation. 2. By his assisting Grace. 3. By restraining Satan and wicked Men, and all things that would hurt us, and by his merciful Providence, directing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and delivering us from sin and misery.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of the Ten Commandements in General.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu. 1.</hi> ARE the Ten Commandements a Law to Christians? Or are they abrogated with the rest of <hi>Moses</hi> Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Ten Commandements are considerable in three States: 1. As part of the Primitive Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. As the Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> for the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Government of the <hi>Iews</hi> Common-wealth. 3. As the Law of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Exod. 20. Deut. 5. Exod. 34. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Law of Nature is not abrogate, though the terms of Life and Death are not the same as under the Law of Innocency.<note n="b" place="bottom">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> as such, never bound all other Nations, nor now bindeth us, but is dead and done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.

But seeing it was God that was the Author of that Law, and by it expresly told the <hi>Iews</hi> what the Law of Nature is, we are all bound still to take those two Tables to be God's own Transcript of his Law of Nature, and so are by consequence bound by them still. If God give a Law to some one Man, as that which belongs to the Nature of all Men, though it bind us not as a Law to that Man, it binds as Gods exposition of the Law of Nature when notified to us.</p>
               <p>3. As the Law of Christ, it binds all Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> How are the Ten Commandements the Law of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Nature it self, and lapsed Mankind is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Christ as Redeemer, to be used in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Kingdom. And so the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is become his Law.<note n="c" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 18, 19. &amp; 24. 40. Mark 10. 19. &amp; 12. 29, 30.

               </p>
               <p>2. It was Christ as God-Redeemer that gave the Law to <hi>Moses,</hi> and as it is a Transcript of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of Nature he doth not revoke it, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.</p>
               <p>3. Christ hath repeated and owned the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it in the Gospel, and made it his Command to his Disciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Is there nothing in the Ten Commandements proper to the <hi>Israelites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: 1. The Preface: <hi>Hear O Israel:</hi> And [<hi>that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage.</hi>] 2. The stating the Seventh

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> How doth Christ and his Apostles contract all the Law into that of Love?</p>
               <p>

So that, 1. Objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Love to God,</hi> our <hi>Selves</hi> and <hi>Others</hi> in that measure that it is exercised Wisely, is <hi>Obedience Emenently</hi> and somewhat higher. 2. And <hi>Love</hi> as the <hi>Principle</hi> in Man, is the most powerful Cause of Obedience, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Reverence of Authority and the fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but is somewhat more Excellent than they. A Parents Love to a Child makes him more constant and full in all that he can do for him,<note n="e" place="bottom">2 Tim. 1. 7. 1 Ioh. 4. 17, 18. Gal. 5. 14.</note> than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a King alone would do. In that measure that you Love God, you will heartily and delightfully do all your duty to him; and so far as you love Parents or Neighbours, you will gladly promote their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Safety, Chastity, Estates, Rights, and all that's theirs, and hate all that is against their good. And as Parents will feed their Children, though no fear of punishment should move them; so we shall be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60383:125"/>
above the great necessity of the fear of punishment, so far as God and Goodness is our delight. <note n="f" place="bottom">Psal. 1. 2, 3. &amp; 119.—.</note>

               <p>

                  <item>2. Under <hi>General</hi> Commands and Prohibitions, the kinds and particulars are included which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral word extendeth to.</item>
                  <item>3. When one Particular sin is forbidden, or duty Commanded, all the Branches of it, and all of the same kind and reason are Forbidden or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</item>
                  <item>4. Where the End is commanded or forbidden, it is implyed that so are the true Means as such.</item>
                  <item>5. Every Commandement extendeth to the whole Man, to our Bodyes and all the Members, and to the Soul and all its Faculties respectively.</item>
                  <item>6. Commands bind us not to be alwayes doing the thing Commanded. Dutyes be not at all times duty: But Prohibitions bind us at all times from every sin, when it is indeed a sin.</item>
                  <item>7. Every Command implyeth some reward or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Obedient, and every sin of Omission or Commission is supposed to deserve punishment, though it be not named. <note n="h" place="bottom">Mal. 3. 14.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. Every Command supposeth the thing Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60383:125"/>
to be no <hi>Natural impossibility,</hi> (as to see Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or into the Heart of the Earth, to know that which is not intelligible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But it doth not suppose us to be <hi>Morally</hi> or <hi>Holily</hi> disposed to keep it, or to be able to change our Corrupt Natures without God's Grace.</item>
                  <item>9. So every Command supposeth us to have that <hi>Natural freedom</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> which is a <hi>self-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power,</hi> not <hi>necessitated</hi> or <hi>forced to sin</hi> by any: But not to have a Will that is free from <hi>Vicious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> Nor from under God's disposing power. <note n="i" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 6, 7, 8.

                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 19. Rom. 14. 9. Ioh. 5. 22. Ioh. 17. 2, 3.</note> So that this signifieth the nearest Right and Reason of this Relation between God and Man. He giveth us his Law now not only as our <hi>Creator,</hi> but as our <hi>Redeemer:</hi> and as such we must be his willing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and obey him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Are all Men Subjects of God's Kingdom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. All are Subjects as to Right and Obligation. 2. All that Profess Subjection as <hi>profest Consenters.</hi> 3. And all true hearty Consenters are his sincere Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that shall be Saved.</p>
               <p>God the Creator and Redeemer hath the <hi>Right</hi> of Soveraignty over all the World whether they <hi>Consent</hi> or not. But they shall not have the Blessing of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects without their own <hi>true Consent,</hi> nor of <hi>visible Church Members</hi> without <hi>profest Consent.</hi> But <hi>antecedent</hi> Mercies he giveth to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Why is this description of Gods Soveraignty, and Mans Subjection, and the Ground of it, set before the Commandements?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60383:127"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because, 1. Faith must go before Obedience.<note n="c" place="bottom">Ioh. 17. 3. &amp; 14. 1, 2. Ioh. 3. 16. Ios. 24. 18. Ioh. 20, 28.</note> He that will come to God and obey him, must Believe that God is God, and that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. And he that will obey him as our Redeemer, must believe that we are Redeemed by Jesus Christ, and that he is our Lord and King. 2. And <hi>Relations</hi> go before the <hi>Dutyes</hi> of Relation: And our <hi>Consent</hi> foundeth the mutual <hi>Relation.</hi> The nature and form of Obedience is, To Obey anothers Commanding will <hi>because</hi> he is our <hi>Rightful Governour.</hi> No Man can Obey him formally whom he taketh not for his <hi>Ruler.</hi> And Subjection or Consent to be Governed, is <hi>Virtually</hi> all Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But what if Men never hear of the Redeemer, may they not obey Gods Law of Nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They may know that they are Sinners; and that the sin of an Immortal Soul deserveth endless punishment: And they may find by experience that God useth them not as they deserve, but giveth many mercies to those that deserve nothing but misery; and that he obligeth them to use some means in hope for their recovery, and so that he Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth them by a Law (or on terms) of Mercy. And being under the first Edition of the Law of Grace, though they know not the second, they ought to keep that Law which they are under, and they shall be judged by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> How then doth the Christian Church as Christs Kingdom, differ from the World without, if they be any of his Kingdom too?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> As all the World was under that Common Law of Grace which was made for them to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noe,</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed only were chosen out of all the World as a peculiar Holy Nation to God, and were under a Law and Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity,</hi> which belonged <hi>only</hi> unto them; so though Christ hath not revoked those common Mercies given to all by the first Edition of the Law of Grace, nor left the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed and lawless, yet he hath given to Christians a more excellent Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> than he gave the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and hath elected them out of the World to himself, as a chosen Generation, a Royal Priestood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to shew forth the Praises of him that hath called them out of darkness into his marvellous Light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> It seems then we must take great heed that we make not Christs Kingdom either less or Greater than it is?</p>

A true Love to those that are likest God in Wisdom, Holiness and doing good; And such a Love to them as is above the Love of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches, Honour and Pleasure, so that it will enable us to do them good, though by our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or loss in a lower matter, when God calls as to it.

               <p>4. True Love to God doth Love it self.

It is Love that maketh us sorrowful that we can please him no more, nor more enjoy him; and that maketh us grieved that we can no more know him, love him, and delight in him; and that we have so much sin within us to displease him, and hinder our communion of Love with him. 5.

                  <hi>A.</hi> To make us know that God doth so strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the great duty of worshipping him as the true God, and hate the sin of Idolatry or giving his Glory to another, or blaspheming him as if he were like to painted things, that he would have us accordingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> Why doth God threaten to visit the iniquities of the Fathers on the Children in this Command rather than in the rest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God hath Blessings and Curses for Societies as well as for individual persons; And societies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and known by the Symbols of publick profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And as Gods publick Worship is the Symbol of his Church which he will bless, so Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is the Symbol of the societies which he will Curse and Punish. And it was Specially needful that the <hi>Israelites</hi> should know this, who could never else have been excused from the guilt of Murdering Man, Woman and Child of all the Nations which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, had not God taken it on himself as judging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> But doth not God disclaim punishing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the Fathers sins, and say the Soul that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth shall die?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; when the Children are either wholly innocent of that sin, or else are pardoned through Christ upon their true repentance, and hating and renouncing their Fathers sins. But not else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> Are any Children guilty of their Parents sins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, all Children are guilty of the sins which their Parents Committed before their birth, while they were in their loins. Not with the same degree and sort of Guilt as the Parents are; but yet with so much as exposeth them to just penalties.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First by the Nature of the Case: For though we were not <hi>Personally</hi> existent in them when they sinned, we were <hi>seminally</hi> existent in them, which is more than <hi>Causally</hi> or <hi>Virtually:</hi> And it was tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

save <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, it would not have saved all or any of his Posterity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they also had continued innocent themselves. Nor did God make any promise to continue and keep innocent all <hi>Adams</hi> posterity, in case he sinned not. We sinned in <hi>Adam</hi> because we were seminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him; and so are our Children in us: And who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, if it was essentially in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> If we are guilty of all neerer parents sin, will not our guilt increase to the end of the World, and the last man have the greatest guilt? <note n="k" place="bottom">On this I have written a peculiar Treatise of Original sin.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: because all guilt from <hi>Adam,</hi> and from our nearer parents too, is pardoned by Christ, when we are baptized as sincere Believers or their seed: But it's true that we are so far more guilty as to have the more need of a Saviours grace. 2. And Guilt is considerable either as <hi>more obligations</hi> to the <hi>same</hi> punishment, or as obligation to <hi>more or greater punishment.</hi> It's true, that impenitent persons who are the seed of a line of wicked Ancestors, have more obligations to the <hi>same</hi> punishment; but not obligation to <hi>greater</hi> punishment: because as great as they were capable of was due before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> But many say that for nearer parents sins no punishments but temporal are due?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. If <hi>any</hi> at all are due, it proveth an answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guilt: 2. To say that <hi>Adams</hi> sin deserveth our spiritual and eternal punishment, and all other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents sin only temporal, is to speak without and against Scripture and the Nature of the Case? The
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60383:143"/>
Case of the seed of the old World, the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and the present Heathens, speaks much more. 3. It's clear that nearer Parents sin is a cause that many of their Posterity are more sinful (in Lust, Pride, Fornication, Heresie, Ignorance) than others: And <hi>Sin</hi> (as well as <hi>Grace</hi>) hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to perpetuity, if not cured and remitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> Why doth God name only the third and fourth Generation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To shew us, that though he will punish the sins of his Enemies on their Posterity who imitate their Parents, yet he sets such bounds to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Justice, as that sinners shall not want en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to repent and hope for Mercy.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> All that have a predominant hatred to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, his Service and his holy Laws. But the Text specially meaneth those Societies of Infidels, Heathens, and Malignants, who are the professed enemies of his Church and Worship. As I said before, The outward symbols of Idolatry were the <hi>Professing signs</hi> by which his Churches Enemies were openly noted in the World; as Baptism and the Lords Supper were the Badges of his Church and Servants. <note n="l" place="bottom">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. As to the Subject it must be noted, that such a Belief in God as causeth men to Love him and keep his Commandements, is the qualification
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60383:143"/>
of them that have the promise of Gods saving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Faith working by Love and Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The words signifie Gods wonderful Mercy and his delight to do good to those that are qualified to receive it.</p>
               <p>3. And they signifie, that God will not only love and bless a Godly Offspring for their own sake, but also for the sake of their godly Ancestors, and while they succeed them in true Piety, God will increase his Blessings on them.</p>
               <p>4. And though those forfeit all, that prove ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they come to age, yet the Insant-seed of the Faithful, while such, are in Covenant with God, on the account of their relation to those godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who dedicate themselves and theirs to him.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> This Promise doth not say that God will keep all the Children of the faithful from sinning against him, and casting away his Mercy and Salvation: But if men be sincerely Godly, and dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Children to God, and enter them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Covenant, and perform their own part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by them, God will accept them into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and pardon their Original Sin, and give them the necessary helps for their personal Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience when they come to the use of Reason: <note n="m" place="bottom">Prov. 20. 7.

But as Infidels and wicked Hypocrites have no Promise of Gods acceptance of them and theirs, so such do not dedicate themselves and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God: He that will devote his Child to God, must do it as it were a part of himself; and cannot do it sincerely if he first devote not himself to God.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I have said heretofore as others, that it's but an Appeal to God as the Witness of the Truth, and the Avenger of a Lye; but on further Thoughts I
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60383:145"/>
find that the common nature of an Oath is to [<hi>Pawn some greater thing in attesting of the truth of our words,</hi>] or [<hi>to take some grievous thing on our selves as a penalty if we Lye,</hi>] or [<hi>to make some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth a pledge of the truth of what we say;</hi>] And to Swear by our Faith, or Truth, or Honesty, by the Temple, the Altar, the Fire, the Sun, is as much as to say [If this be not true, then I have no Faith, Truth, Honesty; there is no Temple, Altar, Fire, Sun] or [let me be taken for one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth that I have any Faith, that there is any Sun, Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] or [it is as true as that this is Fire, Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] so to Swear by God, is to say [It is as true as that there is a God, or as God liveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] or [If I Lye, take me for one that denyeth God to be God] (and consequently it is an Appeal to him as the Avenger:) so [<hi>By the Life of Pharaoh</hi>] was [<hi>As true as Pharaoh liveth</hi>] or [<hi>else take me for one that denyeth the life of Pharaoh;</hi>] So that there is somewhat of an Imprecation or Self-reproach as the penalty of a Lye in every Oath, but more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of <hi>Divine Revenge</hi> when we Swear by God, and of Idolatry when men Swear by an Idol as if it were a God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Which be the chief wayes of taking Gods Name in vain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Fathering on him false Doctrine, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Laws; saying as false Prophets, <hi>God sent me,</hi> and <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> when it is false; saying, <hi>This Doctrine or this Prophecy Gods Spirit revealed to me,</hi> when it is not so; therefore all Christians must be very fearful of false Revelations and Prophecies, and see that they believe not every Spirit, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Revelations; and to take heed of taking
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60383:145"/>
the Suggestions of Satan, or their crazed melancholy Fancies, for the Revelations of God.</p>
               <p>2. So also <hi>Gathering false Doctrines</hi> out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by false Expositions, and fathering these on God. And therefore all men should in dark and doubtful cases, rather suspend their judgments till they have overcome their doubts by solid Evidence, than rashly to conclude, and confidently and fiercely dispute for Errour. It's a great prophanation to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lies on God, who is the Hater of them, when Lying is the Devils work and character.</p>
               <p>3. The same I may say of a rash and false Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Gods Providences.</p>
               <p>4. And also of fathering false Laws on God, and saying that he either commandeth or forbiddeth what he doth not: To make <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> which God never made, and say he made them, is to father falshood on him, and corrupt his Government.</p>
               <p>5. Another way is by <hi>false Worship.</hi> 1. If men say that <hi>God commanded such Worship</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not, it is the sin last mentioned. 2. If they worship him with their own Inventions without his Command (Particular or General) they prophane his Name, by offering him that which is unholy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unclean.</p>
               <p>6. Another way is by false pretending that God gave them that Authority which he never gave them; Like counterfeiting a Commission from the King. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Why was that day made the Sabbath?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God having made the world in six daies space, seeing all Good and very Good, rested in his own complacency; and appointed the seventh day every week to be separated as Holy, to worship and praise him the Great Creator, as his Glorious perfections shine forth in his works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What is meant by Gods resting from his work?</p>

                  </gap>iness therein; but 1. That he finished the Creation; 2. That he was pleased in it as Good: 3. And that he would have it be a day of holy pleasant Rest to man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What is meant by keeping Holy the Sabbath day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Separating it to the Holy Worship and praise of the Creator, and Resting to that end from unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodily labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> What doth the word <hi>[Remember]</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, it is an awakening Caveat to bid us take special care that we break not this Commandement 2. And then that we must prepare before it comes
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60383:150"/>
to avoid the things that would hinder us in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to be fit for it's performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Why is <hi>[Remember]</hi> put before this more than before the rest of the Commandements?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because, 1. Being but of Positive institution, and not naturally known to man, as other duties are, they had need of a positive excitation and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. And 2. It is of great importance to the constant and acceptable worship, and the avoiding of impediments to keep close to the due Time which God hath appointed for it: And to violate it, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Atheistical ungodliness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Why is it called <hi>[The Sabbath of the Lord thy God?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Because 1. God did institute and separate it: 2. And it is separated to the honour and Worship of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> When and how did God institute and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Fundamentally by his own Resting from the work of Creation: But immediately by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to <hi>Adam</hi> his Will for the sanctifying of that day, which is expressed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Some think that the Sabbath was not insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted till man had sinned and Christ was promised, and so God Rested in Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When the text adjoineth it close to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and giveth that only as the reason of it (that God ended his works which he had made, and rested from them,) this is humane, corrupting presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But some think the Sabbath was first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the Wilderness, when they were forbid to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manna?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:60383:151"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not there mentioned as newly instituted, and it is mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. and then insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted with the reason of it, [<hi>And God blessed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and sanctified it, because in it he rested from all his works which God created and made.</hi>] And the same reason is repeated in the Fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> Is this Commandement of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as are the rest?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was more of the Law of Nature to <hi>Adam</hi> than to us; his nature knowing otherwise than ours, both <hi>when</hi> God ended his works, and how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they were before the Curse. It is now of the Law of Nature (that is, known by Natural light without other Revelation.) 1. That God should be worshipped: 2. That Societies should assemble to do it together: 3. That some set Time should be separated statedly to that use: 4. That it should be done with the whole heart, without worldly diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or distractions.</p>
               <p>But I know nothing in Nature alone from whence a man can prove that 1. It must be either just one day in seven, 2. Or just what day of the seven it must be: 3. Nor just what degree of Rest is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. Though reason may discern that one day in seven is a very convenient proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> Are the words [<hi>Six dayes shalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> &amp;c.] a Command, or onely a License?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are not only a License but a Command to man, <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Thes. 4. 11. 2 Thes. 3. 10, 11, 12. Pro. 18. 9. Mat. 25. 26. Rom. 12. 11.</note> to live in an ordinary calling or Lawful course of Labour, according to each ones ability and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60383:151"/>
place, and diligently to exercise it, and not spend time in Idleness: And the ordinary time is here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> Then how can it be lawful to spend any of the week-dayes in Religious Exercises, any more than to spend any part of the Sabbath day in Labour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All Labours are to be done as the Service of God, and as a means to holy and Everlasting ends; and therefore it is implyed still that God be sought and remembred and honoured in all; As our Eating and drinking is our duty, but to be done to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and therefore with the seeking of his blessing and returning him our thanks. <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. 31. 27. Ezek. 16. 41. 1 Tim. 5. 13. Mat. 20. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 16.</hi> But is it lawful then to separate whole dayes either weekly, or monthly, or yearly, to Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, when God hath commanded us to labour on them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As Gods command of Resting on the Sabbath is but the Stating of the <hi>Ordinary Time;</hi> supposing an exception of extraordinary Cases; (as in time of War, of Fire, of dispersing Plagues, of hot Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As Circumcision was omitted in the Wilderness forty years;) so this Command to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour six dayes doth state our ordinary time, but with supposed exception of extraordinary occasions for dayes of Humiliation and Thanksgiving. And all Gods Commands suppose that when two dutyes meet together and cannot both be then done, the greater must ever be preferred: And therefore saving the Life of a Man, or a Beast, yea feeding and watering beasts, labouring in Temple Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to be
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60383:152"/>
preferred before the Rest of the Sabbath: And so when our necessity or profit make Religions exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises more to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r good, and so a greater duty (as Lectures, Fasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) we must preferre them to our ordinary Labour. For as the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath, so were the other dayes. <note n="e" place="bottom">Esth. 9. 26, 28, 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> May not Rich men that have no need, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the six dayes Labour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: if they are able: It is part of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Riches are his gift: And to whom he giveth much, from them he expecteth not less but more: Shall servants work less because they have more wages? It is not only for their own supplyes that God commandeth men to Labour, but also for the publick good, and the benefit or relief of others: and the health of their Bodies, and the suitable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of their minds, and that none of their short precious time be lost in sinful idleness. <note n="f" place="bottom">See Prov. 31. 27, &amp;c.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> But it will seem sordid for Lords, and Knights, and Ladies to labour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is swinish and sinful not to Labour: But they must do it in works that are suitable to their places. As Physicians, School-masters, and Church-Ministers, labour not in the same kind of imployment as Plow-men and Tradesmen do; so Magistrates have their proper Labour in Government, and Rich Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have Families, Children and Servants to oversee, their poor Neighbours and Tenants to visit, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and relieve, and their equals so to converse

with as tendeth to the greatest good: But none must live idly. <note n="g" place="bottom">Ezek. 16. 49.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> Was <hi>Rest</hi> on the Sabbath absolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was alwayes a duty to break it, when a greater duty came in which required it: As Christ hath told the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> in the Case of feeding Man or Beast, healing the sick, and doing such necessary good; For God preferreth Morals before Rituals; and his rule is, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> Why then was bodily Rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That body and mind might be free from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, weariness and distraction, and fit with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure wholly to serve God, in the religious dutyes of his Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> Why doth God mention not only Servants but Beasts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As he would not have Servants enslaved and abused by such Labour as should unfit them for Sabbath-work and Comfort, so he would have man exercise the clemency of his Nature even towards the Brutes: and Beasts cannot labour, but man will be put to some Labour or diversion by it: And God would have the whole place where we dwell, and all that we have to do with, to bear an open significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our obedience to his Command, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his sanctified Day and Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> Is this Commandement now in force to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So much of it materially is in force as is of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60383:153"/>
the Law of Nature, or of Christ by supernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and no more. Therefore the Seventh day Sabbath of Corporal Rest, is changed by Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords day, appointed for Christian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> Was not all that was written in stone of perpetual obligation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: Nor any as such: For as it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on those stones it was the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> for the <hi>Iews,</hi> and bound no other Nations, and is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the dissolving of their Republick and by Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q 24.</hi> How prove you all this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. As <hi>Moses</hi> was Ruler or Mediator to none but the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the words of the Decalogue are appropriate to them as redeemed from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, so the Tables were delivered to no other: and a Law cannot bind any without promulgation. All the world was not bound to send to the <hi>Iews</hi> for Revelation, nor to be their Proselytes.</p>
               <p>2. The Scripture expresly affirmeth the change, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 7, 11. <hi>If the ministration of death writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and engraven in stones was glorious, so that the Children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of</hi> Moses <hi>for the Glory of his Countenance, which was to be</hi> (or is) <hi>done away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if that which is done away was Glorious</hi> (or, <hi>By Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) <hi>much more that which remaineth is Glorious</hi> (or <hi>In glory.</hi>) Here it is evident that it is the Law written on Stone that is mentioned, and that it is not (as some say) the Glory only of <hi>Moses</hi> Face or the flaming mount which is <hi>done away;</hi> (for that was done away in a few dayes;) But it is the Law which is called <hi>Glorious</hi> that is said to be <hi>done</hi> away.

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Doth this Commandement belong to the first Table or the second?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No man knoweth which of the two Tables of Stone it was written in by God: But if we may judge by the Subject, it seemeth to be the Hinge of both, or belong partly to each: As Rulers are Gods Officers, and we obey God in them, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to our duty to God: But as they are Men, it belongs to the second. <note n="a" place="bottom">Pro. 1. 8. &amp; 6. 20. &amp; 23. 22, 25.

               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:60383:158"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Parents are our first Governours before Kings: 2. Their Government is deeplyer founded, even in Nature, and not only in Contract. 3. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents give us our very being, and we are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to them than to any. 4. They have a natural Love to us and we to them: so that they are justly named first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Is it only Parents that are here meant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: All true Governours are included: but so far as the Commandement is part of the Law of Nature, it bindeth us but to natural Rulers <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> to humane Contract and consent, and to those that Rule us by Contract, but consequently. <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3.

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What is the Power of Parents and Rulers which we must obey?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are of various ranks, and Offices; and every ones power in special, is that which belongeth to his own place and Office: But in general, they have power first to command Inferiors to obey Gods Laws: And 2. To command them such undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined things in subordination to Gods Laws which God hath left to their Office to determine of: As Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations make By-Laws by Virtue of the Kings Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> What if Parents or Princes command what God forbids?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must obey God rather than men. <note n="c" place="bottom">Act. 5. 29.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for God never gave them power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his Laws.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> But who shall be Iudge when mens Commands are contrary to Gods? Must Subjects and Children judge?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> While we are Infants naturally uncapable of judging, we are ruled as Bruits by our Parents. But when we grow up to the use of Reason, our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Govern our selves is greater than to be governed by others. <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 14. 1 Ioh. 5. 21. Iude 20, 21. Mar. 13. 9. Prov. 25. 28. &amp; 16. 37. &amp; 9. 12. 2 Tim. 2. 15. 1 Tim. 3. 15. &amp; 4. 7, 15, 16. &amp; 5. 22. &amp; 6. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods Government</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> in order of Nature: <hi>Self-government</hi> is the <hi>next,</hi> though we are not capable of it till we come to some ripeness: A man is nearer to himself than his Parents are, and his happiness or misery depends more on himself than on them: And indeed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens or mens <hi>obedience to others,</hi> is but an act of <hi>self-government.</hi> It is a mans <hi>self-governing</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Will which causeth him to obey another: nor can a Child perform any act of <hi>proper obedience</hi> differing from a Brutes, unless by a <hi>self-governing act.</hi> But Parents Government is the next to Self-government, and the Government of Husbands, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Masters which are by Contract is next to that. Every Subject therefore being first a Subject of God and next a <hi>self-governour,</hi> is to obey as a reasonable Creature, and to understand what is his duty and what not; And because all is our duty which God commandeth, but not all that man Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Gods power being Absolute, and all mens li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, therefore we have nothing to do with the Laws of God but to know them, <hi>and Love them,</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:60383:159"/>
and <hi>obey</hi> them. But as to mans Commands we must know also that they are not contrary to Gods Laws, and that they belong to the Office of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <note n="e" place="bottom">Dan. 3. &amp; 6.</note> If a Parent or Prince command you to blaspheme God, or Worship Idols, or deny Christ, or renounce Heaven, or not to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you must obey God by disobeying him. And if a King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you not to obey your Parents, or will choose for you your Wife, your Dyet, your Physick, the words you shall say to God in your secret Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these are things which belong not to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, no more than to a Captains to become Judge of the Common-pleas. Subjects therefore must judge what they must or must not obey, as Rulers must judge what they must or must not Command: or else they act not as men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> But what Confusion will this Cause, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subject and Child become judge whether their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Parents Commands be lawful? Will they not take all for unlawful which their folly or Corrupt wills dislike, and so cast off all obedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not finding <hi>inconveniencies</hi> in the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of lapsed Mankind that will cure them. Were there any avoiding Errour, Sin and Confusion by Government, some would have found out the way before now. But while man is bad, he will do accordingly. In avoiding these evils we must not run into far greater. Are they not Greater, if men must not discern <hi>who</hi> is their lawful Governour, but must fight for an <hi>Usurper</hi> in Power against his Prince or Parents if Commanded by him? And if every Child and Subject must renounce God, Christ and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60383:160"/>
Heaven, that is Commanded; and men become Gods and Antigods? <note n="f" place="bottom">Isa. 9. 6, 7. Iob 34. 17. Neh. 5. 14. 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> But is there no remedy against both these Confusions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: the remedies are these. 1. Rulers, that should have most reason, must give us the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, by knowing Gods Laws, and taking care that they Command and forbid nothing contrary to them, and not put on Subjects a necessity of disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p>2. Children and Subjects must be instructed also to know the Laws of God, that they may not take that for his Law which is not: It is not keeping them <hi>ignorant</hi> of Gods Laws, lest they pretend them against the Laws of man, that is the way; no more than keeping them ignorant that there is a God, lest they obey him against man.</p>
               <p>3. They must be taught betime the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the capacity of Children and of men at age, and of young unfurnished wits, and those that Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Experience have ripened; and they must be taught the duty of self-suspicion, humility and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and that as Learning is necessary to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so believing our Teachers (with a humane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) is necessary to Learning of them. <note n="g" place="bottom">Eph. 6. 1, 2, 3.</note> Who can learn that will believe nothing which his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er saith? But this is not taking him for Infallible, nor resolving only to be ruled still by his knowledge, but in order to Learn the same Evidence of Truth which our Teachers themselves discern it by. <note n="h" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 21. 1 Thes. 5. 12, 13. 1 Pet. 5. 5. 2 Pet. 2. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:60383:160"/>4. They must be taught to know, that if they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake Gods Laws, and erroneously pretend them against their Rulers, their errour and abuse of the Name of God is their sin, and will not excuse their disobedience: And therefore they must try well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they disobey.</p>
               <p>5. All the Churches near them should agree pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly of all the necessary Articles of Divine Faith and Obedience, that the authority of their Concord may be some awe to the minds both of Commanders and Obeyers.</p>
               <p>6. Rulers are not to suspend the executive part of their Government upon every Consciencious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Child or Subject: If they will pretend Gods Law for intolerable sin or injury, they must nevertheless be restrained by punishment.</p>
               <p>7. But lastly, the Conscience of Subjects duty to God must be tenderly used and encouraged, and their mistakes through infirmity must be tolerated in all tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cases: Some differences and disorders in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice must be born with by them that would not bring in greater. <note n="i" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 1, 2, &amp;c.</note> Gentle reasoning and Loving usage, must cure as much of the rest as will be cured: And our Concord must be placed in the few plain and necessary things: The King hath more wit and clemency than to hang all ignorant, erroneous, faulty Subjects, or else he would have none left to Govern. And if Pastors have not more wit and clemency than to excommunicate all such, they will be no Pastors as having no flocks. But hainous is their sin that can tolerate multitudes of the ignorant and ungodly in their Communion, who will
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60383:161"/>
but be for their power and wealth, and can tolerate none of the Wise and Conscionable if they do but differ from them in tolerable cases, or dislike them. Yet there goeth more to make a tolerable Christian and Church-member, than a tolerable Subject: And <hi>consent</hi> to the Relation is necessary to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What duty doth the Word <hi>[Honour]</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Command?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The first and chief act of <hi>Honouring</hi> them, is to acknowledge their Relation to God as his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Officers, and the Authority which God hath given them, that they may be obeyed reverently, and God in them.</p>
               <p>2. The next is to take all their Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which God hath authorized them to make, to be the Rule of our duty in subordination to Gods Laws, and so far to obey them for Conscience sake, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a sin to resist or disobey them.</p>
               <p>3. Another is to maintain them honourably, so far as we are able and they need: Though parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Children in youth, Children must maintain Parents if they need it, when they come to age; And so must People their Princes and Pastors, and pay Tribute to whom it is due. <note n="k" place="bottom">Mal. 1. 6, 7. Mat. 15. 5, 6. &amp; 21. 30, 31. Eph. 6. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 17. 1 Tim. 5. 17. Rom. 13. 6, 7. Eph. 5. 33. Heb. 12. 9, 2 Sam. 9. 6. 1 King. 1. 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. Also they ought to speak reverently to them, and honourably of them, and not use any unjust dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring Thoughts, Words or Deeds against them, specially which would disable them for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:60383:161"/>5. Lastly they ought to do their best to defend them against injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But seeing <hi>Parents</hi> are named and not Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, must we defend our Parents against our King if he be their Enemy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If their Cause be just, we must defend them by all lawful means; that is, by Prayer to God, by Argument, by Petition to the King, and by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Flight or hiding them: And if a King would ravish or murder your Mother or Wife, you may hold his hands while they escape; as you may do if he would kill himself in Drunkenness or Passion. But you may not on such private accounts raise a War against him, because War is a publick action, and under the Judgment of the publick Governour of the Common-wealth, and not under the Judgment of your Parents or any private person. <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Sam. 19. 11, 12, 13, 17. &amp; 19. 1, 4, 7. &amp; 20. 16, 30, 42. &amp; 14. 44, 45.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> But if the King Command me one thing and my Parents another, which of them must I prefer in my obedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Each of them have their proper Office, in which they must be preferred and obeyed: Your Mother must be obeyed before the King, in telling you when to Suck or Eat. Your Parents must be obeyed before the King, in matters proper to Family-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as what daily Food you shall eat, and what daily work for them you shall do, and what Wife to choose, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the King is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before your Parents in all matters belonging to <hi>National</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> But what if it be about <hi>Religious</hi> acts, as what
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60383:162"/>
                  <hi>Pastor</hi> I shall choose; What Church I shall joyn with; how I shall spend the Lords day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Must I prefer the <hi>King</hi> or my <hi>Parents</hi> in my Obedience?</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Supposing it to be in the Fathers power, it is a duty to leave them no more than will maintain their lives in temperance: For all men are Gods Stewards and must be accountable for all that he doth trust them with: And they ought not to give it to be the fewel of Lust and Sin, when they have reason to believe that it will be so used: That were to give Gods Mercies to the Devil, to be turn'd against him. Nor are Parents bound to give those Children the <hi>necessary maintenance</hi> for their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> or any thing at all, who by <hi>obstinate rebellion utterly forfeit it:</hi> Nature is not so strong a bond, but that some sin may dissolve it, and forfeit Life it self, and therefore forfeit fatherly maintenance.

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is supposed that the Parents have tryed to the utmost of their Power: And Parents cannot judge of what unlikelihoods God may bring to pass when they are dead. If God change them, God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them: If Parents have any hope, they may

                  <hi>Q. 29.</hi> But what if a Son be not deboist, but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; But be of a Corrupt understanding, inclined to ill Opinions, and averse to serious Piety, and like to use his Estate to the hurt of the Church or Common-wealth? What shall Parents do by such?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The publick Interest is to be preferred before a Sons: If Parents have good hopes that such a Son may do more good than harm with his Estate, they must trust him as far as Reason requireth, rather than to trust a Stranger. But if they have reason to believe that he will do more harm than good with it, they should settle it in trust to do all that good which he should do, and not leave it to do hurt, if it be in their Power; Allowing him necessary maintenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 30.</hi> Should not Parents leave all their Estates to their Children? Or what proporion must they give them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Nature makes Children so near their Parents, that no doubt they must be specially careful of their Corporal and Spiritual welfare above others: And the <hi>Israelites</hi> being tyed to keep their Possessions in their Families and Line, were under an extraordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in this matter. But to all Christians the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of God and the Common good is the Chief, and to be preferred: <note n="y" place="bottom">Act. 4. &amp; 5. 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 4. 2. 1 Pet. 4. 10.

Luk. 19. 8.</note> They that all Sold their possessions, and laid down the Money at the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles feer, did not scruple alienating them from their Heirs.

But if not, they should secure a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for good Works.</p>
               <p>And however all men should in their Life do all the good that regularly they can do: For who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that his Son should do that good with his Estate, which he had not a Heart to do himself?

A carnal Selfish man doth live to his Flesh and Carnal Self, for which he gathers all that he can get: And when he must needs dye and can no longer enjoy it, he takes his Children to be as parts of himself, and what they have he thinks he almost hath himself: And so out of meer Self-love doth Love them and enrich them. But a Holy person thinks all is Gods, and that it is best used which is best improved to his Will and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But Alas, what have Selfish carnal worldlings to account for? When the best they can say of the use of Gods talents, is, that they pampered the flesh with as much as it craved, and the rest they gave their Children to make them rich, that their Flesh also might be pampered, and their lust might want no fewel or provision, nor their Souls want temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hundreds or Thousands given to Daughters, and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60383:167"/>
Lands purchased for their Sons, and now and then a Farthing or a Penny given to the Poor. And though the Hypocrites take on them to believe Christ, that it's harder for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God, than for a Camel to go through a Needle's eye, yet they live as if nothing were the desire and business of their lives, but to make their own and their Childrens Salvation by Riches thus next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. <note n="z" place="bottom">Psal. 49. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Nature and Scripture tell us of some preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the eldest: This Birthright <hi>Iacob</hi> thought worth the buying of <hi>Esau:</hi> Christ is called the <hi>First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of every Creature,</hi> because the first-born have the preeminence of Rule, Wealth and Honour: And the heavenly Society are called <hi>The general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the first-born whose Names are enrolled in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Heb. 12. Because they are in Honour and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er above others. But yet, 1. The Younger also are Sons, and must have their part: And it pleased God to leave on record how oft he hath preferred the Younger: Even an <hi>Abel</hi> before <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Seth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Seniors; a <hi>Sem</hi> before <hi>Iaphet</hi> and <hi>Cham: Isaac</hi> before <hi>Ishmael; Iacob</hi> before <hi>Esau: David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> before their Elder Brethren.</p>
               <p>2. But to the faithful, though Nature be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, yet Grace teacheth us what to prefer. And Christ and his members are dearer to us than our Sons or natural members. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 21. Mar. 10. 21. Luk. 12. 33. &amp; 18. 22.</note> In cases where

we must deny our selves for Christ and the publick good, we may also deny our natural Kindred; For they are not nearer to us than our selves. And if an eldest Son be wicked or unprofitable, a believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent should give him the less, and more to a younger (yea to a Stranger) that will do more service to God and his Countrey; and not prefer a fleshly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and priviledge, before a Spiritual and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Service.</p>

               <p>III. Another sort of hainous Murder is, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:60383:172"/>IV. Another is when Princes destroy their own Subjects whom by Office they are bound to protect, or Subjects their Princes, whom they are bound to obey, and defend, and honour.</p>
               <p>V. Another sort of hainous Murder, is when it is committed on pretence of Justice, by <hi>Perjured Witnesses, false Accusers,</hi> or <hi>false Iudges</hi> or <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">1 King. 25. 19.</note> As <hi>Naboth</hi> was murdered by <hi>Iezebel</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and Christ by the <hi>Iews</hi> upon false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of Blasphemy and Treason. For in this case the Murder is fathered on <hi>God</hi> and on <hi>Iustice</hi> which most abhorre it, and the best things which should preserve the peace of the Innocent, are used to the worst ends, even to destroy them: And a man hath no defence for himself, as he may have against Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers or open Enemies; and he is destroyed by those that are bound to defend him: And the most devilish wicked Perjured men are made the Masters of mens Lives, and may conquer Subjects by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Law.</p>
               <p>VI. One of the most hainous crimes is <hi>soul-murder:</hi> which is done by all that draw or drive men into sin, or from their duty to God and the care of their Salvation: either by seducing false Opinions, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing necessary Truth and Duty, or by scorns, or threats. But none here sin so grievously as <hi>wicked Rulers,</hi> and <hi>wicked Teachers</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Churches: Others kill Souls by one and one, but these by hundreds and thousands: And therefore it is the Devils main endeavour through the World, to get Rulers and Teachers on his side, and turn the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> against him that did ordain them.

When the <hi>Turks</hi> had once conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Eastern Empire, how quickly did those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches and large Nations forsake Christ, and turn to the grossest of Deceivers! O how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Souls have been since hereby destroyed! And what wicked deceitful, and contentious Teachers have done to the murdering of Souls, alas! the whole Christian World is witness. Some by Heresie, and some by Proud Tyranny, and some by malignant opposition to the serious practice of that holy Law of God which they preach; and some by Ignorance, and some by slothful treacherous negligence, and some by Church-divisions, by their Snares, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiousness.

               <p>VII.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All unlawful carnal Copulation, and every evil inclination, or action or omssion which tendeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or partaketh of any degree of unchastity or Pollution.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> Is all lust or inclination to Generation a Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: For 1. Some is natural to man, and that not as corrupt; But as God said, <hi>Increase and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> before the Fall, so no doubt he inclined Nature thereto. <note n="a" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 4. Gen. 1. 22, 28. &amp; 9. 7. &amp; 22. 17. &amp; 26. 4, 24.</note> 2. And the regular propagation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is one of the noblest natural works that man is instrumental in: A Man being a more excellent thing than a house or any Work of art. 3. And God hath put some such inclination into Nature, in great Wisdom and Mercy to the world: For if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not some considerable appetite to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and also strong desire of Posterity, Men would hardly be drawn to be at so much care, cost and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60383:175"/>
to propagate Mankind, but specially Women would not so commonly submit to all their sickness, pain, danger and after-trouble which now they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. But if a few self-denying persons did propagate Mankind only as an act of obedience to God, the multitude of the ungodly would not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> If it be so, why is any carnal acts of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration forbidden? specially when it is an act of Love, and doth no body any harm?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God hath in great Wisdom and Mercy to man made his Laws for restraining men from inordinate Lust and Copulation.</p>
               <p>1. The noblest things are basest when Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Devils are worse than men because they were higher and better before. A wicked man is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably worse and more miserable than a Beast or a Toad, because he is a nobler nature depraved. And so humane Generation is worse than that of Swine or Dogs when it is vicious.</p>
               <p>2. Promiscuous unregulated Generation tends to the utter ruin and vitiating of Mankind, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the just Education of Children, on which the welfare of Mankind doth eminently depend. Alas, all care and order is little enough and too little to keep corrupted Nature from utter Beastiality and malignity; much more to make Youth wise and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, without which it had been better never to have been born: When Fathers know their own Children, and when Mothers have the love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Houshold-advantage of order which is necessary, some good may be done. But law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less exercise of Lust will frustrate all. 1. Women themselves will be Slaves, or their advantage muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uncertain: For such Lust will serve its turn
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60383:176"/>
of them but for Novelty, and will be still for change; And when a younger or a fairer comes, the Mother is cast off and hated: <note n="b" place="bottom">Act. 15. 20, 29. Rom. 1. 29, 30. 1 Cor. 6. 13, 18. &amp; 7. 2. &amp; 10. 8. Gal. 5. 19. Eph. 5. 3. 4. Col. 3. 5. 1 Thes. 4. 3. Rev. 2. 14, 20. Mat. 15. 19. 1 Cor. 5. 11. Heb. 12. 16.</note> And then the next will hate her Children, or at least not love them as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Education doth require. And when the Father hath forsaken the Mother, it's like he will forsake the Children with her. And when Womens lusts are lawless as well as Mens, men being uncertain what Children are their own, will be regardless both of their Souls and Bodies: So that Confusion would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Religion and Civility, and make the World worse than most of the <hi>American Savages</hi> are, who are taught by nature to set bounds to lust.</p>
               <p>And besides all this, the very Lust it self thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by lawless liberty would so corrupt mens Minds, and Fantasies and Affections into a sordid beastly Sensuality, that it would utterly indispose them to all spiritual and heavenly yea and manly employments of Heart and Life; men will grow sottish and stupid, unfit to consider of Heavenly things, and uncapable of Holy pleasures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But if these evil consequents be all, then a man that can moderately use Fornication so as shall avoid these evils, sinneth not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sin is the breach of Gods Law: These mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that would follow lawless lust, shew you that God made this Law for the welfare of Mankind: But Gods own Wisdom and Will is the Original reason of his Law, and must satisfie all the World. But
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60383:176"/>
were there none but this forementioned, to avoid the Worlds confusion and ruine, it was needful that God set a Law to Lust: And when this is done for the Common good, it is not lest to man to break Gods Law whenever he thinks he can avoid the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and secure the end of the Law. For if men be left to such liberty as to judge when they may keep Gods Law and when they may break it, lust will alwayes find a reason to excuse it, and the Law will be in vain. The World needed a regulating Law: and Gods Law must not be broken.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Which are the most hainous sorts of filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some of them are scarce to be named among Christians: 1. Sodomy: 2. Copulation with Bruits. 3. Incest; sinning thus with near kindred: 4. Rapes or forcing Women. But the commonest sorts are Adultery, Fornication, self-Pollution and the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the thoughts and affections, and the words and actions which partake of the Pollution. <note n="c" place="bottom">Gen. 18. 1 Cor. 5.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Besides the foresaid evils that are Common to it and Fornication, it is a perfidious violation of the Marriage Covenant, and destroyes the conjugal Love of Husband and Wife, and confoundeth Progeny, and as is aforesaid corrupteth Family order and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Education. <note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 32. &amp; 19. 6.

And (that we may not think worse of them than they were) as God hath taught the very Bruits to use Copulation no ofter than is necessary to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, so it is probable by many passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it was so ordinarily then with men; and consequently that they that had many Wives used them not so often as now too many do one, and did not multiply Wives so much for Lust as for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny. <note n="e" place="bottom">Gen. 29. 30, 34. &amp; 30. 15. 18. 20.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, in Case of necessitating Lust: But such a measure of Lust is to be accounted inordinate, either as sin or a disease; and not to be causlesly indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; though this remedy be allowed it. <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. 7. 9.</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. No man can either dispense with Gods Laws, or forgive sin against them, but God himself. If he <hi>forbear</hi> men in a sin, that doth not justifie it. 2.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: Secret consent makes a Marriage before God, though not before the World: and the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is Adultery before God.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> May not a man put away his Wife, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her, if she seek his death, or if she prove ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly intolerable?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The publick good is a higher end of all mens worldly Interests and Actions than their own: And when the Example would encourage unlawful

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If his taking will by encouraging Thieves do the Common-wealth more hurt than his Life will do good, he is bound rather to die than Steal. But I dare not say that it is so where all these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conditions concurre: 1. If it be so small a thing as is meerly to save Life (as God allowed the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said taking of Fruit and Corn.) 2. If you have first tryed all other Means, as Begging or seeking to the Magistrate. 3. If by the Secresie, or by the Effect, it be no hurt to the Common-wealth but good: As for instance, If to save life one take an Apple from a Tree of him that is unwilling; or eat Pease or Corn in the Field: If Children have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that would famish them: If a company in a Ship should lose all their Provision save one mans, and he have enough for them all, and would give them none; I think the Law of Nature alloweth them to take as much as will save their Lives, against his will. If <hi>David</hi> the Lords Anointed and his six hundred men want Bread, they think they may take it from a churlish <hi>Nabal.</hi>

The Common-wealths right in every Subjects Estate is greater than his own, as

                  <hi>A.</hi> No, unless as aforesaid meerly to save Life. If Children have hard Parents they must patiently bear it: If Servants have hard Masters, they may leave them, or seek Remedy of the Magistrate for that which they are unable to bear. But the World must not be taught to invade other mens Property, and be Judges of it themselves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not without the Magistrate, who is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of common Order and Peace, when your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it would break that Order; and such liberty would encourage Robbery. If you take it, you sin not against his Right, but you sin against the greater Right and Peace of the Common-wealth.</p>

But if a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate wager be laid, only to be a penalty to the loser for being Confident in some untruth, it's just to take his wager as a penalty, and give it to the Poor.

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That you give the true worth, that is, the Market-price for what you buy, and desire not to have it cheaper, unless it be of a rich man that aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you the price in kindness or Charity, or one that having bought it Cheaper can afford to sell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. <note n="c" place="bottom">Lev. 25. 14.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60383:184"/>
than to others, or one that in liberality will give you more.</p>
               <p>2. That you do as you would be done by, if you were in the same circumstances with the other; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing your own desires just.</p>
               <p>3. That you work not on the ignorance or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of another, to get more or take less than the worth.</p>
               <p>4. And therefore that you deceive him not by hiding the fault of what you sell, nor by any false words or wiles.</p>
               <p>5. That if a man be overseen, you hold him not to his bargain to his loss, if you can release it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a greater loss. Yet that you stand to your own word to him if he will not discharge you. More I omit. <note n="d" place="bottom">Amos 8. 6.</note>

                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> Is it lawful to take Usury, or gain for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The great difference of mens judgments about Usury, should make all the more Cautelous to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on none that is truly doubtful. I shall give my Judgment in some Conclusions.</p>
               <p>1. It is evident that Usury of other things as well as of Money was forbidden the <hi>Iews, Deut.</hi> 23. 19, 20. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 36, 37. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 25. And by Usury is meant any thing more than was lent taken for the use of it.</p>
               <p>2. It is manifest the word [<hi>Nesheck</hi>] fignifying <hi>biting,</hi> Usury, that it is unmerciful hurting another that is here meant.</p>
               <p>3. It is manifest that it was to the <hi>Poor</hi> that this manner of lending was not to be used: And that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60383:184"/>
only to a Brother or <hi>Israclite,</hi> who also might not be bought as a forced Servant; But to a Stranger it was lawful.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Israelites</hi> then used no Merchandize, or Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Selling for gain. They lived on Flocks, Herds and Vineyards and Figtrees. So that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking usury of any thing that was lent to the needy, when Charity bound them to relieve them by lending, that is here meant.</p>
               <p>5. To exact the Principal or thing lent was as truly forbidden, when the Poor could not pay it: And so it was to deny to give him freely in his need.</p>
               <p>6. All this plainly sheweth that this supposeth a case in which one is bound to use Mercy to another in want, and that it is meer unmercifulness that is here forbidden.</p>
               <p>7. The Law described the sin, and the Prophets when they speak against Usury do but name it; making no new Law, but supposing it described in the Law before.</p>
               <p>8. The Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as such bound not the rest of the World, nor bindeth Christians now, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>9. Therefore there is no Usury forbidden but what is against the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Supernatural Revelation of Christ</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. The Law of Nature and of Christ forbid all <hi>Unjustice</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableness,</hi> and therefore all <hi>Usury which</hi> is against <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi> Every man must in Trading, lending and giving keep the two Grand precepts; [<hi>Do as you would</hi> (justly) <hi>be done by</hi>] and [<hi>Love your Neighbours as your selves.</hi>]</p>
               <p>11. To take more for the Use than the <hi>use of the Money, Horse, Goods</hi> or any thing was <hi>really worth</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:60383:185"/>
to the <hi>User,</hi> is injustice. And to take either <hi>Use</hi> or Principal when it will do more hurt to him that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, than it is like to do good to our selves or any other to whom we are more obliged, is contrary to <hi>Charity:</hi> And so it is, <hi>Not to Give where we are obliged to give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. Merchandize or Trading by buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for gain is real <hi>Usury.</hi> They that lay out Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on goods, and sell them for more than they gave for them, do take use or increase for their Money of the buyer: which was forbidden the <hi>Israeliets</hi> to Poor Brethren. And it is all one to make a Poor man pay one Shilling in the Pound for the use of the Money to buy Cloth with, as to make him pay one Shilling more than was paid for the cloth. And if a Draper be bound to lend a Poor man money to buy Cloth without use, he is as much bound to sell him Cloth without gain.</p>
               <p>13. Merchandize or Trading for gain is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, being used without <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. Every one that hath Money is not bound to lend it at all: And not to lend it at all, is as much against the good of some borrowers, as to lend it and take but what the use of it was worth to them.</p>
               <p>15. No more must be taken for Use, than the User had real Profit by it; unless it be when the Rich are willing to pay more, or run the hazard, or what a man loseth by one bargain he gets by another. <note n="e" place="bottom">Deu. 23. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>16. Some Usury is an Act of great Charity: <hi>viz.</hi> A Landlord offereth to sell his Tenant his Land for
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60383:185"/>
much less than the worth: The Tenant hath not Money to buy it: A Rich Neighbour told him [<hi>The Land is also offered to me; but if you will, I will lend you Money on use to buy it, and pay me when you can.</hi>] It was Wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Land: The Tenant borrows the Money; and in two years sells the Wood which paid it all, and had the Land for almost nothing. Was not this charitable Usury. <note n="f" place="bottom">Mat. 25. 27. Luk. 19. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I knew a worthy Person that trading in Iron works, did partly for himself and partly in Charity, take to Use the Moneys of many honest mean people, that knew not else how to live or to use it; and from a small Estate he grew to purchase at least Seven thousand pound <hi>per Annum</hi> to himself and his Sons; was there any uncharitableness in this Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? <note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. 22. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>17. It is great uncharitableness in some, not to give use for Money, and Cruelty to set it out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out use: As when poor Orphans are left with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little Money to maintain them, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Poor Widdows that have a little Money, and no trade to use it in, and must beg if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently spend the stock; If they lend it the Rich or those that gain by it in trading, the gainers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful if they pay not use for it, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.</p>
               <p>18. They that say, we must not lend to make men rich, but only to the needy, do put down all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trading: And forbid most young men to marry: For that which will maintain a single man plentifully, will not maintain a Wife and Children, and provide
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60383:186"/>
them necessary Portions: And if he must not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to grow richer than he is, how shall he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, who had but enough for himself before? And how shall he be able to relieve the Poor, or do any such good works, if he may not endeavour to grow richer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> If a Merchant find that it's usual to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Custom-house, or poor men think Chimney-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or other Legal Taxes to be an Oppression, may they not by Concealment save what they can?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: The Law hath given it the King, if you like not to be his Subjects on the Terms of the Law, remove into another Land; If you cannot, you must patiently suffer here: It is no more lawful to rob the King than to rob another man.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Which are the divers degrees of Lying or Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable false speaking?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. One is <hi>privative;</hi> When men falsly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things by <hi>Diminutive</hi> Expressions: Things may be falsly represented by <hi>defective</hi> as well as by <hi>Excessive</hi> speeches: He that speaks of God, and Heaven and Holiness faintly as Good, saith a <hi>graminatical truth:</hi> But if he speak not of them as <hi>Best</hi> or <hi>Excellent,</hi> it is Morally a false Expression through defect. He that saith Coldly, To <hi>Murder,</hi> to be <hi>Perjured,</hi> to <hi>Silence</hi> Christs <hi>Ministers unjustly, is not well,</hi> as <hi>Eli</hi> said of his Sons Wickedness; or only saith, [I <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justifie it,</hi>] or [<hi>It's hard to justifie it</hi>] saith a Grammatical Truth, but a <hi>Moral falshood</hi> by the extenuating words, as if he would perswade the hearer to think it some small or doubtful matter, and so to be impenitent.</p>
               <p>2. He that speaketh falsly through <hi>rashness, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,</hi> neglect of just Information, or any ignorance which is Culpable, is guilty of some degree of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But he that knowingly speaketh falsly, is a Lyar in a higher degree.</p>
               <p>3. He that by <hi>Culpable forgetfulness</hi> speaks falsly, is to be blamed: But he that <hi>Remembreth</hi> and <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth</hi> it, much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:60383:192"/>4. He that lyeth in a <hi>small matter</hi> which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to hurt but perhaps to profit the Hearer, is to be blamed: But he that lyeth in <hi>great</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to the great hurt of others, much more.</p>
               <p>5. He that speaketh either contrary to <hi>his Mind,</hi> or contrary to the <hi>Matter</hi> culpably, lyeth. But he that speaketh both contrary to his <hi>Mind</hi> and the <hi>Matter,</hi> lyeth worse.</p>
               <p>6. He that by <hi>Equivocation</hi> useth <hi>unapt</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable expressions,</hi> to deceive him that will misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them, is to be blamed: But he that will stand openly bold-faced in a Lie, much more.</p>
               <p>7. It is sin to speak Untruths of <hi>our own,</hi> which we might avoid: But it's much worse to <hi>father them on God</hi> or the Holy <hi>Scripture.</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 15. 1 Ioh. 5. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>8. It is sin by falshood to <hi>deceive one,</hi> but much more to deceive <hi>multitudes,</hi> even whole Assemblies or Countreys.</p>
               <p>9. It is sin in a <hi>private</hi> man to Lie to another about small things: But much more hainous for a <hi>Ruler,</hi> or a <hi>Preacher,</hi> to deceive multitudes even in matters of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. It is a sin <hi>rashly</hi> to <hi>drop</hi> a falshood: But much greater to <hi>write Books</hi> or <hi>dispute</hi> for it, and <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> it.</p>
               <p>11. It is a sin to Lie from a <hi>good intent:</hi> But much more out of <hi>envy, malice</hi> or <hi>malignity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. It is a sin to lie in private Talk: But much more to lie to a Magistrate or Judge who hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us.</p>
               <p>13. It is a sin to <hi>assert</hi> an Untruth as aforesaid:
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60383:192"/>
But much greater to <hi>swear</hi> it, or offer it to God in our <hi>Profession</hi> or <hi>Vows.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Is all Deceiving of another a sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: There is great difference, 1. Between deceiving one that I am bound to inform, and one that I am not bound to inform: 2. And between de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving one to his <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>harmlesly,</hi> and to his hurt and injury: 3. And between deceiving him by <hi>just means,</hi> and by <hi>unjust forbidden</hi> means.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. I am under no Obligation to inform a Robber or an usurping Persecutor as such. But to others I may be obliged to open the Truth.</item>
                  <item>II. I may deceive a Patient or Child to profit him, when I may not do it to hurt him.</item>
                  <item>III. I may deceive such as I am not bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, by my <hi>silence,</hi> or my <hi>looks,</hi> or <hi>gestures,</hi> which I suppose he will misunderstand, when I may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him by a Lie.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Is it not all one to deceive one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: 1. I am not bound to open my Mind to all men: What right hath a Thief to know my Goods or Heart? or a Persecutor to know where I hide my self?</p>
               <p>2. But I have before largely shewed you, that <hi>Lying</hi> is so great an evil against <hi>common Trust</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> in the World, as is not to be used for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Commodity or Safety.</p>
               <p>3. And other Signs, Looks and gestures being not appointed for the natural and common Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mind, are more left to humane Liberty and Prudence, to use for Lawful ends. As Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. made by his motion, as if he would have gone further: And even by words about <hi>Caesars</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60383:193"/>
and other Cases, concealed his Mind, and oft denyed the <hi>Pharisees</hi> a resolution of Questions which they put to him. Stratagems in a Lawful War are lawful, when by actual shews and seemings an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> But the Scriptures mention many Instances of Equivocation and flat Lying, in the Egyptian Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, in <hi>Rahab,</hi> in <hi>David</hi> and many others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, and some of them with great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reward, <hi>Heb. 11?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is <hi>Gods Law</hi> that tells us what's Sin and Duty, when the History oft tells us but what <hi>was done,</hi> and not how far it was <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is not the <hi>Lie</hi> that is commended in the Midwives and <hi>Rahab,</hi> but their Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>3. That which God <hi>pardoneth</hi> (as he did <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> and <hi>rash Divorce</hi>) to Godly men that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the main, and specially such as knew it not to be sin, is not thereby <hi>justified;</hi> nor will it be so easily <hi>pardoned to us,</hi> who live in the clearer Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But when the Scripture saith, that <hi>All men are Lyars,</hi> and sad Experience seemeth to confirm it, what credit do we owe to Men, and what certainty is there of any History?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> History (by Writing or Verbal Tradition) is of so great use to the World, that Satan maketh it a chief part of his work, as he is the Deceiver and Enemy of Mankind, to corrupt it. And false Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a most hainous sin, and dangerous S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are, by which the great Deceiver keeps up his Kingdom in the World. Heathenism, Mahometanism, Popery, Heresie, and Malignity and Persecution, are all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60383:193"/>
by false Tradition and History. Therefore we must not be too hasty or confident in Believing Man: And yet denying just Belief will be our sin and great loss.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> How then shall we know what and whom to believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We must believe no men that speak against <hi>God</hi> or his Word: For we are sure that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie: And the Scripture is his infallibly Sealed Word.</p>
               <p>2. We must believe none that speak against the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> and common Notices of all Mankind: for that were to renounce Humanity: And the Law of Nature is Gods first Law. But it is not the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Nature as depraved which is this Law.</p>
               <p>3. We must believe no men against the common Senses of Mankind, exercised on their duely qualified Objects. Faith <hi>contradicteth</hi> not common Sense, though it goe <hi>above it.</hi> We are Men before we are Christians; and Sense and Reason are presupposed to Faith: The Doctrine which saith, <hi>There is no Bread nor Wine</hi> after Consecration in the Sacrament, doth give the lie to the Eyes, Taste and Feeling, and intellectual Perception of all sound men, and therefore not to be believed: For if Sense be not to be trusted, we know not that there is a Church, or a <hi>Man,</hi> or a <hi>Bible</hi> or any thing in the World, and so nothing can be believed. Whether all sound Senses may be deceived or not, God hath given us no surer way of certainty.</p>
               <p>4. Nothing is to be believed against the certain Interest of all Mankind, and tending to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; That which would damn Souls, or deny their Immortality and future Hope, or ruine the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:60383:194"/>
Christian World or Nations, is not to be believed to be duty or lawfull: For <hi>Truth</hi> is for <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> is for <hi>Felicity;</hi> and no man is bound to such destructive things. <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Ioh. 4. 1, 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. Nothing is to be believed as absolutely certain, which depends on the <hi>meer honesty</hi> of the Speakers: For all men are liable to mistake or lie.</p>
               <p>6. The more Ignorant, malicious, unconscionable, factious, siding, any man is, the less credible he is. And the wiser and nearer to the action any man is, and the more conscionable, peaceable and impartial he is, the more credible he is. An Enemy speaking well of a man, is so far more credible than a Friend: Multitudes, as capable and honest, are more credible than one.</p>
               <p>7. As that Certainty which is called <hi>Morall,</hi> as depending on mens <hi>Free-will,</hi> is never absolute, but hath many degrees, as the witness is more or less credible; so there is a Certainty by mens Report, Tradition or History which is <hi>Physical</hi> and wholly <hi>infallible:</hi> As that there is such a place as <hi>Rome, Paris,</hi> &amp;c. and that the Statutes of the Land were made by such Kings and Parliaments to whom they are ascribed; and that there have been such Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For proof of which know, 1. That besides the <hi>free acts,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> hath some acts as <hi>necessary</hi> as it is to the <hi>Fire to burn,</hi> viz. To Love our selves and Felicity, and more such. 2. That when all men of contrary Interest, Friends and Foes, agree in a matter that hath sensible Evidence, it is the Effect of such a <hi>Necessitating Cause.</hi> 3. And there is no Cause in Nature that can make them so agree in a
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60383:194"/>
lie. Therefore it is a Natural Certainty. Look back <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But God hath made us Individual persons, with so peculiar a Self-love, that no man can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly love another as himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. You must distinguish between <hi>sensitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Love, and <hi>Rational</hi> Love. 2. And between <hi>Corrupt,</hi> and <hi>Sanctified</hi> Nature.</p>
               <p>1. Natural Sensitive Love is stronger to ones <hi>Self,</hi> that is, (more <hi>sensible</hi> of <hi>self-interest</hi>) than to all the World. I <hi>feel</hi> not anothers Pain or Pleasure, in it self. I hunger and thirst for my self: A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath that Natural Sensitive Love to her own Child (like that of Bruits) which she hath not for any other. <note n="e" place="bottom">Prov. 14. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. Rational Love valueth and loveth, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60383:197"/>
every thing according to the degree of its amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, that is, it's <hi>Goodness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Rational Love destroyeth not Sensitive; but it <hi>Moderateth</hi> and <hi>Ruleth</hi> it, and Commandeth the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> to <hi>preferre</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> and seek and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in higher things, (as Reason ruleth Appetite, and the Rider the Horse;) and to deny and forsake all carnal or private Interests, that stand against a greater good.</p>
               <p>4. Common Reason tells a man, that it's an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable thing in him that would not dye to save a Kingdom; Much more that when he is to love both himself and the Kingdom inseparably, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Love a Kingdom, yea or more excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, above himself. But yet it is Sanctification that must Effectually overcome inordinate self-Love, and clearly illuminate this Reason, and make a man obey it.<note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 33. Tit. 1. 8. Iam. 3. 15, 17. Col. 1. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>5. To conquer this <hi>Selfishness</hi> is the summe of all Mortification, and the greatest Victory in this World: And therefore it is here perfectly done by none: but it's done most where there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Love to God, and to the Church and publick good, and to our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> What is the sinfulness and the hurt of <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is a Fundamental Errour and Blindness in the Judgment: We are so many Poor Worms and little things; And if an Ant or Worm had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, should it think it's Life or Ease or other interest
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:60383:197"/>
more valuable than a Mans, or than all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys?</p>
               <p>2. It is a fundamental Pravity and disorder of <hi>Mans Will:</hi> It is made to <hi>Love Good</hi> as <hi>Good,</hi> and therefore to Love most the greatest good.</p>
               <p>3. Yea it blindly casteth down and trampleth on all Good in the World which is above <hi>self-interest.</hi> For this prevailing Selfishness taketh a mans <hi>self</hi> for his ultimate end, and all things else but as <hi>means</hi> to his own Interest: God and Heaven and all Societies and all Virtue, seem no further Good to him than they are for his own good and welfare. And Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness so overcometh Reason in some, as to make them dispute for this fundamental Errour as a Truth, That there is nothing to be accounted <hi>Good by me,</hi> but that which is <hi>Good to me</hi> as <hi>my interest</hi> or <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:</hi> And so that which is Good to others, is not therefore Good to me.<note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. 3. 5. &amp; 20. 6. &amp; 23. 4. &amp; 25. 27. &amp; 26. 5, 12, 16. &amp; 27. 2. &amp; 28. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. And thus it blasphemously deposeth God in the Mind of the sinner; making him no further Good to us, than as he is a means to our <hi>Good;</hi> and so he is set quite below our selves: As if he had not made us for Himself, and to Love him as God, for his own Goodness.</p>
               <p>5. I told you before (of the First Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) how this maketh every man his own Idol, to be Loved above God.</p>
               <p>6. Yea, that the <hi>Selfish</hi> would be the Idols of the World, and have all men conformed to their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Wills and Words.</p>
               <p>7. A Selfish man is an Enemy to the publick Peace
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60383:198"/>
of all Societies, and of all true Unity and Concord: For whereas Holy persons as such have all one Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Law and End, even God and his Will, the Selfish have as many <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Centers</hi> and Laws as they are persons. So that while every one would have his <hi>own Interest, Will</hi> and <hi>Lust</hi> to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rule and Center, it is by the wonderful over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Power of God, that any order is kept up in the World; and because when they cannot be all Kings, they agree to make that use of Kings which they think will serve <hi>their Interest</hi> best.</p>
               <p>8. A Selfish man so far can be no true Friend: For he loveth his Friend but as a Dog doth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for his own Ends.</p>
               <p>9. A Selfish Person is so far <hi>untrusty,</hi> and so false in Converse and all Relations: For he chooseth and changeth and useth all, as he thinks his own interest requireth. If he be a Tradesman, believe him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his interest binds him: If he be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he will be for that Doctrine and Practice which is for his Carnal Interest: If he be a Ruler, wo to his Inferiours. And therefore it is the highest point in policy, next Conscience and Common Obedience to God, to contrive if possible so to twist the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Princes and People, that both may feel tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What is it that maketh the <hi>Love</hi> of others so great a duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is but to <hi>Love God,</hi> his <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Image in others.</hi> No man hath seen God: But rational Souls, and specially <hi>Holy ones</hi> are his <hi>Image,</hi> in which we must see and Love him. And there is no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duty than to Love God.</p>
               <p>2. Love maketh us meet and useful members in all Societies, especially in the Church of God. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all to love the Common good above their own.</p>
               <p>3. It maketh all men use their utmost power for the good of all that need them.</p>

It overcometh Temptations to hurtfulness and division: It teacheth men patiently to bear and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear: It is the greatest keeper of Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. As one Soul uniteth all parts of the Body, one Spirit of Love uniteth all true Believers. It is the Cement of Individuals; the vital healing Balsom which doth more than Art to cure our Wounds. <note n="o" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12. Eph. 4. 1, 2, 3, 16.

Love is the delight of Life, when it is mutual and is not disappointed: what abundance of Fears, and Cares and Passions, and Law-suit's would it End?

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> Is there any hope that Love should reign on Earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is hope that all the Sound Believers should increase in Love, and get more victory over <hi>Selfishness:</hi> For they have all that Spirit of Love, and obey Christs last and great Command, and are taught of God to Love one another; yea they dwell in Love, and so in God, and God in them; and it will grow up to Perfection.</p>
               <p>But I know of no hope that the Malignant Seed of <hi>Cain</hi> should cease the hating of them that are the Holy seed; save as Grace converteth any of them to God: Of any Common or universal Reign of Love, I see no Prognosticks of it in Rulers, in Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or any others in the World: Prophesies are dark: But my greatest hope is fetcht from the three first Petitions of the Lords Prayer, which are not to be put up in Vain.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> What should we do towards the increase of Love?</p>
               <p>

               <p>3. Do hurt to none but by necessary Justice or defence: And do as much good as you can to all.</p>
               <p>4. Praise all that is good in men, and mention not the Evil without necessity.</p>
               <p>5. Do all that you can to make men Holy, and winne them to the Love of God; And then they will Love each other by his Spirit and for his sake.<note place="bottom">(r) Iam. 2. 8.</note>

Do all that you can to draw men from sinfull worldly Love: For that Love of the World which is Enmity to God, is also Enmity to the love of one another. Further than you can draw men to center in Christ and in holy Love, there is no hope of true Love to others.</p>
               <p>7. Patiently suffer wrongs rather than provoke men to hate you by unnecessary seeking your right or revenge.</p>

and great. The Chains of Sinners are strong: and God useth to work according to the suitableness of means. Great abilities are requisite to all this: And God would not have his cause and work dishonoured, by his Ministers unfitness: Alas! unfit men have been the Churches great Calamity and Reproach. <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3. 16, 1, 2.

               </p>
               <p>2. God would have his work Effectually done; and therefore by men that are wholly devoted to it. Were they never so able, if they have avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and do it by the Halves, dividing their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours between it and the World, this will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Necessity and the End: Even a <hi>Paul</hi> must do it publickly and from House to House, night and day with Tears, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20, 28.

               <p>5. The safety and preservation of the Truth requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Ministerial Office. As the Laws of <hi>England</hi> would never be preserved without Lawyers and Jugdes, by the common People; so the Scriptures, and the Faith, Sacraments and Worship would never have been brought down to us as they are, without a stated Ministry, whose Interest, Office and Work it is continually to use them.

None have leisure to do this great work as it must be done, but those that by Office are wholly separated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> How are men called and separated to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ministry?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are many things concurr thereto. The first Ministers were called immediately by Christ himself, and extraordinarily qualified: But ever since, all these things must concur:</p>
               <p>1. A Common Obligation on all men to do their best in their places to propagate the Gospel and Church, and to save mens Souls, is presupposed, as a preparatory antecedent.</p>
               <p>2. There must he necessary qualifying Abilities: 1. Natural Wit and Capacity. 2. Acquired improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and so much Knowledge as must be exercised in the Office. 3. If Apt to Teach and Able, signified no more than to Read what is prescribed by others, a Child, Fool or an Infidel were Apt and Able. Ability for competent Utterance and Exercise. 4. And to his <hi>Acceptance with</hi> God and his own <hi>Salvation, saving
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60383:206"/>
Faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> is necessary. If you would know the necessary degrees of ability, it is so much without which the necessary acts of the Office cannot be done, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. The things that thou hast heard of me among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to Faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
               <p>3. The approving Judgment of other Senior Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters is ordinarily necessary; For men are not to be the only Judges <hi>themselves</hi> where the publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is concerned. And the <hi>Investing Ordination</hi> of such, is the orderly <hi>Solemnizing</hi> of their <hi>entrance,</hi> and delivery of Christs Commission; and is that to the General Office of the Ministry, which Baptism is to Christianity, and Solemn Matrimony to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or Coronation to a King. This is not done by the Election of the People; It is not their Work to choose Ministers to the General Office, or men to call the World. <note n="i" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 2. Tit. 1. 5. Act. 14. 23. &amp; 9. &amp; 13. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. To make a man the Pastor of a <hi>particular Church</hi> or Flock, the <hi>consent</hi> both of the Man and of the <hi>Flock</hi> is necessary; and to the well being also, the <hi>Consent</hi> of the Neighbour Pastors, and to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> the Princes. This is an <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> which may be often renewed and changed; but the Ordination to the <hi>General</hi> Office is to be but once: To <hi>license a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> and to <hi>choose him</hi> for <hi>my Physician</hi> are divers things: And so it is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> What Laws or Canons have Pastors power to make for the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. None to the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> for that hath no Ruler or Law-maker or Judge but Christ; man being utterly uncapable of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:60383:207"/>2. None which shall Cross the Laws of Christ, in Nature or Scriptures.</p>
               <p>3. None which are of the same kind and use with Christs own universal Laws, and no more needful to one Place or Age than to all: For this will accuse Christ, as if he had been defective in his own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation, when more must be added of the same kind. <note n="k" place="bottom">Isa. 33. 22. Iam. 4. 12. 1 Tim. 4. 6. 1 Cor. 3. 5. &amp; 4. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>4. Taking the Word [<hi>Laws</hi>] strictly, Pastors as such have no Legislative power. But taking it <hi>laxly,</hi> for Mandates or Directions given by just Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, such as a Parent or Tutor hath, they may make such Laws as these: 1. Such as only enjoyn the obeying of Christs own Laws. 2. And such as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine of such meer Accidents of Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, as Christ hath commanded in General, and virtually, and left the particular sort to humane determination of Governours (as Time, Place, Utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 3. Such as are not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the Churches of which they are Pastors, to others of whom they are no Rulers. 4. Such as being Indifferent are not made more necessary than their Nature and Use requireth; Nor used to the Churches Destruction or hurt, but to it's Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 5. Such as being mutable in the Reason or Cause of them, are not fixed. And continued when the reason of them ceaseth. <note n="l" place="bottom">Mat. 20. 27, 28. 2 Cor. 1. 24. 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 3. 6. 1 Pet. 4. 9, 10, 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Christ calleth us Minsters that we may not think we are Lords of his Heritage: Our Work is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:60383:207"/>
and apply his Laws and perswade men to obey them, and not to make Laws of our own of the same kind, as if we were his Equals, and Lords of his Church. It's true, he hath bid us determine of Circumstances to the Churches Edification, and the Pastor is Judge for the present Time and Place, what Chapter he shall read, what Text he shall preach on, and in what Method, what Psalm shall be Sung and in what Tune, and such like: But who made him Lord of other Churches, to impose the like on them? Or how can he prove that the very same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are necessary to all, when a day may alter the case with himself, which depends on mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table causes. If all the World or Land be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on such a day to read the same Psalm and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and occurrents make any Subject far more suitable, who hath power to deprive the present Pastor of his Choice, and to suppose Ministers <hi>unable</hi> to know what Subject to read or preach on, unless it be they that make such men Ministers that they may so rule them?</p>

                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> Why must there be stated Worshipping Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. For the Honour of God and our Redeemer, who is best honoured in united solemn Assemblies, magnifying him with one Mind and Heart and Mouth. <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14. Heb. 10. 21, 22. Act. 14. 23.</note>

               <p>3. For the Benefit and Joy of Christians, who in such concordant Societies, receive Encouragement, Strength and Comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:60383:208"/>4. For the due Order and Honour of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches and the whole.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> Is every worshipping Congregation a Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Name</hi> is not much worthy of a debate: There are divers sorts of Christian Assemblies which may be called [<hi>Churches.</hi>] 1. There are occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accidental Assemblies that are not stated. 2. There are stated Assemblies like Chappels, which have only Curates, and are but Parts of the lowest political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Churches. 3. Christians statedly associated under such Pastors as have the Power of the Church Keyes for personal Communion in Holy Doctrine, Worship and Conversation, are the lowest sort of Political Governed Churches. 4. Synods, consisting of the Pastors and Delegates of these may be called Churches in a laxe sence. 5. And so may a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nation under one King. 6. And all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World is one Catholick Church as Headed by Jesus Christ. 7. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Sect is a spurious Church, as it is headed by a humane uncapable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, claiming the Power of Legislation and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over all the Church on earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> But how shall I know which is the true Church, when so many claim the Title; the Papists say it is only theirs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have fully answered such doubts on the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church and Communion of Saints, in the Creed.</hi> Either you speak of the <hi>Whole Church,</hi> or of a <hi>Particular Church</hi> which is but a Part. If of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> it is a foolish que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, [How I shall know which is the <hi>true Church</hi>] when there is but one. If of a <hi>Particular</hi> Church, every true Christian <hi>Society</hi> (Pastors and Flocks) is <hi>a true Church,</hi> that is, a True Society as a <hi>part</hi> of the Whole.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 13.</hi> But when there are divers contending Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, how shall I know which of them I should joyn with?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1 If they are all true Churches, having the same God, and Christ, and Faith, and Hope, and Love, You must <hi>separate</hi> from none of them, as Churches, though you may separate from their sins: But must communicate with them in all lawful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, as occasion requireth. 2. But your fixed Relation to a particular Pastor and Church peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, must be chosen, as your own Case and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, all things considered, doth require. When you can have free choice, the <hi>Nearest</hi> and <hi>Ablest</hi> and <hi>Holyest Pastor</hi> and Society should be chosen: When Violence interposeth, a Rulers will may do much to turn the scales for a tolerable Pastor and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: if it make it most for the common good, and your Edification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 14.</hi> May men adde any thing to the prescribed Worship of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Worship</hi> is a doubtful Word; If you will call meer mutable Accidents and Circumstances by the Name of Worship, Man may adde to them, such as is putting off the Hatt, the Meetre and tune of Psalms, and such like. But men may do nothing which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a defect in the Laws of Christ, and therefore may make no new Articles of Faith, or Religion, or any thing necessary to Salvation, nor any Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Ordinances of Worship of the same kind with Christs, much less Contrary thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 15.</hi> May we hold Communion with a faulty Church and Worship?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Or else we must have Communion with none on Earth: All our personal Worship is faulty; we
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60383:209"/>
joyn with them for Christian Faith and Worship. If the Minister say or do any thing contrary, it is his sin, and our presence maketh it not ours. Else we must separate from all the World. But we may not by false Professions, Subscribing, Swearing or Practice, commit any sin our selves for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of any Church on Earth. <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 4. 16. &amp; 6. 6.

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a Sacred action (or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) instituted by Christ, for the Solemnizing of the Covenant of Christianity between God and Man, and the solemn investing us in the State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, obliging us to Christ, and for his delivering to us our Relation and right to him as our Head, and to the gifts of his Covenant. <note n="a" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 29.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. A Soul in flesh is apt to use sense, and needs some help of it. 2. Idolaters had filled the World with Images and outward Ceremonies, and the Jews had been long used to abundance of Typical Rites. And Christ being to deliver the World from these,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:60383:209"/>
and teach them to Worship in Spirit and Truth, would not run into the extream of avoiding all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signs and helps, but hath made his Sacraments, few and fitted to their use, to be instead of Images, and mens vain Inventions and the Jewish burdens, as meet and sufficient helps of that kind to his Church, that men might not presume to set up any such things of their own, on pretence of need or usefulness.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> As a Sinner miserable by guilt and pravity, and loss of his blessed Relation to God, but Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ and called by him, and coming to receive him and his saving Grace.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> You must well understand that two Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting acts of God are presupposed to Baptism, as done before. I. The first is Gods Covenant with Jesus Christ as our Redeemer by Consent; In which God requireth of him the work of mans Redemption as on his part, by perfect Holiness, Righteousness, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Suffering, and the rest: And promiseth him as the reward to be Lord of All, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Glorifying of the Church with his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Glory. <note n="b" place="bottom">Ioh. 17. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 3. 35. &amp; 5. 22, 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 6. 39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>II.

               </p>
               <p>Now Baptism is the bringing of this <hi>Conditional Promise</hi> upon <hi>mans consent</hi> to be an <hi>actual mutual Covenant.</hi>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> First, he doth by his Minister stipulate, that is, demand of the party baptized whether he truly consent to his part. And next on that supposition, he delivereth him the Covenant-gifts which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent are to be bestowed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I confess to you, of the two evils, I think the Church is more corrupted for want of such a solemn serious renewing of the Baptismal Covenant at age, and by turning Confirmation into a Ceremony, than by those Anabaptists, who call People to be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously rebaptized, as the <hi>Africk</hi> Councel did those that had been baptized by Hereticks.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> But is it not enough to know that they are of the Church visible?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> All at Age that are of the visible Church are in a state of Salvation except Hypocrites. Therefore all Infants that are of the visible Church, are also of the Mystical Church, except such as had not the requisite qualification; and that is, such as were not the Children of the Faithful.</p>
               <p>All the World are in the Kingdom of the Devil who are not in the Kingdom of God. And if there be no visible way of Salvation for them, what reason have we to hope that they are saved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 22.</hi> Some say we must leave their case to God as unknown to us, and that he will save such of them as he electeth?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> True Faith and Hope is grounded on Gods Promise. What reason have we to believe and hope that any are saved whom God never promised to save?

                  <hi>Q. 23.</hi> You make the Mercy so very great, as maketh the denyal of it seem a hainous sin in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are three sorts of them greatly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 1. Some say that <hi>no Infants have Original sin,</hi> and so <hi>need no Baptism nor Pardon:</hi> Or if it be sin, it's done away by Christs meer death, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the World are saved.</p>
               <p>2. Others say that Infants have <hi>Original sin,</hi> but <hi>have no visible Remedy,</hi> nor are any in Covenant with Christ, nor Members of his Church, because no Pardon is promised but to Believers.</p>
               <p>3. Others hold that Infants have Original sin, and that the Promise is to the Faithful and their Seed, and that Parents ought thankfully to acknowledge this Mercy, and devote them to Christ as Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members of his Church: but that <hi>Baptism</hi> is not for <hi>Infant-members,</hi> but only as the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> for the adult; This last sort are they whom I speak of as such whom I would not separate from, if they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate not from us: But the other two sorts are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously erroneous. When God hath made so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plain Promises to the Seed of his Servants; and in all Ages before Christ, hath taken Infants for Church-members, and never made a Covenant but to the <hi>faithfull and their Seed,</hi> to say that Christ the Saviour of the World, came to cast all Infants out of the Visible Church, into the visible Kingdom of Satan, and give them no greater Mercy instead of it, seemeth to me very great Ingratitude, and making Christ too like to Satan, as coming to do much of his destroying work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 24.</hi> But every where Salvation is promised only to Believers?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:60383:215"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Promise is to them and their Seed, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant. The same Text that saith, <hi>He that believeth shall be saved,</hi> saith, <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> Which sheweth that it is only the Adult that it speaketh of; Or else all Infants must be damned for Unbelief. It shuts them no more out of Baptism than out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 25.</hi> But the Scripture speaks of no Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. No Infants are to be baptized but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the Faithful: Therefore the Parents were to be made Believers first. 2. The Scripture speaks of baptizing divers Housholds. 3. No Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth that ever any Child of a Believer was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized at age. 4.

                  <hi>Q. 26.</hi> How can Infants be Disciples that learn not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Did Christ mistake when he sent them to <hi>Disciple Nations,</hi> of which Infants are a part? 2. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Infants be Disciples of Christ, if Christ an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant can be the <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of his Church? Christ was our Teacher, Priest and King in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by Right, Relation, and Destination, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and Obligation to what he was after to do: and so may Infants be his Subjects and Disciples: May not an Infant be a King that cannot rule? And are not Infants the Kings Subjects, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey? May not they be Knights and Lords, and have right to inheritances? 3. Yea, are not Infants called <hi>Gods Servants, Levit.</hi> 25. 42. Yea and Christs

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 27.</hi> We are all by Nature Children of Wrath, and none can enter into Heaven that is not regenerate and born of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But we are all the Children of God (we and our Seed) by the Grace of Christ: And Infants are capable of being regenerate by the Spirit. Or else they would not be called Holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 28.</hi> The Apostle only giveth a reason why a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Husband may lawfully live with an unbelieving Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> True: But <hi>what is the Reason</hi> which he giveth? The doubt was not whether it be Fornication: that was past doubt: But the Faithful must in all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations be a peculiar Holy People, and the doubt was, Whether their Conjugal Society became not such as Infidels, common and unholy; And <hi>Paul</hi> saith, No: To the pure all things are Sanctified: The Unbeliever is not Holy in her self, but sanctified to the Husband for conjugal Society: Else saith he, (<hi>Your Children were unclean,</hi> not <hi>Bastards,</hi> but <hi>unholy</hi> as those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are;) <hi>But now are they Holy,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> adult and Infants were a Holy People, separated from the World to God, in the Covenant of peculiarity, and not common and unclean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 29.</hi> Is it the Infants of all professed Christians and Hypocrites, or only the Infants of sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have the Promise of Pardon and Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and sealed by Baptism?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As the Church is to receive all the adult who make a credible profession, so are they to receive
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:60383:216"/>
all their Infants: For God only knoweth the Heart. But it is with the <hi>Heart</hi> that <hi>man believeth</hi> to <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Rom.</hi> 10. And as adult Hypocrites are not pardoned by God who knoweth the Heart, so neither is there any promise of pardon to their Seed. No <hi>text of Scripture</hi> giveth any pardon but to <hi>sincere Believers</hi> and <hi>their Seed.</hi> And the <hi>Child</hi> is in the Covenant as the <hi>Child of a believer devoted to God:</hi> And that Faith which qualifieth not the Parent for pardon, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not qualifie the Child for it. I know no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to an <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> than to a <hi>Heathens</hi> Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 30.</hi> But what if the Godfather, or Grandfather be a true Christian, or the Ancestors and the Parents both Infidels: may not the Child be baptized and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The further you go from the Parent, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the Gase. We are all the offspring of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Noe,</hi> and yet that maketh not the Infants of <hi>Heathens</hi> baptizable or pardoned. But the case of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant maketh it <hi>probable,</hi> that whoever is the <hi>true owner</hi> of the Child by <hi>Nature, Purchase</hi> or <hi>Adoption,</hi> may devote it acceptably to God in baptism: Because the Infant having <hi>no choosing power,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> of his <hi>Owner</hi> goeth for his own, in accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mercies of the Covenant and obliging him to such conditions as are for his good; which if he like them not, he may renounce when he comes to age. But if the Grandfather or <hi>Godfather</hi> be <hi>no Owner of the Child,</hi> I know no proof that their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to be baptized helps him to Pardon and Salvation. If we dream that Baptism giveth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to all Infidels, and <hi>Heathens</hi> Children, whose owners were not in the Covenant themselves, we
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:60383:217"/>
make a Gospel, which as far as I can find, Christ never made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 31.</hi> May not any man take an Infant out of the Street and give him food and rayment; much more offer him to Baptism, which is an Act of greater Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The first God alloweth: But Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is none of ours to give, but Gods; and we can ministerially deliver the investing signs to none that have no title to which God hath promised the gift: If as some think, bare Redemption hath given a right to all the World, then all Infidels and <hi>Heathens</hi> shall be saved if baptized: If they say it is to all Infants in the World, then whether they have God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers or no they may be baptized: And if all that are baptized are saved, it's irrational to think that <hi>want of Baptism</hi> without their fault shall hinder their Salvation. But though God <hi>offer</hi> to all men Pardon and Life for themselves and their Infants, yet no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>giveth</hi> it to either without <hi>Acceptance</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 32.</hi> Some say, that so much Faith will serve for a Title to Baptism, as taketh Christ for a Teacher and maketh us Disciples, that we may after attain to saving Holiness, but that it is not special saving Faith, that must needs be then professed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is to make a new Baptism and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to vie with that which alone Christ made. No adult person is a Christian in Scripture sence, who believeth not in Christ as Christ. Which is as Saviour, as Prophet, Priest and King: The essentials of Christs Office and gifts as offered, are essential to that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Faith, which makes us Christians: A Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

and a Christian were words of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <note n="n" place="bottom">Mar. 16. 16. Rom. 10. 10, 14.</note> Christ made no Baptism but for the remission of Sin, and giving men a Relation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to Father, Son and Holy Ghost: Baptism saveth by the answer of a good conscience to God. <hi>Arise and wash away thy sins;</hi> was the word to <hi>Saul.</hi> We are Sacramentally buryed and risen with Christ; as dead to Sin, and made new Creatures, when we are baptized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Therefore it is called <hi>The Laver of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. All the Church of Christ from the Apostles, taught that Baptism put away the guilt of Sin, to all that were truly qualified for that Sacrament. And they required the profession of a Saving Faith and Repentance: And all the form of Baptism used in <hi>England</hi> and the whole Christian World, so happily agreeth in expressing this, that whoever will bring in the Opinion, [<hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Faith short of that which hath the promise of Pardon and Life, entitleth to Baptism,</hi>] must make a new Baptismal form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 33.</hi> But many Divines say, that Baptism is not administred to Infants on the title of a <hi>present</hi> Faith, nor to give present pardon; but on a promise that they shall believe at age, and so have the Ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> None dare say so of the adult: If they say, we repent not nor believe now, but we promise to do it hereafter, no wise man will baptize them. It is <hi>present Believing,</hi> and not a meer promise to believe that is their Title. And Infants title is the Parents Faith and dedication. By this Doctrine, Infants of Christians are not in the same Covenant or Baptism

as their Parents, nor are any more pardoned than <hi>Heathens.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 34.</hi> What use are we to make of our Baptism ever after?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is of great and manifold use. 1. We must live under the humble sence of that miserable state of Sin from which Christianity doth deliver us. <note n="p" place="bottom">Rom. 3. Rev. 1. 5. &amp; 7. 14. Rom. 6. 1, 2, 3. 1 Cor. 6. 10, 11, 12. Heb. 10. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. We must live in the thankful sence of that Grace of God in Christ which did deliver us: and in the Exercise of our belief of that Truth and Love which was then Sealed to us.</p>
               <p>3. We must live in the faithful remembrance of that Covenant which we Sealed, and that Obedience which we promised, and in that War against the Devil the World and the Flesh in which we then engaged our selves.</p>
               <p>4. It is the Knowledge of the Baptismal Covenant which tells us what Christianity is, and who we must take and Love as Christians, while Sects and Dividers by narrow false measure, do limit their Christian Love and Communion, and hate or cast off the Disciples of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Accordingly it is the baptismal Covenant that must tells us what <hi>true Faith</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> Such a Belief as causeth us truly to <hi>consent to that Covenant;</hi> and what <hi>true Conversion</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> Such a change as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a <hi>true consent</hi> to that Covenant: And so it tells us how to judge of our sincerity of Grace; <hi>viz.</hi> When we <hi>unfeignedly consent to that Covenant;</hi> And tells us what sin is <hi>mortal,</hi> that is, inconsistent with
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:60383:218"/>
true Grace and Title to Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> All sin which is not consistent with an <hi>unfeigned consent to the Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="bottom">Ioh. 13. 8. Eph. 5. 26. Tit. 3. 5. Act. 22. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>6. It tells what the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly all that profess consent to the baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and forsake it not: and mystically all that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely do consent to it.</p>
               <p>And 7. So it tells us how to exercise Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, that we cast not out those as none of Christs members for their Infirmities, who are not proved by sufficient witness to have done that which cannot stand with the sincere <hi>keeping of that Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus Baptism, not as a meer <hi>Outward wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but as including the Grace which it signifieth, and the <hi>Covenant</hi> and Vow which it sealeth, is the very Kernel of the Christian Religion, and the Symbol, or Livery of the Church and Members of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 35.</hi> Are all damned that die unbaptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Baptism is the solemn devoting men in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Christ. All that hear the Gospel are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that consent not to this Covenant. But the Heart-consent for our selves and Children is our Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition before God, who damns not men for want of an outward Ceremony, which by Ignorance or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is omitted: Believers Children are Holy because they and theirs are devoted to God, before Baptism: Baptism is to Christianity what publick Matrimony is to Marriage, Ordination to the Ministry, listing to a Souldier, and Crowning to a King.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a sacred Action in which by Bread and Wine <hi>Consecrated,</hi> broken and poured out, given and taken, and eaten and drunk, the Sacrifice of Christs Body and Blood for our Redemption is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated,</hi> and the Covenant of Christianity mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and solemnly <hi>renewed,</hi> and sealed, in which Christ with the benefits of his Covenant is given to the Faithful, and they give up themselves to Christ, as members of his Church, with which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Communion. <note n="a" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28.

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Here are so many things contained, that we must desire you to open them severally: And first what Actions are here performed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. <hi>Consecration,</hi> 2. <hi>Commemoration,</hi> 3. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting and communication.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the seperating and Sanctifiing the Bread and Wine, to this holy use; by which it ceaseth to be meer common Bread and Wine, and is made Sacramentally, that is, by signification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:60383:219"/>
the Sacrificed Body and Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> How is this done, and what Action conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateth them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As other holy things are consecrated, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Utensils, Church-maintenance, Oblations, the Water in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is by an <hi>authorized devoting it to it's proper holy use.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> But some say, it is done only by saying these words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> or by <hi>Blessing it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is done by all that goeth to a <hi>Dedication</hi> or <hi>Seperation</hi> to it's holy use: and that is, 1. By declaring that <hi>God commandeth and accepteth it,</hi> (which is best done by reading his Institution) and that we then accordingly devote it. 2. By Praying for his Acceptance and Blessing 3. By pronouncing Ministerially that it is now Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, Christs Body and Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Is the Bread and Wine the true Body and Blood of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Relatively, Significantly, Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, Sacramentally: that is, it is consecrated Bread and Wine on these accounts so called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 7.</hi> But why do you call it that which it is not really, when Christ saith, <hi>This is my Body,</hi>

                  <hi>Shilling of the Kings</hi> Coin, and the question be <hi>Whether this be a Shilling, or the Kings</hi> Coin, or <hi>Silver?</hi> You will answer, It is all three: The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it is <hi>Silver;</hi> The <hi>General Relation</hi> is <hi>Money</hi> or Coin; The <hi>Special Relative</hi> form is, It's a <hi>Shilling.</hi> And this is the fittest name when the value is demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:60383:220"/>
So the question is, Whether this be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> or a <hi>Sacrament, or Christs Srcrificed Body and Blood.</hi> It is <hi>all</hi> these: and the Answer must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the question.</p>
               <p>It is usual to say of Pictures, <hi>This is</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and This is <hi>such</hi> a one, and <hi>This is my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly the two parts of the Sacrament must be understood alike: And of one Christ saith [<hi>This Cup</hi> is the <hi>New Testament in my Blood which is shed for you,</hi> Luk. 22. 20. 1 Cor. 11. 25. Where none can deny that by [<hi>Cup</hi>] is meant the <hi>Wine,</hi> and by [Is <hi>the New Testament</hi>] is meant, [<hi>Is the Exhibition</hi> and <hi>Sealing of the New Testament</hi>] and not the very Testament it self.</p>
               <p>And its known that Christs common Teaching was by Parables and Similitudes, where he saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 28. <hi>A Certain man had two Sons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>A Certain Housholder planted a Vineyard,</hi> &amp;c.

The good Seed are the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: The tares are the Children of the Wicked one: The Enemy is the Devil: The Reapers are the Angels,</hi> that is, <hi>They are signified:</hi> This is ordinary in the Gospel, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>I am the Vine, and my Father is the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman:</hi> Joh. 10. 7, 9, 14. <hi>I am the Door, I am the good Shepheard,</hi> (<hi>as</hi> David, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>I am a Worm and no man;</hi>) Mat. 15. 13, 14. <hi>Ye are the salt of the Earth: the Lights of the World:</hi> that is, <hi>Ye are like</hi> these things.</p>
               <p>Yea, the Old Testament useth [<hi>is</hi>] for [<hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi>] most frequently, and hath no other word so fit to express it by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 8.</hi> Why then do the Papists lay so much stress
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:60383:220"/>
on the Word <hi>[is:]</hi> Yea, why do they say <hi>That, there is no Bread and Wine after the Consecration,</hi> but only <hi>Christs Body and Blood under the shew of them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Sacrament is exceeding Venerable, being the <hi>very Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking, Christs own Sacrificed Body and Blood in similitude</hi> or <hi>representation.</hi> And it was meet that all Christians should discern the Lords Body and Blood in similitude, from common Bread and Wine: And in time the use of the Name when the Church was drowned in Ignorance, was taken (about one thousand years after Christ) for the thing <hi>signified</hi> without the <hi>sign;</hi> As if they had said, <hi>This is the King;</hi> Therefore it is not a <hi>picture,</hi> nor is it <hi>Cloth</hi> or <hi>Colours.</hi> And it being proper to the Priests to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it, they found how it exalted them to be judged able to make their Maker, and to <hi>Give</hi> or <hi>Deny Christ</hi> to men by their Authority, and so they set up Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, and by a General Council made it He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, to hold that there is any Bread or Wine left after Consecration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 9.</hi> Wherein lyeth the evil of that Opinion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Evils are more and greater than I must here stay to recite. In short, 1. They feign that to be Christs Body and Blood, which was in his Hand or on the Table when he spake the words, as if he had then two Bodyes</p>
               <p>2. They feign his Body to be broken and his Blood shed before he was crucifyed.</p>
               <p>3. They feign him to have <hi>Flesh and Blood</hi> in Heaven, which two General Councils have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; his Body being a Spiritual Body now.</p>
               <p>4. They feign either himself to have eaten his own Flesh and Drunk his own Blood, or at lest his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to have done it while he was alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="416" facs="tcp:60383:221"/>5. They feign him to have been the Breaker of his own Flesh and Shedder of his own Blood, and make him to do that which was done only by the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. They contradict the express words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which three times together call it <hi>Bread</hi> after the Consecration, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <note n="*" place="bottom">So 1 Cor. 10. 15. Act. 20. 7, 11. &amp; 2. 42. 46. 1 Cor. 11. 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> When yet they say, <hi>It is not Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. They condemn the <hi>belief of the soundest senses</hi> of all men in the World, as if it were heresie. All our <hi>Eyes, Touch, Tast,</hi> &amp;c. tells us that <hi>there is Bread and Wine,</hi> and they say <hi>there is none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Hereby they deny all certainty of Faith, and all other certainty: For if a man may not be <hi>certain</hi> of what he <hi>Seeth, Feeleth and Tasteth,</hi> he can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of no sensible thing: For we have no Faculties but sence to perceive things sensible as such: Nor any way to transmit them to the Intellect but by sense. And we can no otherwise know that there is a Bible, a Church, a Council, a Pope, a Man, or any thing in the World, and therefore much less can believe any of them. So that all Humane and Divine Faith are thus destroyed, yea man is set below a Beast that hath the Benefit of sense.</p>
               <p>9. Hereby they feign God to be the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the World; For, things sensible are his Works, and so is Sense: And he makes us know no supernatural Revelation but by the intromission of some Sence: And if God may deceive all men by the way of sense, we can never be sure but he may do it otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:60383:221"/>10. They set up Men who confess their <hi>own senses</hi> are not to be credited, to be more <hi>credible</hi> than all <hi>our senses,</hi> and to be the Lords of the understandings of all Princes and People in despight of sense: And he that is to be believed before our senses, is an absolute Lord.</p>
               <p>11. They deny it to be a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> For if there be no <hi>sign</hi> there is no <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. They feign every ignorant drunken Priest every time he consecrateth, to work greater Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles than ever Christ wrought, and so to make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles common and at the Wills of thousands of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. I must not here stay to handle all this: But in a small Book call'd <hi>Full and Easie Satisfaction which is the true Religin,</hi> I have shewed thirty one Miracles with twenty Aggravations which all Priests are feigned to work at every Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 10.</hi> What is it that is called the Mass, which the Papists say that All the Fathers and Church used in every age, and we renounce?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In the first Ages the Churches were gathered among <hi>Heathens;</hi> and men were long <hi>Instructed</hi> and <hi>Catechized hearers</hi> before they were baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: And the first part of the day was spent in publick, in such Common Teaching and Prayer as belonged to all, and then the Deacon cryed <hi>Missa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>est;</hi> that is, <hi>Dismist</hi> the unbaptized hearers, and the rest that were Christians spent the rest of the time in such duties as are proper to themselves, especially the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> and the <hi>Praises of God.</hi> Hereupon all the Worship following the <hi>Dimission</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christened and suspended, came to be called barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously <hi>the Mass,</hi> or <hi>Dismission.</hi> And this Worship hath been quite changed from what it was in the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:60383:222"/>
beginning, and the Papists by keeping the Name [<hi>Mass</hi>] or <hi>Dismission,</hi> make the ignorant believe that the Worship it self is the same as of old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 11.</hi> What be the changes that have been made?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> More than I may now stay to number. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> describe it in their Time to be just such as the Scripture mentioneth, and we now commonly perform; that is, In Reading the Scripture, opening and applying it; Praying as the Minister was able, Praising God, Baptizing, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Lords Supper. After this Ministers grew less able and trusty, and they decreed that they should pray and Officiate in set forms; yet so that every Bishop might choose his own, and every Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter must shew it to the Bishops and have their approbation: The Creed, Lords Prayer, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and the Words of Baptism and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Lords Supper were alwayes used in forms before. After this they grew to use the same forms called a Liturgie in whole Provinces: some Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were so Ancient that we cannot find their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, that is, The Anointing of the baptized, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them Milk and Honey to taste, dipping them thrice, cloathing them in a white Garment after, to Worship with their faces toward the <hi>East,</hi> and not to kneel in Prayer or Adoration any Lords day in the year, nor any Week day between <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> and specially to observe those two year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Festivals, and Good Frydaies fast.</p>
               <p>And quickly after the encouraging of persecuted Christians to suffer, drew them to keep a yearly day at the place where a Martyr was kill'd or buryed, to honour their memories and give God thanks for them. After this they built Altars over them: And
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:60383:222"/>
they built their Churches where their graves or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of their bones were laid, and in honour of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory called the Churches by their Names. Next they brought their Names daily into the Church Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies; And next they added to them the Names of such Bishops of those particular Churches as had left an honourable memorial behind them. And the Lords Supper was celebrated much like as it is in our English Liturgy (save these Names.) And thus far the changes were then accounted laudable, and were not indeed such as should discourage any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from Communion: Nor do we read of any that were against them. Besides which they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued the use of Crossing.</p>
               <p>But quickly (though by degrees) a Flood of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies came in, and Popes and Prelates added at their Pleasure, till Gods publick Worship was made quite another thing.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. God who is a Spirit and will be Worshipped in Spirit and Truth, is by Mass-Priests and Papists Worshipped by such a mass of Ceremonies, as makes it like a Stage-play, and representeth God so like the <hi>Heathens</hi> Idols, delighted in Mummeries and toyish actions, as is greatly to the dishonour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and God. <note n="b" place="bottom">Ioh. 4. 20, 22, 23, 24.

                  <hi>Q. 12.</hi> You have spoken much about the <hi>Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the Sacrament; What is it which you call the <hi>Commemoration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It containeth the signal representation of the Sacrificing of Christ, as the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the World. Where the Signs are, 1. The Materials, the Bread and Wine; 2. The Ministers <hi>Breaking</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Pouring out</hi> the <hi>Wine;</hi> 3. The Presenting them to God as the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of that Sacrifice in which we trust: and declaring to the people that this is done to this <hi>Commemoration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The things signified are, 1. Christs Flesh and Blood when he was on Earth: 2. The Crucifying of Christ, the piercing of his Flesh, and shedding his Blood: 3. Christs <hi>Offering</hi> this to God as a Sacrifice for mans Sin. And this <hi>Commemoration</hi> is a great part of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 13</hi> What think you of the name <hi>Sacrifice, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi> here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Ancient Churches used them all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception from any Christian that ever I read of. I. As the Bread is justly called <hi>Christs Body</hi> as <hi>Signifying</hi> it, so the Action described was of old called a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>representing</hi> and <hi>commemorating</hi> it. And it's no more improper than calling our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and our Alms, and our Prayers <hi>Sacrifices.

                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:60383:224"/>II. And the naming of the Table an <hi>Altar</hi> as related to this representative Sacrifice, is no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper than that other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat,</hi> seems plainly to mean the Sacramental Communion.

We are not offended that the Lords day is called the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> though the Scripture doth never so call it; and a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in Scripture sence was a day of <hi>Ceremonial rest:</hi> and the ancient Church called it the <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> but by such allusion as it (more commonly) used the word <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and Altar.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I. 1. On Gods part, the renewed <hi>giving</hi> of a <hi>Sacrificed Saviour</hi> to the penitent Believer.</p>
               <p>2. The Will and Command of Christ, that as Sacrificers feasted on the Sacrifice, so the Soul by Faith should thankfully and joyfully feast on Christ by hearty Acceptance of the free Gift. <note n="f" place="bottom">Zec. 9. 11. Heb. 10. 29. &amp; 13. 20.</note>
               </p>

Our confirmed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Christ as our Head and Saviour, and to God as our Father reconciled by him, and to the Holy Ghost as our Sanctifier, and to the Church as his Kingdom or Body. 2. The Pardon of our Sins by his Blood. 3. Our right confirmed to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life. 4. The strengthening of our Faith, Hope, Love, Joy, Patience and all Grace. <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 16. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Luk. 22. 20. Heb. 9. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note>

                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:60383:225"/>II. On the Receivers part is signified, 1. That in the sence of his own Sin, Misery, and Need, he humbly and thankfully receiveth his part in Christ as Sacrificed. 2. That he endeavoureth by Faith to feast on him: 3. And that he thankfully receiveth the Blessings purchased, to wit, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Christ as his Head, to God as his Father, and to the Holy Ghost as his Sanctifier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, with the Pardon of Sin, the Sealed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Right to Heaven, and all the helps of his Faith and other Graces. 4. That he resolvedly reneweth the Dedication of himself to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and holy Ghost, as thus, related to these ends; Covenanting Fidelity in these relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and renouncing the contraries. 5. Doing all this as in Communion with all the Church of Christ, as being united to them in the same Head; the same Faith, and Hope and Love. 6. Thankfully praising God and our Redeemer for this Grace.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 17.</hi> Should not one prepare for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by Fasting and Humiliation before? or how should we prepare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We must alwayes live in habitual Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and special Fasts are not ordinarily necessary thereto: the Primitive Church did communicate not only every Lords day, but on other dayes when they met to worship God; and therefore used not every Week to spend a day in Fasting for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But as Christians must use Fasting on just occasions, so must they do before this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in case that any hainous Sin, or heavy Judgment or danger call for it; and preparing. Considerations and Prayers are necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 18.</hi> May one communicate who is uncertain of the sincerity of his Faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:60383:225"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> you mean either <hi>Objective,</hi> or <hi>Active</hi> Faith.</p>
               <p>1. One that is so far uncertain that the Gospel is true, and that there is a Life to come, as that he dare not say, I have no wavering or doubt of it, may yet be a true Believer and may communicate, if his perswasion be but so prevalent, as to resolve him to consent to the Covenant of Grace, and take God for his God, and Christ for his Saviour, and the Holy Ghost for his Sanctifier; Gods Law for his Rule, his Promise for his Security, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his Happiness, and here to place his Hope and Trust, forsaking all that stands against it. A weak and doubting Faith may bring a man to Martyrdom and to Heaven, if it bring him to trust Christ with Soul and Body in the way of Obedience to him. <note n="h" place="bottom">Act. 8. 37. Mar. 9. 24. Mat. 6. 30. &amp; 8. 26. &amp; 14. 31. &amp; 16. 8. Luk. 17. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. If by <hi>Faith</hi> you mean the Act of <hi>Believing</hi> and Consenting, God hath made the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of our Faith necessary to our Salvation, but not the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that it is Sincere.</hi> Every man must do his best to discern the Trust, Consent and Choice of his own Heart: And he that truly believeth, and yet is not sure of it, if he can say, As far as I am able to know my own Heart by Trial, I seriously think that I resolvedly consent to the Covenant of Grace, and prefer Christ, Holiness and Heaven before all this World, and trust to Christ and his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for my Felicity; ought to come to the Table of the Lord, notwithstanding his uncertainty. <note n="i" place="bottom">Ioh. 20. 25.

                  <hi>Q. 19.</hi> Whence is it that so many Christians are
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:60383:226"/>
more terrified than comforted by the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Some of them by an excess of reverence to this above all other Ordinances of God; which by degrees brought in the Papists Transubstantiation and Adoration. And by a dread lest by unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they should eat and drink their own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; And so coming thither with a <hi>deeper sence</hi> of the <hi>danger</hi> than of the <hi>Benefit:</hi> And mistaking their Imperfections for this <hi>Unworthy Receiving.</hi> 2. And some come with two high expectations, that God must suddenly give them Joy, or all the grace that is signified by the Sacrament, while they have not the Holy skill to fetch in Comfort by the exercise of their Faith. And when they miss of what they expected, they are cast down. 3. And too many by wilful Sin or Negligence deal falsly with God, and break their Covenant, and renew their wounds of Conscience, and deprive themselves of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Love of God, and the Grace of Christ, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit. <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Cor. 11. 20, 30, 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 20.</hi> Is not the Lords Supper a Converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which therefore should be used by the unbelievers or ungodly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Many things may accidentally by Gods Grace convert a man, which are not to be chosen and used to that End. Plagues, Sickness, Death-approaching, may convert men: Falling into a hainous Sin hath affrighted some to leave their Sin. But these are not means to be chosen for such Ends. And the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> of preparing for a Sacrament hath conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some, when it was not the <hi>Receiving</hi> that did it. It is so evident as not to need long proof, that
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60383:226"/>
God never appointed the Lords Supper to be chosen and used by Infidels or Impenitent ungodly persons, as a means to convert them: 1. Because it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed that they be baptized who communicate. And I have proved that Baptism to the adult presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Profession of Faith and Repentance; And that it delivereth Pardon and Title to Salvation.</p>
               <p>2. Because Faith and Repentance and Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consent renewed are also to be professed by all before they communicate.</p>
               <p>3. Because it was ever an Ordinance proper to the Church, which consisteth of Professors of Faith and Holiness. 4. And the Communicants are said to be <hi>One Bread</hi> and <hi>one Body,</hi> and to Eat <hi>Christs Flesh and drink his Blood,</hi> and <hi>Christ to dwell</hi> in them by <hi>Faith,</hi> and to have <hi>Eternal Life</hi> hereby.</p>
               <p>And as for them that say, it is not <hi>saving Faith</hi> but some <hi>Commoner Preparatory</hi> sort which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be <hi>professed</hi> in Baptism and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I have at large confuted them in a Treatise of <hi>Right to Sacraments:</hi> and the reasons before and now named confute it. I adde, that their Opinion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to true Christian Love; For by them, No one should be taken for a Child of God and in a state of Salvation for being baptized and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and so not Loved as such. And how Poor a Charity is it to love all Visible Church-members, but as the Children of the Devil must be loved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 21.</hi> Must we Love all as true Christians who are baptized and communicate and profess Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, with these three exceptions: 1. That it is not as a <hi>certain</hi> Truth that we must judge them sincere, but as <hi>Probable.</hi> 2. That there be divers
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:60383:227"/>
                  <hi>degrees of Probability</hi> as there be of Profession: Some we are <hi>almost sure</hi> are sincere; And some we have more <hi>Fear</hi> than <hi>Hope</hi> of. And we must measure our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> accordingly. 3. If men by <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Life Apostatize,</hi> or plainly contradict and destroy their profession of Christianity, thereby they nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie our Obligation to take them for Christians. But till men render their <hi>Profession incredible</hi> by <hi>Contrary Profession</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> we are by the Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and Humane Charity, to take all Professed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Communicating Christians to be sincere, but only in various degrees of probability. <note n="l" place="bottom">Act. 11. 26.

the Sacrament or Excommunicated, because it is the Food of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. If none be kept from Baptism, Heathens and Infidels, and professed deriders of Christianity might be baptized to make a mock of Baptism: We must make men Christs Disciples before we baptize them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. And then Baptism would be no Baptism, nor the Ministry no Ministry, the specifying End and Use being changed. 2. Then the Church would be no Church, but lie common with the World: 3. And then Christ would be no King and Head and Husband of the Church, that is, no Christ. <note n="n" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 16. 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29, 30. Eph. 1. 22, 23.</note> 4. If all may not be <hi>baptized,</hi> all may not <hi>communicate;</hi> for Baptism entereth them into a state of Communion: Else the unbaptized and all Infidels might communicate. 5. Some baptized persons turn Atheists, Sadducees or Infidels after: And these are worse than common Infidels that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were baptized. The Church is no Church if it be common to these. 6. Some that continue a Nominal Christianity, openly hate and persecute the Practice of it, and live in common Adultery, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Murder: And the Church is Holy, and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, a holy Nation, a royal Priesthood: <note n="o" place="bottom">Tit. 2. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> And Repentance and Obedience are necessary to the Church as well as Faith. If therefore these notorious, flagitious, impenitent persons, must be Members in Communion with the Church, it will be a Swine-sty and not a Church; a Shame to Christ
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60383:228"/>
and not an Honour. If his Church be but like the rest of the World, Christ will not be honoured as the Saviour of it, nor the Spirit as its Sanctifier. It is the Unity of <hi>the Spirit</hi> that all Christians must keep in the <hi>bond of Peace:</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 3. 16. Rom. 8. 9.</note> But these have none of his Spirit, and therefore are none of Christs.</p>
               <p>The Sacraments are <hi>Symbols</hi> of the Church as differenced from the World; and Christ will have them be a visibly distinct Society. 7. Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants come to receive the greatest gift in the world, Pardon, Justification, Adoption, right to Heaven: The Gospel giveth these to none but Penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: To say that Christ giveth them to flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impenitent Rebels, whose Lives say, <hi>We will not have him reign over us,</hi> is to make a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, contrary to Christs Gospel, which <hi>Paul</hi> curseth were it done by an Angel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8. They are not yet capable of these precious gifts.</p>
               <p>8. The Objectors take no notice of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16, 17. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. where the Churches are reproved for suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Defilers; nor <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 42. 42. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12, 13. which describe the Office of Church-guides, nor 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the governing of the Church, and avoiding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Impenitent are described.</p>
               <p>9. In a word, Christs Office, Works and Law, the Nature of the Church and Sacrament, the Office of the Ministry, the frequent Precepts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and the constant practice of the Church in its greatest Purity, down from the Apostles dayes, do all speak so plainly for keeping and casting out In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60383:228"/>
and impenitent wicked men, and for keeping the Church as a Society of visible Saints, separated from the World, that I can take him for no better than a Swine or an Infidel, who would have the Church-Keyes cast away, and the Church turned common to Swine and Infidels.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Some body must be trusted with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if the work must be done: The Church must be differenced from the World: Therefore some must trye and judge who are fit to be baptized and to have its Communion. And who is fitter than those whom Christ by Office hath thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? Would you have Magistrates or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do it?

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They must Catechize and Examine the Adult before they baptize them; and consequently those who were baptized in Infancy before they number them with adult Communicants: or else Atheists and Infidels will make up much of the Church, who will come in for worldly Interest: This Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination should go before Confirmation, or the publick owning of their Baptism. But there is no Necessity of any more Examination before every Sacrament, except in case of Scandal, or when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons need and crave such help.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Those who are proved to be Impenitent in gross scandalous sins after sufficient admonition and patience. And to reject such, is so far from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, that it is necessary Church-Justice: without which a Pastor is but a Slave or Executioner of the sinfull will of others: Like a Tutor, Philosopher or Schoolmaster, who is not the Master of his own School, but must leave it common to all that will come in, though they scorn him and refuse his conduct. But no man must play the Pastor over other mens Flocks, nor take the Guidance of a greater Flock than he can know and manage: Much less be the only Key-bearer over many Score or Hundred Churches: And least of all take upon him to Govern and judge of Kings and Kingdoms and all the World, as the Roman deceiving Tyrant doth.</p>

the whole work of Life, for which many hundred years are not too long if God should so long spare and trie us. And all that I have hitherto said to you, for Faith Love and Obedience, upon the Creed, Lords Prayer and Commandements, is to teach you how to prepare for Death. And though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound Conversion at last, may tend to Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to them that have lived a careless wicked Life; Yet the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>surest,</hi> the <hi>Wisest</hi> Preparation, is that which is made by the whole course of a holy obedient heavenly Life. <note n="a" place="bottom">Phil. 2. 12.

                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What Life is it that is the best Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. When we have so well considered of the certain Vanity of this World, and all its pleasures, and of the truth of Gods Promises of the Heavenly Glory, as that by Faith we have there placed our chiefest Hopes, and there expect our chief Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make it our chief business in this world to seek it, preferring no worldly thing before it, but resolved for the hopes of it to forsake them all when God requireth it: This is the first part of our preparation for Death. <note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>II. When we believe that this mercy is given by Christ the Mediator between God and Man, and trust in his Merits and Intercession with the Father, and take him for our Teacher also and our Ruler, resolving to obey his Word and Spirit. This is the second part of our preparation for Death. <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Cor. 4. 16, 18. Ioh. 3. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:60383:230"/>III. When the Holy Spirit hath shed abroad Gods Love upon our hearts, and turned their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a habit of Love to God and Holiness, and given us a Victory over that Love of the World and fleshly Prosperity and Pleasure which ruleth in the hearts of Carnal men, though yet our Love shew it self but in such Mortification, and endeavour, and grief for what we want, we are prepared for a safe Death. <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 17. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 8. 9, 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if the foretasts of Heavenly Glory, and sense of the Love of God, do make our thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sweeter to us than our thoughts of our Earthly hopes, and cause us out of Love to God and our glorified Redeemer and his Church; and out of love to a Life of perfect Knowledge, Love and Joy, to long to depart and be with Christ; then we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not only for a safe but a joyful Death. <note n="e" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 1, 3, 8. Phil. 1. 21, 23.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> O! But this is a great and difficult work?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not too hard for the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and a Soul renewed by it. It is our great foll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> and naughtiness that maketh it hard: Why e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> should it be hard for a man that loveth: himself, and knoweth how quickly a Grave, and rotting in the Dark must end all his pleasures in this World, to be earnestly desirous of a better after it. And why should it be hard for one that believeth that mans Soul is immortal, and that God hath sent one from Heaven who is greater than Angels to purchase it for us and promise it to us, and give us the first fruits by his Holy Spirit; to rejoyce that he dyeth not as an unpardoned Sinner, nor
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:60383:230"/>
as a Beast, but shall live in perfect Life and Light, and Love and Joy and Praise for ever; What should rejoyce a believing considering man like this? <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 6, 8. 1 Thes. 5. 16. Phil. 2. 16, 17, 18. &amp; 4. 4. Heb. 3. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> O! But we are still apt to doubt of things unseen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. You can believe <hi>Men</hi> for things unseen, and be certain by it; for instance, that there is such a place as <hi>Rome, Paris, Venice,</hi> that there have been such Kings of <hi>England</hi> as <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. King <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp;c. You know not but by believing others, whether ever you were Baptized, nor who was your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother: 2. You see not your own Soul, nor any ones that you talk with; and yet you feel and see such things as may assure any Sober man that he hath a Soul. God is not seen by us, yet nothing is more certain than that there is a God.</p>
               <p>3. We see Plants, Flowers, Fruits, and all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Acts, produced by an unseen Power: we see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast, lucid, glorious Regions above us; and we see and feel the effects of invisible powers: therefore to doubt of things because they are <hi>unseen,</hi> is to doubt of all the vital noblest part of the World, and to believe nothing but gross and lowest things; and to lay by Reason and become Bruits. But of this I have said more near the Beginning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> What should we do to get the Soul so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar above, as to desire to be with Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I. We must not live in a foolish forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Death; nor flatter our Souls into delayes and dulness, by the expectations of long life on
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:60383:231"/>
Earth, the grave must be studied till we have groundedly got above the fears of it.</p>
               <p>II. We must not rest quiet in such a humane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Gospel and the Life to come, as hath no better grounds than the common opinion of the Countrey where we live, as the <hi>Turks</hi> believe <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his <hi>Alcoran:</hi> for this leaveth the Soul in such doubts and uncertainty as cannot reach to solid Joy, nor Victory over the World and Flesh: But the true Evidences of the Gospel and our Hopes must be well digested, which I have opened to you in the beginning, of which I give you a breviate in two Sentences.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The History of the Gospel of Christs Life, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, sending down the Spirit, the Apostles Miracles, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Writing and Sufferings, is a true History: Else there is none sure in the World: for none of such Antiquity hath greater Evidence.</item>
                  <item>2. And if the History aforesaid be true, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> must needs be true: for it is part of the History, and owned and sealed certainly by God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>III. We must not be content to be once satisfied of the Truth of the Life to come, but we must men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally live upon it and for it: and know how great business our Souls have every day, with our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Lord, and the Glorified Society of Angels and the perfected Spirits of the just, and with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God of Love and Glory: We must daily fetch thence the motives of our desires, hopes and dutyes, the incentives of our Love and Joy. The Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="bottom">(g) Phil. 3. 18, 19, 20. Col. 3. 1, 2, 3. Heb. 13. 22, 23, 24.</note>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:60383:231"/>
of all Temptations from the Flesh and World; and our supporting patience in all our Sufferings and Fears. Read oft <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 22, 23, 24. &amp; 20. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 19, 20, 21, 33. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4, 5. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17. &amp; 5. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 21, 23. &amp; 3. 18, 19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They that thus live by Faith on God and Glory, will be prepared for a joyful death.</p>
               <p>IV. We must take heed that no worldly Hope or Pleasure, vitiate our Affections, and turn them down from their true delight. <note n="h" place="bottom">Eph. 3. 17, 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>V. We must live wholly upon Christ, his Merit, Sufficiency, Love and Mediation; His <hi>Cross</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> must be the summe of our <hi>Learning,</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Content. <note n="i" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>VI. We must take heed of grieving the Spirit of Consolation, and wounding our Consciences, by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin of Omission or Commission.</p>
               <p>VII. We must Faithfully improve all our Time and Talents to do God all the Service, and others all the good that we can in the World; that we may be ready to give an account of our Stewardship.</p>
               <p>VIII. We must be armed against Temptations to unbelief and despair.</p>
               <p>IX. We must while we are in the Body in our daily thoughts fetch as much help from sensible Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes as we can, to have a suitable Imagination of the Heavenly Glory. And one of the most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar is, that which Christ calleth the <hi>Coming of the Kingdom</hi> of God, which was his Transfiguration with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in Glorious appearance in the Holy Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 1. Which made <hi>Peter</hi> say, <hi>It's
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:60383:232"/>
good to be here.</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">Mat. 17. 4.</note> Christ purposely so appeared to them to give them a sensible apprehension of the Glory which he hath promised. And <hi>Moses</hi> that was buried appeared there in a Glorified Body.</p>
               <p>And we must not think only of God but of the Heavenly Society, and even our old Acquaintance, that our Minds may find the more Suitableness and Familiarity in their objects and Contemplations.</p>
               <p>X. We must do our best to keep up that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vivacity and Chearfulness, which may be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for Spiritual Employment: for when the Body is diseased with Melancholy, Heaviness, or Pains, and the Mind diseased with Griefs, Cares and Fears, it will be hard to think joyfully of God or Heaven or any thing.</p>
               <p>XI. We must exercise our selves in those dutyes which are nearest kin to the work in Heaven. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially labouring to excite Hope, Love and Joy by Faith, and Praising God, especially in Psalms in our Families and the sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Assemblies, and using the most Heavenly Books and Company.</p>
               <p>XII. We must not look when all is done to have very clear Conceptions of the quality and acts of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Souls, or the World of Spirits; But must be satisfied with an implicite Trust in our Father and our Glorified Lord, in the things which are yet above our reach: And giving up Soul and Body to him, we should joyfully trust them with him as his own: And believe that while we know as much as may bring us well to Heaven, it is best for us that the rest is known by Christ, in whose Hand and Will we are surer and better than in our own.</p>
