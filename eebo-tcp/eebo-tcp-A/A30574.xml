            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God takes it exceeding ill at his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hands to be mealy mouthed, when his wrath is incenſed; and therefore he calls the Watchmen that did not give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by an ignominious name, <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MB DOGS, that cannot bark,</hi>

To forſake that God that made us, and to make that to be a God unto us that we have made our ſelves: The Father looks upon his Child as inferior to him, becauſe he was the inſtrument of his being, and ſo he may well: If any man have maintainance by one, or is raiſed by him, he expect that he ſhould be ſerviceable to him.<note place="margin">Idolatry drives men againſt principls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of reaſon.</note> Only Idolatry makes men go againſt the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon: They made it and yet they accounted it their god,</p>
                     <p>And an eſpecial Note from hemce it, <hi>That man by any work of his own cannot put a Divinity upon a creature.</hi> They made it, therefore it is not God. Man by any work that he can do cannot put Divinity upon a creature, no, he cannot ſo much as put holineſs into a creature; all the workmanſhip of man by his conſecratien or any thing that he can do, cannot make ſtones and mortar to be holy, ſo as now it ſhould be a ſin to uſe them to any<note n="*" place="margin">in caſe of need.</note> common uſe, man takes too much upon him to think to raiſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo near to a Divinity, he cannot by any work of his put any Religious reſpect on any creature ſo as that God ſhall be neerer to him, or he neerer to God than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.

                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed there is a creation of man that the Scripture ſpeaks of that is called, <hi>God,</hi> but not truly, not God really, rather a Metaphorical God;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.

                     <p>If all the Art, and Skill, Power and Riches, if all the men in the world were put together, and all the wiſdom and power of Angels joyned to it, to extract all excellency in all things in all creatures, and to make that which ſhould have all created excellency in it, yet this ſurely could not be a God to us; I ſay, if we conceive all art, skill power, and riches, of all the world brought together into one man, yea, all the skill and power of Angels put into him too, and if he were able to make an extract of all the excellencies of all creatures, and put into one thing, yet this could not be a God unto us; becauſe it was made. And ſhall we ſay further, God himſelf by his infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer cannot make any thing to be a God to us: I ſay, God himſelf by his infinite power cannot make any thing to be a God to us; if he himſelf were made he could not be God to us; nay, if God himſelf were made he could not be God: therefore ſurely that which the workman hath made cannot be a God.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104281:37"/> not bleſs themſelves now? No, God watches them there, and curſes them in the very bud. I but what if it comes to meal, that it's ready now to come to a full iſſue, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy even to come to be eaten, now that they come to feed upon their projects, and they think all is ſure? No, the curſe of God is upon them there, ſtrangers ſhall devour it. Bleſſed be that God who hath followed our Adverſaries this way, How often have they bleſt themſelves, and when they have had one deſign, this will do it, Oh how finely it works! and perhaps they get the very advantage that they themſelves deſire, and think all is well, and then Gods Curſe comes upon them. We are my brethren too unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, we are ready to fear if we hear but of any thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any plot and project of our Adverſaries, if any ſtalk doth appear, and eſpecially if they begin to bud, Oh! then we think they ripen; &amp; we do not look up to the great God who doth take delight in blaſting the projects of the Adverſaries; as the Bleſſing of God is upon the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his people, ſo the Curſe of God is upon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked projects of his enemies. God may ſeem many times to leave many a good action, but God doth carry it through at length, though it ſeems to have many things that would cruſh it in the very bud, yet God carries good projects through many difficulties, and God cruſhes wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked projects through much proſperity.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104281:45"/> ground for thoſe that have profeſt themſelves to be godly rather to withdraw themſelves from the afflicted Saints, and ſeek correſpondence with wicked men that proſper. God would have his people ſee an al ſufficiency in himſelf in their ſadeſt condition, ſo as they need not go out from him for help, but ſtill wait upon him and keep his way; the Lord by his Prophet rebukes <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in <hi>2 Chron. 19. 2.</hi> for loving the ungodly and helping them that hate the Lord. And is there not as great an evil to ſeek the love of the wicked and ungodly and help from them that hate the the Lord? certainly the evil is very great, it argues very little love that we have to God, it charges God of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, as if though he hath engaged himſelf to his people, yet he would leave them in the lurch; this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the wicked in their wicked waies, and it charges God with that which is accounted one of the moſt vile things among men. What is accounted one of the vileſt things among men, that a man ſhould ſet another men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his work, and then leave them in the lurch when they meet with troubles in their work? It is as vile a thing as any is among men, and we ſhould look upon ſuch men as ſhould imploy others in any ſervice and then leave them to ſhift for themſelves in their ſtraights, we ſhould look upon them as vile men, unworthy to be dealt withal. Now what would we but charge God with this, even that which makes men to be moſt vile?</p>
                     <p>And this beſides is a moſt <hi>deſperaee folly</hi> ſo to do, for when thou art thinking to provide for thy ſelf by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with ungodly men, it may be thou wert juſt at the very point of deliverance at that very time; it is Gods uſual way to come to help his people when they are in the greateſt ſtraights; and therefore it is the greateſt folly that when we are in ſtraights then to think of ſhifting courſes, ſo that then we muſt forſake our own mercy in thinking of ſhifting courſes; in ſtraights above all times Chriſtians ſhould take heed of thinking of ſhifting courſes, becauſe

                        <hi>Who is meant by the King of Princes.</hi> We are here to underſtand the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> becauſe he was a great King whoſe Nobles were Princes, and we find this both by Scripture and likewiſe by humane Story; in <hi>2 King. 18. 24.

                     <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Burthen.</note> 
                        <hi>What was this burden?</hi> This burden was thoſe Taxes that were upon the people, whereby they maintained their correſpondence with this King of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> correſpondence with wicked men it is burdenſom: for the the more they are ſought to, and yeelded to, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the more burdenſom they are: and whatſoever they do for you for a while, it is indeed to ſerve their own ends, and this they brought upon themſelves: for they would go to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and they found the Aſſyrians to be burdenſom to them.</p>
                     <p>When men will follow their own waies,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> Follow not thine own waies.</note> and think to have more eaſe in their own way than in Gods, it is juſt they ſhould find thoſe waies to be burdenſom to them. I am perſwaded there is not one in this Congregation but hath found the experience of this; when you think your waies will bring more eaſe to you than Gods waies, have not you found your waies burdenſom?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But thirdly,</hi> When was this fulfilled? <hi>If we would know
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104281:47"/> the meaning of the Prophet we muſt refer to the Hiſtory of the</hi> Kings, <hi>and in</hi> 2 Kings, 15. 19. <hi>there you may find when this Propheſie was fulfil'd.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Burden of the King of Princes.</note> 
                        <hi>Why doth the holy Ghoſt ſay, The burden of the King of Princes?</hi> In ſpeaking of the burden that was upon the people he doth give the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſuch an Epithite? Why it ſeems to be a dimunition of their burden rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aggravation; for he ſpeaks of ſorrowing but a little, as if it ſhould not be ſo great a burden as afterwards ſhould be upon them, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing thus, That they were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened a while with Taxations from a great King, but they ſhould afterwards come under the power, to be at the wils &amp; luſts of al kind of baſe people, of the very dregs of people: And it is not ſo great an evil to be under the power of men of rank and quality, no not under their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as to be under the oppreſſion of many people, of people that are of very mean quality and condition, the very refuſe of a Nation, to come to be under their power it's a great deal worſe.</p>
                     <p>And by the way this Note it ſhould teach us, even thoſe that are of mean breeding, and whoſe lives have been very low in the world, of mean condition, if they be put into place of any power and Authority, to take heed how they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104281:48"/> behave themſelves, for their oppreſſion will be the moſt grievous to an ingenuous ſpirit that poſſibly can be. And there is a great deal of danger in them to grow more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing than other men that were born to greatneſs, and their oppreſſion wil be ſo intolerable as wil bring the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt confuſion that poſſibly can be if that be not well lookt to. And therefore here when he would leſſen the burden, (ſaith he) you ſhall ſorrow a little for tht burden of the King of Princes.</p>
                     <p>But what is it? You ſhall ſorrow a little. They complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but ſaith God, what do you complain of this? this is but a little burden to that which you are like to have, there's another manner of burden a coming for you than this; and from hence the Notes are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>When ſinners have brought trouble upon themſelves they will complain much, exceedingly troubled;</hi> but when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they are to conſider, that what they feel it is but a little to what's coming after. There are burdens upon you, and you are complaining of theſe burdens, as if ſo be that they were the greateſt that ever were upon people,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Uſe.</hi> Admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Engl.</hi>
                        </note> Oh ſinner! conſider of this when you are complaining of your burdens, know, that theſe burdens that are upon you may prove to be but very trifles in compariſon of what's like to come upon you afterwards, for that's the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt here, <hi>They ſhall ſorrow a little for this burden,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, There is other manner of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row coming after, and ſo it did, for afterwards the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> carried them all away captives, and the baſeſt of all the people came even to ſet their feet upon them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the holy Ghoſt, This is but a little: I ſpeak to thoſe that make not up their peace with God; and do not upon thoſe burdens that are upon them return to God. As the mercies of God to his Saints, that which now they have is but a little, they may be ſaid to rejoyce a little for the mercy that now they have. And ſo the burdens upon the ungodly they are but a little, but if they return not to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104281:48"/> God upon what they feel, God hath greater burdens than thoſe are that they ſo vex and fret under.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Obſ. 2</note> Taxes and Impoſitions upon mens eſtates are but a little burden in compariſon of being brought under the power of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Though there be ſore Taxes upon you,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> as here there was fifty ſhekels of ſilver laid upon every man that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but thoſe Taxes are but little burdens in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of being given up to the power of the Enemy, they would lay burdens indeed upon us, burdens upon our Conſciences, all our Eſtates, all our Lives, all our Liberties, whatſoever we are or have muſt be under their mercy; now we are troubled, but then their little finger will be more heavy than the loins that now we find to be upon us; although we dare not ſay but ſome may find burdens very ſore upon them for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>A third Note,<note place="margin">Obſ. 3.</note> is this; <hi>That, as Taxes are a burden, but a little in compariſon, ſo the carrying of our Brethren into captivity:</hi> Though we enjoy our Eſtates our ſelves, yet if God laies his hand upon any of our Brethren though in remote parts of the Kingdom, Oh we ſhould account this to be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As not only their Taxations was a burden, but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away of their Brethren that were beyond the River.</p>
                     <p>If there were no other ſin among us, it were juſt with God to bring the Enemy upon us, and then we ſhould find that there were other manner of burdens.</p>
                     <p>But there is another burden that we are not ſenſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of, and that is the captivity of our Brethren in the remote parts of this Land. Oh! how little ſenſible are we of it becauſe we feel it not our ſelves?</p>
                     <p>The fourth Note from hence is this,<note place="margin">Obſ. 4</note> 
                        <hi>That it's Gods mercy when we are running on to our utter ruin, not to ſuffer us to plung our ſelves irrecoverably into miſery, but to bring leſſer evils upon us that by them we may come to bethink our ſelves, and if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevent greater.</hi> You ſhall ſorrow a little, I will not undo you preſently; but return to me, or elſe you are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104281:49"/> undone, but this is my Mercy, I wil bring afflictions upon you by piece-meal,<note place="margin">[in that generality that they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away]</note> and if you do not return to me, then you ſhall be utterly loſt; for ſo this people were, they were carried away captive and never returned to this very day. Oh! doth God come to you in your family, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or eſtate? Oh! let us conſider of this.</p>
                     <p>And this is the laſt note from it:<note place="margin">Obſ. 5</note> 
                        <hi>The conſideration of little burdens which is upon us to what might be, ſhould cauſe us to turn to God;</hi> it ſhould break our hearts, and cauſe us to ſeek the face of God, that we may prevent greater evils, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will certainly come; the Lord in his dealing towards us ſeems as if he were loth to loſe us, and that this Nation ſhould periſh, Oh that this might work kindly upon our hearts to prevent greater evils, that we might not be made a ſpectacle of the wrath of God to all the Nations that are round about us.</p>

                     <hi>the Ark of the Teſtimony, before the Mercy-ſeat.</hi> It was to ſtand in the holy of holieſt, but juſt before the Vail, right againſt the Mercy-ſeat; and by this you muſt be helped to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Scripture in <hi>Heb. 9. 4.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 4.</note> which (as ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it) ſeems to have ſome variety from this,<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> it is ſaid that the holieſt of all had the golden Cenſer, by which they underſtand the golden Altar, in which the Cenſer was; but we ſhall find that the golden Altar did not ſtand in the holy of holieſt, for we reade in <hi>Exod. 30. 6. And thou ſhalt put it before the Vail that is by the Ark of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, before the Mercy-ſeat;</hi> that is, over the Teſtimony. And therefore Interpreters reconcile it thus: it is not ſaid here that the golden Cenſer or Altar (if we ſo take it) was in it, but it had it, that is, it was for the uſe of the holy of holieſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Beza, <hi>not</hi> Major</note> and it ſtood juſt before the holy of holieſt, and juſt againſt the Mercy-ſeat, ſo that the high Prieſt when he was to enter into the holy of holieſt he was to take a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and Incenſe from this Altar, and ſo go into the holieſt of all.</p>
                  <p>But this is the Note, in that the Altar of Incenſe ſtands juſt againſt the Mercy-ſeat, and yet there is a Vail between the Mercy-ſeat and it. So when we are to offer up our Incenſe upon the Merits of Chriſt and his Interceſſion, though we cannot by the eye of our bodies ſee the Mercy-ſeat, yet we muſt act our faith upon the Mercy-ſeat; and then that's obſervable, that the Incenſe muſt be burnt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Altar at that very time when the Lamps were to be trim'd and lighted, ſo you ſhall obſerve it in <hi>Exod. 30. 7.</hi> and that was to note thus much to us: That we are to joyn the Word with our Prayers, and not to come igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to God, but labor to enlighten our ſouls with the Lamp of his Word, when we come to offer up our Incenſe to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104281:52"/> Further, There is a command that no ſtrange Incenſe ſhall be offered upon it. This is to teach us thus much: That we muſt take heed of bringing any thing to God to offer him in Prayer, but what comes from the Spirit of God, only Gods own Incenſe; Take heed (I ſay) of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unſanctified parts, or any thing but that which is from the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Once a year an atonement was made upon the horns of the Altar, with the blood of the Sin-offering; though the Sin offering was not offered upon it, yet once a year an atonement was made upon it with the blood of the Sin-offering. This is to note thus much: <hi>That even by our Incenſe we defile the Altar what in us lies.</hi> And thus I have a little digreſt, and yet it is ſtill for opening of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to you, to ſhew unto you the meaning of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>The Altar of burnt-offerings did typifie this: <hi>That Chriſt was to be the only Sacrifice;</hi> there ſhould be no other ſacrifice to pacifie Gods wrath but only Jeſus Chriſt, who was both the Sacrifice indeed, and the Altar its ſelf, for his human Nature was offered to God upon the Merits, as it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worthineſs of his divine Nature: <hi>Heb. 9. 14. How much more ſhall the blood of Jeſus Chriſt who through the eternal Spirit offered Himſelf without ſpot to God &amp;c.</hi> This Altar did ſignifie the offering of Jeſus Chriſt. As if God ſhould ſay, Know that what endeavors you do or can uſe to ſatisfy my Juſtice, and my wrath it is to no purpoſe, there's nothing but only my Son and that offering that ſhall ſatisfie my wrath: and now for them to make more Altars, it was to deny that great point of Religion that there was only the Sacrifice of Chriſt to ſatisfie God.<note place="margin">2. No ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation but by him</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſignified, <hi>That in Chriſt only our ſervices
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104281:52"/> which are our ſpiritual ſacrifices are accepted of God;</hi> there muſt be no Altar, but this for the ſacrifice, and the other for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; God would have this Doctrine kept pure from that time and ſo ever after, that none of our ſpiritual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices can be accepted any other way but only as they have reference to Jeſus Chriſt that Altar that the Lord hath appointed.</p>

Now for my part, I know none living that holds a National Church in theſe daies in this ſenſe, that is to be of Divine Inſtitution, and joyned in one, by Gods commanding any National Worſhip for them.<note place="margin">yet in ſome ſenſe.</note> Where there are in Nations a great many of the Saints of God, that they may be called a National Church we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute not againſt that; but people when they talk of a National Church, do not conceive the meaning of it; Certainly this was a ſpecial end why God would have them come to this one Altar, it was to be the bond of the National Church, that they ſhould have ſuch a worſhip wherein they were all of them to joyn in one, and this it was that made them a National Church: It is not enough to have the ſame kind of worſhip; as now, we al pray, and reade the Word in all Congregations, we have all the ſame Sacraments, but they muſt joyn in one individual worſhip. If the Nation of the Jews had worſhiped the ſame God after the ſame manner, in divers Temples, and upon divers Altars, this had not been a National bond to them; but by coming up to the ſame Temple, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon the ſame Altars, and when the Sacrifice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104281:53"/> was offered for them all, they were joyned in the very act, all of them in that one thing, this was the thing that did unite them into a Church-union in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than any Church-union can be in this world, til we have ſuch a kind of Inſtitution as they had. We have no Inſtitution for worſhip but where people may perſonally joyn together: but for thouſands of Congregations to be bound by Inſtitution to joyn in the very ſame bond of worſhip, in the very ſame individual act, ſuch an union we have not in theſe daies, and without the underſtanding of this aright, we underſtand not the ſcope why they had but one Altar for burnt offerings, and one Altar for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But now it may be ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note> That it doth not ſeem to be ſuch a ſin to erect Altars, for that's the ſin charged upon Ephraim, That they did erect many other Altars; for the Scripture ſpeaks of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Altars that were Gods Altars,<note place="margin">1 King. 19</note> 
                     <hi>1 King, 19.</hi> you know it is the complaint of <hi>Elias</hi> that they had caſt down Gods Altars, <hi>They have caſt down thine Altars;</hi> now this was ſpoken after the time of the Law when there was but only two Altars appointed by God, and the Prophet did not mean them, the Altar for burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Incenſe.</p>

                     </note> That this is ſpoken of thoſe Altars that the Patriarks and others had built for the honor of God to ſacrifice upon, before the time that the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for that one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Altar of ſacrifice, (and here he complains they had caſt down thoſe Altars) for it was Lawful before the command was given to build divers Altars, but after the command was given, it was not.</p>

                     <hi>but ſtill the Objection will be,</hi> How could it be a ſin to caſt down thoſe Altars when they were of no further Religious uſe? for after the Command of God for that one Altar, then the other were to be demoliſhed; Was it not commended in the godly Kings that they caſt down high Places, and cut down Groves? though ſome of them formerly were for the true Worſhip of God, yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104281:53"/> after God had appointed a peculiar place for His Worſhip and thoſe other places were abuſed to ſuperſtition, then they were to be caſt down; and ſo there's no queſtion to be made but all other Altars that were built for Religious uſes were to be caſt down, after Gods own Altars were made.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer to it therefore is this;<note place="margin">2. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>Anſ.</hi>
                     </note> That the evil that <hi>Elijah</hi> complains of, it was the prophaneſs of the people, their caſting off all fear and reverence of God; becauſe they did not caſt down thoſe Altars out of love to God, and his Worſhip, upon this Principle, that they would not ſuffer any thing that might be dangerous to ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that was not the Principle whereby they were acted in caſting them down, but they caſt them down as led thereunto by malice and rage againſt Religion, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their luſts; and thus if men oppoſe that which is indeed ſuperſtitious, yet if it be not out of a true love to God and his Honor,<note place="margin">A good act in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be evil in the doer.</note> if it be not out of a deſire to ſet up and to maintain the true Worſhip of God, but in a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rage, meerly out of ſelf-ends to pleaſe themſelves in a way of revenge, or through any diſtemper, though (I ſay) the thing be evil that theſe men do oppoſe, yet God will not own it as any ſervice to him, it is a ſin in them to caſt down that which ſhould be caſt down, if they do not caſt it down out of a right and gracious Principle; Then what evil is it for men in bitterneſs of ſpirit to oppoſe that which is in its ſelf good, if God account it ſin to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that which which ſhould be oppoſed, if it be through bitterneſs of ſpirit, and not through gracious Principles.</p>

                        <hi>They uſe the Law as a ſtranger,</hi> that is, they uſe the Law <hi>ſlightly,</hi> only for their own turns: As uſually men when ſtrangers comes into their Country, (thoſe that have been ſtrangers in other Countries know it) that the Natives of the Country they uſe them ſlightly, but if they do ſeem to ſhew any reſpect unto them it is meerly for their own turns: As they may have any advantage by them ſo far they ſhew reſpect to them and no further.

                        <hi>That ſuperſtitious people who are forward and zealous in their own way of Worſhip, yet they are very ſlight and negligent in Gods way of Worſhip, little regard that.</hi> Indeed their own Altars they were accounted <hi>great things,</hi> that way which they appointed themſelves, they did not care what coſt they were at in that way; but as for Gods way, that was as a <hi>ſtrange thing</hi> unto them. We have ſeen it very evident, and do ſee it in great part to this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104281:69"/> day, how thoſe that are very zealous in ſuperſtitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are the moſt negligent in Gods way of Worſhip; to inſtance:<note place="margin">Confirmed from the late times in England</note> you know in late times, what a deal of ſtir did men make with their own forms of Worſhip, with their own Ceremonies and Waies of Worſhip which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? how zealous were they in them, and devout were they in them? when they came in publick Congregations to bow and cring, and for other Ceremonies that they ſaid were only for the decency of Gods Worſhip, how ſtiff were they in them, that the mouths of the moſt Godly Miniſters muſt be ſtop'd if they would not conform to them? But even theſe men would ſcorn and jeer at ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Gods Waies, and ſlight any man that would be conſciencious in the Waies of God, and they were Rebels that ſhould not yeild to a Ceremony, becauſe it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to Magiſtracy.

And mark it, thoſe people that ſtand moſt upon ſuch Feſtivals, they ſtand leaſt upon Gods Sabbaths; and indeed you ſhall have many people which think it a ſtrange thing for men not to have regard to ſuch Feſtivals, Why may not we keep the birth of our Savior! Now that you might not think it a ſtrange thing do but conſider of this, that when God

                     <p>I anſwer:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> firſt, It was in them a ſin of <hi>Hypocriſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſin of <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſin of Hypocriſie in this,<note place="margin">Their ſin in building Temples.</note> In that they would perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe that would go to worſhip at the true Temple, and yet that they would beſtow ſo much coſt in building <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Temples of their own. And many of the Antients have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> many large invectives againſt al ſuch as ſhal beſtow a great deal of outward buildings, and yet let the poor Saints want.</p>
                     <p>2. It was Superſtition in them, they would not go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Temple that God had appointed, yet they would ſet up Temples of their own. There are many that hate the true Temple, and the true Church, that is, the Communion of Saints, yet magnifie the outward buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as if there were no other Church but only that.

                     <p>But wherein was the ſuperſtition for them to build Temples?<note place="margin">How ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in them to build Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus: It is ſuperſtition for any men to put holineſs in any buildings of their own. There were Three things
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104281:80"/> that made the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> an holy Temple; and none of them can be attributed to any other place in the world.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">what made the Temple at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Holy, and Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it.</note> It was ſet apart by God, ſo as it was a ſin to make any other uſe of it but holy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It did ſanctifie the very duties that were performed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It was a type of Jeſus Chriſt. There were Theſe three things that were proper to the Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">No argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from thence for the holineſs of Churches</note> And therefore you muſt learn for ever from hence, that there can be no argument drawn from the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the holineſs of Temples now.</p>
                     <p>1. It is a ſuperſtition in any man to ſet apart a place ſo as it ſhould be a ſin to make uſe of it for any common thing.</p>
                     <p>2. Which is worſe, and that is, For any man to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part a place ſo as to think that the very place ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the duty, becauſe the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did ſo: Now for a man to think that his prayers are ſanctified, becauſe they are within ſuch a building as this is,<note place="margin">Praying in Churches no more accepted, unleſs with the holy Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition: hence a company of poor ignorant people they muſt go behind a piller and pray, as if they were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the more becauſe of the place. It's true, when we come and joyn with the Church, then our prayers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, becauſe it is in a way of Ordinance.

This would be a great Point to ſhew how the ſins of the Profeſſors of Religion are worſe than others, and therefore it is not enough for you to ſay, We are all ſinners: No, we muſt not excuſe our ſelves in this, that others are guilty as well as we, Oh! but conſider what aggravations there is of thy ſin more than there is of the ſins of others; It is a ſign of a very car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart to think to go away thus, it's true, I ſin, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſin as well as I do; yea, but a true penitent heart wil not only conſider that he is a ſinner, but what aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are there upon his ſin more than upon the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? and ſo will lay it upon their hearts, It's true, ſuch and ſuch ſin, but had they what I have had, it would not be ſo with them; my ſin that hath broken through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terrors of conſcience, and that God hath ſought by ſuch means to keep me from my ſin, it is a ſign of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my ſpirit indeed that hath broken through ſo much as I have done: it is therefore an abominable thing to make our profeſſion in holy Duties a Medium to make our ſins leſs, Doeſt thou think that this is a means to make thee eſcape that wrath? Certainly this is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy ſins.</p>
                     <p>We have a generation of men among us,<note place="margin">Some <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> noted.</note> that becauſe they are Beleevers, therefore they need no ſorrow for their ſin, they muſt have only joy.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104281:91"/> of ſome other people are, yet it is not alwaies an argument that we may rejoyce as other people.</p>

We have ſuch examples in Scripture, as in the example of <hi>Saul,</hi> the thing that God caſt away <hi>Saul</hi> for, in its ſelf it was not ſo much as that which <hi>David</hi> had been guilty of, he had been guilty of groſer ſins than that which God caſt away <hi>Saul</hi> for,<note place="margin">Inſtanced in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Saul</hi> might have ſaid, this is an offence, but is this like Murder and Adultry? What if it be not, God will pardon <hi>David,</hi> and caſt away <hi>Saul.</hi> Oh! do not you think to rejoice as other people do; Why, may not God do with his mercie as he pleaſes, it is his own; God may pardon one, and damn thee eternally: And therefore let no ſinner pleaſe himſelf with what others do, for he is not to do as others do.

                  <p>In their offerings there was wont to be Wine and Oyl; to note cheerfulneſs in Gods ſervice: thus in <hi>Numb. 15. 5. The fourth part of an Hyn of Wine for a drink offering ſhalt thou

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> This makes an affliction to be bitter and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous indeed, <hi>That all joy and comfort in Gods ſervice is gone;</hi> for that's the ſcope, <hi>They ſhall offer no Wine offerings,</hi> all their joy in the ſervice of God ſhall be gone; they ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſorrow in their outward afflictions that are upon them, but every time they come to think of any ſervice of God their hearts ſhall be dejected, all their joy in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God ſhall be taken away: there was a time when ſome of you were wont to offer Wine offerings to the Lord, that is, to have much joy and comfort in the ſervice of God, but is not all gone? where's your Wine offerings to the Lord? you can now perform duties, but your hearts are heavy and dul in the performance of them, there's no ſweetneſs, there's no enlargement of ſpirit in holy duties, all the Worſhip of God is a burden now unto you. Now there is no burden of affliction ſo great a burden as when the duties of Gods Worſhip comes to be a burden. The Saints, ſo long as they have a Wine offering for the Lord in holy duties, ſo long as their ſpirits in holy duties can be free and joyful, their afflictions are not very burdenſom, they are well enough, this is more delightful to them than all the Wine in the world, for they can ſay of Gods love, <hi>They love is better than Wine;</hi> ſo they can ſay of their love to God again, <hi>That our love unto him is more comfortable to us than any Wine in the world;</hi> Now though they be in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their eſtates are gone, that they have no Wine to drink themſelves, yet they have a Wine offering to offer unto the Lord. It's no great matter though we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104281:97"/> have not Wine as we were wont to have at our Tables, but when we go to worſhip God, we have a Wine offering for him at any time; and this makes glad the hearts of the Saints more than the hearts of all the men in the world can be glad when their Corn, and Wine, and Oyl encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <hi>They ſhall offer no Wine offerings; neither ſhall they be pleaſing unto him;</hi> they ſhall not be ſweet to him, whatſoever their offerings be. Now that they offer to the Lord, God will take no delight in them, they will be but ſowre things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the palate of God, the offerings of the Saints in Gods way they do cheer the very heart of God; And hence is the reaſon of that phraſe that we have,<note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 13 enlightned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Thou haſt a cup of Wine for thy friend to cheer him, but haſt thou a cup of Wine for God to cheer his heart? that is a gracious holy offering unto God: Surely that which is moſt ſweet to the Soul of God ſhould be moſt ſweet to our ſouls:<note place="margin">Duties of Religion, a Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</note> You would wonder to hear a man ſay that he takes as much delight, and he can recreate himſelf as much in reading, in praying, in hearing Sermons, in holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as you can do in all your good cheer, in playing and drinking of Wine in bowls; you think that men are mad to ſay, that they have as much pleaſure in thoſe things, as playing at Cards, and merriment, and muſick, and good cheer: you call upon them to play at Cards with you, or be merry, you ſay to them, why ſhould you be dumpiſh

Well, it's happy for us to conſider what we do, and to lay to heart what we have done, that ſo in ſuch a day of the Lord as this, we may know what to do; the Servants of God who have walked conſcionably before him, they know what to do in the day of publick cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, They know what to do, they can ſanctifie God Name in his righteous judgments, they can ſee mercy and the love of a Father in the ſoreſt and heavieſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that do befall them.</p>

You can rejoyce now when you are in a Tavern, but in the day of Tribulation, when a diſmal day ſhall come to the world, what will you do then? I thank God I have that that can rejoyce my heart in ſuch a day as this is; and that that I have gotten by the Word, and by prayer, and by the Ordinances, can enable me to do that that you cannot do; that's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that when a man in times of Tribulation can carry himſelf above all, ſo that men or devils are not able to put him in ſuch a caſe as he cannot tell what to do.

                     <p>Thus many who have carnal hearts,<note place="margin">Expoſ.</note> and are not able to bear the evincing and threatning power of the Word in the mouths of the true watchmen, of faithful Miniſters, they ſeek to help themſelves by the opinions &amp; judgments of other Miniſters, and ſo think they are ſafe when they have the opinion and judgment of ſome that are learned, and have repute of godlineſs too, for ſo certainly theſe watchmen had here; and then they can ſet the opinion and judgment of one, againſt the opinion and judgment of the other, they think they are ſafe now and may be quiet, yet this proves a dangerous ſnare.</p>

                        <hi>it is a dangerous thing out of a lothneſs to yeeld to that, to ſeek the opinions of others.</hi> I confeſs when a man hath the opinion and judgments, and if out of love to the truth that he might be confirmed in the Truth, or that he might know fully what the Truth is, for him to ſeek help from others is a good thing; but if out of diſtaſt to a Truth, if becauſe the heart is weary of it, and would fain not have it to be true, becauſe it may bring ſome trouble, upon that ground he goes to ſeek the opinion of ſome other, and hopes before he goes that he ſhall find the opinion of others to be contrary, and ſo he may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to quiet his ſpirit; this is a great ſnare to the ſouls of thoſe that have been guilty of it.</p>

                     <p>And certainly it's a great deal of joy for the Saints to ſee Miniſters of God to have clean ſpirits this way, to have no deſigns of their own, but to ſet up the honor of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong people.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104281:115"/> is a ſnare of a Fowler, and hatred, in the houſe of my God. This is a woful change in places where people have had Watch-men that were godly, wiſe, zealous, faithful with God, but now theſe are gone, they are dead, many of them are baniſhed, and many are with God in Heaven, and they have others now among them, as a juſt Judgment of God who are a ſnare to them, and hatred in the houſe of God, others who do ſucceed theſe bleſſed ſervants of God that are gone, they are like ſtorms, and tempeſts, that do ſucceed fair and Sun-ſhine weather, and if we take it thus for both, the true Prophets in the former part of the verſe, and the falſe Prophets in the other; then there is a ſpecial emphaſis in the change of the phraſe <hi>[my God;</hi> and <hi>his God]</hi> the Watch-man with my God, and hatred in the houſe of his God; the God of the true Watch-men, and the God of the falſe Prophets are not the ſame: thoſe who pretend to worſhip God, and yet worſhip him in a falſe way, they worſhip another God, they have not the ſame God; and no mervail though there is hatred between true Prophets and falſe then; they muſt needs have hatred one againſt another who have divers Gods, <hi>My God,</hi> and <hi>His God,</hi> and yet both pretended to be for the ſame God.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but ſaith the Prophet here, No, whatſoever their pretences are, they teach people the Worſhip of God not in a right way, God is not their God: And who they are that have moſt intereſt in God, let God Himſelf judge; not by giving the one more of the favour of the times than the other; for the falſe Prophets had more of this now: but 1. By the moſt appearing of the Spirit of God in men. 2. By the witneſs of mens conſciences when they are going to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God. And 3.

                     <p>Thirdly, Whereas <hi>Iſrael</hi> thought themſelves holy and devout for God in the multitude of their ſacrifices, and their devotion, and their ſervices that they tendered up to God, yet God looks upon them as filthy and wicked, as the men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> were that committed ſodomy and ſuch kind of filthineſs, ſaith God, <hi>You have corrupted your ſelves as in the daies of</hi> Gibeah; whatſoever your fair ſhews are, and your ſacrifices be that you offer, yet you are lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as thus vile and abominable before God.</p>

                        <hi>That men may have very fair ſhews in the Worſhip of God, and do that which

We do not reade of ſuch abominable filthineſs of body as was in the daies of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> but becauſe of the corruptions of Gods Worſhip that they carried fairly, yet the Lord lookt upon it as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as that was in the daies of <hi>Gibeah.</hi>

Be it known to you, perhaps ſome may be here, or know others of their friends that have had ſuch a hand of God upon them, be but convinced of this one thing which I know you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, That the exerciſe of grace ſutable to this work of God that is now upon thee, or againſt thee, conceive it as thou wilt, I ſay, the exerciſe of thy grace ſutable to this work of God is a greater good to thee than the life of thy child could have been, it could never have done thee that good as the exerciſe of grace may do in this condition when it is ſutable to this ſtroke of God upon thee; and this indeed is the only way to make up any loſſes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or loſs of any goods, be it a child, be it a husband or the deareſt friend, a wife, or thy eſtate, yet the exerciſe of thy grace is better than the enjoiment of them all.

                     <p>Oh! but if this be ſo great an evil for Parents to have their children to be brought forth to the Murderers here, how great an evil then is it for Parents to bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be fewel for Gods wrath for all eternity, to be the firebrands for Gods wrath to burn upon, milions of years to all eternity?

                     <hi>It is no preſumption for one, or for a few to challenge a ſpecial intereſt in God, in way of diſtinction from the multitude, and from the generality.</hi> So it is here: How ſingular was <hi>Hoſea</hi> at this time? This people might think him to be very preſumptuous; What, as if no body had intereſt in God but he, Is not God our God as well as his? He is bold to ſpeak this in way of diſtinction: You may forſake God and His Worſhip, but I have cleaved to God, He is my God. When multitudes and generality of men depart from God, yet for two or three, or a few that cleave to the true Worſhip of God, they may challenge God to be their God when he is none of the God of the multitude.

Yes, <hi>John</hi> knew, and would not be diſcouraged to affirm, that the World did lie in wickedneſs: and yet we know we are of God.</p>
                  <p>Let not men be offended at the fewneſs of thoſe that keep the Truth,<note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and the multitude of thoſe that forſake it. I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104281:151"/> remember <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in the life of <hi>Phocion</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> that upon a time there was an Oracle of <hi>Apollo Delphias</hi> read before the people, which did ſay, That although all the people did agree, yet there was one man amongſt them that diſſented from them: now the people began to ſtartle at this; But <hi>Phocion</hi> ſtepping forth before them all bid them never ſeek further for the man, for it was he that liked none of all their doings; and yet <hi>Phocion</hi> at length gained as much reſpect from them as ever any man did, and they choſe him (I think) fourty times to be Pretor for all that. And ſo let never ſo many go on in a way that thou canſt not ſee light in thy conſcience for, keep to thy principles, only examin them, (ſo far the reſpect we do owe to others muſt lead us) that if there be a greater party go one way than another,<note place="margin">Keep to principles:</note> we ſhould call things into the more neerer ſcrutine,<note place="margin">but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min them:</note> we ſhould think we may poſſibly be rather in an error than they, and we ought to give all due reverence to the judgments of more men, and more learned and wiſe than our ſelves, but ſtill after all,<note place="margin">and pray,</note> praying to God to ſhew us his mind, and ſearching our own hearts to ſee whether there be no particular Engagement,<note place="margin">and ſearth thy heart.</note> and after all endeavors to find out the Truth, And yet then if God doth perſwade your conſciences after all means uſed, we ſhould not be diſcouraged becauſe the greater part go the other way, but keep to that which our conſciences tell us is the right. And thus it was with <hi>Hoſea,</hi> though they went generally another way, yet he could claim a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interſt in God.</p>

Chapter, he tells of ten Culei (that's his word) that an Acre of Vines brought forth in a year, which comes to a matter of eighteen hundred gallons: nay in the 1. Chapter of his 14. Book, he tells of one ſtock, one ſingle Vine, that was planted by <hi>Livia</hi> the Empreſs, that yeelded an hundred and eight gallons of good Wine yeerly. The Vine is a very fruitful thing, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing in the out-ſide. And what fruit indeed is there brought forth to God in the world but by his Churches? and God expects much fruitfulneſs among his people; how ever, as you ſhall hear, they are charged with being empty.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, No plant requires ſo great care as the Vine; What a deal of do is there in dreſſing the Vine and underprop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it, and pruning of it, looking to it continually? and the Lord hath the greateſt care of his people, of his Church: himſelf accounts it no diſhonor to be the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, as he is ſaid to be in <hi>John 15.</hi> and in <hi>Iſa. 27. 3.</hi> you have a moſt admirable expreſſion of Gods taking care of his Church, as his Vine. <hi>I the Lord do keep it: I will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it every moment, leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> I will keep it and I will water it, and every moment leſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt it, I will keep it (again) night and day. And this is the Vinyard that he ſpeaks of in the beginning of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104281:155"/> this Chapter, and it was the Vinyard that brought out red Wine, the beſt ſort of Wine. Thoſe that bring forth the beſt ſort of Wine ſhall have the beſt of Gods care and charge and protection over them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Vine it is the moſt depending creature in the world, it is not able to under-prop its ſelf, but muſt have props more than other Plants,<note place="margin">the ſtrings in the Vine</note> and therefore Nature hath given unto it ſtrings by which it catches hold upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing next it: And ſo the Church, the Church is weak in its ſelf, and is the moſt depending thing in the world, depends upon its props that God affords unto it; you have an excellent place to ſet out that in <hi>Iſa. 27. 2, 3.</hi> ver. there the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of a Vinyard of red Wine, and in the 4. verſe,<note place="margin">Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. 2, 3</note> 
                        <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> which ſhews that there ſhould come a kind of great ſtorm and tempeſt, but he would not have his People to be diſcouraged. <hi>Fury is not in me.</hi> And then in the 5. verſe, <hi>Let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make his peace with me.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">explained.</note> Let him take hold of my ſtrength; that is, ſpeaking to his Church as a Vine, in the time when my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is abroad, yet do you like the Vine, which catches hold upon a pole, and there under-props its ſelf, ſo let him take hold of my power, let him act faith upon my power in time of ſtorms and tempeſts and he ſhall make peace, though he hath never ſo much trouble abroad in the world with others, yet he may, he ſhall have peace with me. That's the nature of the Vine to catch hold upon that which is next it, and eſpecially in time of ſtorms, when the ſtrongeſt Oaks are rent in pieces, yet the Vine catching hold upon the props it hath, reſts there.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If it be not fruitful, it is the moſt unprofitableſt thing in the world.<note place="margin">Ezek. 15. 2</note> I ſuppoſe you know that place in <hi>Ezek. 15. 2. What is the Vine-tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the Forreſt? Shall wood be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof to do any work, or will men take a pin of it to hang any veſſel thereon? Behold, it ſhall be caſt into the fire for fewel;</hi> It
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104281:156"/> is not meet for any work, the Vine is meet for nothing, not to make a pin if it be not fruitful. And no people in the world are ſo unprofitable as Profeſſors of Religion if they bring not forth the fruit of godlineſs, and the world may be rid of them better than any people elſe if they bring not forth their fruit unto God.</p>
                     <p>And then further in the ſixt place, A Vine is the moſt ſpreading plant that is, that ſpreads larger than other plants, and fills a great deal of room with the ſpreading of the branches of it, and ſo you have the Promiſe of the Church in <hi>Iſa. 27. 6.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And then laſtly, The Vine is the moſt tender, ſoft plant, and it is the Emblem of peace, the ſitting under our Vines, it is to ſet forth Peace. And ſo the People of God they ſhould be of tender ſoft ſpirits, not like the Bramble, nor the Thorn full of pricks, if we ſit under Thorns and Brambles we may be prick'd with them; but ſitting under the Vine there is nothing but ſweetneſs and delightfulneſs there: <hi>Iſrael is a Vine;</hi> yea but he is an empty Vine.

                     <p>This ſhews how he comes to be an empty Vine; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods mercy is ſcant to him, but he makes himſelf ſo by his ſin, what juyce &amp; moiſture he hath he doth empty it forth into other things, and ſo is empty.</p>
                     <p>Iſrael was a Vine full of cluſters, refreſhing God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as you heard in the ninth Chapter, that he was to the Lord as Grapes in the Wilderneſs, as a Vine that did bring forth Grapes in the Wilderneſs, that was ſo ſweet to a weary and thirſty traveller. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was once ſuch a one, yea, but now he is come to be an empty Vine, though he grows in the Vinyard of God, and not in the Wilderneſs.</p>

An empty ſpirit is fit for the Devil to come to poſſeſs; <hi>Mat. 12. 24.</hi> he found his place empty, and then he comes in: where the Devil ſees an empty ſpirit, there's a fit place for him to come. It is an evil thing for you to grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods ground and to cumber it, to cumber any part of Gods ground; it may be if thou wert gon, there might be another in thy family, or place, that might bring forth fruit to God; but thou hindereſt, God might have more Rent (as I may ſo ſay) for all his poſſeſſions in the world, the great Rent is, the fruit that the Church brings forth; in <hi>Cant. 8. 11.</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Caut. 8. 11</note> that <hi>Solomon</hi> let out his Vineyard, and it brought him in a thouſand pieces of Silver for the fruit of it. And God he lets out his Vinyard, and his Rent (I ſay) it is the fruit that the Saints bring forth to him; What glory hath God in the world, if thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be his people ſhould be empty?</p>
                     <p>8. God doth not let us sit under empty Vines; our Vines they have bin fruitful Vines, ſhall we then be empty Vines our ſelves?</p>
                     <p>9. The Lord hath juſtly ſtruck this Vine here in <hi>England,</hi> and our Vine bleeds; it bleeds, and is in danger to bleed to death, and what though it doth, it hath brought forth little fruit, and therefore it's juſt with God that he ſhould let this Vine even bleed now to death.</p>
                     <p>10. According to the greatneſs of the opportunities that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath, or any ſociety of men, ſo is the greatneſs of the evil of emptineſs: Oh! now to be empty, when God puts great opportunities of great ſervice into our hands, now to be empty when God expects great ſervices, Oh! it is the moſt vile thing of all. Oh my brethren, that we were but ſenſible of this.</p>
                     <p>But if this be an evil thing to be empty,<note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> than what is it to bring forth the Grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Cluſters of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah?</hi> to bring forth the Wine of the Gall of Aſps, wild Grapes? And yet a great deal of ſuch fruit there hath been brought forth; And truly the fruit that moſt men have
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104281:158"/> brought forth now, they are wild Grapes at the beſt. If men do any thing, yet they do ſo mingle the vanity of prid, the ſowreneſs of their own ſpirits, the rigedneſs of their own nature with what they do, that all is but ſowr before God.</p>
                     <p>Well,<note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note> To conclude this, about the <hi>emptineſs of the Vine:</hi> Oh! let us prize fruitfulneſs more, and ſay as the Vine that is brought in,<note place="margin">Iudg. 9.</note> in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Judges, Shall I leave my Wine which cheereth God and man, and go and reign over you?</hi> Oh ſo, Shall we leave our fruitfulneſs upon any earthly advantage in the world? Let us account it a greater advantage to bring forth much fruit to the glory of God, than to glory in any earthly advantage: No matter what becomes of us, ſo we may be but fruitful; though God dung us, though he caſt all the filth and reproaches in the world upon us, yet if God will make this but cauſe us to be fruitful, it is no great matter.</p>

And therefore certainly, when we have to deal with thoſe that we have had experience to be falſe, we muſt ever retain this concluſion, except we ſee an apparent change in their hearts, for that's not enough that they are willing to take Covenants, that's no new thing; but till we ſee that God hath wrought ſome mighty work upon their hearts we muſt carry this concluſion, Certainly if they can they will ruin us, therefore our condition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſafe but to be ſo as they can do us no hurt.

Now my Brethren, that even Heathens themſelves are convinc'd of this great evil, that is ſo dreadful an evil; what cauſe have we to lay our hands upon our hearts this day in reſpect of that part of our Covenant, that concerns one another, for certainly ſince the time of our ſolemn Covenant there was never more treachery than there hath been in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Scotland</hi> too, there hath been as much treachery ſince that time as ever yet was, ſince either of them were a Nation; we have been falſe one to another ſo far as it relates to our ſelves.</p>

                     <p>That whereas there ſhould be <hi>Righteouſneſs, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as it's expected: behold inſtead of this there ſpings up a crop of <hi>Oppreſſion, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> that is bitter as Hemlock; I rather think that this muſt be the meaning,<note place="margin">Injuſtice compared to Hemlock Amos 5. 7.

                     <p>Now I find three things eſpecially recorded of this herb.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The nature of Hemlock <hi>Plin</hi> lib. 25. cap. 13</note> It is a very venimous herb; therefore I find <hi>Pliny</hi> records of it in his 25. Book, 13. Chap. of Natural Hiſtory, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did uſe to give this to malefactors that were condemn'd to die to execute them withal. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> that was ſo wiſe a man among them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Socrates</hi> He died for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining there was but one God.</note> yet he becauſe he did not yield to their gods, but ſpake againſt their falſe gods, therefore they judged him to die, and he muſt drink a potion of <hi>Hemlock,</hi> and ſo died.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, I find the ſame Author ſaith of it that, the leaves are ſomewhat like to Coriander, but that they be more tender, and a ſtrong ſtinking ſmel they have with them:<note place="margin">Injuſtice like to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</note> and the ſeeds like to Annis. And ſo Juſtice ſeems to have a very fair pretence ſometimes, and may ſeem to do things that are very good; under very fair pretences men are very injuſt: the leaves when they come up one would think there ſhould be ſuch a fine fruit, one would think to have Coriander, or Annis, but the truth is, it comes to Hemlock at laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:104281:180"/> And then the third thing is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hierom</hi> in loc.</note> that which <hi>Hierom</hi> reports of it, and it is in his Comment upon my text, he ſaith that Hemlock grows up very ſtiff and full of joynts, and at the joynts (he ſaith) it puts forth a ſtalk, and that doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſprout upwards and bear fruit, but downwards to have a root, &amp; he ſaith that every branch, If it hath but a joynt in it will ſerve inſtead of a ſeed, yea, every ſprig of it will ſerve inſtead of ſeed; yea, he ſaith, if any pieces falls to the ground, It wil grow up, and ſo grow up as that it will be very hard to rid the ground of it. And truly thus it doth reſemble Injuſtice, if it be let alone but a little, Oh how it multiplies one to another and ſpreads through the whol Land quickly.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Pliny</hi> doth obſerve many other things too, he ſaith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that the root of it is hollow, and that's unfit for any uſe at all;<note place="margin">Vnjuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hollow.</note> and ſo are the hearts of thoſe that are injuſt, hollow hearts and unfit for any thing.</p>
                     <p>And alſo he ſaith, that the leaves are fit for ſwellings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and againſt ſore eyes.<note place="margin">God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies to his people the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</note> And God doth turn even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice that is many times, among a people to be medicines to his people againſt their ſwellings, and to open their ſore eyes.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaith, That if Hemlock be drank in Wine, it will certainly kill a man, and there is no remedy. So if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> men ſhall be Injuſt and take delight in it,<note place="margin">Thoſe that delight in Injuſtice are in a deſperate condition.</note> and take pleaſure in it, and ſcorn and contemn at thoſe that they can oppreſs by Injuſtice, thoſe men are in a deſperate condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>And then laſtly, he doth obſerve by this Herb that it kils by cold, thoſe that takes the leaves or ſeeds, if they get the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> maſtery of any they ſhall feel themſelves begin to was cold in their inward parts,<note place="margin">Injuſtice kils by coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> and ſo die inwardly.

                     <hi>are moſt afraid of any thing elſe.</hi> Where the fear of God is not, other baſe fear will be, and ſo much the more, the leſs we fear God. Oh! how much better were it that our fear were ſet upon God, than upon other things? You muſt love ſomething; Were it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that your love were placed upon God than any thing elſe? And you muſt fear ſomething; Were it not better that your fear were upon God, than any thing elſe? And you muſt rejoyce in ſomething, and ſorrow and the like. <hi>Fear,</hi> it is a very troubleſom affection, if it be miſplaced; Oh! learn to place your affections right, place them upon God: By the fear of God you ſhall come to fear nothing elſe; Oh! how excellent is Gods fear! This one thing ſets out the excellency of the fear of God: <hi>That where the fear of God is ſetled in the hearts of men and women, all other baſe fears are rooted out.</hi> Would not you be glad to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from creature fears, eſpecially you that have liv'd in many dangers a few months ſince? Oh! if you might be delivered from the fears of the creature, how glad would you bee? Here's the only way; Let the fear of God be ſtrong in your hearts, and the fear of the creature will not prevail with you.</p>
                  <p>You ſee it clearly in the example of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> in <hi>Hab. 3. 16.</hi>

                     <hi>When I heard</hi> (God revea'd his will) <hi>my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice; rottenneſs entred into my bones,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:104281:185"/> and I trembled in my ſelf.</hi> (But now <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> why would you trouble your ſelf with ſo much fear?) Mark, there was a great good came to him by it,<note place="margin">expounded</note>

Men can rejoyce in the time of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but in times of afflictions then they fear? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe that fear the Lord in their proſperity, in the times of their affliction then they moſt rejoyce.

                        <hi>That wicked men, Idolaters did dedicate themſelves to their Idols, they are the people of the Idol.</hi> Thoſe that were the very peculiar of God and his Treaſure, the People of God, now they are called the people of the Calf, for they have none to go to for help but only that Idol of theirs; they had forſaken God.</p>
                     <p>And it's ſaid, <hi>That they yet mourn over it.</hi> Though cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at firſt, the ſetting up of the Calf could not but be a very ſtrange thing to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet within a while after they were uſed to it, they did worſhip it, and it took their very conſciences, ſo as they loved it, and when it was taken away they mourn'd and were in extream diſtreſs and trouble.

                        <hi>Let the fear of God be ſtrong in your hearts when you come to counſel.</hi> Oh! it's a good thing when any are going to Counſel about matters of conſequence, that they would prepare their hearts before they go with the poſſeſſion of the fear of the great God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts, and then they will counſel well: you have a notable Scripture for this in <hi>Ezra, 10. 3. Come, let us go to do according to the Counſel of my Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezr. 10. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>and of thoſe that tremble at the Commandement of our God.</hi> It may be there are ſome that have deeper reaches than they have; I, but have they the fear of God in them? there is hope that they are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord, and therefore let us do according to the Counſel of thoſe that tremble at Gods Word; Do you ſee a man whoſe heart is poſſeſſ'd with the fear of God and his Word? if his parts be but ordinary you may expect that God will be with him rather than with thoſe that are bold and preſumptuous, and ſlight the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>4. In your Counſels (eſpecially in matters of Religion) <hi>be ſure to look at the Word;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">4. Look at the Word, eſpecially in matters of Religion.</note> and think not thus, In way of reaſon and prudence ſuch a way were better, and would conduce for peace: As I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Reaſon is a moſt deadly enemy even to Faith, it is dangerous to reaſon matter of Faith. And ſo in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Worſhip of God, there's a great deal of danger. Keep to the Word therefore in all your Counſels, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for ſincerity of heart in all your Counſels: this is that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104281:195"/> that makes men miſcarry in their Counſels, their hearts are byaſſed with ſome luſt or other, and therefore when any thing is ſpoken to them that is ſutable to what they have a mind to, that they imbrace; and if any thing be ſpoken to them that is otherwiſe, that they reject: Oh! it's juſt with God to anſwer thee according to the Idol that is ſet up in thy own heart.</p>
                     <p>5. In all thy Counſels,<note place="margin">5. Be not put off with ſhews of Reaſon.</note> 
                        <hi>Take heed of being put off with ſome fair ſhews.</hi> When the Lord is leaving any, yet he will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe that give evil Counſel to mix a great many good things with that which is evil: As ſome that will put a few braſs ſhillings into a great bag of money, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is all good currant money, yea but here's ſome braſs ſhillings put amongſt it. So ſometimes in the midſt of a great deal of good Counſel, there is a little mixture that may turn all: therefore thoſe that would counſel, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the publick affairs, they had need have their eyes about them, and poiſe every word and line, and examine every particular, or otherwiſe they may quickly come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of their own Counſel.</p>
                     <p>There are many Rules might further be given.</p>

                     <p>This is an expreſſion to ſhew,<note place="margin">Expoſ. 1.</note> Firſt, the dreadfulneſs of their miſery. It ſhould be ſuch a great miſery as ſhould make them be weary of their lives, ſhould make them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire death than life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is to note the wonderful deſperation that in the apprehenſion and ſence of this their miſery they had no whither to go for help, but their hearts ſhould diſpair, and all the help that they ſhould expect was, to have the Mountains fall upon them, and the Hills to cover them. Now this expreſſion I find Chriſt makes uſe of in the ſetting out the miſery of the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards,<note place="margin">Luke, 23. 30.</note> in <hi>Luke, 23. 30.</hi> and ſo I find the holy Ghoſt in expreſſing the miſery of the <hi>Antichriſtian party,</hi> when the wrath of God ſhould come out upon them, their miſery ſhall be ſo great, as to cry to the Mountains to fall upon them,<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 16</note> and the Hills to cover them, in <hi>Revel. 6. 16.</hi> there the Princes and the great men, and mighty men, and Captains, they call upon the Mountains to fall upon them and the Hills to cover them. I remember reverend Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> upon that very Scripture interpreting, the great men,<note place="margin">See Mr <hi>Brightm.</hi> in Revel. 6. 16.</note> and the mighty men calling to the mountains to fall upon them, and the hills to cover them, he ſaith, That it was fulfil'd in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when the Heathen Emperors were vanquiſhed, and he doth interpret it upon <hi>Diocleſian</hi> that he was ſo terrified in apprehenſion of the wrath of the Lamb that Chriſt did appear againſt him, that he drank poyſon and kild himſelf. And <hi>Maximian</hi> ended his life with a haltar, and hanged himſelf. <hi>Galerius</hi> died of a moſt noiſom and filthy diſeaſe. <hi>Maximinus</hi> that he might prevent his death he likewiſe murdered himſelf.

                  <p>But that their ſin was either from the daies of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> or <hi>More</hi> than the daies of <hi>Gibeah.</hi> From thence the Notes are.</p>

                  <p>But this is the ſpecial Note from hence,<note place="margin">Obſ. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>That God takes it very ill that thoſe men, or the poſterity of thoſe men whom he doth uſe as inſtruments to puniſh ſin in others, and to reform others, yet ſhould be guilty of the ſame ſin themſelves, or greater.</hi> Oh! (ſaith the Prophet) you may juſtly expect to have the Mountains to fall upon you, and the Hills to cover you, for you are more wicked than in the daies of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> though I did uſe
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:104281:205"/> your forfathers to puniſh that great ſin, yet you continue to be viler and worſe than they were that were puniſhed by your forfathers. Oh my brethren, God cannot endure to ſee that wickedneſs continued in men, that they ſhall be made uſe of to puniſh in others: What ſhall we be uſed, or any in this generation be uſed for to execute the anger of God, the diſpleaſure of God upon ſuperſtitious people, and ſhall we continue in the ſin of Superſtition? ſhall we be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to caſt out mens inventions, and ſhall we bring in mens inventions? yea, ſhall we be uſed to puniſh Oppreſſion and Tyranny, and Injuſtice, and ſhall we continue in Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Tyranny, and Injuſtice? Oh! this cries to Heaven when it ſhall be ſaid, Well, God ſtirred up you to make you an inſtrument to caſt out ſuch Oppreſſing Courts, ſuch Tyranny, and ſuch and men that were ſo cruel to godly people, you were uſed to caſt out them, and you come and ſucceed them in ſuch Oppreſſions and Tyranny, and Injuſtice, and you make my Saints cry to Heaven for the burdens that you lay upon them. Oh! this would be very heavie. Take we heed that when God uſes us, or our forfathers to reform any evil, take heed that it be never ſaid, that thoſe evils continue in their Children after them.</p>
                  <p>There hath been much ado in our REFORMATION,<note place="margin">Applied to theſe times</note> as there was much ado in the puniſhment of the ſin of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah;</hi> it coſt much blood to puniſh that ſin; and ſo it hath coſt much blood to puniſh Oppreſſors, to bring in Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, to caſt out thoſe that have been burdens to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. Therefore it was worſe in their poſterity to continue in that ſin that had coſt ſo much blood to have it puniſhed. And ſo the more it coſts to caſt out our oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Courts, &amp;c. the more fearful wil our ſin be if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Oppreſſion our ſelves.

                  <p>IN the 2. verſe you heard much of the diviſions of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> and of the ten Tribes; but in the latter end of the 10. verſe you heard how God would joyn them together: But how ſhould they be joyned? it ſhould be in their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they ſhould be bound together in their furrows: now though it be in your books, <hi>They ſhall bind themſelves,</hi> which hath likewiſe a ſenſe which we ſpake to then, yet you may as well reade the words, <hi>They ſhall bind them together,</hi> and ſo carry the ſenſe, That they ſhould be bound in their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, like Oxen in the Plough, there they ſhould be yok'd; they would not come in together under Gods yoke, but they ſhall come intogether under the yoke of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and that I think is the principal ſcope of the words, They ſhall bind them in their two furrows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that were ſo divided in their proſperity, when they come into bondage there they ſhall by their enemies be bound together.</hi>

                  <p>But <hi>Ephraim</hi> thought her ſelf far from this.

They were wont in thoſe times inſtead of threſhing out the ſeed from the chaff, to have beaſts to tread out the ſeed, or to draw inſtruments whereby the ſeed was ſeperated from the husk.

                  <p>And ſecondly, then they were not to be muzzel'd but to feed all the while as they pleaſed, while they were treading out the Corn; this by the Command of God. Now this was a very eaſie work for them to be without yoke, to run up and down in the Corn and ſo they could feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fat; They had enough to feed on, certain food, and preſent food, whereas thoſe Heifers that went to plow were fain to be abroad in the ſtorms and cold and wind, and work all day long, and it may be not have a bit of meat till night, and this was a hard work, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> did not love that work; and it ſeems to have reference to ſome of the ten Tribes who would ſtay in their Country, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>

When Reaſon would come to the higheſt degree of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:104281:216"/> what is it that it doth, only this, to conclude Righteouſneſs to be, <hi>to depart from evil, and do things that are good, but what Righteouſneſs is this?</hi> But the Scripture Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is this: for a man to know that he hath no good at all in himſelf, that all his evil is pardoned in Jeſus Chriſt, this is the Righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, and this is the ſeed, the ſeed of all good works: I name this, though I can hardly think that this is the ſcope of the Prophet at this time, yet there is a very good meditation from this which I ſee that uſeful man in the Church of God <hi>[Luther]</hi> goes on in, ſaith he, <hi>What madneſs and blindneſs in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is there, that will urge people to ſow, and yet they do reject and caſt off this ſeed that they ſhould ſow?</hi> That is the Doctrine of the imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by faith, why ſaith he, in all Pulpits there's crying out to men for good works, that they would ſow in Righteouſneſs, but (ſaith he) where have they their ſeed? The thing certainly is an excellent truth that he hath upon the place: how vain is it for men to be taught to ſow good works till they have got the ſeed? And the ſeed of all good works is, <hi>The Righteouſneſs that we have by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and therefore he falls a rebuking thoſe that ſhall blame the Doctrine of the Goſpel as the means of licentiouſneſs, ſaith he, there's a great many when we preach of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, think that we preach licentiouſneſs, and that men may live as they liſt, it's quite contrary, when we preach the Righteouſneſs of Jeſu Chriſt, we preach the ſeed of all good works, and thoſe that have this ſeed, good works will come out of them. But ſaith he further, They would have Righteouſneſs, but what? they ſlight the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God making, the Righteouſneſs of his Son, but they muſt have Righteouſneſs of their own to tender up to God &amp; then when they come to good works they wil ſlight <hi>Gods</hi> good works, and they will be giving to God of <hi>their</hi> good works, the world doth neglect thoſe as light things, that is, the works of mercy, to receive the Saints &amp;c. No, but
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:104281:217"/> they will have other brave works, to build Churches, and Temples, and Monaſtries, and to laviſh out gold about them, and they are the chief good works: they will not come to do the work as it were of a Servant, but rather the work of a Benefactor to God, for in relieving thy poor brother when none but thy ſelf and God knows it thou doſt the work of a ſervant then, but to build brave Temples, and Monaſtries, and laviſh out Gold upon them; this is for you to be a Benefactor to God.

And ſo ſhould we know our ſeaſons, we ſhould obſerve our times to be humbled and reform, to reform and be humbled. But this for the Reformation of a State.</p>
                     <p>But the plowing of the heart, that's the thing that is here eſpecially intended, and I deſire to apply it particularly to every man and woman. Thoſe who have ſuch ſore necks who cannot bear the yoke, yet you muſt be Plow-men and Plow-women, for <hi>Alice Driver</hi> that I told you of, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought her up to plow, and both men and women, the daintieſt Ladies of all muſt hold this plow that is here ſpoken of. Now for this plowing of humbling your hearts it is for the getting in of Truths into your ſpirits, that may rend up your hearts, I'le name ſome few Truths that are as it were the Plow-ſhare, that you muſt not only know them, but labor to get them into your hearts.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, That ſuch is the vileneſs of every ſin, as it ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the ſoul from God and puts it under an eternal Curſe. This one Truth, you muſt get this into your hearts, and get it deep into your hearts, it will help to unlooſen the roots of the thorns and bryars that are there, the ſetled appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of this Truth.</p>
                     <p>And then ſecondly, This Truth: That, there is ſuch a breach between God and my ſoul by ſin, that all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth is not able to make up this breach, here is a ſharp plow-ſhare to get into the heart.</p>
                     <p>And then thirdly, This Truth, that by nature I am full of this ſin, my heart is full of it, all the faculties of my ſoul are filled with ſin that is of ſuch an hainous nature. Here is a ſharp plow-ſhare to get into the heart.</p>
                     <p>And then fourthly, That every action that ever I have done in all my life, in my unregenerate eſtate, it is nothing elſe but ſin, nothing elſe but ſin that hath ſuch a vile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="470" facs="tcp:104281:225"/> Yea further, That if any ſin be pardoned to me it is by vertue of a price paid that is more worth than ten thouſand worlds: <hi>This Truth.</hi> Now here's the Goſpel as well as the Law, for the plowing is but the ſpiritualneſs of the Law, the Truths of the Law in a Goſpel way, for you muſt take notice that the Law [as Law] accepts of no humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſin, it is as it is reveal'd in a Goſpel way, in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel way it doth tend to humiliation, for let men be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled never ſo much, the Law never accepts of them for their humiliation, but the Law in a Goſpel way ſo it comes to humble the ſoul ſo as to do it good. Now therefore the Conſideration of the Truths that the Law requires, having reference to the Goſpel they ſerve for the humbling of the ſoul; Now get in theſe truths and ſee what they will do in thy Soul, you muſt work them in, And let conſcience be put on to draw this plow, Theſe are as the Plow-ſhare, and the working of Conſcience is the drawing of this plow; while the plow ſtops (as when it meets with a thorn and bryar) now a ſtrong Conſcience will draw it on, and will make the thorns and bryars to be rent up by the roots, if the Conſcience be put upon with ſtrength to draw theſe Truths in the ſoul; and though they put you to pain, yet you muſt be content to draw them on in the ſoul; And if theſe and the like Truths be got into thy ſoul, and thou beeſt at plow, and thy Conſcience be drawing, This is that I ſhall ſay, <hi>God ſpeed the Plow,</hi> yea, God ſpeed theſe Truths that Conſcience is drawing on in the ſoul, for it may tend to a great deal of good, to prepare thee for the ſeed that may bring forth Righteouſneſs and Mercy to thy ſoul for ever. I confeſs it is a hard work to be thus plowing; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for men and women only to hear Sermons, and be talking and conferring of good things, theſe things are pretty eaſie, but to go to plow, to plow with ſuch Truths as theſe are, to get up the thorns and bryars by the roots, this is a very hard task; but we muſt be willing to do it, and to continue plowing; as the fallow ground muſt not

                     <p>It is an excellent Note to help us both in our ſeeking God, and in the comforts that we have. When we are ſeeking God we are not ſeeking God meerly as a gratuity.

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:104281:241"/> find ſome take this word <hi>Tumult [A Tumult ſhall ariſe]</hi> that is only meant the Confuſion of the hearts of people when the enemies ſhould come upon them, that they ſhould be all in a Confuſion, not knowing what to do through fear and terror altogether. As ſuppoſe on a ſudden an Army ſhould come againſt a Citie, people would be wringing of their hands and running up and down from place to place, and paleneſs in their countenances, and not knowing what in the world to do, all in perplexity and tumult: Thus God threatens it ſhould be with them. As if he ſhould ſay, You are jolly and brave now, but when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> come out upon you then your hearts ſhall fail, and you ſhall all run together and not know what to do, the women and children ſhall cry, not knowing how to help your ſelves, and ſo ſhall be brought into a confuſed Tumult. This is the ſenſe that ſome carries it in. But the ſenſe may very well go either of theſe waies.</p>
                  <p>It is a mercy that God hath not tried us this way; We live in our houſes, and follow our tradings, and lie down and ſleep in quietneſs and riſe again, but we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin what woful diſtractions there would be in the ſpirits of people in the Citie, if there were a conſiderable Army encamped round about it: Perhaps ſome of you here have been in places where the enemies have come ſuddenly ſo that you know what this Tumult in the ſpirits of men and women means.

                        <hi>In the morning,</hi> which comes yet neerer and more full to the ſenſe and the ſcope of the Spirit of God here; that is, even when the light comes, when they have hopes of further good, then he ſhall be cut off.

But when he threatens the wicked (ſaith he) <hi>When the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes it ſhall be darkneſs.</hi> The Lord doth uſe to turn the darkneſs of the Saints into light, and to turn the light of the wicked and ungodly into darkneſs. Oh! let us learn to fear that God then that is able to turn light into darkneſs,<note place="margin">Amos, 5. 8.</note> and darkneſs into light. <hi>Amos, 5. 8.

Suppoſe there be the greateſt darkneſs upon you, God can make that a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of light: and ſuppoſe there be a morning of light, God can turn that into darkneſs. Many men they ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome waies, and becauſe they have a <hi>morning</hi> they bleſs themſelves and think all muſt needs go on according to their way; it is a very ordinary thing in the hearts of men, eſpecially that are compaſſing ſome notable deſign of their own, if it doth proſper in the begining they think al wil go on: Oh! thou maieſt be utterly deceived, thy deſigns may have a morning, and then God may cut thee off and thy deſigns, and all thy thoughts may then periſh. We reade that <hi>Saul</hi> had many Victories after that God had pronounced that he ſhould be rejected.

                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obſ. 4</note> God did not diſcomfit the Hoſt of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> until the morning. God loves to draw forth great ſinners to the light; not to come upon them in the dark,

                        <hi>In the morning he ſhall be cut off.</hi> That is, <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,</hi> God will be quick at his work: They thought by their power to hold it out: No, ſaith God, I will not make a daies work of it,<note place="margin">ſicut mane tranſit, ſic pertranſit Rex Iſrael</note> it ſhal be in the <hi>morning,</hi> ſo the old Latin turns it, <hi>It ſhall paſs as the morning,</hi> as the light of the morning quickly paſſes over; as you heard before, as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is compared to the <hi>foam,</hi> ſo he is here compared to the <hi>morning.</hi> Now my brethren to cloſe this Chapter, Oh! what alteration of things God is able to make in a morning!

                        <hi>Ezek. 7. 5, 6, 7. Thus ſaith the Lord God, An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. An end is come, the end is come, it watches for thee, behold, it is come. The Morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwelleſt in the Land; the time is come, the day of trouble is near.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay, Al this while that thou haſt bin in the act of the pride of thy heart, and vanity of thy ſpirit, I did determin, that ſuch a morning, ſuch an evil ſhould come, and it's come, it is come, it is come, ſaith God: Again, again, and again, <hi>the morning is come.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Make our peace at night,</note> O! think, when you lie down at night, think what thou haſt done this day, do not dare to lie down, but firſt make thy peace with God, thou knoweſt not what may be in the morning, and when thou riſeſt up in the morning,<note place="margin">And ſeek God whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we riſe.</note> look up to God, and ſeek bleſſing and mercy from the Lord; for though thine eyes be opened, and thou come to ſee the morning light, yet before the morning be quite gone, thou knoweſt not what may befal
