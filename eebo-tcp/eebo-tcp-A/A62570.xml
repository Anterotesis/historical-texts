            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE AUTHOR of these
Sermons was so well known,
particularly for his most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and Useful Discourses from the
Pulpit, that I shall not attempt, by
any thing I can say, to recommend
them to the Publick. I know very
well, they have already that Credit in
the World, which will render any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
needless; especially when by this
Publication of them, they shall speak
for themselves.</p>
            <p>I think it requisite, only to assure
the Reader, That they are what they
<pb facs="tcp:56284:4"/>
pretend to be, the <hi>genuine Works</hi>
of <hi>that great Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst I had the Happiness of
Conversing with him, he was pleas'd
(at my Request) to instruct me in
the <hi>Character</hi> in which he wrote all
his Sermons; and some of these now
Published, having been Transcrib'd
by me some Years since, were found
amongst his Papers, Corrected with his
own Hand.</p>
            <p>By what he had been pleas'd to
say, <hi>that I was Master of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
and by the few Errata he
observ'd in my first Performance, I
was encouraged to set about this
Work; in which I can Solemnly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that I have observ'd a Religious
care and strictness, neither to omit nor
add any thing, but an <hi>of,</hi> a <hi>the,</hi> or
the like, when the Sense plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
it; and of that too I have
given notice, by affixing this Mark
[``] upon the Word which I did
<pb facs="tcp:56284:4"/>
not find in the Original; so that the
Reader is left to judge of the fitness
of such Additions; which, after all,
are so very few and inconsiderable, as
scarcely to deserve this notice; only
that he might be satisfied (in case the
Printer do his part) that he hath here,
what he expects, a perfect Transcript
of these <hi>Sermons;</hi> and in them a
true and lively strain of <hi>Christian
Piety and Eloquence,</hi> so fitted to
all Capacities, that I cannot but hope,
all that shall read them will be the
better for them, even those not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
(if there be any such) who
may have entertain'd any unreasonable
Prejudices against them, or their
<hi>most Reverend Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have alwaies thought, and often
said it, that if any were Leaven'd
with Prejudice against Him, they
were, to be sure, such as did not
know him; and the farther I go in
his Writings, the more I am assur'd,
<pb facs="tcp:56284:5"/>
that it must be so. But because the
Sermons themselves, to which I refer,
are not yet all of them Published, I
must leave this to the Judgment of the
Impartial Reader, when the whole
shall be finish'd, which is design'd with
all convenient speed.</p>

               <q>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him,
and saith of him, Behold an

            </epigraph>
            <p>WHO this <hi>Nathanael</hi> was, upon
whom our Saviour bestows
this extraordinary Character,
doth not certainly appear, his Name
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56284:9"/>
being but once more mention'd in the
whole History of the Gospel: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
he was a good Man, who deserved
this extraordinary Commendation; and
none but our Saviour, who knew what
was in Man, and needed not that any
should tell him, could have given it,
especially of one, whom he had never
seen before that time; for when Jesus
saw him coming to him, he saith of him
<hi>Behold an Israelite indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were
<hi>Israelites,</hi> by Natural Descent, being the
Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Israel;</hi> but in a special,
and more excellent sense, none are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
the true Posterity of <hi>Israel,</hi> but
those, who resembled this Father of their
Nation, in true Piety, and Goodness;
for (as the Apostle reasons) they are
not all <hi>Israel,</hi> who are of <hi>Israel;</hi> they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are <hi>Israelites</hi> indeed, who resemble
good Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the sincerity of his
Piety, and the simplicity of his Temper,
and Disposition; for our Saviour seems
here to allude to that Character which is
given of <hi>Jacob</hi> (Gen. 25. 27.) <hi>That he
was a plain Man, or as the Hebrew</hi> word
signifies, a perfect and sincere Man, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> who is said
<hi>to be cunning;</hi> so that to be an <hi>Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56284:9"/>
indeed, is to be a downright honest
Man, without fraud, and guile, without
any arts of hypocrisie and deceit.</p>
            <p>In speaking of this vertue of Sincerity,
which is the highest Character and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of a good Man, I shall consider
it, as it respects God, and Man. As it respects
God, so it imports the truth and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Piety and Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. As it regards Men, so it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a simplicity of Mind and Manners,
in our Carriage and Conversation, one
towards another; both these are includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and very probably were intended, in
the Character which our Saviour here
gives of <hi>Nathanael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. I shall consider this Grace, or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
of sincerity, as it respects God; and
so it imports the truth and sincerity of
our Piety toward him, that we heartily
believe, and fear, and honour him, and
that the outward expressions of our Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Obedience to him, are the genuine
issue of our inward apprehensions of him,
and affections towards him; and this no
doubt our Saviour intended in the first
place in the Character of this good Man,
that he was a Man of a real and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and unaffected Piety, and in truth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56284:10"/>
what he appeared to be; that he did sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
love God, and his Truth, and
was ready to embrace it, whenever it
was fairly proposed to him, as did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in his Carriage towards our
Saviour; for when <hi>Philip</hi> invited him
to come and see him, he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the prejudice and objection he had
against him, grounded upon a common,
but uncharitable Proverb, <hi>That out of</hi>
Nazareth <hi>ariseth no Prophet,</hi> but having
an honest and sincere mind, he was not
so carried away by a popular prejudice,
as not to have patience to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and therefore was easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to go and see our Saviour, and
to discourse with him himself, and being
satisfied that he was the Messias, he
presently owns him for such, calling him
the Son of God, and the King of <hi>Israel;</hi>
and because sincerity is the very heart
and substance of Religion, it concerns
us not only to endeavour after this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and disposition, but to enquire into
the nature and properties of it, that we
may know when we have it, and may
have the comfort of it. I shall mention
five or six Properties of a sincere Piety,
by which Men may sufficiently know
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56284:10"/>
the integrity of their hearts towards
God.</p>
            <p>1. Our Piety is then sincere when the
chief reasons and predominant motives
of it are Religious; and I call that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
or rational motive, which regards
God, and another World, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Men, and to our present tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Advantages; when the principal and
swaying motives of our Piety, are a sense
of God's Authority over us, and of our
Duty and Obligation to him; a fear of
his Displeasure and Threatnings, and
the hopes of the Glorious Reward which
he hath promised to Obedience; these
motives are properly Religious, because
they respect God, and are the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Obedience, which he himself
offers to us, to perswade us to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and that is a sincere Piety, which is
wrought in us by these Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how unequally soever mixed; for
even in the most of Men Fear does many
times prevail more than Love, and in case
of great temptation, may preserve Men
from sin, when perhaps no other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
will do it. On the contrary,
that is an unsincere Piety, to which we
are moved, meerly by the regard of
Men, and the consideration of some
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56284:11"/>
temporal Advantages; and when these
have the chief influence upon us, it is
easie for any Man to discern in himself;
for he that will carefully observe himself,
can hardly be ignorant of the true spring
and motive of his own actions; but there
is one sign, whereby a Man may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know that his heart is not right
towards God, and that is, if when these
motives are absent, our Piety and Zeal
for the true Religion doth either cease,
or be sensibly cooled and abated, as if
Impiety, or Popery, or any thing else
that is bad, begin to be in fashion, and
to have the Countenance of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
if those whom we fear, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom we depend, do discover any
inclination that way, if the garb of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
cease to be for our interest, or in
the revolution of things, happen to be
contrary to it; if in any of these cases,
we let fall the profession of our Religion,
or neglect the practice of it, this is a plain,
and undeniable demonstration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity
of our former Piety.</p>
            <p>2. A sincere Piety must be rooted in
the heart, and be a living principle within
us; for as the Apostle reasons in another
case, <hi>he is</hi> not a <hi>Jew</hi> who is <hi>one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but he who is one inwardly,</hi> and in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56284:11"/>
heart; and without this all outward acts
of Piety and Devotion, are hypocrisie, a
picture of Religion and a form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
without the life and power of
it.</p>
            <p>3. A Third Evidence of a sincere Piety
is, when Men are Religious in private
and in secret, as well as in publick and
in the open view of Men; he is truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,
who is so in his Family, and in his
Closet, where he hath no Witness, but
God, and his own Soul, as well as in
the Church; he is a downright honest
Man, who will make good his Word,
and perform his Promise (when no
proof can be made of it, and no Law
compel him to it) as readily as if there
had been an hundred Witnesses of it; he
is sincerely just, who will not detain
from another his right, though he be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it, nor wrong any Man, tho'
he could do it with all the secresie and
safety in the World; who will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon anothers ignorance or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
tho never so much to his own
benefit and advantage; he is truly Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
who would not only as soon, but
rather sooner give his Alms in secret,
than in the sight of Men; and he is truly
grateful, who when there is occasion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56284:12"/>
and opportunity, will acknowledge a
kindness and requite a benefit to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of his Deceased Friend, though
he be sure that all memory of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
dyed with him, and that none
are conscious to it, but God and his
own Conscience: And indeed there is
scarce any act of Piety, and Vertue, the
sincerity of which may not by this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
be known to us: As on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Man may for certain conclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Hypocrite, if he be not the same,
in the presence of God, and his own
Conscience that he is in the sight of
Men.</p>
            <p>4. Another Evidence of a sincere Piety
is a constant tenour of goodness in the
general course of our Lives: I do not
now speak of the first beginnings of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in new Converts, which are many
times very imperfect, and such as afford
little or no evidence of a Man's sincerity;
but in those who have made any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
progress in goodness; the habits of
any known sin, and the wilful and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
neglect of our Duties, and even the
single acts of more hainous Crimes, will
bring in question our sincerity, and are
by no means to be sheltred under the
name of infirmity; for these the Grace of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56284:12"/>
God, if we be not wanting to our selves,
will inable us to subdue; and he is not
sincerely good, who doth not seriously
endeavour to be as good as he can, and
does not make use of that Grace which
God is ready to afford to all the purposes,
(though not of a perfect, yet) of a sincere
obedience to the Laws of God.</p>
            <p>5. Another Evidence of a sincere Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is, that our obedience to God be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and universal, equally respecting
all the Laws of God, and every part of
our Duty; that it do not content it self
with an especial regard to some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Law, though never so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and allow it self in the breach,
or neglect of the rest; no nor with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Duties of one Table of the
Law, if it overlook the other, no nor
with obedience to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, one only excepted.
St. <hi>James</hi> puts this case, and determines,
<hi>That he that keeps the whole Law, saving
that he offends in one point, is guilty of all,</hi>
that is, is not sincere in his obedience to
the rest; and therefore we must take
great heed, that we do not set the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God at odds, and dash
the two Tables of the Law, against one
another, lest as St. <hi>James</hi> says, we break
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56284:13"/>
the whole Law: And yet I fear this is too
common a fault, even amongst those
who make a great profession of Piety,
that they are not sufficiently sensible of
the obligation and necessity of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the second Table, and of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of those Graces, and Vertues,
which respect our Carriage and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with one another: Men do not
seem to consider, that God did not give
Laws to us, for his own sake, but ours;
and therefore that he did not only design
that we should Honour him, but that
we should be happy in one another; for
which reason, he joyns with our humble
and dutiful Deportment towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Offices of Justice and Charity
towards others, Mich. 6. 8. <hi>He hath
shewed thee, O Man, what is good; and what
doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and to love mercy, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with thy God?</hi> And 1 John 4. 21.
<hi>This Commandment have we from him, that
he who loveth God, love his Brother also.</hi>
And yet it is too visible that many, who
make a great profession of Piety towards
God, are very defective in Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
very unpeaceable, and turbulent in
their Spirits, very peevish and passionate,
very conceited and censorious, as if their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56284:13"/>
profession of Godliness did exempt
them from the care and practice of
Christian Vertues: But we must not so fix
our eye upon Heaven, as to forget that
we walk upon the Earth, and to neglect
the ordering of our steps and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
among Men, lest while we are
gazing upon the Stars, we fall into
the Ditch of gross and foul Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>It is very possible, that Men may be
devout and zealous in Religion, very
nice, and scrupulous about the Worship
and Service of God, and yet because of
their palpable defect in points of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Honesty, of Meekness and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
of Peace and Charity, may be
gross and odious Hypocrites; for Men
must not think for some acts, either of
outward or inward Piety, to compound
with God for the neglect of Mercy and
Judgment, or to demand it as a right
from Men to be excused from the great
Duties and Vertues of Humane Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or pretend to be above them, because
they relate chiefly to this World, and to
the temporal happiness of Men; as if it
were the priviledge of great Devotion,
to give a license to Men to be peevish
and froward, sower and morose, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56284:14"/>
and censorious in their behaviour
towards others: Men must have a great
care, that they be not intent upon the
outward parts of Religion, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of inward and real goodness, and
that they do not so use the means of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as to neglect and lose the main
end of it; that they do not place all
Religion in Fasting and outward Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;
for though these things be
very useful and necessary in their place,
if they be discreetly managed, and made
subservient to the great ends of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet it is often seen that Men have so
unequal a respect to the several parts of
their Duty, that Fasting and Corporal
severity, those meager and lean Duties of
Piety, in comparison, do <hi>like Pharaoh</hi>'s
<hi>lean kine, devour and eat up almost all
the goodly and well-favoured,</hi> the great
and substantial Duties of the Christian
Life; and therefore Men must take great
heed, lest whilst they are so intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mortifying themselves, they do not
mortifie Vertue and good Nature, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Meekness and Charity, things
highly valuable in themselves and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the eyes of Men, and in the sight
of God of great price.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56284:14"/>
For the neglect of the Moral Duties of
the second Table is not only a mighty
scandal to Religion, but of pernicious
consequence many other ways: A fierce
and ill governed, an ignorant and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Zeal for the Honour of God,
and something or other belonging ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
as they think, to his true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Service, hath made many Men
do many unreasonable, immoral and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
things, of which History will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us with innumerable instances, in the
practice of the Jesuits, and other Zealots
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and there are
not wanting too many examples of this
kind amongst our selves; for Men that
are not sober, and considerate in their
Religion, but give themselves up to the
conduct of blind prejudice, and furious
zeal, do easily perswade themselves, that
any thing is lawful, which they strongly
fancy to tend to the Honour of God, and
to the advancement of the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
hence some have proceeded to
that height of absurdity, in their Zeal
for their Religion and Church, as to
think it not only lawful, but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
and meritorious, to equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
upon Oath, and break Faith with
Hereticks, and to destroy all those that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56284:15"/>
differ from them; as if it were Piety in
some cases, to lie for the Truth, and to
kill Men for God's sake.</p>
            <p>So that if we would approve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of our hearts to God, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to our selves the sincerity of our
Obedience, we ought impartially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
all the Laws of God, and every
part of our Duty; and if we do not,
our heart is not upright with God: 'Tis
observable that sincerity in Scripture is
often call'd by the name of Integrity,
and Perfection, because it is integra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and made up of all the parts of our
Duty.</p>
            <p>6. The last evidence I shall mention
of the sincerity of our Religion is, if it
hold out against persecution, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the fiery tryal; this is the utmost
proof of our integrity, when we are
called to bear the Cross, to be willing
then to expose all our worldly interest,
and even life it self, for the Cause of
God, and Religion; this is a tryal which
God doth not always call his faithful
Servants to, but they are always to be
prepared for it, in the purpose and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of their minds; this our Saviour
makes the great mark of a true Disciple,
if <hi>any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>will be my disciple,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56284:15"/>
let him deny himself, and take up his cross,
and follow me;</hi> this is a certain sign, that
Men have received the word into good
ground, and are well rooted in their
Religion, when they are not shaken by
these fierce assaults; <hi>for many</hi> (as our
Saviour tells us) <hi>hear the word, and with
joy receive it, but having not root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they endure but for a while, and
when persecution, or tribulation ariseth,
because of the word, presently they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;</hi>
nay, some when they see perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
coming at a distance, wheel off,
and bethink themselves of making their
retreat in time, and of <hi>agreeing with their
adversary whilst he is yet in the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that constancy to our Religion in
case of danger, and suffering for it, is the
best proof of our sincerity: This is the
fiery tryal, as the Scripture calls it, which
will try what materials we are made of,
and whether we love God and his truth
in sincerity.</p>
            <p>And thus I have considered sincerity as
it respects God, and imports true Piety
and Religion towards him; and I
proceed to the second consideration</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56284:16"/>
II. Of sincerity as it regards Men, and
so it signifies a simplicity of mind and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in our conversation, and carriage
one towards another, singleness of Heart,
discovering it self in a constant plainness
and honest openness of behaviour, free
from all insidious devises, and little
tricks, and fetches of Craft and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
from all false appearances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
disguises of our selves in word
or action; or yet more plainly, it is to
speak as we think, and do what we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and profess, to perform and make
good what we promise, and in a word,
really to be, what we would seem and
appear to be.</p>
            <p>Not that we are obliged to tell eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man all our mind, but we are never
to declare any thing contrary to it; we
may be silent, and conceal as much of
our selves, as prudence, or any other
good reason requires; but we must not
put on a disguise, and make a false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and empty show of what we are
not, either by word or action. Contrary
to this Vertue is (I fear) most of that
compliment, which is current in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
and which for the most part
is nothing but words, to fill up the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56284:16"/>
Gaps, and supply the emptiness of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and a pretence to that kindness
and esteem for persons, which either in
truth we have not, or not to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
which our expressions seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which if done with design, is that
which we call Flattery, a very odious
sort of Insincerity; and so much the
worse, because it abuseth Men into a
vain, and foolish opinion of themselves,
and an ill grounded confidence of the
kindness and good-will of others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; and so much the more
dangerous, because it hath a party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us, which is ready to let it in; it plays
upon our self-love, which greedily catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at any thing that tends to magnifie
and advance us; for God knows, we are
all too apt to think and make the best
of our bad selves, so that very few
Tempers have Wisdom and firmness e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be proof against Flattery; it
requires great Consideration, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Modesty and Humility to resist the
Insinuations of this Serpent; yea, a little
rudeness and moroseness of Nature, a
prudent distrust and infidelity in Mankind
to make a Man in good earnest to reject
and despise it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56284:17"/>
Now besides that all Hypocrisie and
Insincerity is mean in it self, having false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
at the bottom, it is also often made
use of, to the prejudice of others, in
their Rights and Interests; for not only
Dissimulation is contrary to Sincerity,
because it consists in a vain shew of what
we are not, in a false muster of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and good Qualities, in a deceitful
representation and undue Character of
our Lives; but there are likewise other
Qualities and Actions more inconsistent
with Integrity, which are of a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
and mischievous consequence to
our nature, as falshood, and fraud, and
perfidiousness, and infinite little Crafts
and arts of deceit, which Men practise
upon one another in their ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and intercourse; the former is
great vanity, but this is gross iniquity.</p>
            <p>And yet these Qualities dexterously
managed, so as not to lie too plain and
open to discovery, are look'd upon by
many, as signs of great depth and shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
admirable instruments of business,
and necessary means for the compassing
our own ends and designs; and though
in those that have suffered by them, and
felt the mischief of them, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
accounted dishonest, yet among
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56284:17"/>
the generality of lookers on, they pass
for great policy, as if the very skill of
governing and managing humane affairs,
did consist in these little tricks and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
But he that looks more narrowly
into them, and will but have the patience
to observe the end of them, will find
them to be great follies, and that it is
only for want of true wisdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
that Men <hi>turn aside to tricks,
and make dissimulation and lies their refuge.</hi>
It is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Observation, <hi>That he that
walketh uprightly walketh surely, but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Fools is deceit:</hi> The folly of Fools,
that is, the most egregious piece of folly
that any Man can be guilty of, is to play
the Knave; the vulgar Translation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
this clause a little otherwise, but yet
towards the same sense, <hi>Sed stultus diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit
ad dolos,</hi> but the Fool turns aside to
tricks; to make use of these is a sign the
Man wants understanding to see the
plain and direct way to his end: I will
not deny but these little Arts may serve
a present turn, and perhaps successfully
enough, but true Wisdom goes deep,
and reacheth a great way further, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the end of things and regarding
the future as well as the present, and by
judging upon the whole matter and sum
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56284:18"/>
of affairs, doth clearly discern, that Craft
and Cunning are only useful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion, whereas Integrity is of a
lasting use, and will be serviceable to
us upon all occasions, and in the whole
course of our Lives; and that Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Deceit, though they may do
some present execution in business, yet
they recoil upon a Man terribly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
so as to make him stagger, and
by degrees to weaken, and at last to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
his Reputation, which is a much
more useful and substantial and lasting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of prosperity and success in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs than any tricks and devices
whatsoever. Thus have I considered this
great vertue of Sincerity, both as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
God, and the mutual conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and intercourse of Men one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
            <p>And now having explained the nature
of Sincerity to God and Man, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the properties of it, and in what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
we ought chiefly to practise it,
and what things are contrary to it; that
which now remains, is to perswade Men
to endeavour after this excellent quality,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> to practise it in all the words and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56284:18"/>
Let us then in the first place be sincere
in our Religion, and serve God in truth
and uprightness of heart out of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our Duty and Obligations to him,
and not with sinister respects to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
interest or passion, to the publick
approbation or censure of Men; let us
never make use of Religion to serve any
base and unworthy ends, cloaking our
designs of Covetousness, or Ambition,
or Revenge, with pretences of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Zeal for God; and let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
after the reality of Religion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remembring that a sincere Piety
doth not consist in shew, but substance,
not in appearance, but in effect; that the
Spirit of true Religion is still and calm,
charitable and peaceable, making as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
shew and stir as is possible; that a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sincerely good Man does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
vain Ostentation, and an unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
discovery of his good Qualities, but
endeavours rather really to be, than to
seem Religious; and of the two rather
seeks to conceal his Piety than to set it
out with pomp; gives his Alms private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
prays to God in secret, and makes no
appearance of Religion but in such fruits
and effects as cannot be hid; in the quiet
and silent vertues of Humility, and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56284:19"/>
and Patience, of Peace and Charity;
in governing his Passions, and taking
heed not to offend with his Tongue by
slander and calumny, by envious detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or rash censure, or by any word
or action that may be to the hurt and
prejudice of his Neighbour: But on the
contrary, it is a very ill sign if a Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to make a great noise and bustle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion, if he blow a Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his good Works, and by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
shews of Devotion summon the
Eyes of Men to behold him, and do, as it
were, call aloud to them to take notice
of his Piety, and to <hi>come to see his zeal
for the Lord of Hosts:</hi> It is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but such a Man with all his vanity
and ostentation may have some real
goodness in him; but he is as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
are, and does as like one as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
and by the mighty shew that he
makes to wise and considerate Men,
greatly brings in question the sincerity of
his Religion.</p>
            <p>And with the sincerity of our Piety
towards God, let us joyn the simplicity
and integrity of Manners in our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with Men; let us strictly charge
our selves to use truth and plainness in all
our words and doings; let our Tongue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56284:19"/>
be ever the true Interpreter of our
Mind, and our Expressions the lively
Image of our Thoughts and Affections,
and our outward actions exactly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our inward purposes and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Amongst too many other Instances of
the great corruption and degeneracy of
the Age wherein we live, the great and
general want of sincerity in Conversation
is none of the least; the World is grown
so full of Dissimulation and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that Mens words are hardly any
signification of their thoughts; and if
any Man measure his words by his heart,
and speak as he thinks, and do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
more kindness to every man than
men usually have for any man, he can
hardly escape the censure of rudeness and
want of breeding: The old <hi>English</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sincerity, that generous integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Nature and honesty of Disposition
which always argues true greatness of
mind, and is usually accompanied with
undaunted courage and resolution, is in
a great measure lost amongst us; there
hath been a long endeavour to transform
us into foreign Manners and Fashions,
and to bring us to a servile imitation of
none of the best of our Neighbours in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56284:20"/>
some of the worst of their Qualities:
The Dialect of Conversation is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
so swell'd with Vanity and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so surfeited (as I may say) of
expressions of kindness and respect, that
if a man that lived an Age or two ago
should return into the World again, he
would really want a Dictionary to help
him to understand his own Language, and
to know the true intrinsick value of the
phrase in fashion, and would hardly at
first believe at what a low rate the highest
strains and expressions of kindness ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
do commonly pass in currant pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and when he should come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, it would be a great while
before he could bring himself, with a
good Countenance and a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to converse with Men upon equal
terms and in their own way.</p>
            <p>And in truth it is hard to say whether
it should more provoke our contempt or
our pity to hear what solemn expressions
of respect and kindness will pass between
men, almost upon no occasion; how
great honour and esteem they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
for one whom perhaps they never
heard of or saw before, and how entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are all on the sudden devoted to
his service and interest for no reason; how
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56284:20"/>
infinitely and eternally obliged to him
for no benefit, and how extremely they
will be concerned for him, yea, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
too for no cause. I know it is said
in justification of this hollow kind of
Conversation, that there is no harm, no
real deceit in Complement, but the
matter is well enough so long as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
one another, <hi>Et verba valent
ut Nummi,</hi> Words are like Money, and
when the currant value of them is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
understood, no Man is cheated by
them; this is something if such words
were any thing, but being brought into
the Account they are meer Cyphers.
However it is still a just matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that sincerity and plainness are
out of fashion, and that our Language is
running into a Lye; that Men have almost
quite perverted the use of Speech, and
made words to signifie nothing; that the
greatest part of the Conversation of
Mankind, and of their intercourse with
one another, is little else but driving a
Trade of Dissimulation, insomuch that
it would make a Man heartily sick and
weary of the World, to see the little sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
that is in use and practice among
Men, and tempt him to break out into
that melancholy Complaint and Wish of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56284:21"/>
the Prophet (Jer. 9.) <hi>O that I had in
the Wilderness a lodging-place of way-faring
men, that I might leave my people and go
from them; for they are all Adulterers, and
an assembly of treacherous Men; and they
bend their tongue like their bow for lies, but
have no courage for the truth upon earth.
Take ye heed every one of his Neighbour,
and trust ye not in any Brother; for every
Brother will utterly supplant, and every
Neighbour will walk with slanders. Thine
habitation is in the midst of deceit; one
speaketh peaceably to his Neighbour, but in
his heart he lieth in wait: Shall not I visit
for these things, saith the Lord; and shall
not my Soul be avenged of such a Nation as
this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the Manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel</hi> at that time, which were
both the forerunner and the cause of
those terrible Calamities which befell
them afterwards; and this Character
agrees but too well to the present Age,
which is so wretchedly void of Truth
and Sincerity, for which reason there is
the greater need to recommend this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to us, which seems to be fled from
us, <hi>that truth and righteousness may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and glory may dwell in our land, and
God may shew his mercy upon us and grant
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56284:21"/>
us his Salvation, and Righteousness and
Peace may kiss each other.</hi> To this end
give me leave to offer these following
Considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Sincerity is the highest
commendation and the very best Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
that can be given of any man; it
is the solid foundation of all Virtue,
the Heart and Soul of all Piety and
Goodness; it is in Scripture called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and frequently joyned with it;
and throughout the Bible, there is the
greatest stress and weight laid upon it;
it is spoken of as the sum and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of all Religion: <hi>Only fear the
Lord and serve him in sincerity and
truth,</hi> says <hi>Joshua</hi> to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
(Jos. 24. 14.) God takes great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in it; so <hi>David</hi> assures us, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
29. 17.) <hi>I know my God that thou try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
the Heart, and hast pleasure in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
And again, <hi>Thou lovest truth in the
inward parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this disposition of mind the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of divine favour and blessing are
particularly made, <hi>Psal. 15. 1, 2. Lord
who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, who shall
dwell in thy holy Hill? He that walketh
uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56284:22"/>
speaketh the truth from his Heart.</hi> Psal. 32. 2.
<hi>Blessed is the Man, unto whom the Lord
imputeth no sin, and in whose Spirit there
is no guil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis observable that this Character
of our Saviour here given of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi>
is the only full and perfect commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we read was ever given by
him of any particular person. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
some particular acts of Piety and
Virtue in others, as St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s confession
of him, the Faith of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and
of the Woman that was healed by
touching the Hem of his Garment, the
Charity of the Woman that cast her
two Mites into the Treasury, and the
Bounty of that other devout Woman
who poured upon him a Box of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Oyntment: But here he gives the
particular Character of a good Man
when he says of <hi>Nathaniel</hi> that he was
an <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed, in whom was no
Guil: And the Apostle mentions this
quality, as the chief ingredient into the
Character of the best Man that ever was,
our blessed Saviour, <hi>who did no Sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Guil found in his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The rarity of this Virtue
is a farther commendation of it. A sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56284:22"/>
pious and good Man, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
guil or disguise is not a sight to be
seen every day: Our Saviour in the Text,
speaks of it, as a thing very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and of special remark and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and breaks out into some kind
of wonder upon the occasion, as if to
see a Man of perfect integrity and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
were an occurrence very rare and
unusual, and such as calls for our more
especial attention and regard, <hi>Behold</hi>
(saith he) <hi>an</hi> Israelite <hi>indeed in whom
there is no Guil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The want of Sincerity will
quite spoil the virtue and acceptance of
all our Piety and Obedience, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
deprive us of the reward of it:
All that we doe in the service of God,
all our external obedience to his Laws,
if not animated by Sincerity, is like a
Sacrifice without a Heart, which is an
abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hypocrisy and Insincerity
is a very vain and foolish thing; it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to cheat others, but is in truth a
deceiving of our selves: No Man would
flatter or dissemble, did he believe he
were seen and discover'd; an open Knave
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56284:23"/>
is a great Fool, who destroys at once
both his design and his Reputation; and
this is the case of every Hypocrite; all the
disagreement which is between his Tongue
and his Thoughts, his Actions and his
Heart, is open to that Eye, from which
nothing can be hid; <hi>for the ways of Man
are before the Eyes of the Lord, and he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all his goings; there is no darkness nor
shadow of Death where the workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
may hide themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Truth and Reality have all
the advantages of appearance, and many
more; if the shew of any thing be
good for any thing, I am sure Sincerity
is better; for why does any man dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or seem to be that which he is not,
but because he thinks it good to
have such a quality as he pretends to?
for to counterfeit and dissemble, is to
put on the appearance of some real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency:
Now the best way in the world
for a man to seem to be any thing, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be what he would seem to be: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that it is many times as troublesome
to make good the pretence of a good
quality, as to have it; and if a man have
it not, it is ten to one, but he is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to want it, and then all his pains
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56284:23"/>
and labour to seem to have it is lost.
There is something unnatural in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which a skilful Eye will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
from native Beauty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
            <p>It is hard to personate and act a part
long; for where truth is not at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
nature will always be endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to return, and will peep out and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
herself one time or other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any man think it convenient to
seem Good, let him be so indeed, and
then his Goodness will appear to every
body's satisfaction; for Truth is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and carries it's own light and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
along with it, and will not only
commend us to every Man's Conscience,
but, which is much more, to God, who
searcheth and seeth our Hearts; so that
upon all accounts Sincerity is true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Particularly as to the affairs of this
World Integrity hath many advantages
over all the fine and artificial ways of
Dissimulation and Deceit; it is much the
plainer and easier, much the safer and
more secure way of dealing in the world;
it hath less of trouble and difficulty,
of entanglement and perplexity, of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and hazard in it; it is the shortest
and nearest way to our end, carrying
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56284:24"/>
us thither in a straight line, and will hold
out and last longest. The Arts of Deceit
and Cunning do continually grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and less effectual and serviceable to
them that use them, whereas Integrity
gains strength by use, and the more and
longer any Man practiseth it, the greater
service it does him, by confirming his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and encouraging those with
whom he hath to do, to repose the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Trust and Confidence in him, which
is an unspeakable advantage in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and affairs of life.</p>
            <p>But a Dissembler must always be upon
his guard and watch himself carefully, that
he doth not contradict his own pretence,
for he acts an unnatural part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must put a continual force and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon himself. Truth alwayes lies
uppermost, and if a Man do not careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attend, he will be apt to bolt it out:
Whereas he that acts sincerely, hath the
easiest task in the world, because he
follows Nature, and so is put to no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and care about his words and actions;
he needs not invent any pretences before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
nor make excuses afterwards for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing he hath said or done.</p>
            <p>But Insincerity is very troublesome to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage;
a Man hath so many things to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56284:24"/>
to, so many ends to bring together,
as make his life a very perplext and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
thing: <hi>Oportet mendacem esse memorem,</hi>
A lyar had need have a good memory,
lest he contradict at one time what he
said at another; but Truth is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with it self, and needs nothing
to help it out; it is always near at
hand, and sits upon our Lips, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to drop out before we are aware,
whereas a Lye is troublesome and sets a
Mans invention upon the Rack, and one
trick needs a great many more to make
it good: It is like building upon a false
Foundation, which continually stands in
need of props to shoar it up, and proves
at last more chargable, than to have
raised a substantial Building at first upon
a true and solid Foundation; for Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is firm and substantial, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hollow and unsound in it, and
because it is plain and open, fears no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
of which the Crafty Man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in danger, and when he thinks he
walks in the dark, all his pretences are
so transparent, that he that runs may
read them; he is the last Man that finds
himself to be found out, and whilst he
takes it for granted that he makes Fools
of others, he renders himself ridiculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56284:25"/>
Add to all this, that Sincerity is the most
compendious Wisdom, and an excellent
instrument for the speedy dispatch of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
it creates confidence in those we
have to deal with, saves the labour of
many enquiries, and brings things to an
issue in few words: It is like travelling in
a plain beaten Road, which commonly
brings a Man sooner to his Journeys end,
than By-ways in which Men often lose
themselves. In a word, whatsoever conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
may be thought to be in falshood
and dissimulation, it is soon over; but
the inconvenience of it is perpetual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it brings a Man under an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
jealousie and suspicion, so that he is
not believed when he speaks truth, nor
trusted when perhaps he means honestly:
When a Man hath once forfeited the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Integrity, he is set fast, and
nothing will then serve his turn, neither
Truth nor Falshood.</p>
            <p>And I have often thought, that God
hath in great Wisdom hid from Men of
false and dishonest minds the wonderful
advantages of Truth and Integrity to the
prosperity even of our worldly Affairs;
these Men are so blinded by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and Ambition, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look beyond a present advantage, nor
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56284:25"/>
forbear to seize upon it, tho by ways ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so indirect: They cannot see so far,
as to the remote Consequences of a steady
Integrity, and the vast benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which it will bring a Man at last.
Were but this sort of Men wise and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
enough to discern this, they would
be honest, out of very Knavery, not out
of any love to Honesty and Vertue, but
with a crafty design to promote and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
more effectually their own Interests;
and therefore the Justice of the Divine
Providence hath hid this truest point of
Wisdom from their Eyes, that bad men
might not be upon equal Terms with the
Just and Upright, and serve their own
wicked Designs by honest and lawful
means.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the
world for a day, and should never have
occasion to converse more with Mankind,
never more need their good opinion, or
good Word, it were then no great matter
(speaking as to the concernments of this
world) if a man spent his Reputation all
at once, and ventured it at one throw;
but if he be to continue in the world, and
would have the advantage of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whilst he is in it, let him make use of
Truth and Sincerity in all his Words and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56284:26"/>
Actions, for nothing but this will last and
hold out to the end; all other Arts will
fail, but Truth and Integrity will carry
a man through, and bear him out to the
last.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Observation of <hi>Solomon</hi> (Prov.
12. 19.) <hi>The lip of Truth is established,
for ever, but a lying Tongue is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And the wiser any man is, the
more clearly will he discern, how service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sincerity is to all the great ends and
purposes of humane life; and that man
hath made a good progress, and profited
much in the School of Wisdom, who
valueth Truth and Sincerity according
to their worth: Every man will readily
grant them to be great Vertues and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of a generous mind; but that
there is so much of true Wisdom in them,
and that they really serve to profit our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in this World seems a great Paradox
to the generality of Men, and yet I doubt
not but it is undoubtedly true, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
found to be so, in the experience
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Consider that it is not worth
our while to dissemble, considering the
shortness and especially the uncertainty
of our Lives. To what purpose should
we be so cunning, when our abode in this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56284:26"/>
world is so short and uncertain? Why
should any man by dissembling his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or acting contrary to it, incur at
once the displeasure of God, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
of his own mind? Especially if
we consider, that all our Dissimulation
shall one day be made manifest and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
on the open Theatre of the World,
before God Angels and Men, to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Shame and Confusion; all Disguise
and Vizards shall then be pluckt off, and
every man shall appear in his true Colours.
<hi>For then the Secrets of Men shall be judged,
and God will bring every Work into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and every secret thing, whether it be
Good, or whether it be Evil. Nothing is
now covered, which shall not then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
nor hid which shall not then be
known.</hi>
            </p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>HEB. XI. 17, 18, 19.</bibl>
               <q>By Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was Tryed offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up <hi>Isaac:</hi> And he that had received the
Promises offered up his only begotton Son;
Of whom it was said, That in <hi>Isaac</hi> shall
thy Seed be called: Accounting that God
was able to raise him up, even from the
Dead; From whence also he received him
in a Figure.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE design of this Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> is to recommend to
them the Christian Religion, to which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56284:30"/>
they were but newly Converted, and to
encourage them to Constancy in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of it, notwithstanding the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which attended it. He sets before
them in this Chapter several examples in
the Old Testament of those, (who tho?
they were under a much more imperfect
dispensation) yet by a stedfast belief in
God and his promises, had performed
such wonderful acts of Obedience and
Self-denyal.</p>
            <p>He begins with the Patriarchs before
the Flood, but insists chiefly upon the
examples of two eminent Persons of their
own Nation, as nearest to them, and most
likely to prevail upon them, the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> the one the
Father of their Nation, the other their great
Lawgiver, and both of them the greatest
Patterns of Faith, and Obedience, and
Self-denyal, that the History of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages, from the beginning of the
World, had afforded.</p>
            <p>I shall at this time, by God's assistance,
treat of the first of these, the Example
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Constancy of whose Faith,
and the cheerfulness of whose Obedience,
even in the difficultest Cases, is so remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
above all the other Examples menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in this Chapter. For at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56284:30"/>
of God, he left his Kindred and
his Country, not knowing whither he
should go.</p>
            <p>By which eminent Act of Obedience,
he declared himself to be wholly at God's
Disposal, and ready to follow him: But
this was no tryal in comparison of that
here in my Text, when God commanded
him to offer up his only Son.</p>
            <p>But such was the immutable stedfastness
of his Faith, and the perfect submission
of his Obedience, that it does not appear
that he made the least check at it; but
out of perfect Reverence and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Authority of the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he went about it as readily and
cheerfully, as if God had bid him do
some small thing: <hi>By Faith Abraham
when he was tryed offered up Isaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the explication of which Words,
it will be requisite to consider two
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Tryal or Temptation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Excellency of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Faith and Obedience upon this Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Tryal or Temptation in
general: It is said that <hi>Abraham when
he was tryed,</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tempted: That is, God intending
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56284:31"/>
to make Tryal of his Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and so it is exprest <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 1.
Where it is said, that God did Tempt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
and said unto him, take now thy
Son, thine only Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are two difficulties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this matter: It seems contrary to
Scripture, that God should Tempt any
Man; and contrary to Reason, because
God who knows what every Man will
do, needed not to make tryal of any
Man's Faith or Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It seems contrary to Scripture,
which say's, <hi>God Tempts no Man:</hi> and
'tis most true, that God Tempts no Man,
with a design to draw him into Sin; but
this doth not hinder, but he may try
their Faith and Obedience with great
difficulties, to make them the more illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Thus God Tempted <hi>Abraham;</hi> and
he permitted <hi>Job,</hi> and even our Blessed
Saviour himself to be thus Tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It seems contrary to Reason,
that God, who knows what any Man
will do in any Circumstances, should go
to make Tryal of it. But God does not
try Men for his own information, but to
give an illustrious Proof and Example
to others of Faith and Obedience: And
tho after this Tryal of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56284:31"/>
says to him, <hi>now I know that thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
me, because thou hast not withheld
thy Son, thine only Son from me;</hi> Yet
we are to understand this as spoken after
the manner of Men; As God elsewhere
speaks to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Sodom; I
will go down now to see whether they
have done altogether aecording to the cry
which is come up unto me, and if not, I
will know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the Second thing I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
The Excellency of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith
and Obedience upon this Tryal: <hi>By Faith
Abraham when he was tryed offered up
Isaac.</hi> God accepts of it, as if he had
done it, because he had done it in part,
and was ready to have performed the
rest, if God had not countermanded
him.</p>
            <p>And this act of Faith and Obedience
in <hi>Abraham</hi> will appear the more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if we consider these three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The firmness and stedfastness
of his Faith, notwithstanding the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The constancy of his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
notwithstanding the difficulty of
the thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56284:32"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The reasonableness of his
Faith, in that he gave satisfaction to
himself in so hard and perplext a Case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The firmness and stedfastness of
his Faith will appear, if we consider what
objections there were in the case, enough
to shake a very strong Faith. There
were three great objections against this
Command, and such as might in reason
make a wise and good Man doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Command were from God.</p>
            <p>The horrid nature of the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>The grievous scandal that might seem
almost unavoidably to follow upon it.</p>
            <p>And the horrible consequence of it,
which seemed to make the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> void.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the horrid nature of the
thing commanded, which was for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to kill his own Child; this must
needs appear very barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
and look liker a Sacrifice to an
Idol, than to the true God.</p>
            <p>It seemed to be against the Law of
Nature, and directly contrary to that
kindness and affection which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had planted in the hearts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
towards their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56284:32"/>
And there is no affection more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and strong than this, for there are
many persons that would redeem the
Lives of their Children with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their own. Now that God hath
planted such an affection in Nature, is
an argument that it is good, and
therefore it could not but seem strange
that he should command any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it: And in this case, there were
two circumstances that increased the
horrour of the fact; That his Son was
innocent; and that he was to Slay him
with his own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That his Son was Innocent. It
would grieve the heart of any Father to
give up his Son to Death, tho he were
never so undutiful and disobedient.</p>
            <p>So passionately was <hi>David</hi> affected
with the death of his Son <hi>Absolom,</hi> as
to wish he had dyed for him, tho he
dyed in the very act of Rebellion, and
tho the saving of his Life had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the Peace of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>How deep then must it sink into the
heart of a Father to give up his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Son to death? And such a Son was
<hi>Isaac,</hi> for any thing appeared to the
contrary. God himself gave him this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56284:33"/>
that he was the Son whom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loved, and there is no intimation
of any thing to the contrary: Now this
could not but appear strange to a good
Man, that God should command an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
person to be put to death.
But, <hi>Secondly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a Father should be commanded,
not only to give up his Son to death,
but to slay him with his own Hands;
not only to be a Spectator, but to be
the Actor in this Tragedy; What Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not shrink, and start back
at such a Command? What good Man,
especially in such a case, and where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was so hard prest, would not have
been apt to have looked upon such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
as this, rather as the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and illusion of an evil Spirit, than
a Command of God? And yet <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Faith was not staggered, so as to
call this Revelation of God in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The grievous scandal that
might seem almost unavoidably to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon it, was another great obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against it; the report of such an
action would in all appearance blemish
the reputation, even of so good a Man,
amongst all sober and considerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56284:33"/>
who could hardly forbear to censure
him, as a wicked and unnatural Man.</p>
            <p>And this was a hard case, for a Man
to be put to Sacrifice at once, two of
the dearest things in the world, his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and his Son; nor could he have
easily defended himself from this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by alledging an express Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Command of God for it; for who
would give credit to it?</p>
            <p>A Revelation to another Man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to me, unless I be assured that
he had such a Revelation, which I
cannot be, but either by another
immediate revelation, or by some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to confirm it.</p>
            <p>The act had an appearance of so much
horrour, that it was not easily credible
that God should command it; and if
every Mans confident pretence to revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be admitted, the worst actions may
plead this in their excuse.</p>
            <p>So that this pretence would have been
so far from excusing his fault, that it
must rather have been esteemed a high
aggravation of it, by adding the boldest
Impiety to the most barbarous Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But <hi>Abraham</hi> was not stumbled
at this, nor at the advantage which the
Enemies of his Religion would make of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56284:34"/>
such an occasion, who would be ready
to say, <hi>Here is your excellent good Man,
and likely to be a Friend of God,
who was so cruel an Enemy to his own
Son.</hi> All this 'tis probable he might
consider, but it did not move him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
resolved to obey God, and to leave
it to his Wisdom to provide against all
the inconveniencies that might follow
upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The strongest Objection of
all, was the horrible consequence of the
thing, which seemed to clash with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Revelations, and to make void the
promise which God had before made to
<hi>Abraham, That in his Seed all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth should be blessed,</hi> which
promise was expresly limited to <hi>Isaac</hi>
and his Posterity, who had then no
Son.</p>
            <p>And of this difficulty the Apostle takes
express notice in the Text, <hi>that he that
had received the promises</hi> (that is, was
persuaded of the truth and faithfulness
of them) <hi>offered up his only begotten
Son, of whom it was said, that in Isaac
shall thy Seed be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Objection is really so strong,
that if <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have given
himself satisfaction about it, he might
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56284:34"/>
justly have questioned the truth of the
Revelation; for no Man can possibly
entertain two contradictory Revelations,
as from God, but he must of necessity
question one or both of them; but so
strong was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, as not to
be shaken by the seeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these two Revelations.</p>
            <p>II. We will consider the constancy of
his Resolution to obey God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the harshness and difficulty of
the thing. Tho <hi>Abraham</hi> were firmly
persuaded that this Command to kill
his Son, was really from God; yet it is
no easie matter for a Man to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to obey God in so difficult a case,
and out of meer reverence to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, to divest himself of his
Nature, and to thwart the strongest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of it; a Man would be very
apt to confer with flesh and blood in
such a case. Let but any Man that
knows what it is to be a Father, lay
his hand upon his heart and consider his
own Bowels, and he will be astonished at
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience as well as his
Faith.</p>
            <p>To take his Son, his only Son, his
Son whom he loved, and in whom he
placed all his hopes of a happy Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56284:35"/>
and with his own hands to destroy
him and all his hopes together; it must
be a strong Faith that will engage a
Man to Obedience in so difficult an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
            <p>There is one circumstance more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
which renders <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
very remarkable; The deliberateness
of the action. It had not been so much,
if so soon as he had received this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God, he had upon a suddain
impulse and transport of zeal done
this.</p>
            <p>But that his Obedience might be the
more glorious, and have all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of advantage given to it, God
would have it done deliberately, and
upon full consideration; and therefore
he bad him go to the Mountain three
daies Journey from the place where he
was, and there to offer up his Son.</p>
            <p>It is in acts of Virtue and Obedience,
as in acts of Sin and Vice; the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
the Sin is, and the more calm
and sedate temper the Man is in when
he commits it, the greater is the fault;
whereas what is done by surprize, in the
heat of Temptation or transport of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath some excuse from the suddainness
and indeliberateness of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56284:35"/>
So is it in acts of Virtue and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
especially if they be attended with
considerable difficulty, the more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
they are done, the more virtuous
they are, and the greater praise is due
to them.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Obedience might
want nothing to highten it, God seems
on purpose to have put so long a space
betwixt the Command and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; he gives him time to
cool upon it; to weigh the command,
and to look on every side of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
duty; he gives scope for his reason
to argue and debate the case, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for natural affection to play
its part; and for flesh and blood to
raise all its batteries against the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he had taken up.</p>
            <p>And now we may easily imagin, what
conflict this good Man had within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
during those three daies that he was
travelling to the Mountain in <hi>Moriah;</hi> and
how his heart was ready to be rent in
pieces, betwixt his duty to God, and
his affection to his Child; so that every
step of this unwelcome and wearisome
journey, he did as it were lay violent
hands upon himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56284:36"/>
He was to offer up his Son but once,
but he Sacrificed himself and his own
Will every moment for three days
together; and when he came thither,
and all things were ready, the Altar, the
Wood, and the Fire, and the Knife, it
must needs be a stabbing Question, and
wound him to the Heart, which his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Son so innocently askt him,
<hi>Where is the Lamb, for a Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be a strong Faith indeed, and
a mighty Resolution, that could make
him to hold out three days against the
violent Assaults of his own Nature, and
the charming Presence of his Son, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to melt his Heart, as often as he
cast his Eyes upon him; and yet nothing
of all this, made him to stagger in his
Duty, but <hi>being strong in Faith, he gave
glory to God,</hi> by one of the most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
acts of Obedience that ever was
exacted from any of the Sons of Men.</p>
            <p>III. In the <hi>Third</hi> and last place, I come
to consider the Reasonableness of his
Faith, in that he was able to give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to himself in so intricate and perplext
a case. The constancy of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith,
was not an obstinate and stubborn Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56284:36"/>
but the result of the wisest
reasoning, and soberest consideration.</p>
            <p>So the Text says, that <hi>he counted</hi>
(the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>he Reasoned
with himself) that God was able to
raise him up from the Dead;</hi> so that
he debated the matter with himself,
and gave himself satisfaction, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Objections and Difficulties in
the case; and being fully satisfied that
it was a Divine Command, he resolved
to obey it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Objections</hi> I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>1. The horrid appearance of the
thing, that a Father should Slay his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Son. Why should <hi>Abraham</hi> scruple
the doing this, at the Command of
God, who being the Author of Life,
hath power over it, and may resume
what he hath given, and take away the
Life of any of his Creatures when he
will, and make whom he pleaseth instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the execution of his Command?</p>
            <p>It was indeed a hard case, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
natural affection; and therefore God
did not permit it to be executed.</p>
            <p>But the question of God's Right over
the lives of Men; and of his authority
to command any Man to be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56284:37"/>
of his pleasure in such a case, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no dispute.</p>
            <p>And the God hath planted strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in Parents towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
yet he hath written no Law in
any Man's heart, to the prejudice of his
own Soverign Right: This is a case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
excepted, and this takes away the
objection of Injustice.</p>
            <p>2. As to the scandal of it, that could
be no great objection in those times,
when the absolute power of Parents
over their Children was in it's full force,
and they might put them to Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being accountable for it.</p>
            <p>So that then it was no such startling
matter, to hear of a Father putting
his Child to Death; nay, in much later
times we find that in the most ancient
Laws of the <hi>Romans</hi> (I mean those of
the 12 <hi>Tables</hi>) Children are absolutely
put in the power of their Parents, to
whom is given, <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis,</hi> a power
of Life and Death over them; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to sell them for Slaves.</p>
            <p>And tho amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> this pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
power was limited by the Law of
<hi>Moses;</hi> and the judgment of Life and
Death was taken out of the Fathers
hands, except in case of Contumacy and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56284:37"/>
Rebellion; (and even in that case the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was to be before the Elders of the
City) yet it is certain, that in elder times
the paternal power was more absolute
and unaccountable, which takes off much
from the horror and scandal of the thing,
as it appears now to us who have no
such power.</p>
            <p>And therefore we do not find in the
History, that this Objection did much
stick with <hi>Abraham:</hi> It being then no
unusual thing for a Father to put his
Child to Death, upon a just account.</p>
            <p>And the Command of God, who
hath absolute Dominion over the Lives
of his Creatures, is certainly a just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and no Man can reasonably scruple
the doing of that, upon the Command
of God, which he might have done by
his own Authority, without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for the Action, to any but
God only.</p>
            <p>3. As to the Objection from the
horrible consequence of the thing
Commanded, that the Slaying of <hi>Isaac</hi>
seemed to overthrow <hi>the Promise,
which God had made before to</hi> Abraham,
<hi>That in</hi> Isaac <hi>his Seed should be called:</hi>
This seems to him to be the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and here he makes use of Reason,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56284:38"/>
to reconcile the seeming Contradiction
of this Command of God, to his former
Promise. So the Text tells us, that <hi>he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his only begotten Son, of whom
it was said, that in</hi> Isaac, <hi>shall thy Seed
be called; Reasoning that God was able
to raise him up from the Dead.</hi> So
that tho' <hi>Isaac</hi> were put to Death, yet
he saw how the Promise of God might
still be made good by his being raised
from the Dead, and living afterwards
to have a numerous Posterity.</p>
            <p>There had then indeed been no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
or Example of any such thing
in the World, as the Resurrection of
one from the Dead, which makes <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
Faith the more wonderful, but he
confirmed himself in this Belief, by an
Example as near the case as might be.
<hi>He Reasoned, that God was able to raise
him from the Dead, from whence also he
had received him in a Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I know is by Interpreters ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
understood of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the Jaws of Death, when
he was laid upon the Altar, and ready
to be Slain. But the Text seems not to
speak of what happend after, but of
something that had passed before: By
which <hi>Abraham</hi> confirmed himself in this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56284:38"/>
peruasion, that if he were Slain, God
would raise him up again.</p>
            <p>And so the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> ought
to be rendred, in the past time, <hi>from
whence also he had received him, in a
Figure.</hi> So that this Expression plainly
refers to the miraculous Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
when his Parents were past the Age of
having Children; which was little less
than a Resurrection from the Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And so the Scripture speaks of it.</hi>
Rom. 4. 17. <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God,
who quickeneth the Dead, and calleth
the things which are not, as if they were,
and not being weak in Faith, he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not his own Body which was Dead;
<hi>and a little before the Text, (speaking
of the miraculous Birth of</hi> Isaac) and
therefore sprang there of one, and him as
good as dead, as many as the Stars of Heaven.</p>
            <p>From whence (as the Apostle tells us)
<hi>Abraham</hi> Reasoned thus; That God who
gave him <hi>Isaac</hi> at first, in so miraculous a
manner, was able by another miracle to
restore him to life again, after he was
Dead, and to make him the Father of
many Nations. <hi>He Reasoned, that God
was able to raise him up from the Dead,
from whence also he had received him in a
Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56284:39"/>
Thus you see the reasonableness of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith; he pitched upon the
main difficulty in the Case, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
it, as well as was possible: And
in his reasoning about this matter, he
gives the utmost weight to every thing,
that might tend to vindicate the Truth
and faithfulness of God's Promise, and
to make the Revelations of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with one another; and this tho'
he had a great Interest, and a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
concernment of his own, to have
biassed him.</p>
            <p>For he might have argued with great
appearance and probability the other way:
But as every Pious and Good Man should
do, he reasoned on God's side, and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that part. Rather than disobey a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, or believe that his promise
should be frustrate, he will believe any
thing that is credible and possible, how
improbable soever. Thus far Faith will
go, but no farther: From the believing
of plain Contradictions and Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it alwayes desires to be excused.</p>
            <p>Thus much for explication of the
Words; which I hope hath not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unprofitable, because it tends
to clear a point which hath something
of difficulty and obscurity in it, and to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56284:39"/>
vindicate the Holy Scripture, and the
Divine Revelation therein contained,
from one of the most specious Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>But I had a farther design in this Text;
And that is to make some <hi>Observations</hi>
and <hi>Inferences</hi> from it, that may be of
use to us. As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Humane Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of clear and full satisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a Divine Revelation; for if
<hi>Abraham</hi> had not been fully and past all
doubt assured that this was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God, he would certainly
have spared his Son. And nothing is
more reasonable, than to believe that
those to whom God is pleased to make
immediate Revelations of his Will, are
some way or other assured that they are
Divine, otherwise they would be in
vain, and to no purpose.</p>
            <p>But how Men are assured concerning
Divine Revelations made to them, is
not so easy to make out to others: Only
these two things we are sure of.</p>
            <p>1. That God can work in the
Mind of Man, a firm persuasion of the
Truth of what he Reveals, and that
such a Revelation is from him. This no
Man can doubt of, that considers the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56284:40"/>
great power and influence which God,
who made us, and perfectly knows our
Frame, must needs have upon our Minds
and Understandings.</p>
            <p>2. That God never offers any
thing to any Man's belief, that plainly
contradicts the Natural and Essential No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Mind. Because this would
be for God to destroy his own
Workmanship, and to impose that upon
the understanding of Man, which whilst
it remains what it is, it cannot possibly
admit.</p>
            <p>For instance, We cannot imagin, that
God should Reveal to any Man any thing,
that plainly contradicts the Essential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the Divine Nature; for such
a Revelation can no more be supposed
to be from God, than a Revelation from
God, that there is no God; which is a
downright Contradiction.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to the Revelation,
which God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacrificing of his Son. This was
made to him by an audible Voice, and
he was fully satisfied by the Evidence
which it carried along with it, that it
was from God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56284:40"/>
For this was not the first of many
Revelations that had been made to him,
so that he knew the manner of them, and
had found by manifold experience, that
he was not deceived, and upon this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
was grown to a great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Truth and Goodness of
God. And it is very probable, the first
time God appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> because
it was a new thing, that to make way
for the credit of future Revelations,
God did shew himself to him in so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a manner, as was abundantly to his
Conviction.</p>
            <p>And this St. <hi>Stephen</hi> does seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<hi>Acts 7. 2. The God of glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he
was in</hi> Mesopotamia. Now by this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Appearance of God to him at
first, he was so, prepared for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of after Revelations, that he
was not staggered even at this, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sacrificing of his Son, being
both by the manner of it, and the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that accompanied it, fully satisfied
that it was from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe from hence the
great and necessary use of Reason, in
matters of Faith. For we see here that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56284:41"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Reason, was a mighty strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and help to his Faith. Here were
two Revelations made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which seemed to clash with one another;
and if <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Reason could not have
reconciled the Repugnancy of them,
he could not possibly have believed them
both to be from God; because this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Notion, or Principle, <hi>that God
cannot contradict himself,</hi> every Man
does first, and more firmly believe, than
any Revelation whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Reason relieved him
in this strait; so the Text expresly
tells us, <hi>that he reasoned with himself,
that God was able to raise him from the
Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this being admitted, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, concerning the Slaying
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> was very well consistent with
his former Promise, That <hi>in Isaac his
Seed should be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know there hath a very rude cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
been raised by some persons,
(but of more Zeal I think than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
against the use of Reason in
matters of Faith; but how very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
this is, will appear to any one
that will but have patience to consider
these following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56284:41"/>
1. The nature of Divine Revelation:
That it doth not endow Men with
new Faculties; but propoundeth new
Objects to the Faculties, which they had
before. Reason is the Faculty whereby
Revelation is to be discerned; for when
God reveals any thing to us, he reveals
it to our Understanding, and by that we
are to judge of it: Therefore St. <hi>John</hi>
cautions us 1 <hi>Jo. 4. 1. Not to believe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
spirit, but to try the spirits, whether
they are of God, because many false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are gone out into the world:</hi> That
is, there are many that falsly pretend to
Inspiration; but how can these preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
be tryed and discerned from those
that are truly inspired, but by using
our Reason, in comparing the evidence
for the one and the other?</p>
            <p>2. This will farther appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the nature of Faith. Faith
(as we are now speaking of it) is an
assent of the Mind to something as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
by God: Now all assent must be
grounded upon evidence, that is, no
Man can believe any thing, unless he
have, or thinks he hath some reason
to do so. For to be confident of a thing
without reason, is not Faith, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
persuasion, and obstinacy of
mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56284:42"/>
3. This will yet be more evident, if
we consider the method, that must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be used to convince any Man of the
truth of Religion. Suppose we had to deal
with one that is a Stranger, and Enemy
to Christianity, What means are proper
to be used to gain him over to it? The
most natural method surely were this,
to acquaint him with the Holy Scriptures,
which are the Rule of our Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
He would ask us, <hi>why we believe
that Book?</hi> The proper answer would
be, <hi>because it is the Word of God;</hi> this
he could not but acknowledge to be a
very good reason, if it were true: But
then he would ask, <hi>Why we believed
it to be the Word of God, rather than</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet'<hi>s</hi>
Alchoran, <hi>which pretends no less
to be of divine Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Man now should answer,</hi> that
he could give no reason why he believed it to
be the word of God, only he believed it to
be so, and so every man else ought to do,
without enquiring after any further reason,
because reason is to be laid a side in matters
of Faith; <hi>would not the Man presently
reply,</hi> that he had just as much reason as
this comes to, to believe the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> or
any thing else; <hi>that is none at all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56284:42"/>
But certainly the better way would be,
to satisfie this Man's reason, by proper
arguments; that the Scriptures are a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, and that no other Book
in the world can with equal reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be so; and if this be a good
way, then we do and must call in the
assistance of reason for the proof of our
Religion.</p>
            <p>4. Let it be considered farther, that
the highest commendations that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Scripture to any ones Faith, are
given upon account of the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith is famous,
and made a pattern to all generations,
because he reasoned himself into it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
and he did not blindly break
through these objections, and wink hard
at them, but he look'd them in the face,
and gave himself reasonable satisfaction
concerning them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Centurian</hi>'s Faith is commended
by our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 11. Because
when his Servant was sick, he did not
desire him to come to his house, but to
<hi>speak the word only, and his Servant should
be healed:</hi> For he reasoned thus, <hi>I am a
man under authority, having Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me, and I say to this man go and he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56284:43"/>
goeth, and to another come and he cometh; and
to my Servant do this, and he doth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if he that was himself under au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
could thus command those that
were under him; much more could he
that had a divine Power and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do what he pleased by his word.
And our Saviour is so far from repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
him for reasoning himself into
this belief, that he admires his Faith so
much the more for the reasonableness of
it, <hi>v. 10. When Jesus heard this, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
and said to them that followed him,
verily, I say unto you, I have not found so
great Faith, no not in Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inlike manner our Saviour commends
the Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Faith, because
she enforc't it so reasonably. <hi>Matthew</hi>
15. 22. She sued to him to help her
Daughter, <hi>but he answered her not a
word;</hi> and when his Disciples could
not prevail with him to mind her,
yet still the prest him, <hi>saying, Lord
help me;</hi> and when he repulsed her with
this severe answer, <hi>It is not meet to take
the Childrens bread and cast it to dogs,</hi>
she made this quick and modest reply,
<hi>truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
which fall from their Masters Table.</hi> She
acknowledgeth her own unworthiness,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56284:43"/>
but yet believes his goodness to be such,
that he will not utterly reject those who
humbly seek to him; upon which he
gives her this testimony, <hi>O woman great
is thy faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostles were divinely inspired,
and yet the <hi>Bereans</hi> are commended,
because they enquired and satisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the reasons of their belief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they assented to the doctrine which
was delivered to them, even by Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that certainly were Infallible.</p>
            <p>5. None are reproved in Scripture for
their unbelief, but where sufficient reason
and evidence was offered to them. The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
are generally blamed for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;
but then it was after such
mighty wonders had been wrought for
their Conviction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours time, are
not condemned simply for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
but for not believing when there
was such clear evidence offered to them.
So our Saviour himself says, <hi>If I had
not done amongst them, the works which
no other man did, they had not had sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas</hi> indeed is blamed for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
of his unbelief, because he
would believe nothing but what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
saw.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56284:44"/>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> To shew this yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let us consider the great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and absurdity of declining the
use of Reason in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
There can be no greater preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to Religion, than to decline this
tryal.</p>
            <p>To say we have no Reason for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is to say it is unreasonable. Indeed it
is Reason enough for any Article of our
Faith, that God hath revealed it, because
this is one of the strongest and most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
reasons for the belief of any thing.
But when we say God hath revealed any
thing, we must be ready to prove it, or
else we say nothing. If we turn off Reason
here, we level the best Religion in the
World with the wildest and most absurd
Enthusiams.</p>
            <p>And it does not alter the case much,
to give Reason ill names, to call it blind,
and carnal Reason. Our best reason is
but very short and imperfect: But since
it is no better, we must make use of it
as it is, and make the best of it.</p>
            <p>Before I pass from this Argument, I
cannot but observe, that both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
of those who differ from our
Church, are generally great Declamers
against the use of Reason in matters of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56284:44"/>
Faith: If they find <hi>their</hi> account in it, 'tis
well; for <hi>our parts</hi> we apprehend no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of inconvenience, in having Reason on
our side; nor need we to desire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
evidence, that any Man is in the
wrong, than to hear him declare against
Reason, and thereby to acknowledge
that reason is against him. Men may vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
Reason as much as they please; and
tho being reviled she reviles not again,
yet in a more still and gentle way, she
commonly hath her full revenge upon
all those that rail at her.</p>
            <p>I have often wonder'd that people
can with patience endure to hear their
Teachers and Guides talk against Reason;
and not only so, but they pay them the
greater submission and veneration for it.
One would think this but an odd way
to gain authority over the minds of
Men; but some skilful and designing
men, have found by experience, that it
is a very good way to recommend them
to the ignorant, as Nurses use to endear
themselves to Children, by perpetual
noise and nonsense.</p>
            <p>III. I observe, that God obligeth no
Man to believe plain and evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
as matters of Faith. <hi>Abraham</hi>
could not reasonably have believed this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56284:45"/>
second revelation to have been from
God, if he had not found some way to
reconcile it with the first. For tho a
Man were never so much disposed to
submit his Reason to divine Revelation;
yet it is not possible for any Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
God against God himself.</p>
            <p>Some Men seem to think that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
God mightily, by believing plain
contradictions. But the matter is quite
otherwise. He that made Man a <hi>reasonable</hi>
Creature, cannot take it kindly from
any Man, to debase his workmanship,
by making himself <hi>unreasonable.</hi> And
therefore, as no service, or obedience; so
no Faith is acceptable unto God, but
what is reasonable; if it be not so, it
may be confidence or presumption, but
it is not Faith; for he that can believe
plain contradictions, may believe any
thing how absurd soever; because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more absurd, than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a plain contradiction; and he
that can believe any thing, believes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon good grounds, because to
him Truth and Falsehood are all one.</p>
            <p>4. I observe that the great cause of the
defect of Mens obedience is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Faith. Did we believe the
commands of God in the Gospel, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56284:45"/>
his promises and threatnings, as firmly as
<hi>Abraham</hi> believed God in this case; what
should we not be ready to do, or suffer
in obedience to him?</p>
            <p>If our Faith were but as strong and
vigorous as his was, the effects of it
would be as great and conspicuous; were
we verily persuaded that all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of our Religion are the express
Laws of God, and that all the promises
and threatnings of the Gospel will one
day be verified and made good, <hi>What
manner of persons should we be in all
holy conversation and godliness?</hi> How
would the lively thoughts of another
world, raise us above the vanities of
this present life; and set us out of the
reach of the most powerful temptations
that this world can assault us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
and make us to do all things with
regard to Eternity, and to that solemn
and dreadful account which we must one
day make to God the Judge of all?</p>
            <p>It is nothing but the want of a firm
and steady belief of these things, that
makes our Devotion so dead and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and our resolutions of doing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so weak and inconsistent. This it
is, that makes us so easie a prey to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
temptation; and the things of this
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56284:46"/>
world to look so much bigger than they
are; the enjoyments of it more tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the evils of it more terrible
than in truth they are. And in all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
betwixt our Conscience and our
Interest, to hold the balance so unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to put our foot upon the lighter
Scale, that it may seem to weigh down
the other.</p>
            <p>In a word, in proportion to the
strength or weakness of our Faith, our
obedience to God will be more or less
constant, uniform, and perfect; because
Faith is the great source and spring of
all the Virtues of a good life.</p>
            <p>5. We have great reason to submit to
the ordinary strokes of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon our selves, or near relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or any thing that is dear to us.
Most of these are easily compared with
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s case; it requires a prodigious
strength of Faith to perform so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
an act of obedience.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>And lastly,</hi> We are utterly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
if we disobey the easie Precepts
of the Gospel. <hi>The yoke of Christ is easie,
and his burden light,</hi> in comparison of
God's former dispensations. This was a
grievous Commandment which God gave
to <hi>Abraham, to sacrifice his only Son:</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56284:46"/>
It was <hi>a hard saying</hi> indeed; and <hi>which
of us could have been able to hear it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if God think fit to call us to the
more difficult duties of self-denial, and
suffering for his truth and righteousness
sake, we must after the example of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Abraham,</hi> not think much to deny or
part with any thing for him, no not life
it self. But even this which is the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of Religion, is easier than what
God put upon <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it doth not offer near the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to nature, to lay down our life in
a good cause, as it would do, to put a
Child to death with our own hands.
Besides the consideration of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
comfort and support, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rewards that are expresly promised
to our obedience and self denial in such
a case; encouragement enough to make
a very difficult duty easie.</p>
            <p>And whilst I am perswading you and
my self to resolution and constancy in
our Holy Religion, notwithstanding all
hazards and hardships that may attend it,
I have a just sense of the frailty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and of humane resolution:
But with all, a most firm persuasion of
the goodness of God, that he will not
suffer those who sincerely love him and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56284:47"/>
his Truth, <hi>to be tempted above what they
are able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will add but one consideration more,
to shew the difference betwixt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
case and ours. God commanded
him to do the hardest thing in the world,
to sacrifice his only Son; but he hath
given us an easie commandment; and
that he might effectually oblige us to
our duty, he hath done that for us
which he required <hi>Abraham</hi> to do for
him; <hi>he hath not spared his own Son, his
only Son, but hath given him up to death
for us all: And hereby we know that he
loveth us, that he hath given his Son for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What God required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he
did not intend should be executed; but
one great design of it was to be a Type
and Figure of that immense love
and kindness which he intended to
all mankind, in the Sacrifice of his Son,
as a propitiation for the sins of the whole
world.</p>
            <p>And as the most clear and express
promise of the Messias was made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
so the most express and lively Type
of the Messias that we meet with in all
the old Testament, was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Son. And as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> tells
us (from an ancient and constant Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56284:47"/>
of the <hi>Jews</hi>) the Mountain in <hi>Moriah,</hi>
where <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<hi>Isaac,</hi> was Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where our
Lord also was Crucified and offered up,
<hi>that by this one sacrifice of himself once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
he might perfect for ever them that are
sanctified, and obtain eternal redemption
for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to him that sitteth upon the throne,
and to the Lamb that was slain, to God even
our Father, and to our Lord Jesus Christ the
first begotten from the dead; to the Prince of
the Kings of the Earth; to him that loved
us, and washed us from our sins in his own
blood; to him be Glory and honour,
thanksgiving and power, now and for ever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE Text sets before us a great
pattern of self-denial; for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understanding whereof, I will give
a brief account of the History of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56284:49"/>
to which our Apostle in this passage
doth refer.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moses</hi> was born, his Parents
(for fear of the cruel law which <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
had made, <hi>That all the male Children
of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>so soon as they were
born, should be put to death</hi>) after
they had hid him three months, did at
last expose him in an Ark of Bulrushes,
upon the River <hi>Nile,</hi> and committed
him to the providence of God, whom
they despair'd to conceal any longer by
their own care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter coming by the
River side, espied him, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on him; and guessing him to
be one of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Children, called
for an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nurse, to take care of
him, who, as the Prviodence of God had
ordered it, proved to be the Childs own
Mother. As he grew up, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
Daughter took care of his Education in
all Princely qualities, and adopted him
for her Son; and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>(as <hi>Josephus</hi> tells
us) being without Son, designed him
Heir of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> refused this great offer. But
why did he refuse it, when it seem'd to
be presented to him by the providence
of God, and was brought about in so
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56284:49"/>
strange a manner, and when by this
means he might probably have had it
in his power to have eased the <hi>Israelites</hi>
of their cruel bondage, and perhaps
have had the oportunity of reducing
that great Kingdom from the worship
of Idols to the true God? Why
would he refuse a Kingdom which was
offered to him with so fair an oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing so much good?</p>
            <p>That which seems to have prevailed
with <hi>Moses,</hi> was this, That he could not
accept the offer, without forsaking God,
and renouncing his Religion; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how strangely the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were
addicted to Idolatry, he could never
hope to be accepted for Heir of that
Kingdom, unless he would violate his
Conscience, either by abandoning or
dissembling his Religion.</p>
            <p>And how unlikely it was that he
should prevail with them to change
their Religion, he might easily judge by
the example of <hi>Joseph,</hi> who tho he had
so much authority and esteem amongst
them, by having been so great a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
to their Nation; yet he could
never move them in the least, in that
matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56284:50"/>
Now seeing he had no hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or enjoying that dignity without
sinning grievously against God, he would
not purchase a Kingdom at so uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
a price. And as for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of his people, he was content
to trust the providence and promise of
God for that; and in the mean time was
resolved rather to take a part in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of God's people, <hi>than to enjoy
the pleasures of sin for a season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, I shall
take occasion to consider these Four
things.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Moses</hi>'s self-denial, in preferring
and choosing a state of afflicted piety,
before any sinful enjoyments whatsoever;
before the greatest earthly happiness and
prosperity, when it was not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and enjoyed upon other terms
than of sinning against God.</p>
            <p>II. I shall consider those circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this self-denial of <hi>Moses,</hi> which
do very much commend and set off the
virtue of it.</p>
            <p>III. The prudence and reasonableness
of this choice, in preferring a state of
afflicted Piety and Virtue, before the
greatest prosperity and pleasure of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
course.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56284:50"/>
IV. Supposing this choice to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
I shall inquire how it comes
to pass that so many make another
choice.</p>
            <p>I. We will consider <hi>Moses</hi> his self-denial,
in preferring a state of afflicted
piety, before the greatest earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and prosperity, when it is not to
be enjoyed upon other terms, than of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against God. He was adopted Heir
of the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (one of the
greatest and most flourishing Kingdoms
then in the World;) But he could not
hope to attain to this dignity, and to
secure himself in the possession of it,
upon other terms than of complying
with that Nation, in their Idolatrous
Religion and Worship.</p>
            <p>Now being brought up in the belief
of the true God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> by
his Mother, to whom <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had committed him, he could not
without great violence to his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the principles of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
renounce the true God, and fall
off to the Idolatry of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi>
And for this reason he refused to be
called the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter,
chusing rather to suffer affliction with
the worshipers of the true God, than to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56284:51"/>
have the temporary enjoyment of any
thing that was not to be had without
sin; for so the word ought to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>than to
have the temporary enjoyment of sin.</hi>
So here was <hi>Moses</hi> his self-denial, that
he chose rather to suffer affliction
with the worshipers of the true God,
than to gain a Kingdom, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of God and Religion.</p>
            <p>II. We will consider those circumstances
of his self denial, which do very much
commend and set off the virtue of it.</p>
            <p>1. What it was he refused to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<hi>the Son of</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Daughter;</hi> that
is, to be Heir of one of the greatest
and most flourishing Kingdoms in the
world: a temptation so great, that the
Devil himself could not find out one
much greater, when he set upon the
Son of God, to tempt him to fall down
and worship him.</p>
            <p>And when we consider for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
things some men sell their
Religion and their Consciences, we shall
think it no small temptation which <hi>Moses</hi>
here resisted. <hi>Si violandum est jus, regnandi
causÃ¢ violandum est;</hi> If a Man would do
any unjust thing, and violate his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Conscience, he would not do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56284:51"/>
it for less than a Kingdom; and it would
be a very hard bargain, even upon those
terms.</p>
            <p>2. Consider not only what he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but what he chose in the place of it;
a state of great affliction and suffering.
Had he refused a Kingdom, and chosen
the quiet condition of a Subject of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
rank (beneath envy and above
contempt,) his self-denial had not been
so great; nay perhaps he had made a
wise choice, in the account of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
men, in preferring a plentiful
and quiet retirement, before the cares
of a Crown, and the burthen of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Government.</p>
            <p>But it is very rare to find a Man, that
would choose rather to be opprest and
persecuted; than to be a Prince, and
to have the sweet power to use others
as he pleased.</p>
            <p>3. Consider how fair a prospect he
had of enjoying this Kingdom, if he
could but have come up to the terms
of it. He did not reject it, because he
despaired of attaining it: for he had
all the right that a good title could
give him, being adopted Heir to it; and
yet he refused it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:56284:52"/>
To which I may add, that his breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was such, as might easily kindle
ambitious thoughts in him. He was
brought up in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and was
the Darling and Favourite of it; exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beautiful (as <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us) and
learned in all the wisdom of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
than which no two qualities are
more apt to puff up, and swell a Man
with big thoughts of himself.</p>
            <p>They that are bred in a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never think of a Kingdom; Men
not being apt to aspire to things which
are remote, and at a great distance
from them. But nothing is more rare
in persons of great and generous minds,
than such a self-denial as this.</p>
            <p>4. Let it be considered in the last place,
that this was a deliberate choice, not any
rash and sudain determination made by
him, when he was of incompetent age
to make a true judgment of things.
And this the Apostle takes notice of in
the Text, as a very memorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>that when he was come to years,
he refused to be called the Son of</hi> Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh's
<hi>Daughter.</hi> And St. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells us,
that he was full forty years old when he
made this choice, <hi>Acts 7. 23. When he
was full forty years old, it came into his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56284:52"/>
heart, to visit his brethren, the children
of Israel.</hi> When he was of ripest judgment,
and in the height of his prosperity, and
reputation, he made this choice: for it is
said in the verse before, <hi>that Moses was
learned in all the wisdom of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and mighty in word and deed;</hi> that
is, he was in great reputation for his
Wisdom and Valour.</p>
            <p>This seems to refer to other passages
of his Life, which are not recorded in
the Scripture History, but related at
large by <hi>Josephus</hi> out of Historians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in his time. For he tells, that when
the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had invaded <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
almost over-run it, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was
directed by the Oracle at <hi>Memphis,</hi> to
make <hi>Moses</hi> his General, who by his
extraordinary Conduct and Courage
overthrew the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and drave
them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Moses</hi> did not think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of himself; but St. <hi>Stephen</hi> seems to
allude to it, when he says, that he was
mighty in word and deed: And then
it follows; <hi>and when he was full forty years
old, it came into his heart to visit his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the children of Israel;</hi> that is, when
he was at full maturity of judgment,
and in the hight of his Prosperity, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56284:53"/>
Reputation, he quitted the Court of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and went to visit his afflicted
Brethren, and chose rather to take part
with them in their sufferings, than to
accept those great offers that were made
to him.</p>
            <p>There is likewise another passage in
<hi>Josephus</hi> concerning <hi>Moses,</hi> which seems
to be a forerunner of the contempt
which he shewed afterward of the
Crown of <hi>Egypt;</hi> That when <hi>Moses</hi> was
about three years old, <hi>Thermuthis,</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> brought the Child
to him, who took him in his arms
and put his Diadem upon his Head,
But <hi>Moses</hi> took it off, and cast it to
the ground, and trampled it under his
feet. This was but a childish act, and
they who saw it, would easily believe,
that for all his childish contempt of it
then, it it were put upon his Head in
good earnest, when he came to be a
Man, he would hold it on faster, and
use it with more respect.</p>
            <p>And it is not improbable, but that
the Apostle might have some regard to
this, when he says, that Moses <hi>when
he came to Years;</hi> intimating that he did
not only trample upon the Diadem of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he was a Child; but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56284:53"/>
when he was come to years, and was
capable of judging better of those things,
he refused to be called the Son of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Daughter.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any farther, I
cannot but take notice of an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may seem to reflect greatly
upon the integrity of <hi>Moses.</hi> Can we
think him so very conscientious a Man,
who persuaded the people of <hi>Israel</hi>
(and pretended God's direction in the
case) to cheat the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their
Jewels, under a fraudulent pretence of
borrowing them? There is some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the thing, as at first sight it appears:
And yet I doubt not, with your favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
attention, and free from prejudice,
to vindicate <hi>Moses</hi> clearly in this
matter.</p>
            <p>And I shall not insist upon that, which
is commonly and truly said in this case;
That God, who is the supream Lord of
all things, may transfer the Rights of
Men from one to another: because
the objection doth not lye against
God's Right to take away from any Man
what he hath given him; but against
the fraudulent manner of doing it,
which seems unworthy of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or encourage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:56284:54"/>
Now this matter I think is capable of
another, and much clearer answer; which
in short, is this, and grounded upon the
History, as we find it related, <hi>Ex.</hi> 12.
The Providence of God did, it seems,
design by this way to make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> for the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
usage which they had received
from the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And that first (as
the Text expresly tells us) <hi>in giving
them favour with the Egyptians,</hi> who in
truth, for their own ends, and to get
rid of such troublesome Guests, were
disposed to lend them any thing they
had.</p>
            <p>Thus far all is right. Here is nothing
but fair borrowing and lending: And if
the <hi>Israelites</hi> acquired a right to those
things afterwards, there was then no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to restitution.</p>
            <p>Let us see then how the Providence
of God brought this about: Namely, by
permitting the <hi>Egyptians</hi> afterwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, and after leave given them
to depart, to persue them, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to have destroyed them; by which
Hostility and Perfidiousness they plainly
forfeited their Right to what they had
only lent before. For this hostile attempt,
which would have warranted the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56284:54"/>
to have spoiled them of their
Jewels, if they had been in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> did certainly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them to keep them when they had
them; and by this means they became
rightful possessors of what they had
only by Loan before, and could not
have detained without fraud and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
if this hostility of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
had not given them a new title and clear
right to them.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the <hi>third</hi> thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
which was to vindicate the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and reasonableness of this choice.
And in speaking to this, I shall abstract
from the particular case of <hi>Moses,</hi> and
shew in general, That it is a prudent and
reasonable thing, to prefer even an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
state of Piety and Virtue, before
the greatest pleasures and prosperity of
a sinful course: And this will appear, if
we consider these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. The sufferings of good Men upon
account of Religion, together with the
the reward of them.</p>
            <p>2. The temporary enjoyment of
sin, with the mischiefs and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
consequent upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:56284:55"/>
1. The sufferings of good Men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of Religion, together
with the reward of them. This <hi>Moses</hi>
had in his eye, when he made this choice;
for therefore <hi>he chose to suffer Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the People of God, rather
than to enjoy the Pleasures of sin, which
are but for a Season,</hi> because <hi>he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the recompence of reward:</hi> And tho
he had but a very imperfect discovery,
in comparison of the future state, yet
it seems he had so much assurance of
the goodness of God, as firmly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he should be no loser at the
last, by any thing that he suffered for
God and Religion. Indeed if there were
no life after this, and we had no
expectation beyond this world, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thing we could do, would be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
as much of the present contentment
of this world, as we could make our
selves Masters of.</p>
            <p>But if we be designed for immortality,
and shall be unspeakably happy, or into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
miserable in another world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as we have demeaned our selves in this
life; then certainly it is reasonable that
we should take the greatest care of the
longest duration, and be content to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with some present inconveniences,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56284:55"/>
for an eternal felicity; and be willing to
labour and take pains for a little while,
that we may be happy forever. And this is
accounted prudence in the account of the
wisest Men, to part with a little in present,
for a far greater future advantage.</p>
            <p>But the disproportion betwixt Time
and Eternity is so vast, that did we
but firmly believe, that we shall live
for ever, nothing in this world could
reasonably be thought too good to part
withall, or too grievous to suffer for the
obtaining of a blessed Immortality. And
upon this belief and persuasion of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reward, beyond all their present suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and that they should be infinite
gainers at the last, the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were kept from sinking under their
present sufferings, and fortified against
all that the malice and cruelty of the
world could do unto them. And if we
would consider all things together, and
mind the invisible things of another
world, as well as the things which are
seen, we should easily discern that he
who suffers for God and Religion, does
not renounce his happiness, but put it
out to Interest, upon terms of greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and does wisely consider his
own best, and and most lasting interest.
This is the <hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56284:56"/>
II. This will yet more evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we consider the temporary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of sin, together with the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and inconveniencies attending,
and consequent upon them: That as to
the nature of them, they are mixt, and
imperfect; as to the duration of them,
they are short, and but for a season;
and as to the final issue and consquence
of them, that they end in misery and
sorrow.</p>
            <p>1. As to the nature of them, all the
pleasures and enjoyments of sin are
mixt and imperfect. A wicked Man may
make a shew of mirth and pleasure, but
<hi>even in laughter his heart is sorrowful, and
the end of that mirth is heaviness.</hi> There
can be no true and sincere pleasure in
any sinful and vitious course, tho it be
attended with all the Pomp and Splendor
of outward Happiness and Prosperity; for
where ever sin and vice is, there must be
guilt; and whereever guilt is, the mind
will be restless and unquiet.</p>
            <p>For there are two very troublesome
and tormenting passions, which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
consequent upon guilt; Shame
and Fear. Shame, arising from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the danger of being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
and Fear, from the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56284:56"/>
of the danger of being punisht: And
these do continually haunt the sinner,
and fill him with inward horror and
confusion, in his most secret retirements.
And if sin were attended with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trouble but the guilt of it, a wise
Man would not commit it, if it were
for no other reason, but meerly for the
peace and quiet of his own mind.</p>
            <p>2. The enjoyments of sin, as to the
duration of them are but short. Upon
this consideration, <hi>Moses</hi> set no great
price and value upon them, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
affliction and suffering in good
company, and in a good cause, before
the temporary enjoyments of sin.</p>
            <p>If the enjoyments of this world were
perfect in their nature, and had no
mixture of trouble and sorrow in them:
Yet this would be a great abatement of
them, that they are of so short and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
a continuance. The pleasure of
most sins expires with the act of them;
and when that is done, the delight va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny but there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
worldly advantages to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by sin, which may perhaps be of a
longer continuance; as Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
the common purchase of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56284:57"/>
and Ambition, and of that long
train of inferiour Vices which attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and minister unto them; but
even these enjoyments are in their own
nature of an uncertain continuance,
and much more uncertain for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purchased by indirect and ill means.
But if the enjoyment of these things
were sure to be of the same date with
our lives, yet how short a duration is
that compared with Eternity? make the
utmust allowance to these things, that
can be; yet we can but enjoy them
whilst we are in this world. When we
come into the world of spirits, it will
signifie nothing to us to have been rich
or great in this world. When we shall
stand before that highest Tribunal, it
will not avail us in the least to have
been Princes, and great Men, and Judges
on the Earth; the poorest Man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lived in this world, will then be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
equal terms with the bigest of us
all.</p>
            <p>For all mankind shall then stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a level, and those civil distinctions of
rich and poor, of base and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which seem now so considerable,
and make such a glaring difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men in this world, shall all then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56284:57"/>
be laid aside, and moral differences shall
only take place. All the distinctions
which will then be made, will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the good and the bad; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and the wicked; and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a good and bad Man, will
be really much greater than ever it
seemed to be, betwixt the highest and
meanest persons in this world.</p>
            <p>And if this be so, why should we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the enjoyments of sin at so high a
rate, which at the best are only conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
(and that only in the imagination
of vain Men) during our abode in this
world, but bear no price at all in that
Country where we must live for ever: Or
if they did, we cannot carry them along
with us. The guilt of them indeed will
follow us with a vengance; the injustice
and all the ill arts we have used for the
getting or keeping of them, especially, if
at once we have <hi>made Shipwreck of
Faith and a good Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we have changed our Religion, or
which is much worse, if continuing in
the profession of it, we have betrayed
it, and the interest of it, for the gaining
or securing of any of these things; we
shall find to our sorrow, that tho the
enjoyments of sin were but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56284:58"/>
the guilt of it will never leave us,
nor forsake us, but will stick close to us,
and make us miserable for ever. But
this belongs to the</p>
            <p>III. Thing I proposed to speak to, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The final issue, and consequence of
a sinful course, which is misery and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
many times in this world; but
most certainly in the next.</p>
            <p>1. In this world, the very best issue
and consequence of a sinful course, that
we can imagin, is Repentance: And
even this hath a great deal of sensible
pain and trouble in it; for it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times (especially after great sins,
and a long continuance in them,)
accompanied with much regret and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
with deep and piercing sorrow;
with dismal and despairing thoughts of
God's mercy; and with fearful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of his wrath and vengeance.
So that if this were the worst conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of sin (which indeed is the
best) no Man that considers and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates
things wisely, would purchase
the pleasure of any sin, at the price of
so much anguish and sorrow, as a true
and deep repentance will cost him; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
since a true repentance, does in
many cases oblige Men to the restitution
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56284:58"/>
of that which hath been gained by sin,
if it hath been got by the injury of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>And this consideration quite takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the pleasure and profit of an ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Estate. Better never to have had it,
than to be obliged to refund it. A wise
Man will forbear the most pleasant meats,
if he know before-hand that they will
make him deadly sick; and that he shall
never be at ease, till he have brought
them up again.</p>
            <p>No Man that believes the threatnings
of God, and the judgment of another
world, would ever sin, but that he
hopes to retrieve all again by repentance.
But it is the greatest folly in the world
to commit any sin upon this hope; for
that is to please ones self for the present,
in hopes to have more trouble afterwards
than the pleasure comes to. But especially,
no Man would be guilty of an act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and oppression, in hopes to repent
of it afterwards; because there can be no
repentance for such sins without restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and 'tis perfect madness for a Man
to run the hazard of his Soul, to get
an Estate, in hopes of restoring it again;
for so he must do that truly repents of
such a sin. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:56284:59"/>
2. In the other world, the final issue
and consequence of all the pleasures of
sin unrepented of, will certainly be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and sorrow. How quietly soever a
sinner may pass through this world, or
out of it, misery will certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
him in the next, unspeakable and
eternal misery, arising from an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the greatest loss, and a sense of
the sharpest pain; and those sadly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
by the remembrance of past
pleasure, and the despair of future
ease.</p>
            <p>From a sad apprehension and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
reflection upon his inestimable
loss. In the other world; the sinner shall
be eternally separated from God, who
is the fountain of happiness. This is the
first part of that miserable sentence which
shall be past upon the wicked; <hi>depart
from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sinners are not now sensible of the
joyes of Heaven, and the happiness of
that state, and therefore are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of estimating the greatness of such a
loss: But this stupidity and insensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sinners, continues only during
this present state, which affords Men
variety of objects and pleasures, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and entertain them: But when they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56284:59"/>
are once enter'd upon the other world,
they will then have nothing else to take
up their thoughts, but the sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
into which by their own wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and folly, they have plunged
themselves. They shall then, <hi>lift up their
eyes,</hi> and with the rich Man in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>at once see the happiness of others,
and feel their own misery and torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all. Besides the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of so great a loss, they shall be
sensible of the sorest and sharpest pains;
and how grievous those shall be, we
may conjecture by what the Scripture
says of them in general; That they are
the effects of a mighty displeasure, of
Anger and Omnipotence met together,
far greater than can be described by any
pains and sufferings which we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
withall in this world: <hi>For who
knows the power of Gods anger,</hi> and the
utmost of what Omnipotent Justice can
do to sinners? <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall
into the hands of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think this were misery
enough, and needed no frather aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but yet it hath two terrible ones;
from the remembrance of past pleasures,
and the despair of any future ease and
remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56284:60"/>
The remembrance of past pleasure
makes present sufferings more sharp and
sensible. For as nothing commends plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
more, and gives a quicker relish to
happiness, than precedent pain and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
(for perhaps there is not a greater
pleasure in the world, than in the suddain
ease which a Man finds after a sharp fit
of the Stone) so nothing enrageth affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
more, and sets a keener edg upon
misery, than to pass into great pain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out of a state of ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
This was the stinging aggravation
of the rich Man's torment, That <hi>in his
life time he had received his good things,
and had faired so deliciously every day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the greatest aggravation of all is,
the despair of any future ease and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
The duration of this misery, is
set forth to us in Scripture, by such
expressions as do signifie the longest and
most interminable duration. <hi>Depart ye
cursed, into everlasting fire,</hi> Matth. 25.
and Mark 9. 43. <hi>Where the worm dies not,
and the fire is not quenched.</hi> And in the
Revel. it is said, <hi>that the wicked shall be
tormented, day and night, for ever and
ever;</hi> without intermission, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
end. And this surely is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of misery, for a Man to lye under
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56284:60"/>
the greatest torments, and to be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of ever finding the least ease.</p>
            <p>Let us now compare things together:
on the one hand, the sufferings of good
Men, for a good Conscience, and the
reward that follows them; and on the
other hand, the enjoyments of sin, with
the mischief and misery that attends
them, and will certainly overtake them
in this world, or the next: and then
we shall easily discern which of these is
to be preferred in a wise Man's choice.</p>
            <p>And indeed the choice is so very plain,
that a Man must be strangely forsaken
of his reason, and blinded by sense, who
does not prefer that course of life, which
will probably make him happier in this
world, but most certainly in the next.</p>
            <p>There remains now only the <hi>Fourth</hi>
and <hi>last</hi> particular to be spoken to;
<hi>viz.</hi> Supposing this choice to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
to enquire whence it comes to
pass, that so many make a quite contrary
choice. How is it that the greatest part of
mankind are so widely mistaken, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the temporary enjoyments of sin, before
Conscience and Religion; especially, if
it be attended with great afflictions and
sufferings? And of this I shall give you
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56284:61"/>
as brief an account as I can, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Discourse.</p>
            <p>This wrong choice, generally proceeds
from one or both of these two causes;
from want of Faith; or from want of
consideration; or of both.</p>
            <p>1. One great reason why Men make
so imprudent a choice, is unbelief; either
the want of Faith, or the weakness of it.
Either Men do not believe the recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of another life, or they are not so
firmly persuaded of the reality of them. If
Men do not at all believe these things,
there is no foundation for Religion; for
<hi>he that cometh unto God</hi> (that is, he that
thinks of being religious) <hi>must believe
that God is, and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
reasons in the beginning of this
Chapter.</p>
            <p>But I hope, there are but few that
are, or can be Infidels, as to these great
and fundamental principles of Religion.
But it is to be feared, that the Faith of
a great many, is but weak and wavering;
their Faith is rather negative; they do
not disbelieve these things, but they are
not firmly persuaded of them; their
Faith is rather an opinion, than a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56284:61"/>
and well grounded persuasion; and
therefore no wonder; if it be not so
strong, and vigorous a principle of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and like the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Moses,</hi> and other worthies mentioned in
this Chapter. For where Faith is in its
full strength and vigour, it will have
proportionable effects upon the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and wills of Men: But where it is but
weak, it is of little or no efficacy. And
this is the true reason, why so many
forsake Religion, and cleave to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world; and when it comes to the
push, choose rather to sin, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
and will rather quit the truth, than
endure persecution for it.</p>
            <p>These are they, whom our Saviour
describes, <hi>who receive receive the word
with joy, and endure for a while; but when
tribulation and persecution ariseth because
of the word, presently they are offended:</hi>
not that they did not believe the Word;
but their Faith had taken no deep root,
and therefore it withered. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and wavering of Mens Faith, makes
them unstable and inconstant in their
course; because they are not of one
mind, but divided betwixt two interests,
that of this world, and the other; and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56284:62"/>
               <hi>the double minded man</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> tells
us) <hi>is unstable in all his ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is generally a true rule; so much
wavering as we see in the actions
and lives of Men, so much weakness
there is in their Faith; and therefore he
that would know what any Man firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believes, let him attend to his actions
more than to his professions.</p>
            <p>If any Man live so, as no Man that
heartily believes the Christian Religion
can live, it is not credible that such a
Man doth firmly believe the Christian
Religion. He says he does; but there is
a greater evidence in the case than words;
there is <hi>Testimonium rei,</hi> the Man's actions
are to the contrary, and they do best
declare the inward sense of the Man.
Did Men firmly believe, that <hi>there is
a God that governs the world, and that
he hath appointed a day, wherein he
will judge it in righteousnes;</hi> and <hi>that
all mankind shall shortly appear before him,
and give an account of themselves, and all
their actions to him; and that those who
have kept the Faith and a good Conscience,
and have lived soberly, and righteously,
and godly in this present world,</hi> shall
be unspeakably and eternally happy;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56284:62"/>
but the <hi>fearful and unbelieving,</hi> those
who out of fear or interest, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the Faith, or lived wicked lives,
<hi>shall have their portion in the lake, which
burns with fire and brimstone;</hi> I say,
were Men firmly persuaded of these
things, it is hardly credible that any
Man should make a wrong choice, and
forsake the ways of Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
upon any temptation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Faith, even in temporal matters, is a
mighty principle of action, and will make
Men to attempt and undergo strange and
difficult things. The Faith of the Gospel
ought to be much more operative and
powerful; because the Objects of Hope
and Fear, which it presents to us, are far
greater, and more considerable, than any
thing that this world can tempt or terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us withall.</p>
            <p>Would we but by Faith make present
to our minds, the invisible things of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world; the happiness of Heaven,
and the terrors of Hell, and were we as
verily persuaded of them, as if they were
in our view, how should we despise all
the pleasures and terrors of this world!
And with what ease should we resist and
repel all those temptations, which would
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56284:63"/>
seduce us from our duty, or draw us
into sin!</p>
            <p>A firm and unshaken belief of these
things, would effectually remove all those
mountains of difficulty and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which Men fancy to themselves in
the ways of Religion. <hi>To him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
all things are possible,</hi> and most
things would be easie.</p>
            <p>2. Another reason of this wrong choice,
is want of consideration; for this would
strengthen our Faith, and make it more
vigorous and powerful: And indeed a
Faith which is well rooted and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>should
doth suppose a wise and deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of things; and the want of this
is a great cause of the fatal miscarriage
of Men; that they do not sit down and
consider with themselves seriously, how
much Religion is their interest, and how
much it will cost them to be true to it,
and to persevere in it to the end.</p>
            <p>We suffer our selves to be governed
by sense, and to be transported with
present things; but do not consider our
future and lasting interest, and the whole
duration of an immortal Soul. And this is
the reason, why so many men are hurried
away by the present and sensible delights
of this world; because they will not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56284:63"/>
take time to think of what will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>For it is not to be imagined, but that
the Man who hath seriously considered
what sin is; the shortness of its pleasure,
and the eternity of its punishment; should
resolve to forsake sin, and to live a holy
and virtuous life.</p>
            <p>To conclude this whole Discourse. If
Men did but seriously believe the great
principles of Religion; the Being and
the Providence of God; the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of their Souls; the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and the dreadful punishments of
another world; they could not possibly
make so imprudent a choice, as we see
a great part of mankind to do; they
could not be induced to forsake God and
Religion for any temporal interest and
advantage; to renounce the favour of
Heaven, and all their hopes of happiness
in another world, for any thing that this
world can afford, nay not for the whole
world, if it were offered to them. For as
our Saviour reasons in this very case of
forsaking our Religion for any temporal
interest, or consideration; <hi>what is a man
profited if he gain the whole world, and
lose his own Soul? or what shall a man
give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:56284:64"/>
               <hi>When ever any of us are tempted in
this kind; let that solemn declaration
of our Saviour and our Judge be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
in our minds;</hi> he that confesseth me
before men, him will I confess also before my
Father which is in heaven; but whosever
shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall
the son of man be ashamed, when he shall
come in the glory of his Father, with his
holy Angels.</p>
            <p>And we have great cause to thank
God, to see so many in this day of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and hour of temptation, to adhere
with so much resolution and constancy
to their Holy Religion, and to prefer
<hi>the keeping of Faith, and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
to all earthly considerations and
advantages.</p>
            <p>And this very thing, that so many hold
their Religion so fast, and are so loth
to part with it, gives great hopes that
they intend to make good use of it, and
to frame their lives according to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rules and precepts of it; which alone
can give us peace whilst we live, and
comfort when we come to die; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death secure to us the possession of
a happiness large as our wishes, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as our Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:56284:64"/>
To which, God of his Infinite Goodness
bring us all, for his mercy's sake, in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: To whom, with the Father, and
the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and Glory,

            <q>Let us hold fast the profession of our Faith

hath promised.</q>
            <p>THE main Scope and design of this
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Christianity, to continue sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in the profession of that Holy and
Excellent Religion which they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced;
and not to be removed from it,
either by the subtile insinuations of their
Brethren the <hi>Jews,</hi> who pretended that
they were in possession of the true ancient
Religion, and the only true Church of
God upon Earth; or by the terrour of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56284:66"/>
Heathen persecution which was so hot
against them at that time. And to this end
the Author of this Epistle doth by great
variety of arguments demonstrate the
excellency of the Christian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>Jewish</hi> dispensation; and shews
at large, that in all those respects upon
which the <hi>Jews</hi> valued themselves and
their Religion (as namely upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Lawgiver, their High-Priests
and their Sacrifices) the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion had every way the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of them.</p>
            <p>And having made this clear, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with an earnest exhortation to
them to continue stedfast in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this excellent Religion, which
was revealed to them by the Son of
God, the true propitiatory Sacrifice, and
the great High-Priest of their profession,
and into which they had solemnly been
initiated and admitted by Baptism; <hi>vers.</hi>
19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Having therefore, brethren,
boldness to enter into the holiest, by the blood
of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he
hath consecrated for us through the vail,
that is to say, his flesh; and having an
high-priest over the house of God: Let us
draw near with a true heart, in full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of faith,</hi> (that is, let us sincerly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56284:66"/>
serve God with a firm persuasion of
the Truth and Excellency of this
Holy Religion, into the Profession
whereof we were solemnly admitted
by Baptism; for that is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the meaning of the following
words; <hi>having our hearts sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from an evil Conscience, and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

with which our Bodies are washt in

and <hi>the purging of our
Consciences from dead Works, to
serve the living God.</hi> From all which
he concludes, <hi>Let us hold fast the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our faith without wavering:</hi>
This refers to that solemn Profession
of Faith, which was made by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56284:67"/>
Apostle upon the same Consideration
exhorts Christians <hi>to retain,</hi> or <hi>hold

            <p>In the words thus explained, there
are <hi>Two</hi> things which I shall distinctly

            <p>I. The Exhortation; <hi>Let us hold fast
the profession of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering:</hi>
And</p>
            <p>II. The Argument or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
used to en<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ce it; <hi>He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that promised.</hi> so I begin with the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56284:67"/>
I. The Exhortation, to be constant
and steady in the Profession of the
Christian Religion: <hi>Let us hold fast the
profession of our faith without wavering.</hi> In
the handling of this, and that we may
the better understand the true meaning
of this Exhortation here in the Text,
I shall do these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew Negatively, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Constancy and Steadiness in
the Profession of the true Religion,
does not consist. And here I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
one or two things which are
thought by some, to be inconsistent
with Constancy and Steadfastness in
Religion.</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew Positively, what
is implied in a Constant and Steady
Profession of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew Negatively, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Steadfastness in the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the true Religion does not imply.
And there are <hi>two</hi> things which are
thought by some to be imply'd, <hi>in
holding fast the profession of our faith
without wavering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That Men should not take the
liberty to examine their Religion, and
enquire into the Grounds and Reasons
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:56284:68"/>
2. That men should obstinately refuse
to hear any Reasons that can be brought
against the true Religion as they think,
which they have once entertained.</p>
            <p>1. That Men should not take the
liberty to examine their Religion,
and to enquire into the Grounds and
Reasons of it. This I think is so
far from being forbidden in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
that on the contrary, I
doubt not to make it appear, that
a free and impartial Enquiry into the
Grounds and Reasons of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and a thorough Tryal and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of them, is one of the
best Means to confirm and establish
us in the Profession of it: I mean,
that all Persons that are capable of
it, should do it. and that they will
find great benefit and advantage by
it. For I do not think that this is
a Duty equally and indifferently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon all; nor indeed fit and
proper for all Persons; because all
are not equally capable of doing it.
There are two sorts of Persons that
are in a great measure incapable of
doing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:56284:68"/>
1. Children.</p>
            <p>2. Such grown Persons as are of a
very mean and low capacity, and
improvement of Understanding.</p>
            <p>Children are not fit to examine,
but only to learn and believe what is
taught them by their Parents and
Teachers: They are fit to have the
fear of God, and the Principles of the
true Religion instilled into them;
but they are by no means fit to
discern between a true and false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to chuse for themselves,
and to make a change of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
as hath of late been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them in a Nation not far
from us, and by publick Edict
declared, that Children at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
Years Old, are fit to chuse and
to change their Religion: Which is
the first Law I ever heard of, that
allows Children of that Age to do
any act for themselves, that is of
Consequence and Importance to them,
for the remaining part of their Lives,
and which they shall stand obliged
to perform and make good. They
are indeed Baptized, according to
the custome and usage of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56284:69"/>
Church, in their Infancy; but
they do not enter into this Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
themselves; but their Sureties
undertake for them, that when they
come to Age, they shall take this
Promise upon themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and make it good. But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they can do no Act for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in their own Name, at
that Age, which can be obligatory:
They can neither make any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
that shall be valid, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
any Debt, nor oblige themselves
by any Promise, nor chuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Guardian, nor do any Act
that may bring them under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
when they shall come
at Age. And can we think them of
discretion sufficient at that time, to
do a thing of the greatest Moment
and Consequence of all other; and
which will concern them to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
namely, to chuse their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
There is indeed one Part of
one Religion (which we all know)
which Children at <hi>Seven</hi> Years of
Age are fit (I do not say to judge
of, but) to be as fond of, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
to as good purpose, as those of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56284:69"/>
riper Years; and that is, to worship
Images, to tell their Beads, to
say their Prayers, and to be present
at the Service of God in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue; and this they are
more likely to chuse at that Age,
than those who are of riper and more
improv'd Understandings; and if they
do not chuse it at that time, it is
ten to one, they will not chuse it
afterwards. I shall say no more of
this, but that it is a very extraordinary
Law, and such as perhaps was never
thought of before, from the beginning
of the World. Thus much for Children.</p>
            <p>As for grown Persons, who are
of a very low and mean capacity
of Understanding, and either by
reason of the weakness of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
or other Disadvantages which
they lye under, are in little or no
probability of improving themselves;
These are always to be considered
as in the condition of Children, and
Learners, and therefore must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
in things which are not
plain and obvious to the meanest
Capacities, trust and rely upon the
Judgment of others. And it is really
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56284:70"/>
much wiser and safer for them so to
do, than to depend upon their own
Judgments, and to lean to their own
Understandings; and such Persons, if
they be modest and humble, and
pray earnestly to God for his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Direction, and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to practise what they know, and
to live up to the best Light and
Knowledge which they have, shall
not miscarry, meerly for want
of those farther degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which they had no Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nor Opportunity to attain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their Ignorance is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and God will require no more
of them than he hath given them,
and will not call them to account
for the improvement of those Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
which he never committed to
them. And if they be led into
any dangerous Error, by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or ill conduct of those, under
whose Care and Instruction the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God permitted them to be
placed, God will not impute it to them
as a Fault: Because in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in which they were, they took
the best and wisest course that they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56284:70"/>
could, to come to the knowledge of
the Truth, by being willing to learn
what they could of those, whom
they took to be wiser than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>But for such Persons, who by the
maturity of their Age, and by the
natural strength and clearness of
their Understandings, or by the due
exercise and improvement of them,
are capable of enquiring into, and
understanding the Grounds of their
Religion, and discerning the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Truth and Error (I
do not mean in unnecessary Points and
matters of deepest Learning and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
but in matters necessary
to Salvation) it is certainly very
reasonable, that such Persons should
examine their Religion, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Reasons and Grounds
of it.</p>
            <p>And this must either be granted
to be reasonable; or else every man
must continue in that Religion in
which he happens to be fixt by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or for any other Reason to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56284:71"/>
pitch upon, when he comes to Years
and makes his free Choice. For if this
be a good Principle, that no Man is
to examine his Religion, but take
it as it is, and to believe it, and
rest satisfied with it: Then every Man
is to remain in the Religion which
he first lights upon, whether by Choice
or the Chance of his Education. For
he ought not to change but upon
Reason; and Reason he can have
none, unless he be allowed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his Religion and to compare it
with others, that by the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he may discern which is best,
and ought in reason to be preferred
in his Choice. For to him that will
not, or is not permitted to search
into the Grounds of any Religion,
all Religions are alike; as all things
are of the same Colour, to him that
is always kept in the dark, or if he
happens to come into the Light, dares
not open his Eyes, and make use
of them to discern the different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of things.</p>
            <p>But this is evidently and at first
sight unreasonable; because at this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56284:71"/>
rate, every Man that hath once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
an Errour, and a false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
must forever continue in it:
For if he be not allowed to examine
it, he can never have Reason to
change; and to make a change with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reason, is certainly unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and mere Vanity and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</p>
            <p>And yet for ought I can see, this
is the Principle which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> doth with great Zeal and
Earnestness inculcate upon their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
discouraging all Doubts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
about their Religion, as
Temptations of the Devil; and all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their Religion, as an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and dangerous step towards
Heresie. For what else can they mean,
by taking the Scriptures out of the
hands of the People, and locking
them up from them in an unknown
Tongue; by requiring them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to submit their Judgments,
and to resign them up to that which
they are pleased to call the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, and Implicitly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56284:72"/>
as She believes, tho they
know not what that is? This is in
Truth, to believe as their Priest tells
them; for that is all the teaching
Part of the Church, and all the Rule
of Faith that the common People are
acquainted with.</p>
            <p>And it is not sufficient to say in
this matter; that when Men are in
the Truth, and of the right Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in the Bosom of the true
Church, they ought to rest satisfied,
and to examine and enquire no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For this is manifestly unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and that upon these <hi>Three</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>1. Because this is a plain and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
begging of the thing in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that which every Church,
and every Religion doth almost with
equal Confidence pretend to; That
Theirs is the only right Religion, and
the only true Church: And these
Pretences are all alike reasonable to
him that never examined the Grounds
of any of them, nor hath compar'd
them together. And therefore it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56284:72"/>
is the vainest thing in the World,
for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to pretend,
that all Religions in the World ought
to be examined, but Theirs; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Theirs, and none else, is the true
Religion. For this which they say
so confidently of it, That it is the true
Religion, no Man can know till he
have examined it, and searched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Grounds of it, and hath
considered the Objections which are
against it: So that it is fond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
to say that, Their Religion is
not to be examined by the people
that profess it; but that all other
Religions ought to be examined,
or rather, because they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from That which they presume
to be the only true Religion, ought
to be condemned at all adventures,
without any farther enquiry. This
I say is fond Partiality; because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Religion and every Church may
(for ought that appears to any man
that is not permitted to examine things
impartially) say the same for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and with as much Reason;
and if so, then either every Religion
ought to permit it self to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56284:73"/>
or else no man ought to
examine his own Religion whatever
it be; and consequently <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
ought all to continue as they are,
and none of them to change; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot reasonably change,
without examining both that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which they leave, and that
which they embrace instead of it.</p>
            <p>2. Admitting this Pretence were
true; that They are the true Church,
and have the true Religion; This is so
far from being a Reason why they
should not permit it to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that on the contrary, it is one
of the best Reasons in the World
why they should allow it to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and why they may safely
suffer it to be so. They should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to be tryed; that men may
upon good Reason be satisfied, that
it is the true Religion: And they
may safely suffer it to be done; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
if They be sure that the Grounds
of their Religion be firm and good,
I am sure, they will be never the
worse for being examined and look'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56284:73"/>
into. But I appeal to every Man's
Reason; whether it be not an ill
Sign, that they are not so sure that
the Grounds of their Religion are
solid and firm, and such as will abide
the Tryal; that they are so very loth
to have them searcht into and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined?
This cannot but tempt a wise
Man to suspect, that their Church is
not founded upon a Rock; and that
they themselves know something that is
amiss in their Religion, which makes
them so loth to have it try'd, and
brought to the Touch.</p>
            <p>3. It is certain among all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that the Doctrine preached by
the Apostles was the true Faith of
Christ; and yet they never forbad
the Christians to examine whether it
were so or not: Nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they frequently exhort them
to try and examine their Religion,
and whether that Doctrine which
they had delivered to them was
the true Faith of Christ. So St.
<hi>Paul; 2 Corinth. 13. 5. Examine
your selves, whether ye be in the faith;
prove your own selves.</hi> And again,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56284:74"/>
1 <hi>Thes. 5. 21. Prove all things,
hold fast that which is good</hi> intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us, that in order to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fast the Profession of our Faith,
it is requisite to prove and try it.
And so likewise St. <hi>John</hi>'s Ep. 1. 4. 1.
<hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit; but
try the Spirits whether, they are of God;
because many false Prophets are gone
out into the world.</hi> And he gives a
very notable mark, whereby we may
know the Spirit of Truth, and the
Spirit of Error. The Spirit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
carries on a worldly Interest
and Design; and the Doctrines of it
tend to Secular Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
vers. 5. <hi>They are of the world;
therefore speak they of the world,
and the world heareth them.</hi> Acts 17.
11. St. <hi>Luke</hi> commends it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of a more noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Spirit in the <hi>Beroeans;</hi> that they
examined the Doctrine which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
preacht, <hi>whether it were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Scriptures;</hi> and this without
Disparagement to their Infallibility;
<hi>These, saith he, were more noble, than
those of Thessalonica, in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the word with all readiness of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56284:74"/>
mind, and searched the Scriptures
daily, whether those things were so.</hi>
They were ready to receive the Word;
but not blindly, and with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith; but using due Care to
examine the Doctrines which they
were taught, and to see if they were
agreeable to that Divine Revelation
of the Holy Scriptures, which they
had before received. It seems they
were not willing to admit and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Contradictions in their Faith.
And we desire no more of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the people to <hi>search the
Scriptures daily,</hi> and to <hi>examine
whether</hi> their Doctrines be <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to them.</hi> We would be glad
to hear the Pope and a General
Council commend to the People
the searching of the Scriptures;
and to try their Definitions of Faith
and Decrees of Worship, by that
Rule, to see whether what they have
defined and decreed to be believed and
practised, be agreeable to it; their
Worship of Images; their solemn
Invocation of Angels, and of
the Blessed Virgin, and the Saints
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56284:75"/>
departed; the Sacrament under one
kind only; the publick Prayers
and Service of God in an unknown
Tongue; the frequent Repetition of
the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christs
Body and Blood in the Mass. Had
the <hi>Beroeans</hi> been at the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> and pleaded their Right <hi>to
search the Scriptures, whether these
things were so;</hi> I doubt they would
have been thought very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and impertinent, and would
not have been praised by the Pope
and Council for their pains, as they
are by St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see then, upon the whole
matter, that it is a very groundless
and suspicious Pretence of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that because They are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
in the right, and Theirs is
the true Religion, therefore their
people must not be permitted to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it. The Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
was undoubtedly the true Faith
of Christ; and yet they not only
permitted the people to examine it,
but exhorted and encouraged them
so to do, and commended them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56284:75"/>
for it: And any Man that hath the
Spirit of a Man, must abhor to
submit to this Slavery, not to be
allowed to examine his Religion, and
to enquire freely into the Grounds and
Reasons of it; and would break with
any Church in the World upon this
single Point; and would tell them
plainly, if your Religion be too good
to be Examined, I doubt it is too
bad to be Believed.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that the allowing
of this Liberty is the way to make
people perpetually doubting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled:
I do utterly deny this, and
do on the contrary with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
affirm, that it is apt to have
the contrary effect; There being in
reason no better way to establish
any man in the belief of any thing,
than to let him see that there are
very good Grounds and Reasons
for what he believes; which no man
can ever see, that is not permitted to
examine whether there be such Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or not. So that besides the
Reasonablness of the thing, it is of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56284:76"/>
great benefit and advantage to us.
And that upon these Accounts.</p>
            <p>1. To arm us against Seducers. He
that hath examined his Religion, and
tryed the Grounds of it, is most
able to maintain them, and make
them good against all Assaults that
may be made upon us, to move us
from our Stedfastness: Whereas he
that hath not examined, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
does not understand the
Reasons of his Religion, is liable
to be <hi>tossed to and fro, and to be
carried about with every Wind of
Doctrine, by the slight of Men, and
the cunning Craftiness of those that
lie in wait to deceive.</hi> For when
he is attempted; he will either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Religion or not: If he
undertake the Defence of it, before
he hath examined the Grounds of
it; he makes himself an easie Prey
to every crafty man that will set
upon him; he exposeth at once
himself to Danger, and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Disgrace: If he decline the
defence of it; he must be forced to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56284:76"/>
take Sanctuary in that Ignorant and
Obstinate Principle, that because he
is of an Infallible Church, and sure
that he is in the right, therefore he
never did nor will examine whether
he be so or not. But how is he, or
can he be sure, that he is in the right;
if he have no other Reason for it, but
his Confidence, and his being wiser
in his own conceit, than Seven men
that can render a Reason? It is a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing in a wise man, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to give a good Reason of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Actions and parts of his Life,
to be able to say nothing for his
Religion, which concerns him more
than all the rest.</p>
            <p>2. To examine and understand
the Grounds of our Religion, will
be a good means (by the assistance
of Gods Grace) to keep us constant
to it, even under the fiery Tryal.
When it comes to this, that a man
must suffer for his Religion, he had
need to be well established in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of it; which no man can so well
be, as he that in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
understands the Grounds and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56284:77"/>
Reasons of his Belief. A man would
be well assured of the Truth and
Goodness of that, for which he
would lay down hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s Life; otherwise
<hi>he dies as a Fool dies,</hi> he knows not
for what. A man would be loth to set
such a Seal to a Blank, I mean, to that
which he hath no sufficient Ground
and Reason to believe to be true;
which, whether he hath or not, no
man that hath not examined the
Grounds of his Religion can be well
assured of. This St. <hi>Peter</hi> prescribes,
as the best Preparative for suffering
for Righteousness sake, the <hi>1st.</hi> Ep. of
<hi>Peter, 3. 14, 15. But if ye suffer for
righteousness sake, happy are ye; And
be not afraid of their terror, neither
be troubled: But sanctifie the Lord
God in your hearts;</hi> (that is, make
him the great Object of your Dread
and Trust) <hi>and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
you a reason of the hope that is in
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The holding fast the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Faith without wavering,</hi>
doth not imply, that Men should
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56284:77"/>
obstinately refuse to hear any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against that Religion which they
have embraced, and think to be the
true Religion. As Men should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
before they chuse; so after
they have chosen, they should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be better informed, if better
Reason can be offered. No Man ought
to think himself so infallible, as to
be priviledged from hearing Reason,
and from having his Doctrines and
Dictates tryed by that Test.</p>
            <p>Our Blessed Saviour himself, the
most Infallible Person that ever was
in the World, and who <hi>declared the
Truth which he had heard of God,</hi>
yet He offered himself and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to this Tryal. <hi>John</hi> 8. 46.
<hi>Which of you convinceth me of
sin?</hi> that is, of Falsehood and Error?
<hi>And if I speak the truth, why do ye not
believe me?</hi> He was sure he spake
the Truth; and yet for all that, if
they could convince him of Error
and Mistake, he was ready to hear
any Reason they could bring to that
purpose. Though a Man be never
so sure that he is in the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56284:78"/>
and never so resolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
constant and stedfast in it;
yet Reason is always to be heard,
when it is fairly offered. And as
we ought always to be <hi>ready to give
an Answer to those who ask a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Hope</hi> and Faith <hi>that is in
us;</hi> so ought we likewise to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to hear the Reasons which others
do fairly offer against our Opinion
and Persuasion in Religion, and to
debate the matter with them; that
if we be in the right, and they in
the wrong, we may rectifie their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
and <hi>instruct them in meekness,
if God peradventure may give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the acknowledgement of the
truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not only to examine our
Religion, before we peremptorily fix
upon it; but after we are, as we think
upon the best Reason, establisht and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in it. Tho we ought not to doubt
and waver in our Religion, upon every
slight and trifling Objection that can
be brought against it; yet we ought
always to have an Ear open to hear
Reason, and consider any thing of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56284:78"/>
Weight and Moment that can be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to us about it. For it is a great
Disparagement to Truth, and argues
a distrust of the Goodness of our Cause
and Religion, to be afraid to hear
what can be said against it: As if
Truth were so weak, that in every
Conflict it were in danger to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
and run down, and go by the
worst; and as if the Reasons that
could be brought against it, were
too hard for it, and not to be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
by those Forces which Truth has
on its side.</p>
            <p>We have that honest Confidence of
the Goodness of our Cause and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that we do not fear what can
be said against it: And therefore we
do not forbid our people to examine
the Objections of our Adversaries, and
to read the best Books they can write
against it. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
are so <hi>wise in their Generation,</hi> that
they will not permit those of their
Communion to hear or read what can
be said against them: Nay, they will
not permit the people the use of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56284:79"/>
Holy Scriptures, which they, with us,
acknowledge to be at least an Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Part of the Rule of Faith. They
tell their people, that after they are
once of their Church and Religion,
they ought not to hear any Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; and though they be never
so strong, they ought not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any doubt concerning it; because
all doubting is a Temptation of the
Devil, and a Mortal Sin. But surely
that Church is not to be heard, which
will not hear Reason; nor that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to be much admired, which will
not allow those that have once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
it, to hear it ever after deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and examined. This is a very
suspicious Business, and argues,
that either they have not Truth on
their side; or that Truth is a weak,
and pitiful, and sneaking Thing, and
not able to make its party good against
Error.</p>
            <p>I should now have proceeded in the
<hi>Second</hi> place, to shew <hi>Positively</hi>
what is implied in <hi>holding fast the
Profession of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering;</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56284:79"/>
and then to have considered the
Argument and Encouragement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>because he is faithful that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</hi>
But I shall proceed no farther at

            <p>I Have already made entrance into
these Words, which I told you do
contain in them,</p>
            <p>I. An Exhortation, <hi>to hold fast

or of Recompence and Reward

            <p>I have begun to handle the <hi>First</hi> part
of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apoostles Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to Christians to be constant and
steady in their Religion: <hi>Let us
hold fast the profession of our Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering.</hi> The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> which
we render, <hi>without wavering,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
inflexible and unmovable, not
apt to waver and to be <hi>shaken with
every Wind of</hi> contrary <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
nor by the Blasts and Storms of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
And that we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comprehend the full and true
meaning of this Exhortation, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to do these <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. To shew <hi>Negatively,</hi> wherein
this Constancy and Steadiness in the
Profession of the true Religion doth
not consist. And</p>
            <p>2. To shew <hi>Positively,</hi> what is
implied and intended here by the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56284:81"/>
Apostle, in <hi>holding fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To shew <hi>Negatively,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Constancy and the Steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Profession of the true
Religion doth not consist. This
I spake to the last Day; and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at large, that there are <hi>Two</hi> things
which are not contained and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this Exhortation.</p>
            <p>1. That Men should not have
the Liberty to examine their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to enquire into the Grounds
and Reasons of it. Such I mean
as are capable of this examination
and enquiry; which some, I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are not; as Children, who
while they are in that state, are
only fit to learn and believe what
is taught them by their Parents
and Teachers: And likewise such
grown Persons, as either by the
natural Weakness of their Faculties,
or by some great Disadvantage of
Education, are of a very low and mean
Capacity and Improvement of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
These are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56284:82"/>
as in the condition of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Learners; and therefore
must of necessity trust and rely
upon the Judgment of others.</p>
            <p>2. This <hi>holding fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi>
does not imply; that when
Men upon examination and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are settled, as they think and
verily believe in the true Religion,
they should obstinately refuse to
hear any Reason that can be offer'd
againg them. Both these Principles
I shew'd to be unreasonable, and
Arguments of a bad Cause and
Religion.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to explain
the meaning of this Exhortation, <hi>To
hold fast the profession of our Faith
without wavering,</hi> by shewing in
the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> place, what it is that is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the constant and steady Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
namely, That when upon
due search and examination, we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56284:82"/>
are fully satisfied, that it is the true
Religion which we have embraced,
or as St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresses it, <hi>1st</hi>
Epistle, 5. 12. <hi>That this is the
true Grace of God, wherein we stand;</hi>
that then we should adhere sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
to it, and <hi>hold it fast,</hi> and not
suffer it to be wrested from us, nor
our selves to be moved from it,
by any Pretences, or Insinuations, or
Temptations whatsoever. For there
is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Confidence and Stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of an Ignorant Man, who hath
never considered Things, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the Grounds of them; and
the Assurance and Settlement of one,
who hath been well instructed in
his Religion, and hath taken pains
to search and examine to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
the Grounds and Reasons
of what he holds, and professeth
to believe. The first is meer Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Obstinacy. A Man hath
entertained, and drank in such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Religion by Education,
or hath taken them up by Chance;
but he hath no Reason for them; and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56284:83"/>
yet however he came by them,
he is resolved to hold them fast, and
not to part with them. The other
is the Resolution and Constancy of
a Wise Man. He hath embraced his
Religion upon good Grounds, and
he sees no Reason to alter it; and
therefore is resolved to stick to it,
and to <hi>hold fast the Profession of it</hi>
stedfastly to the end. And to this
purpose there are many Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Cautions scattered up and
down the Writings of the holy
Apostles; as that we should be <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and unmoveable, established in
the Truth, rooted and grounded in the
Faith, and that we should hold fast
that which is good, and not suffer our
selves to be carried to and fro with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
wind of Doctrine, through the
slight of Men, and the cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
of those that lie in wait to
deceive; that we should not be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him that hath called us unto
the grace of Christ, unto another Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
that we should stand fast in one
Spirit and one Mind, striving together
for the Faith of the Gospel, and be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56284:83"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n nothing terrifled by our Adversaries;
and that,</hi> if occasion be, <hi>we should
contend earnestly for the Faith which
was once delivered unto the Saints;</hi>
and here in the Text, <hi>That we should
hold fast the profession of our Faith
without wavering.</hi> For the explaining
of this, I shall do <hi>two</hi> Things:</p>
            <p>1. Consider <hi>what</hi> it is that we are
to <hi>hold fast;</hi> namely, <hi>the profession of
our Faith;</hi> And,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>How</hi> we are to <hi>hold it fast,</hi>
or what is implied in <hi>holding fast the
profession of our Faith, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>What</hi> it is that we are <hi>to hold
fast;</hi> namely, <hi>the profession of our
Faith;</hi> i. e. of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> or
<hi>Religion:</hi> For, I told you before,
that this <hi>Profession</hi> or <hi>Confession of
our Faith or Hope</hi> (as the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
signifies) is an Allusion to <hi>that
Profession of Faith</hi> which was made
by all those who were admitted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Christian Church by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56284:84"/>
of which the Apostle makes
mention immediately before the <hi>Text,</hi>
when he says, <hi>Let us draw near in
full assurance of Faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and
our bodies washed with pure Water:</hi>
And then it follows, <hi>Let us hold fast
the profession of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.
The Profession of Faith</hi> which
we made in our Baptisms, and which
by the Ancient Fathers is call'd <hi>the
Rule of Faith,</hi> and which is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in that which we call <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed,</hi> and which is called by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. <hi>the Form of
Doctrine which was delivered to them;
i. e.</hi> to all Christians; and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.
13. <hi>the Form of sound Words; Hold
fast,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Form of sound Words,
which thou hast heard of me, in Faith
and Love which is in Christ Jesus;</hi>
and by St. <hi>Jude, The Faith which was
once delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is the first and ancient
Faith of the Christian Church, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
which we are here exhorted
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56284:84"/>
to <hi>hold fast;</hi> the necessary and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles of the Christian
Faith; and by consequence all those
Truths which have a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with those Articles, and are
implied in them, and by plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
are to be deduced from
them. It is not the doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Traditions of Men, nor the
partial Dictates and Doctrines of
any Church, since the Primitive
Times, which are not contained in
the Holy Scriptures and the Ancient
Creeds of the Christian Church, but
have been since declared and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon the Christian World, though
with never so confident a pretence of
Antiquity in the Doctrines, and of
Infallibility in the Proposers of them:
These are no part of <hi>that Faith</hi> which
we are either to <hi>profess</hi> or <hi>to hold
fast;</hi> because we have no reason to
admit the Pretences, by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
those Doctrines or Practices are
imposed; being able to make it
good, and having effectually done
it, that those Doctrines are not of
Primitive Antiquity; and that the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56284:85"/>
Church which proposeth them, hath
no more claim to Infallibility, than
all other Parts of the Christian Church,
which since the Apostles time is none
at all.</p>
            <p>In a word; No other Doctrines
which are not sufficiently revealed in
Scripture, either in express Terms, or
by plain and necessary Consequence;
nor any Rites of Worship, nor Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Practice, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in Scripture, are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
any part of <hi>that Faith</hi> in Re-Religion,
<hi>the Profession</hi> whereof the
Apostle here Commands all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to <hi>hold fast without wavering;</hi>
much less any Doctrines or Practices,
which are repugnant to the Word of
God, and to the Faith and Practice
of the first Ages of Christianity; of
which kind I shall have occasion in
my following Discourse to instance
in several Particulars. In the mean
time I shall only observe, That <hi>that
Faith</hi> and Religion which we <hi>profess,</hi>
and which by God's Grace we have ever
<hi>held fast,</hi> is <hi>that</hi> which hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56284:85"/>
by all Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in all Ages, to have been <hi>the
ancient Catholick and Apostolick Faith,</hi>
and cannot (as to any part or
tittle of it) be denied to be so,
even by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her
self.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the</p>
            <p>II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Thing which I proposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider;
namely, <hi>how</hi> we are to <hi>hold fast
the profession of our Faith,</hi> or what is
implied by the Apostle in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
<hi>To hold fast the profession of
our Faith, without wavering.</hi> And I
think these following Particulars may
very well be supposed to be implied
in it.</p>
            <p>1. That we should <hi>hold fast the
Profession of our Faith,</hi> against the
Confidence of Men, without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
or Reason to support their
Confidence.</p>
            <p>2. And much more against the
Confidence of Men, contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56284:86"/>
and Reason, and the common
Sense of Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. Against all the Temptations and
Terrours of the World.</p>
            <p>4. Against all vain Promises of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into a safer Condition, and
groundless Hopes of getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon easier terms in another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>5. Against all the cunning Arts and
Insinuations of busie and disputing
Men, whose Design it is to unhinge
Men from their Religion, and to gain
Proselytes to their own Party and
Faction. I shall go over these with
as much Clearness and Brevity as I
can.</p>
            <p>1. We should <hi>hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith,</hi> against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Men, without Scripture or
Reason to support that Confidence.
All Religion is either Natural or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted.
The Rule of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is the common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56284:86"/>
The Rule of Instituted Religion
is divine Revelation, or the Word of
God; which all Christians before the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did agree to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Holy Scriptures. So that
nothing can pretend to be Religion,
but what can be proved to be so,
One or both of those ways; either by
Scripture, or by Reason, or by both.
And how confident soever Men may
be of Opinions destitute of this Proof;
any Man that understands the Grounds
of Religion, will without any more
ado reject them, for want of this
proof; and notwithstanding any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authority or Infallibility of
the Church that imposeth them, will
have no more Consideration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of them, than of the confident
Dictates and Assertions of any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast
whatsoever; because there is
no reason to have regard to any Man's
Confidence, if the Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which he brings, bear no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it. We see in Experience that
Confidence is generally ill grounded,
and is a kind of Passion in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and is commonly made use
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56284:87"/>
of, like Fury and Force, to supply
for the weakness and want of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If a Man can prove what he
says by good Argument; there is no
need of Confidence to back and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it. We may at any time trust a
plain and substantial Reason, and leave
it to make its own way, and to bear
out its self. But if the man's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Arguments be not good; his
Confidence adds nothing of real Force
to them, in the Opinion of Wise men,
and tends only to its own Confusion.
Arguments are like Powder, which
will carry and do execution accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its true strength; and all the
rest is but noise. And generally none
are so much to be suspected of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or a Design to deceive, as those
that pretend most confidently to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
and Infallibility: As we see
in all sorts of Enthusiasts, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Inspiration, although we have
nothing but their own word for it;
for they work no Miracles. And all
pretence to Inspiration and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
without Miracle, whether it be
in particular Persons, or in whole
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56284:87"/>
Churches, is Enthusiastical; <hi>i. e.</hi> a
Pretence to Inspiration without any
Proof of it.</p>
            <p>And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not
moved by the Boasting and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the false Apostles; because
they gave no Proof and Evidence of
their Divine Inspiration and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as he had done; for which he
appeals to the Sense of Men, Whether
he had not wrought great Miracles;
which the false Apostles had not
done, though they had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to give out themselves to be
Apostles as well as he; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
11, 12. <hi>I am</hi> (says he) <hi>become a fool
in glorying, ye have compelled me. And
truly the signs of an Apostle were wrought
among you in all patience, in signs, and
wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 2. Christ there commends the
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because <hi>she had
tried them, which said they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
but were not; and had found
them liars.</hi> And as we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every one that <hi>says he is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi>
so neither every one that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56284:88"/>
to be a <hi>Successor of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and to be endued with the same
Spirit of Infallibility that they were:
For these also, when they are <hi>tried</hi>
whether they be <hi>the Successors of the
Apostles</hi> or not, may <hi>be found Liars,</hi>
And therefore St. <hi>John</hi> cautions Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<hi>not to believe every spirit,</hi> (that
is, every one that pretends to divine
Inspiration and the Spirit of God,)
<hi>but to try the Spirits, whether they be of
God; because many false Prophets are
gone out into the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1.
And therefore the Confidence of Men
in this kind ought not to move us,
when their Pretence to Infallibility is
destitute of the proper Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it; which is a Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
and when their Doctrines
and Practices have neither the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Reason or Scripture on
their side.</p>
            <p>For instance; <hi>That the Church of</hi>
Rome <hi>is the Mother and Mistress of
all Churches;</hi> which is one of the
new Articles of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IVth's
Creed; and yet there is not one syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56284:88"/>
in Scripture tending to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And in Reason it cannot be, that
any but that which was the First Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church should be the Mother
of all Churches; and <hi>that</hi> the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> certainly was not, and the
Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> undoubtedly
was.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>that the Bishop of</hi> Rome,
<hi>as Successor of St.</hi> Peter <hi>there, is
the Supreme and Vniversal Pastor of
Christ's Church by Divine appointment,</hi>
as he assumes to himself; and <hi>that
it is necessary to Salvation, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
humane Creature to be subject to
the Bishop of</hi> Rome, as is declared
in their Canon-Law by a Constitution
of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIIIth, which
Constitution is confirmed in the last
<hi>Lateran</hi> Council; of all which there
is not the least mention in Scripture,
nor any divine Appointment to that
purpose to be found there. And it is
against Reason, that all the World
should be obliged to trudge to <hi>Rome</hi>
for the Decision of Causes and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
which in many and the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56284:89"/>
most weighty Matters are reserved to
the Decision of that See, and can be
determin'd no-where else. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Reason likewise it is to found this
universal Supremacy in his being Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and to fix it in
the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than at
<hi>Antioch;</hi> when it is certain, and
granted by themselves, that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was first Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and
out of all question that he was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Antioch;</hi> but not so, that he
was Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for <hi>the Deliverance of Souls out
of Purgatory by the Prayers and Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Living.</hi> The whole Thing
is groundless, and not agreeable to
the constant Suppositions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
concerning a future State.
Nor is there any Reason for it,
besides that which is not fit to be
given, the Wealth and Profit which
it brings in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56284:89"/>
               <hi>The Invocation and Worship of
the Blessed Virgin, and of all the
Saints departed,</hi> is destitute of all
Scripture-warrant or Example, and
confessed by themselves not to have
been owned or practised in the <hi>Three
first</hi> Ages of the Church, because it
looked too like the Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
which deserves to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
by those, who pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their whole Religion from Christ
and his Apostles by a continued and
uninterrupted Succession. And this
practice is likewise destitute of all
colour of Reason; unless we be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they hear our Prayers in
all places; which we cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they be present in all places,
which they themselves do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
or that God doth some way
or other reveal and make known to
them the Prayers which are made
to them, which we cannot possibly
be assured of, but by some Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God to that purpose; which
we no-where find, nor doth the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretend to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:56284:90"/>
But I proceed to the</p>
            <p>2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Thing; namely, That we
should much more <hi>hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith</hi> and Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Confidence of Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture, and Reason, and
the common Sense of Mankind. For
these are the chief grounds of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
which we can have for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any thing; and if these be
clearly on our side, we ought not
to be much moved by the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Men, concerning any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
or Practices of Religion,
which are plainly contrary to these.
If in Points wherein we have
this advantage on our side, we
do not <hi>hold fast the Profession</hi> of
our Religion; our Error and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are capable of no excuse.
And this advantage we plainly
have in several Points and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
betwixt us and the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:56284:90"/>
As in <hi>the Worship of Images;</hi> which
is as expresly and clearly forbidden in
the Second Commandment, and that
without any Distinction, as any other
thing is forbidden in the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And that it is so forbidden in
this Commandment, and that this
Commandment is still in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians, was the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Sense of the ancient Christian
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayers and the Service of God
in an unknown Tongue</hi> are directly
contrary to the very Nature and End
of religious Worship, which ought
to be a Reasonable Service; which it
cannot be, if it be not directed by
our Understandings, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with our Hearts and Affections.
But if it be performed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue, our Understanding
can have no part in it; and if we do
not understand it, it cannot move
our Affections. And this likewise is
plainly contrary to Scripture; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to a large Discourse of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56284:91"/>
almost throughout a whole <hi>Chapter,</hi>
where he purp sely sets himself to
shew the Unprofitableness and gross
Absurdity of Praying or Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any other Part of Religious
Worship, in an unknown Tongue.
If any part of <hi>Our</hi> Religion had been
half so clearly condemned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as this is, (which yet is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and general Practice of the
Church of <hi>Rome) we must have lain
down in our shame, and confusion would
have covered us;</hi> and we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have rejected the Authority of
the Bible, or have renounced that
Point of our Religion, what-ever it
had been: Though it had been dear
to us as <hi>our right Hand, and our right
Eye;</hi> we must upon such plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Scripture against it, <hi>have
cut it off, and plucked it out, and cast
it from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like may be said of <hi>Locking
up the Scriptures from the people in
an unknown Tongue;</hi> contrary to
the Command of the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to the great End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56284:91"/>
of Almighty God in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Publishing of them; and
contrary to the perpetual Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Counsels of all the Ancient
Fathers of the Christian Church for
a great many Ages, not one except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They are hardly more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
and copious, and earnest in
any Argument; than in perswading
People of all Ranks and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the constant and careful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Holy Scriptures. And
contrary to the Common Reason and
Sense of Mankind. For what should
Men be perswaded to be acquainted
withal; if not with That which is the
great Instrument of our Salvation?
That Book which was written on
purpose to reveal and convey to
Men the Knowledge of God, and of
his Will, and their Duty? What
should Men be allowed to know; if
not That which is the best and most
effectual Means, to direct and bring
them to Heaven, or turn them from
Sin, and to preserve them from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Misery? When our Saviour
would represent the best and most
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56284:92"/>
effectual Means of bringing Men to
Happiness, and saving them from the
Eternal Torments of Hell, in the
Parable of the Rich Man and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
He brings in <hi>Abraham,</hi> giving
the best Advice he could to the Rich
Man who was in Hell, concerning
his Brethren that were upon Earth,
how they might prevent their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into that place of Torment;</hi>
And he directs them to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
as the best and most effectual
Means to that purpose: <hi>They have</hi>
(says he) <hi>Moses and the Prophets:
Let them hear them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if in the Church of God
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the same Course
had been taken, that is now in
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Rich
Man might, and in all Reason
ought to have replyed, <hi>Nay, Father</hi>
Abraham; <hi>But they have not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and the Prophets, nor are they
permitted to Read them in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that they can understand; And
therefore this Advice is of no Vse
to them:</hi> And then he might with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56284:92"/>
Reason have press'd him, as he did,
that <hi>one might be sent to them from
the Dead, to Testifie unto them.</hi>
But it appears, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
positive and peremptory in this
Advice; and that he prefers the
Knowledge of the Scriptures, to any
other Way and Means, that could be
thought of, and that if this had
not its Effect to perswade Men to
Repentance, and to preserve them
from Hell, he did not know any thing
else, that was so likely to do it: For
he concludes, <hi>If they hear not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and the Prophets; neither will they
be perswaded the One rose from the
Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the Conclusion of
the Parable. Which plainly shews,
what was the main Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of our Saviour in it; namely,
to recommend to us the Use of the
Holy Scriptures, as the best and most
effectual Means, which the Wisdom
of God hath provided for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:56284:93"/>
And now any Man would be apt
to think, that the declared Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Saviour in the case,
should go a great way, even with
the most Infallible Church in the
World. However, this we must say,
that it is in truth a very hard case,
to which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath
reduced Men; that it will neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them Salvation out of their
Church, nor the best and most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Means of Salvation, when they
are in it. I might say much more
upon this Head; but this I hope may
be sufficient.</p>
            <p>The next Instance shall be in the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> which
is contrary to the Scriptures; which
after Consecration so frequently call,
the Elements <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> and
which, without Reason or Necessity,
puts an absurd and impossible Sense
upon those words of our Saviour,
<hi>This is my Body;</hi> which do no more
prove <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> than those
words, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56284:93"/>
do prove that the material Cup which
was used in the Sacrament, was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
changed into the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
And no more, than those
Texts which affirm God to have
Eyes, and Ears, and Hands, do prove
that he really hath so. But besides
the Contrariety of this Doctrine to
Scripture, nothing can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Reason. It is so big
with Contradictions, and so surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Impossibilities, that it would
be Endless to reckon them up.
And besides all this, it plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
the clear and constant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Four</hi> of our <hi>Five</hi> Senses;
which whoever contradicts, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the Foundation of all Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>And then the <hi>Communion in one
kind</hi> is plainly contrary to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Institution of the Sacrament
in both kinds; as they themselves
acknowledge. And therefore the
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> being sensible
of this, was forced to Decree it
with an express <hi>Non obstante</hi> to the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56284:94"/>
Institution of Christ, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Apostles and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church. And their Doctrine
of <hi>Concomitancy</hi> (as if the Blood
were in the Flesh, and together with
it) will not help the matter: Because
in the Sacrament Christ's Body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
as broken, and pierced,
and exhausted, and drain'd of its
Blood; and his Blood is represented
as shed and poured out; so that one
Kind can by no means contain and
exhibit both.</p>
            <p>The next Instance is, the <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of Christ's Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Mass,</hi> so often as That is
celebrated: Against all Reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Sacrifice of Christ, once
offered upon the Cross, was a full
and perfect Propitiation for the Sins
of the whole World; and therefore
ought not, because it needs not, to be
again repeated for that End, in any
manner whatsoever. And it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary to the main Scope of a
great part of this <hi>Epistle</hi> to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> which shews the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56284:94"/>
of the Gospel above the Law
in this respect, That the Expiatory
Sacrifice of the Gospel was offered
<hi>once for all;</hi> whereas the Sacrifices
of the Law were perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 27. Speaking of
Christ; <hi>who needs not daily, as those
High-priests, to offer up Sacrifices;
first for his own Sins, and then for the
Peoples: for this he did once, when
he offered up himself.</hi> Chap. 9. 26.
<hi>But once in the End of the World hath
he appeared, to take away Sin by the
Sacrifice of himself: And as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for all Men once to dye; so
Christ was once offered to bear the Sins
of many.</hi> And Chap. 10. 10. <hi>By the
which Will we are sanctified, through
the Offering of the Body of Jesus
Christ once for all:</hi> And Verse the
12. <hi>But this Man, after he had
offered one Sacrifice for Sins, for
ever sat down on the right hand of
God.</hi> And Verse the 14. <hi>For by
one Offering he hath perfected for
ever them that are sanctified.</hi> There
cannot be plainer Texts for any
thing in the Bible, than that this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56284:95"/>
Propitiatory Sacrifice was never to
be repeated.</p>
            <p>And whereas they say, that <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Mass is an unbloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi>
This, instead of bringing
them off, doth but intangle the
Matter more. For if Blood be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Sacrifice of the Mass,
how is it an unbloody Sacrifice?
What can be more bloody than
Blood? And if Blood be not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
how is it Propitiatory? Since
the Apostle lays it down for a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule, That <hi>without shedding of
Blood, there is no Remission</hi> of Sins:
<hi>i. e.</hi> There can be no Propitiation
for the Sins of the Living or the
Dead, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
affirms there is.</p>
            <p>I might have added one or two
Instances more; and then should
have proceeded to shew, in the
<hi>Third</hi> place, That we are to <hi>hold
fast the Profession of our Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering,</hi> against all the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Terrors of the World;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56284:95"/>
which is more especially and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
here intended by the Apostle
in this Exhortation.</p>
            <p>But I shall proceed no farther at
present.</p>

            </head>
            <q>Let us hold fast the profession of our
Faith without wavering; for he is
faithful that promised.</q>
            <p>IN these words, I have told you,
are contained</p>
            <p>I. An Exhortation, <hi>to hold fast the
profession of our faith, or hope, without
wavering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. An Argument or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereto; <hi>because he is faithful that
promised.</hi> I am yet upon the <hi>first</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:56284:97"/>
of these; the Exhortation to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to be Constant and Steady in
the Profession of their Religion; <hi>Let
us hold fast the profession of our Faith
without wavering.</hi> And that we
might the better comprehend the
true and full meaning of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
I shewed,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> what is not meant
and intended by it. And I mentioned
these <hi>two</hi> Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The Apostle doth not hereby
intend, that those who are capable
of enquiring into, and examining the
Grounds of their Religion, should
not have the Liberty to do it.
Nor,</p>
            <p>2. That when upon due Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Examination, Men are settled,
as they think and verily believe, in
the true Faith and Religion, they
should obstinately refuse to hear any
Reason that can be offered against
their present Persuasion. Both these
I shewed to be unreasonable, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56284:97"/>
Arguments of a bad Cause and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And therefore neither of
them can be intended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in this Exhortation.</p>
            <p>2. I proceeded <hi>Positively</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the meaning of this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
And to this purpose I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</p>
            <p>1. To consider <hi>what</hi> it is, that we
are to <hi>hold fast,</hi> viz. <hi>the Confession
or Profession of our Faith.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Christian Faith, of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Christian makes <hi>Profession</hi> in his
Baptism: For of That the Apostle
here speaks, as appears by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;
not the doubtful and uncertain
Traditions of Men, nor the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dictates and Doctrines of any
Church, not contained in the Holy
Scriptures, imposed upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church; tho with never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
a pretence of the Antiquity of
the Doctrines proposed, or of the
Infallibility of the Proposers of them.
And then I proceeded in the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:56284:98"/>
2. Place, to shew <hi>how</hi> we are <hi>to
hold fast the profession of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering.</hi> And I mentioned these
following Particulars, as probably
implied in the Apostles Exhortation.</p>
            <p>1. That we should <hi>hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith,</hi> against the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Men, without Scripture or
Reason to support their Confidence.</p>
            <p>2. And much more against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Men, against Scripture and
Reason, and the common Sense of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. Against all the Temptations and
Terrours of the World.</p>
            <p>4. Against all vain Promises of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into a safer condition, and
groundless Hopes of getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon easier Terms, in another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>5. Against all the cunning Arts
and Insinuations of busiy and disputing
Men, whose design it is to unhinge Men
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56284:98"/>
from their Religion, and to gain
Proselytes to their Party and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>1. We are <hi>to hold fast the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Faith,</hi> against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Men, without Scripture
or Reason to support their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And of this I gave several
Instances. As in the Pretence of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Infallibility,</hi>
without any Proof or Evidence of
it, either by Scripture or Miracles:
I mean such Miracles, as are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
attested. For as for their
Legends, since the wisest among
themselves give no credit to them,
I hope, they do not expect that We
should believe them, or be moved
by them. And then their Pretence
that <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mistress of all Churches;</hi>
which is now made an Article of
their <hi>Creed.</hi> And that <hi>the Bishop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>as Successor of Saint</hi> Peter
<hi>there, is by Divine Appointment
the Supream and Vniversal Pastor
of Christs Church.</hi> And that <hi>it is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56284:99"/>
necessary to Salvation, for every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Creature to be subject to him.</hi>
And lastly, <hi>their Invocation and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Blessed Virgin, and Saints
departed;</hi> without any Warrant or
Example of any such thing, either
in Scripture, or in the practice of
the first Ages of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and without sufficient Ground
to believe that they hear the Prayers
which are put up to them.</p>
            <p>2. Much more are we <hi>to hold
fast the Profession of our Faith,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Confidence of Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Scripture and Reason and
the common Sense of Mankind.
And here I instanced in <hi>the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images; the Locking up of
the Scriptures from the People, and
celebrating the publick Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God in an unknown Tongue;</hi>
in their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
their <hi>Communion in one kind;</hi> and
their <hi>daily repetition, in the Sacrifice
of the Mass, of the Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Christ;</hi> which was offered
<hi>once for all,</hi> and is of Eternal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56284:99"/>
and Efficacy, and therefore ought
not, because it needs not, like <hi>Jewish</hi>
Sacrifices under the Law<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>To these Instances, which I have
already spoken to, I shall add <hi>one</hi>
or <hi>two</hi> more; as namely, That <hi>to
the due Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
an Intention in the Minister
at least to do what the Church does,</hi>
is requisite. This is expresly defined,
and under an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all
that shall say otherwise, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent, Sess.</hi> the <hi>Seventh, Can.
11th;</hi> which is to make the Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Virtue of the Sacraments, to
depend upon the Intention of the
Priest or Minister. So that if in the
Administration of Baptism, he do not
intend to Baptize the Party he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Baptize, then it is no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
and consequently the Person
Baptized is not made a Member of
Christ's Church; nor is any Grace
or special Benefit conferred upon
him; nor is he a Christian. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Sacrament of the Lord's
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56284:100"/>
Supper, If the Priest do not intend
to Consecrate the Host, then is it no
Sacrament; and they that receive
it, receive no benefit by it; and
(which according to their Opinion is
a dreadful Consequence) by the
words of Consecration, there is no
change made of the Elements into
the Body and Blood of Christ; and
consequently they that give Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Sacrament in such cases,
Worship Bread and Wine, for God;
which is Idolatry. And so likewise
in their Sacrament of Penance, though
the Priest pronounce the words of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;
yet if he do not intend to
absolve the Penitent; though he be
never so truly penitent, and God on
his part is ready to forgive him; yet
if the Priest do not intend to do so,
there is nothing done, and the Man
is still in his Sin. So likewise in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
(which is another of their
Sacraments) if the Bishop do not
intend to Ordain the Man; he is no
Priest, and all that he does as a Priest
afterwards, either in Administration
of Baptism, or the Lords Supper,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56284:100"/>
or the Absolution of Penitents, all
is vain and of no effect. Nay, in
Marriage, (which they will needs
have to be a Sacrament too) if the
Intention of the Priest be wanting;
there is nothing done, the Contract
is null'd, and they that are so Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
do really live in Adultery;
though they do not know it, nor
have any suspicion of it.</p>
            <p>Now this is contrary to Scripture
and the whole Tenure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
which promiseth the benefit and
efficacy of the Sacraments, to all those
that perform the Conditions of the
Covenant which are required on
their parts, and declares forgiveness
of Sins to those who confess them to
God, and truly repent of them.</p>
            <p>And there is not the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given in the Bible, that the
Virtue and Efficacy of the Sacraments
does depend upon the Intention of
him that administers them; or that
the Forgiveness of sins is suspended
upon the Intention or Absolution of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56284:101"/>
the Priest; but only upon the sincere
Resolution of the Penitent. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nothing can be more absurd, and
contrary to Reason, than that when
Men have performed all the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the Gospel requires;
yet they should notwithstanding
this be deprived of all the Blessings
and Benefits which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and intends to confer upon
them; because the Priest hath not
the same Intention. So that when
a Man hath done all he can to
<hi>work out his own Salvation,</hi> he
shall be never the nearer; only for
want of That which is wholly out
of his Power; the right Intention of
the Priest.</p>
            <p>Besides, that after all their Boasts
of the safe Condition of Men in
Their Church, and the most certain
and infallible means of Salvation to
be had in it; this one Principle (that
the Intention of the Priest is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Validity and Virtue of
the Sacraments) puts the Salvation
of Men upon the greatest Hazard
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56284:101"/>
and Uncertainty; and such as it is
impossible for any Man either to
discover or prevent, unless he had
some certain way to know the
Heart and Intention of the Priest.
For upon these terms, who can
know whether any Man be a Priest,
and really ordained; or not? Nay,
whether he be a Christian, and have
been truly baptized; or not? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
whether any of his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
be valid, and we have any
Benefit and Advantage by them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all this depends upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that, which we neither do
nor can know.</p>
            <p>So that when a Man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
done all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of any Man, to make him
capable of Salvation; yet without
any Fault of his, the want of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in an idle-minded Man may
frustrate all: And though the Man have
been baptized, and do truly believe
the Gospel, and hath sincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of his sins, and lived a most
Holy Life; yet all this may signifie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56284:102"/>
nothing, and after all he may be
no Christian; because his Baptism
was invalid: And all the Promises
of God to the means of Salvation
which his Goodness and Wisdom
hath prescribed, may be of no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy;
if the Priest do not intend in
the Administration of the Sacraments
to do that which God and the Church
intend.</p>
            <p>Now if this be true; there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no Church in the World, in
which the Salvation of Men runs
so many hazards; and yet all this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and uncertainty has its rise, from
a Scholastical Point, which is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
contrary to all the Notions of
Mankind concerning the Goodness of
God, and to the clear Reason of
the thing, and to the constant
Tenor of the Gospel; and which was
never asserted by any of the ancient
Fathers; much less defined by any
Council before that of <hi>Trent:</hi> So that it
is a Doctrine new and needless, and in
the necessary consequences of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and absurd to the utmost
degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:56284:102"/>
The last Instance I shall mention,
is <hi>their Rule of Faith.</hi> The Rule
of Faith universally received and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the Christian Church
in all Ages, before the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> was the Word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Canonical Books of
Holy Scripture; which were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Church called <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
because they were the Rule of
Faith and Manners, of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
to be believed, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be practised by all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
But when the Errours and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church were
grown to the highth, and the Pope and
his Council at <hi>Trent</hi> were resolved not
to Retrench and Reform them, they
saw it necessary to enlarge and leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
out their Rule; because the
ancient Rule of the Holy Scriptures
would by no means reach several
of the Doctrines and Practices of
that Church, which they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to maintain and make good by
one means or other: As namely,
the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> and of <hi>the Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56284:103"/>
and the practice of <hi>the
Worship of Saints, and Images;</hi> of <hi>the
Scriptures, and the Service of God in an
unknown Tongue;</hi> of <hi>Indulgences; and
the Communion in one kind:</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other superstitious Practices in use
among them.</p>
            <p>Now to enlarge their Rule to the
best advantage for the Justification
of these Doctrines and Practices, they
took these <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>1. They have added to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical</hi>
Books of the Old Testament
which were received by the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Church (to whom <hi>were committed
the Oracles of God</hi>) I say to these
they have added several <hi>Apocryphal</hi>
Books, not warranted by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
because they were written
after Prophecy and Divine Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ceased in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church;
<hi>Malachi</hi> being the last of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
according to the general Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that Church. But because
the addition of these Books did not
make a Rule of Faith and Practice
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56284:103"/>
large enough for their purpose; in
imitation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time
of the greatest Confusion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy
of that Church, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place to their Books of
Scripture, which they call <hi>the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Word,</hi> an <hi>unwritten Word</hi>
which they call <hi>Oral Tradition</hi>
from Christ and his Apostles; which
they declare to be of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with the Holy Scriptures
themselves; and that it ought to
be received with the same Pious Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Affection: Of which
Traditions, They being the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Judges, they may extend
them to what they please, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them in their own Breasts,
they may declare whatever they
have a mind to, to have been a
constant and universal Tradition of
their Church; tho it is evident to
common Sense, that nothing can
be more uncertain, and more liable
to Alteration and Mistake, than
Tradition, at the distance of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56284:104"/>
Ages, brought down by word
of mouth, without writing, and
passing through so many hands. He
that can think these to be of equal
Certainty and Authority with what
is delivered by Writing, and
brought down by Books, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
the defence of a strange
<hi>Paradox.</hi> viz. That <hi>general Rumour
and Report of Things said and done</hi> 1500
<hi>Years ago, is of equal Authority and
Credit with a Record, and a written
History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which proceeding of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> concerning the Rule of
Faith and Practice; it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they had no mind to
bring their Faith to the Ancient
Rule, the Holy Scriptures. That
they knew could not be done;
and therefore they were resolved
to fit their Rule to their Faith.
And this Foundation being laid in
their first Decree, all the rest would
afterwards go on very smoothly. For
do but give Men the making of
their Rule, and they can make
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56284:104"/>
good any thing by it. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> having
thus fixt and fitted a Rule to their
own purpose; in the Conclusion
of that Decree, they give the
World fair warning, upon what
Grounds, and in what Ways they
intend to proceed in their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Decrees of Practice, and Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Faith. <hi>Omnes itaque intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
quo ordine &amp; via ipsa Synodus
post jactum fidei confessionis fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
sit progressura,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be it known
therefore to all men, in what Order and
Way the Synod, after having laid this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Confession of Faith, will
proceed; and what Testimonies and
Proofs she chiefly intends to make use
of, for the Confirmation of Doctrines,
and Reformation of Manners in the
Church.</hi> And no doubt all Men do see
very plainly, to what purpose this
Foundation is laid of so large a Rule of
Faith. And this being admitted,
how easie is it for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and prove whatever Doctrines
and Practices they have a mind to
establish?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:56284:105"/>
But if this be a new, and another
Foundation, than That which the Great
Author and Founder of our Religion,
hath laid and built his Church upon,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>the Foundation of the Prophets and
Apostles;</hi> it is no matter what they
build upon it. And if they go about
to prove any thing by the new
parts of this Rule; by the <hi>Apocryphal</hi>
Books which they have added to the
ancient <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures,
brought down to us by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Tradition of the Christian
Church; and by their pretended
unwritten Traditions: we do with
Reason reject this kind of Proof,
and desire them first to prove their
<hi>Rule,</hi> before they pretend to prove
any thing by it: For we protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Rule, as never declared
and owned by the Christian Church,
nor proceeded upon by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers of the Church, nor by
any Council whatsoever, before the
Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In vain then doth the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> vaunt it self of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56284:105"/>
of their Faith and Religion;
when the very Foundation and
Rule of it is but of Yesterday;
a new thing, never before known
or heard of in the Christian World:
Whereas the Foundation and Rule
of <hi>Our</hi> Religion is the Word of
God, contained in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
to which Christians in all
Ages have appealed, as the <hi>only
Rule</hi> of Faith and Life.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>3. Thing I proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> that we
are <hi>to hold fast the profession of our
faith without wavering,</hi> against all
the Temptations and Terrours of the
World. And this seems more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
and principally to be here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostle in this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I shall <hi>first</hi> speak of the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World. And they are
chiefly these <hi>Two;</hi> the Temptation
of <hi>Fashion and Example:</hi> And of
<hi>worldly Interest and Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:56284:106"/>
1. Of <hi>Fashion and Example.</hi> This
in Truth and Reality is no strong
Argument; and yet in Experience and
Effect it is often found to be very
powerful. It is frequently seen, that
this hath many times too great an
Influence upon weak and foolish
Minds. Men are apt to be carried
down with the Stream, and to <hi>follow
a Multitude</hi> in that which is <hi>evil.</hi>
But more especially Men are prone
to be swayed by great Examples;
and to bend themselves to such an
Obsequiousness to their Superiours and
Betters, that in compliance with
them, they are ready not only to
change their Affection to Persons and
Things, as They do; but even their
Judgment also; and that in the
greatest and weightest Matters, even
in Matters of Religion, and the
great concernments of another World.
But this surely is an Argument of
a poor and mean Spirit, and of a
weak Understanding, which leans
upon the Judgment of another, and
is in truth the lowest degree of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56284:106"/>
that a reasonable Creature
can stoop to; and even beneath
That of a Slave, who in the
midst of his Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
doth still retain the Freedom
of his Mind and Judgment.</p>
            <p>But I need not to urge this upon
considerate Persons, who know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how to value their Duty and
Obligation to God, than to be
tempted to do any thing contrary
thereto, meerly in compliance with
<hi>Fashion and Example.</hi> There are
some Things in Religion so very
plain, that a wise and good Man
would stand alone in the Belief
and Practice of them, and not be
moved in the least by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Example of the whole World.
It was a brave Resolution of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua;</hi>
though all Men should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to other Gods, yet he would
not do it, <hi>Joshua 24. 15. If it seem
evil unto you to serve the Lord; chuse
you this day whom you will serve:
But as for me and my House, we will
serve the Lord.</hi> It was well resolv'd
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56284:107"/>
of <hi>Peter,</hi> if he had not been too
confident of his own Strength,
when he said to our Saviour,
<hi>Though all Men forsake thee, yet will
not I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another sort of Temptation,
and which is commonly more Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
than <hi>Example,</hi> is <hi>worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Advantage.</hi> This is a
mighty Bait to a great Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and apt to work very strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Necessities of some,
and upon the Covetousness and
Ambition of others. Some Men
are tempted by Necessity, which
many times makes them do ugly
and reproachful Things, and like
<hi>Esau, for a Morsel of Meat to sell
their Birth-right,</hi> and Blessing. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness
tempts others to be of
that Religion which gives them the
prospect of the greatest Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Advantage, either for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
or securing of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.
When they find that <hi>they
cannot serve God and Mammon;
they will forsake the one, and cleave
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56284:107"/>
to the other.</hi> This was one of the
great Temptations to many in the
Primitive Times, and a frequent
Cause of Apostacy from the Faith;
an eager Desire of Riches, and too
great a Value for them; as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
observes, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 9, 10. But they
that will be Rich, fall into Temptation
and a Snare, and into many foolish
and hurtful Lusts, which drown Men
in Destruction and Perdition. For
the Love of Money is the Root of all
Evil; which while some have coveted
after, they have erred,</hi> or been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>from the Faith, and pierced
themselves through with many Sorrows.</hi>
This was the Temptation which
drew off <hi>Demas</hi> from his Religion;
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.
<hi>Demas hath forsaken me, having lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this present World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ambition, is likewise a great
Temptation to proud and aspiring
Minds, and makes many Men false
to their Religion, when they find
it a hinderance to their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and they are easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56284:108"/>
that That is the best Religion,
which is attended with the greatest
worldly Advantages, and will raise
them to the highest Dignity. The
Devil understood very well the
Force of this Temptation, when he
set upon our Saviour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reserv'd it for the last Assault.
<hi>He shewed him all the Kingdoms of
the Earth, and the Glory of them;
and said to him, All this will I give
thee, if thou wilt fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
me.</hi> And when he saw this
would not prevail, he gave him
over in despair, and left him. But
though this be a very dazling
Temptation; yet there are Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of that Weight to be
set over-against it, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Religion, and the infinite
Concernment of it to our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls, as is sufficient <hi>to quench
this fiery Dart of the Devil,</hi> and to
put all the Temptations of this
World out of Countenance, and
to render all the Riches and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, in comparison of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Happiness and Misery of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56284:108"/>
other World <hi>but as the very small Dust
upon the Balance.</hi> What Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this World can stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Argument of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
if it be seriously weighed
and considered; <hi>What is a Man
profited; if he gain the whole World,
and lose his own Soul? or what shall
a Man give in exchange for his
Soul?</hi> If we would consider Things
impartially, and weigh them in a
just and equal Balance; the Things
which concern our Bodies, and
this present Life, are of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
in comparison of the
great and vast Concernments of
our immortal Souls, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
or miserable Condition of our
Bodies and Souls to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And Religion is a Matter of this
vast Concernment; and therefore
not to be bargained away and
parted with by us for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Things this World can offer.
There is no greater Sign of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Spirit, than to put a high Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56284:109"/>
upon Things of little Worth;
and no greater Mark of Folly, than
to make an unequal Bargain, to
part with Things of greatest Price
for a slender and trifling Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
As if a Man of great
Fortune and Estate, should sell the
Inheritance of it for a Picture;
which when he hath it, will not
perhaps yield so much as will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him for one Year. The Folly
is so much the greater, in Things
of infinitely greater Value; as for
a Man to quit God and Religion,
to sell the Truth and his Soul, and
to part with his Everlasting Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
for a convenient Service,
for a good Customer, and some
present Advantage in his Trade
and Profession, or indeed for any
Condition which the foolish Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of this World cal's a <hi>high
Place,</hi> or a <hi>great Preferment.</hi> The
Things which these Men part with
upon these cheap Terms, God, and
his Truth, and Religion, are to
those who understand themselves,
and the just Value of their Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56284:109"/>
Souls, Things of inestimable
Worth, and not to be parted with
by a considerate Man, for any Price
that this World can bid. And those
who are to be bought out of their
Religion, upon such low Terms,
and so easily parted from it, 'tis
much to be feared that they
have little or no Religion to <hi>hold
fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As we are to <hi>hold fast the
Profession of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi>
against the Temptations and
Allurements of this World; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
against the Terrors of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear</hi> is a Passion of great force; and,
if Men be not very resolute and
constant, will be apt to stagger
them, and <hi>to move them from their
stedfastness.</hi> And therefore when
the Case of Suffering and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for the Truth happens, we
had need <hi>to hold fast the Profession
of our Faith.</hi> Our Saviour in the
Parable of the Sower tells us, that
<hi>there were</hi> many <hi>that heard the Word,
and with joy received it: but when Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56284:110"/>
and Tribulation arose because
of the Word, presently they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though, blessed be God,
this be not now our Case; yet
there was a Time when it was the
general Case of Christians, in the
first beginning of Christianity, and
for several Ages after, though with
some Intermission and Intervals of
Ease. It was then a general Rule,
and the common Expectation of
Christians, That <hi>through many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
they must enter into the
Kingdom of God;</hi> and that <hi>if any
Man will live Godly in Christ Jesus,
he must suffer Persecution.</hi> And in
several Ages since those Primitive
Times, the sincere Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
have, in divers places, been
exposed to most grievous Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Persecutions for the
Truth. And even at this day, in
several Places, the faithful Servants
of God are exercised with the
sharpest and sorest Tryals that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
were ever heard of in any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56284:110"/>
Age; and for the sake of God, and
the constant Profession of his true
Religion, are <hi>tormented and killed
all the day long, and are accounted
as Sheep for the slaughter.</hi> It is Their
hard Lot to be called to these
cruel and bitter Sufferings; and
Our happy Opportunity to be call'd
upon for their Relief; Those of
them, I mean, that have escaped
that terrible Storm and Tempest,
and have taken Refuge and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
here among us, and out of
His Majesty's great Humanity and
Goodness are by his Publick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
recommended to the Charity
of the whole Nation, by the Name
of <hi>Distressed Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us consider how much easier
Our Lot and Our Duty is, than
Theirs; as much as it is easier to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
the Sufferings, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Distresses of Others, than to
be such Sufferers, and in such Distress
Our Selves. Let us make Their Case
our Own; and then we our selves
will be the best Judges, how it is
fit for us to demean our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56284:111"/>
them, and to what degree
we ought to extend our Charity
and Compassion to them. Let us
put on their Case and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
and suppose that We
were the Sufferers, and had fled
to Them for Refuge: the same
Pity and Commiseration, the same
tender Regard and Consideration
of our sad Case, the same liberal
and effectual Relief that we should
desire and expect, and be glad to
have shewn and afforded to our
selves; let us give to them; and
then I am sure they will want no
fitting Comfort and Support from
us.</p>
            <p>We enjoy (blessed be the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to us) great Peace
and Plenty, and Freedom from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Suffering: And surely
one of the best Means, to have
these Blessings continued to us,
and our <hi>Tranquility prolonged,</hi> is,
to consider and relieve those who
want the Blessings which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
and the readiest way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56284:111"/>
God to deprive us of these
Blessings, is, to <hi>shut up the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of our Compassion from</hi> our
Distressed <hi>Brethren.</hi> God can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
change the Scene, and make
our Sufferings, if not in the same
kind, yet in one kind or other
equal to theirs; and <hi>then we shall
remember the Afflictions of Joseph,</hi>
and say as his Brethren did, when
they fell into Trouble, <hi>We are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
guilty concerning our Brother, in
that we saw the anguish of his Soul
when he besought us, and we would
not hear; therefore is this Distress
come upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God alone knows what Storms
the Devil may yet raise in the
World, before the End of it:
And therefore it concerns all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in all Times and Places, who
have taken upon them the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Christ's Religion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
well before-hand, and to
calculate the Dangers and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
it may expose them to, and
to arm our selves with Resolution
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56284:112"/>
and Patience against the fiercest
Assaults of Temptation; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Shortness of all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Afflictions and Sufferings, in
comparison of the Eternal and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Reward of them; and the
Lightness of them too, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the endless and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Torments of another World;
to which every Man exposeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who forsakes God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
his Truth, and wounds
his Conscience, to avoid Temporal
Sufferings.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Fear</hi> in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
especially if it be of Death and
extream Suffering, be a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for several Actions; because
it may, <hi>Cadere in constantem virum,</hi>
happen to a resolute Man: Yet
in this case, of Renouncing our
Religion (unless it be very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and surprizing, out of which
a Man recovers himself when he
comes to himself (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did)
or the Suffering be so extream, as
to put a Man besides himself for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56284:112"/>
the time, so as to make him say
or do any thing;) I say in this
case of Renouncing God and his
Truth, God will not admit <hi>Fear</hi>
for a just excuse of our Apostacy;
which, if it be unrepented of, (and
the Scripture speaks of Repentance
in that case as very difficult) will
be our Ruin. And the Reason is;
because God has given us such fair
Warning of it, that we may be
prepared for it, in the Resolution
of our Minds: And we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Religion upon these Terms, with
a professed Expectation of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and a firm Purpose to lay
down our Lives for the Truth, if
God shall call us to it. <hi>If any
Man will be my Disciple,</hi> says our
Lord, <hi>let him deny himself, and take
up his Cross and follow me:</hi> And
again, <hi>He that loveth Life it self
more than me, is not worthy of me:
And if any Man be ashamed of me,
and of my Words, in this unfaithful
Generation, of him will I be ashamed
before my Father and the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:56284:113"/>
And therefore to master and
subdue this <hi>Fear,</hi> our Saviour hath
propounded great Objects of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to us, and a Danger infinitely
more to be dreaded, which every
Man runs himself wilfully upon,
who shall quit the Profession of
his Religion, to avoid Temporal
Sufferings; <hi>Luke 12. 4, 5. Fear not
them that can kill the Body, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that have nothing that they can
do: But I will tell you whom you
shall fear. Fear him, who after he
hath killed, can destroy both Body
and Soul in Hell: Yea, I say unto
you, Fear him.</hi> And to this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Hazard every Man exposeth
himself, who, for the Fear of Men,
ventures thus to offend God. These
are the <hi>Fearful and Vnbelievers</hi>
spoken of by St. <hi>John, Who shall
have their Portion in the Lake which
burneth with Fire and Brimstone,
which is the second Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see how we are to
<hi>hold fast the Profession of our Faith
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56284:113"/>
without wavering,</hi> against all Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Terrors of this World.
I should now have proceeded to
the next Particular; namely, that
we are to <hi>hold fast the Profession of
our Faith,</hi> against all vain Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of being put into a safer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and groundless Hopes of
getting to Heaven upon easier
Terms, in some other Church and
Religion.</p>
            <p>But this I shall not now enter
upon.</p>

SERMON
ON
<bibl>HEB. X. 23.</bibl>
            </head>
            <q>Let us hold fast the Profession of our
Faith without wavering, for he is
faithful that promised.</q>
            <p>IN these Words, I have told you, are
contained these <hi>Two</hi> Parts:</p>
            <p>I. An Exhortation, <hi>To hold fast the
Profession of our Faith without wavering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. An Argument or Encouragement
thereto; <hi>Because he is faithful that hath
promised.</hi> I am yet upon the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> of these, the Exhortation to
Christians, to be Constant and Steady
in the Profession of their Religion; <hi>Let
us hold fast the Profession of our Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering.</hi> And that we might the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56284:115"/>
better comprehend the true and full
meaning of this Exhortation, I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Negatively,</hi> what is not meant and
intended by it: And I mentioned these
<hi>Two</hi> Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. The Apostle doth not hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that those who are capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into, and examining the Grounds
and Reasons of their Religion, should
not have the liberty to do it. Nor,</p>
            <p>2. That when upon due Enquiry and
Examination, Men are settled, as they
think and verily believe, in the True
Faith and Religion; they should obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
refuse to hear any Reason that
can be offered against their present Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion;
for Reason when it is fairly
offered is always to be heard. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place, <hi>Positively</hi> to explain
the Meaning of this Exhortation: And
to this purpose I proposed to consider,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What</hi> it is that we are to hold
fast; <hi>viz. the Confession or Profession
of our Faith:</hi> The Ancient Christian
Faith which every Christian makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of in his Baptism; Not the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Uncertain Traditions of Men,
nor the Imperious Dictates and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56284:115"/>
of any Church (which are not
contained in the Holy Scriptures) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon the Christian World, though
with never so confident a Pretence of
the Antiquity of the Doctrines, or of the
Infallibility of the Proposers of them.
And then I proceded, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place, to shew <hi>how</hi> we are <hi>to
hold fast the Profession of our Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering:</hi> And I mentioned these
following Particulars, as probably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and comprehended in the Apostles
Exhortation.</p>
            <p>1. That we should <hi>hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith,</hi> against the Confidence
of Men, without Scripture or Reason to
support that Confidence.</p>
            <p>2. And much more against the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Men, contrary to plain Scripture,
and Reason, and the common Sense
of Mankind; under both which Heads
I gave several Instances of Doctrines
and Practices imposed with great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon the World, some without,
and others plainly against Scripture, and
Reason, and the common Sense of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. Against all the Temptations and
and Terrours of the World; the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Fashion and Example, and of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56284:116"/>
worldly Interest and Advantage; and
against the Terrours of Persecution and
Suffering for the Truth. Thus far I have
gone. I shall now proceed to the <hi>Two</hi>
other Particulars which remain to be
spoken to.</p>
            <p>4. We are to <hi>hold fast the profession of
our Faith,</hi> against all vain Promises of
being put into a safer Condition, and
groundless Hopes of getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon easier Terms, in some other
Church and Religion. God hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared to us in the holy Scriptures,
upon what Terms and Conditions we
may obtain Eternal Life and Happiness,
and what will certainly exclude us from
it; That <hi>except we repent,</hi> (i. e.) without
true Contrition for our Sins, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of them, <hi>we shall perish:</hi> That <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Holiness no man shall see the Lord:</hi> That
<hi>no Fornicator, or Adulterer, or Idolater, or
Covetous Person, nor any one that lives in
the practice of such sins, shall have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
in the Kingdom of God or Christ.</hi>
There is as great and unpassable a Gulf
fixt between Heaven and a wicked Man;
as there is betwixt Heaven and Hell.
And when Men have done all they can
to debauch and corrupt the Christian
Doctrine, it is impossible to reconcile a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56284:116"/>
wicked Life with any reasonable and
well-grounded Hopes of Happiness in
another World. No Church hath that
Priviledge, to save a Man upon any other
Terms, than those which our Blessed
Saviour hath declared in his holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
All Religions are equal in this;
That a bad Man can be Saved in none
of them.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends their
Church and Religion to be the only safe
and sure way to Salvation; and yet, if
their Doctrine be true, concerning the
Intention of the Priest, (and if it be
not, they are much to blame in making
it an Article of their Faith) I say, if it
be true, that the Intention of the Priest
is necessary to the Validity and Virtue
of the Sacraments; then there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the World, that runs the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Men upon more and greater
Hazards and Uncertainties, and such as
by no Care and Diligence of Man <hi>in
working out his own Salvation,</hi> are to be
avoided and prevented.</p>
            <p>As for the easier Terms of Salvation
which they offer to Men, they signifie
nothing, if they be not able to make
them good; which no Man can reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
believe they can do, that hath read
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56284:117"/>
the Bible, and doth in any good measure
understand the Nature of God, and the
Design of Religion. For Instance; That
after the long Course of a most lewd and
flagitious Life, a Man may be reconciled
to God, and have his Sins forgiven at the
last Gasp, upon Confession of them to
the Priest, with that imperfect degree
of Contrition for them, which they call
<hi>Attrition,</hi> together with the Absolution
of the Priest.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Attrition</hi> is a Trouble for Sin,
meerly for fear of the Punishment of it.
And this, together with <hi>Confession,</hi> and
the <hi>Absolution</hi> of the Priest, without
any Hatred of Sin for the Evil and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of it to the holy Nature and
Law of God, and without the least
Spark of Love to God, will do the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
business, and put him into a state
of Grace and Salvation, without any
other Grace or Disposition for Salvation,
but only the Fear of Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This, I confess, is easie; but the
great Difficulty is, to believe it to be
true. And certainly, no man that ever
seriously considered the Nature of God
and Religion, can ever be persuaded to
build the Hopes of his Salvation upon
such a <hi>Quick-sand.</hi> The Absolution of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56284:117"/>
all the Priests in the World will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Forgiveness of God for any
Man, that is not disposed for his Mercy
by such a Repentance as the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires;
which I am sure is very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from that which is required by the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that offer Heaven to Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so very large and loose Terms, give
great Cause to suspect, that they will
never make good their Offer; the Terms
are so unreasonably cheap and easie,
that there must be some Fraud and
False Dealing. And on the other hand,
nothing ought to recommend our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
more to a wise and considerate
Man; than that the Terms of Salvation
which we propose to Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith,
and Repentance, and a sincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Precepts of the Gospel, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in the Tenure of a Holy and
Virtuous Life, are not only perfectly
agreeable to the plain and constant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Holy Scripture; but do
likewise naturally tend to engage Men
most effectually to a good Life, and
thereby to make them <hi>meet to be made
partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in
Light.</hi> And therefore every body ought
to be afraid of a Religion, which makes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56284:118"/>
such lavish Offers of Salvation, and to
take heed how he ventures his Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. For if, after all the Hopes
that are given of Salvation upon such
and such Terms, the Sinner do really
miscarry and miss of Heaven; it is but
very ill Comfort to him, to be put into a
<hi>Fools Paradise,</hi> for a Minute or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he leaves the World, and the next
Moment after to find himself in the
place of Torments. I proceed to the</p>
            <p>5. And <hi>Last</hi> Particular I mentioned,
as implied in the Exhortation here in the
Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That we <hi>hold fast the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Faith without wavering,</hi> against
all the cunning Arts and Insinuations of
busie and disputing Men, whose Design
it is to unhinge Men from their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to gain Proselytes to their Party
and Faction. To this purpose there are
several Cautions given by our Blessed
Saviour and his Apostles. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 4.
<hi>Take heed that no man deceive you; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shall come in my Name, and shall deceive
many.</hi> Eph. 4. 14. <hi>That ye henceforth be
no more Children, tossed to and fro, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about with every Wind of Doctrine, by
the slight of men:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> (the Word
signifies the Cunning of Gamesters at
Dice;) <hi>by the slight of Men, and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56284:118"/>
cunning Craftiness whereby they lye in
wait to deceive.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 5. 6. Let no
man deceive you with vain Words.</hi> Col. 2. 8.
<hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and vain Deceit;</hi> that is, by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
and vain Reasoning, under a
pretence of Philosophy. <hi>Heb. 13. 9.
Be not carried about with divers and strange
Doctrines. 2 Pet. 3. 17. Beware lest you
also, being led away with the Error of the
Wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</hi>
And this Caution is enforc'd by an
express Prediction of <hi>a great Apostasie</hi>
which should happen in the Christian
Church, by which many should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
by pretence of Miracles, and by
several Arts of Deceit and Falshood.
<hi>This Apostasie</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly foretels,
2 <hi>Thess. 2. 1, 2, 3. We beseech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that ye be not soon shaken in mind,
or be troubled, neither by Spirit</hi> (that is,
by pretence to Inspiration) <hi>nor by Word</hi>
(or Message) <hi>nor by Letter as from us,
as that the Day of Christ is at hand. Let
no man deceive you by any means; for that
Day shall not come, except there come a
falling away, and that Man of Sin be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
the Son of Perdition.</hi> And after
a particular Description of him, he adds,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56284:119"/>
               <hi>v. 9. Whose coming is after the working of
Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and lying
Wonders, and in all deceitfulness of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
in them that perish.</hi> From
all which he concludes, <hi>v. 15. Therefore,
Brethren, stand fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particular nature and kind of
<hi>this Apostasie</hi> the same Apostle describes
more fully, 1 <hi>Tim 4. 1, 2, 3. Now the
Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter
times some shall apostatize from the Faith,
giving heed to seducing Spirits and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Devils, speaking Lies in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
(i. e.</hi> under a great Pretence of
Sanctity, spreading their pernicious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours)
<hi>forbidding to marry, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to abstain from meats.</hi> This is a very
lively and pat Description of <hi>that great
Apostasie</hi> in the Christian Church,
which began in the <hi>Western</hi> Part of it,
and hath spread it self far and wide.
For there the Spirit of Error and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
has prevailed, under an Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Pretence of their being the only
True Church and True Christians in the
World: There Marriage, and several
sorts of Meat, are forbidden to several
Ranks and Orders of Men. All the
Difficulty is, what is here meant by
<hi>Doctrines of Devils;</hi> and these certainly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56284:119"/>
can be no other than Doctrines tending
to Idolatry, which the Scripture every
where doth in a particular manner
ascribe to the Devil, as the Inventer and
great Promoter of it. And this is very
much confirmed by what we find added
in some ancient Greek Copies in this
Text, which runs thus: <hi>In the latter
times some shall apostatize from the Faith;
for they shall worship the Dead, as some also
in Israel worshiped.</hi> And then it follows,
<hi>giving heed to seducing Spirits, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Devils.</hi> So that the particular
kind of Idolatry, into which some part
of the Christian Church should aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
is here pointed at: That they
should worship Souls departed, or the
Spirits of dead Men; which was part of
the Heathen Idolatry, into which the
People of <hi>Israel</hi> did frequently relapse.
So that the Spirit of God doth here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
such an Apostasie in some part of the
Christian Church as the People of <hi>Israel</hi>
were guilty of, in falling into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatry. <hi>They shall be Worshipers
of the Dead, as the Israelites also were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is <hi>the great and dangerous
Seduction</hi> which the Christians are so
much cautioned against in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and charged <hi>to hold fast the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56284:120"/>
profession of the Faith</hi> against the cunning
Arts and Insinuations of seducing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
not but (as I said before) that we
are always to have an Ear open to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and to be ready to hearken and to
yield to That, whenever it is fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
But to be over-reached and rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of one's Religion, by little So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical
Arts and Tricks, is Childish
and silly. After we are, upon due Trial
and Examination of the Grounds of our
Religion, settled and established in it,
we ought not to suffer our selves to be
removed from it, by the groundless Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Confident People to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and to be practised upon by <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men, who lie at catch</hi> to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
to their Party. This is to be <hi>like
Children, tossed to and fro, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with every Wind of Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we ought to be the more careful
of our selves; because there never was
any time, wherein seducing Spirits were
more bold and busie to pervert Men
from the Truth. Against These we should
<hi>hold. fast</hi> our Religion, as a Man would
do his Money in a Crowd. It passeth in
the World for a great Mark of Folly,
when <hi>a Man and his Money are soon
parted:</hi> But it is a sign of much greater
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56284:120"/>
Folly, for a Man easily to quit his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
especially to be caught by some
such gross Methods, as the Seducers I am
speaking of commonly use, and which
lie so very open to Suspicion; such as
ill-designing Men are wont to practise
upon a young Heir, when they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
themselves into his Company,
to make a Prey of him. They charge
him to tell no body in what Company
he hath been; not to ask the Counsel
and Advice of his Friends concerning
what they have been persuading him
to; because they, for their own Interest,
will be sure to disswade him from it.
Just thus do these Seducers practise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
weak People. They charge them not
to acquaint their Minister, with whom
they have been, nor what Discourse
they have had about Religion, nor what
Books have been put into their Hands;
because then, all their kind Design and
Intention towards them will be defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But above all, they must be sure to
read no Books on the other side, because
they are no competent Judges of Points
of Faith; and this reading on both sides
will rather confound, than clear their
Understandings. They tell them, that
they have stated the matter truly, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56284:121"/>
would not for all the World deceive
them; and they may easily perceive,
by their earnest Application to them,
that nothing but Charity, and a passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
desire of the Salvation of their
Souls, makes them take all these Pains
with them. But this is so gross a way
of proceeding, that any Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
understanding must needs discern
by this kind Treatment, that these Men
can have no honest Design upon them.</p>
            <p>To come then to a more particular
Consideration of the Arts and Methods
which they use (I mean particularly
those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) in making
Proselytes to their Religion: As,</p>
            <p>1. In allowing them to be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
and sufficient Judges for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the Choice of their Church and
Religion, (that is, which is the True
Church and Religion, in which alone
Salvation is to be had) and yet telling
them at the same time, that they are
utterly incapable of judging of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines, and Points of Faith and
Practice; but for these, they must rely
upon the Judgment of an Infallible
Church, when they are in it; otherwise
they will certainly run into damnable
Errors and Mistakes about these things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:56284:121"/>
And they must of necessity allow them
to be sufficient Judges for themselves in
the Choice of their Religion; as will be
evident, by considering in what Method
they proceed with their intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte.</p>
            <p>They propose to him to change his
Church and his Religion, because he is
in the wrong; and they will shew him a
better, and such a one as is the only
True one, and in which alone Salvation
is to be had. To perswade him hereto,
they offer him some Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or give him Books to read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Arguments to move him to make
this Change, to satisfie him of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,
and to convince him of the
Necessity of it.</p>
            <p>Now by this way of proceeding (and
they can take no other) they do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no, make the Person,
whom they are endeavouring to convert,
a Judge for himself, which Church and
Religion is best; that which they would
have him embrace and come over to, or
that which they would perswade him to
forsake. For to what end else do they
offer him Reasons and Arguments to
perswade him to leave our Church, and
to come over to theirs; but that he may
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56284:122"/>
consider the Force and Weight of them;
and having considered them, may judge
whether they be of force sufficient to
over-rule him to make this Change?
So that as unwilling as they are to make
particular Persons judge for themselves
about Points of Faith, and about the
Sense of Scripture confirming those
Points (because this is to leave every
Man to his own private Spirit and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and giddy Brain) yet they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by Necessity, and against their
own Principles, to allow a Man, in this
case of chusing his Religion, to be a
Judge of the Reasons and Arguments
which they offer to induce him thereto.
So that, whether they will or no, they
must permit him to be a Judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for <hi>this once,</hi> but not to make a
Practice of it, or to pretend this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ever after: For in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this great Favour, of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to judge for himself <hi>this once,</hi>
(which they do unwillingly grant him,
and upon meer Necessity) he is for ever
after to resign up his Judgment to the
Church. And tho this Liberty be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>pro hÃ¢c vice,</hi> and properly <hi>to serve
a turn, i. e.</hi> in order to the changing
of his Religion; yet he is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56284:122"/>
that he is no fit and competent
Judge of particular Points of Faith;
these he must all learn from the True
Church when he is in it, and take them
upon her Authority; and in so doing
he shall do very prudently, because She
is infallible, and cannot be deceived;
but He may.</p>
            <p>But is there any Sense in all this, that
a Man should be very fit and able to
judge of that which they esteem the main
and fundamental Point of all, namely,
which is the True Church and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and of the Reasons and Arguments
whereby they pretend to demonstrate
it; and of the true Meaning of those
Texts of Scripture, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to prove theirs to be the only True
Church: and yet should be wholly una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to judge of particular Points of Faith;
or of the True Sense of any Texts of
Scripture that can be produced for the
Proof of those Points?</p>
            <p>Is it so very prudent, in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Points of Faith, for a Man to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Judgment of the Church, because
She is infallible; and not to trust his own
Judgment about them, because He is
fallible, and may be deceived? And is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56284:123"/>
it prudent likewise for this Man to trust
his own Judgment in the main Business
of all; namely, Which is the true Church
and Religion; concerning which he is as
fallible in his Judgment, and as liable to
be deceived, as in the Particular Points?
And if he be mistaken in the main
Point, they must grant his Mistake to
be fatal; because his Sincerity, as to all
the rest, depends upon it. This is a great
Mystery and Riddle; that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Man should have so sufficient a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to this main and fundamental
Business, Which is the True Church and
Religion; and should have no Judgment
at all about particular Points, fit to be
trusted and relied upon! As if there were
a certain Judgment and Prudence, <hi>quoad
hoc;</hi> and as if all Men's Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were so framed, as to be very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and discerning in this main Point
of Religion; but to be weak, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and blind, as to all particular
Points: Or, as if a Man might have a
very good Judgment, and be fit to be
trusted and relyed upon, before he come
into their Church; but from the very
moment he enters into it, his Judgment
were quite lost and good for nothing: For
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56284:123"/>
this in effect and by interpretation they
say, when they allow a Man to be very
able to judge which is the true Church
and Religion; but so soon as he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and embraced that, to have no
Judgment of his own afterwards of any
Point of Religion whatsoever; and a
very tempting Argument it is to any
Man that hath Judgment, to enter into
that Church.</p>
            <p>2. Another Art they use with their
intended Proselyte, in order to his make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a right choice of his Religion, is
to caution him, to hear and read only
the Arguments and Books which are
on one side. But now admitting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Proselyte to be just such a Judge,
and so far as they will allow him to be,
and no farther, <hi>viz.</hi> Which is the true
Church; but to have no Fitness and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
at all to judge of particular
Points of Faith; yet methinks they put
a very odd Condition, and untoward
Restraint upon this Judge, in telling
him, (as they certainly use to do those
whom they would pervert) That he
must have no Discourse, nor read any
Books, but only on that side which
they would gain him to; because that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56284:124"/>
is the way to perplex and confound
him, so that he shall never be able to
come to a clear Judgment and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in the Matter. But will any Man
admit this way of proceeding in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Case? This is just as if in a Cause
of the greatest consequence, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
on one side should go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
the Judge, that it is only fit to
hear what he hath to say in the Case;
that he will open it very plainly, and
state the Matter in difference of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and impartially, and bring such strong
Reasons and Proofs for what he says,
that he shall not need to hear any
thing on the other side, but may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to Judgment without any more
ado: But if when the matter is thus laid
before him so plainly, and is even ripe
for Judgment, he will trouble himself
needlesly to hear, the other side; this
will cast him back where they first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and bring the Matter to an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
wrangling, and so confound and
puzzle his Understanding, that he shall
never be able to pass any clear Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Cause.</p>
            <p>What think we would a Judge say
to such a bold and senseless Pleader?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56284:124"/>
The Case is the same, and the Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
every whit as gross and palpable,
in pressing any Man to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a Matter which infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more concerns him, upon hearing
only the Reasons and Arguments on one
side.</p>
            <p>3. Another Art which they use in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proselytes, is to possess them, that
there is but One thing that they are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd to enquire into, and that is
this; Since there is but one true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church of Christ upon Earth, out
of which there is no Salvation to be
had; Which that True Church is; And
when they have found that out, that
will teach them in a most Infallible
way the True Faith and Religion, and
all things that are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
or done by them, in order to
their Salvation; so that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do, but to satisfie themselves in
this single Enquiry; Which is the True
Catholick Church of Christ? This is
the <hi>Vnum necessarium,</hi> the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
and when they have found
out this, and are satisfied about it, they
need to enquire no farther; this Church
will fully instruct and satisfie them in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56284:125"/>
all other things. And this I cannot deny
to be a very Artificial way of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and to serve their purpose very
well; for they have these two great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
by it.</p>
            <p>1. That it makes the work short,
and saves them a great deal of labour,
by bringing the whole Business to one
single Enquiry: and when they have
gained this Point, that this single Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is all that they need to be satisfied
in; then they have nothing to do, but
to ply and puzzle the Man with their
Motives of Credibility, and Marks
of the true Church; and to shew, as well
as they can, how these Marks agree to
Their Church, and are all to be found in
it, and in no other; and to set out to the
best advantage the Glorious Priviledges
of Their Church, the Miraculous things
that have been and are still daily done
in it, and the innumerable multitude of
their Saints and Martyrs: and if these
General Things take and sink into
them, their work is in effect done.</p>
            <p>2. Another great Advantage they
have by it, is, That by bringing them to
this Method, they divert and keep them
off from the many Objects against
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56284:125"/>
their Church and Religion, namely, the
Errors and Corruptions which we
charge them withal. For this is the
thing they are afraid of, and will by
no means be brought to; to vindicate
and make good their Innovations in
Faith and Practice, so plainly in many
things contrary to Scripture, and to the
Faith and Practice of the Primitive
Church; as the Doctrines of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
of <hi>Purgatory, the Popes
Supremacy,</hi> of <hi>the Infallibility of their
Church,</hi> of their <hi>Seven Sacraments</hi> Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by Christ, and of <hi>the Intention of
the Priest</hi> being necessary to the Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Virtue of the Sacraments: and
then several of their Practices; as of <hi>the
Worship of Images,</hi> of <hi>the Invocation of
Angels and Saints,</hi> of the Service <hi>of God
and the Scriptures in an Vnknown
Tongue,</hi> and <hi>the Communion in one Kind;</hi>
and several other things, so plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scriptures, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and Usage of the Primitive Church,
that almost the meanest Capacity may
easily be made sensible and convinced of
it. These are sore places, which they
desire not to have touched, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they use all possible Artifice, to keep
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56284:126"/>
Men at a distance from them; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the particular discussion of them is
tedious, and it requires more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Skill, to say any thing that is
tenable for them, and so to paint and
varnish them over, as to hide the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and Deformities of them; but
chiefly, because they are conscious to
themselves, that as in all these Points
they are upon the Defensive, so they
are also upon very great Disadvantages;
and therefore to avoid, if it be possible,
being troubled with them, they have
devised this shorter, and easier, and
more convenient way of making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes.</p>
            <p>Not that they are always able to
keep themselves thus within their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
but are sometimes, whether they
will or no, drawn out to Encounter
some of these Objections: but they
rid themselves of them as soon, and as
dexterously as they can, by telling those
that make them, that they will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
give them full Satisfaction to all
these Matters, when they are gotten
over the first and main Enquiry; Which
is the true Church? For if they can
keep them to this Point, and gain
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56284:126"/>
them to it, they can deal with them
more easily in the rest; for when they
can once swallow this Principle, That
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the One True
Catholick Church, and consequently,
as they have told them all along, Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
this Infallibility of the Church
once entertained, will cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of particular Errors and Mistakes;
and it will very much help to cure the
weakness and defects of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Doctrines and Practices, and at least
to silence and over-rule all Objections
against them. So that the benefit and
advantage of this Method is visibly
and at first sight very great; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder they are so steady
and constant to it, and do so obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insist upon it. But how convenient
soever it be to them; it is, I am sure,
very unreasonable in it self; and that
upon these Accounts.</p>
            <p>1. Because the True Church doth
not constitute and make the True
Christian Faith and Doctrine; but it is
the True Christian Faith and Doctrine,
the Profession whereof makes the True
Church; and therefore in Reason and
Order of Nature, the first Enquiry must
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56284:127"/>
be; What is the True Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, which by him was
delivered to the Apostles, and by them
publish'd and made known to the
World, and by their Writings Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and Conveyed down to us? And
this being found, every Society of
Christians which holds this Doctrine,
is a True Part of the Catholick Church;
and all the Christians throughout the
World that agree in this Doctrine, are
the One True Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>2. The Enquiry about the True
Church can have no Issue, even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own way of proceeding,
without a due Examination of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Doctrines and Practices of that
Church, the Communion whereof
they would perswade a Man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.
We will admit at present this
to be the first Enquiry; Which is
the True Church? Let us now see
in what way they manage this, to
gain Men over to their Church. They
tell them, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
the One True Catholick Church of
Christ. The truth of this Assertion we
will particularly examine afterwards,
when we come to consider the next step
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56284:127"/>
of their Method, in dealing with their
Converts. At present I shall only take
notice in the General, what way they
take to prove this Assertion; namely,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the One
True Catholick Church; and that is,
by the Notes and Marks of the True
Church, which they call their <hi>Motives
of Credibility;</hi> because by these they
design to perswade them, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the One True
Catholick Church. I shall not now
reckon up all the Notes and Marks
which they give of the True Church;
but only observe, that one of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Marks of the True Church is this;
That the Faith and Doctrine of it be
agreeable to the Doctrine of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Apostolick Church, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to
the Doctrine delivered by our Saviour
and his Apostles: And this <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
makes one of the Marks of the True
Church. And they must unavoidably
make it so; because the True Faith and
Doctrine of Christ, is that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Constitutes the True Church.
But if this be an Essential Mark of the
True Church; then no Man can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
know the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be
the True Church, till he have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56284:128"/>
the particular Doctrines and
Practices of it, and the Agreement
of them with the Primitive Doctrine
and Practice of Christianity; and this
necessarily draws on and engages
them in a dispute of the particular
Points and Differences betwixt us;
which is the very thing they would
avoid by this Method, and which I
have now plainly shewed they cannot
do; because they cannot possibly prove
their Church to be the True Church,
without shewing the Conformity of
their Doctrines and Practices, to the
Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive
and Apostolick Church; and this will
give them work enough, and will,
whether they will or no, draw them out
of their Hold and Fastness; which is
to amuse People with a general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
Which is the true Church; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
descending to the Examination of
their particular Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But this they must of necessity
come to, before they can prove by the
Notes and Marks of the True Church,
that theirs is the True Church.</p>
            <p>And this is a Demonstration, that
their Method of Satisfaction, as it is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56284:128"/>
and Unreasonable, so it cannot
serve the purpose they aim at by it;
which is, to divert Men from the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the particular Points in
Difference between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and Us, and to gain them over to them
by a wile and trick; because the very
Method they take to prove themselves
to be the True Catholick Church, will
enforce them to justifie all their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Doctrines and Practices, before
they can finish this Proof.</p>
            <p>And here we fix our foot; That the
single Question and Point, upon which
they would put the whole Issue of the
Matter, cannot possibly be brought to
any reasonable Issue, without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Discussion and Examination of the
Points in Difference betwixt Their
Church and Ours: and when they can
make out these to be agreeable to the
Primitive Doctrine and Practice of the
Christian Church; we have reason to
be satisfied, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
a Church, in the Communion whereof
a Man may be safe: But till that be
made out; they have done nothing to
perswade any Man that understands
himself, that it is safe, much less necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56284:129"/>
to be of their Communion. But if
particular Points must be discussed and
cleared, before a Man can be satisfied in
the Enquiry after the True Church;
then they must allow their intended
Convert to be a Judge likewise of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Points; and if he be sufficient
for that too, before he comes into their
Church, I do not see of what use the
Infallibility of the Church will be to
him, when he is in it.</p>

            <p>I Have already made a considerable
Progress in my Discourse upon these
Words; in which I told you, there
is an Exhortation to <hi>hold fast the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Argument or Encouragement thereto;
because <hi>he is faithful that promised.</hi> I
am yet upon the <hi>First</hi> of these, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56284:130"/>
to <hi>hold fast the profession of our
Faith without wavering;</hi> by which I told
you the Apostle doth not intend, that
those who are capable of examining the
Grounds and Reasons of their Religion,
should not have the Liberty to do it:
nor that<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> when upon due Enquiry they
are, as they verily believe, established

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, What</hi> it is that we are here
exhorted to <hi>hold fast, (viz.) The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
or Profession of our Faith;</hi> the
ancient Christian Faith, of which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>4. Against all vain Promises of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put into a safer Condition, and
groundless Hopes of getting to Heaven
upon easier Terms, in some other Church
and Religion. I am now upon the</p>
            <p>5. And <hi>Last</hi> Particular I mentioned,
namely, That we are to <hi>hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith without wavering,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the cunning Arts and Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of busie and disputing Men, whose
Design it is to unhinge Men from their
Religion, and to make Proselytes to
their Party and Faction. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned some of the Arts which
they use, (I mean particularly them of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) in making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
to their Religion; and I have
shewn the Absurdity and Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of them. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In allowing Men to be very
competent and sufficient Judges for
themselves, in the Choice of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56284:131"/>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> which is the True Church
and Religion in which alone Salvation
is to be had) and yet telling them at the
same time, that they are utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of judging of particular Doctrines
and Points of Faith. As for these, they
must rely upon the Judgment of an
Infallible Church; and if they do not,
they will certainly run into damnable
Errors and Mistakes.</p>
            <p>And they must of necessity allow them
the first, a sufficient Ability to judge
for themselves in the Choice of their
Religion: Otherwise in vain do they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them Arguments to perswade them
to Theirs; if they cannot judge of the
Force of them. But now, after this, to
deny them all Ability to judge of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Doctrines and Points of Faith, is
a very absurd and inconsistent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Art they use, in
order to their making a right Choice
of their Religion, is earnestly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to hear and read only the
Arguments and Books on Their side:
Which is just as if one should go about
to persuade a Judge, in order to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understanding and clearer Decision
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56284:131"/>
of a Cause, to hear only the Council on
one side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They tell them, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing they are to enquire into, is,
which is the True Church, the one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church mentioned in the Creed,
out of which there is no Salvation; and
when they have found that, they are to
rely upon the Authority of that Church,
which is Infallible, for all other things.
And this Method they wisely take, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
particular Disputes about the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
and Errors which we charge
them withal. But I have shewn at large,
that this cannot be the First Enquiry:
Because it is not the true Church, that
makes the true Christian Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
but the Profession of the true
Christian Faith and Doctrine, which
makes the true Church.</p>
            <p>Besides, their way of proving Their
Church to be the only true Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Marks and Properties of the
true Church, of which the Chief is,
The Conformity of their Doctrines and
Practices with the Primitive and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Church; this unavoidably draws
on an Examination of their particular
Doctrines and Practices, whether they
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56284:132"/>
be conformable to those of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Apostolical Church, before their
great Enquiry, <hi>Which is the True Church,</hi>
can be brought to any Issue; which it is
plain it can never be, without entring
into the Ocean of particular Disputes,
which they desire above all things to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.
So that they are never the nearer
by this Method; they can neither short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their Work by it, nor keep off the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of their particular Errors and
Corruptions; which are a very sore
place, and they cannot endure we should
touch it.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to discover some
other Arts and Methods which they use
in seducing People to Their Church and
Religion, and shall be as brief in them
as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They pretend, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church is the Catholick Church,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Visible Society of all Christians,
united to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the
Supream Pastor and Visible Head of
Christ's Church upon Earth: from
whence it clearly follows, That it is
necessary to all Christians to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church; otherwise they cannot be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56284:132"/>
of the Catholick Church of Christ,
out of which there is no Salvation.</p>
            <p>We grant the Consequence, That if the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church be the Catholick Church,
it is necessary to be of that Communion;
because out of the Catholick Church
there is ordinarily no Salvation to be
had. But how do they prove, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Catholick Church?
They would fain have us so civil, as to
take this for granted: because if we do
not; they do not well know how to go
about to prove it. And indeed, some
things are obstinate, and will not be
proved without so much Trouble and
Difficulty, that it is better to let them
alone; and by the confident Assertion
of them, by Importunity, and by any
other fair means, to get them believed,
without Proof of this stubborn sort of
Propositions, which will admit of no
Proof. This is one, That a Part is the
Whole; or, which is all one, Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Catholick Church.
For that it is but a Part of the Christian
Church, and not the best Part neither,
but perhaps the very worst and most
corrupt of all the rest, is no difficult
matter to prove, and hath been often
done. But now to prove the Church
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56284:133"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Catholick Church;
that is, the whole Society of all True
Christians in the World; these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Particulars ought to be clearly shewn
and made out.</p>
            <p>1. A plain Constitution of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
whereby St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
at <hi>Rome</hi> are made the Supream Head
and Pastors of the whole Christian
Church. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> first. Can they
shew any such Constitution in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
or can they produce the least Proof
and Evidence out of the History of the
Acts and the Epistles of the Apostles,
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was acknowledg'd for
such by the rest of the Apostles? Nay,
is there not clear evidence there to the
contrary, that in the first Council of the
Christian Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was, if not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
at least equal to him? Does St.
<hi>Paul</hi> acknowledg any Superiority of St.
<hi>Peter</hi> over him? Nay, does he not upon
several occasions declare himself equal
to the chiefest Apostles, even to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
himself? And is this Consistent with
a plain Constitution of our Lord's, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
St. <hi>Peter</hi> Supream Head and Pastor
of the Christian Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:56284:133"/>
But suppose this to have been so;
where doth it appear, by any Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Saviour, that this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was derived to his Successors? And
if it were; why to his Successors at
<hi>Rome,</hi> rather than at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he
was first, and unquestionably Bishop?
They must acknowledg, that when he
was Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he was the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Head and Pastor of the whole
Christian Church; and then the Style
must have been, the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, as it is now the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick. But do they find any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of such a Style in Ecclesiastical
History?</p>
            <p>2. To make good this Proposition,
That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; they are in consequence
obliged to affirm and believe, That the
Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which were Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> for
not keeping <hi>Easter</hi> as They did; and
the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> who
were Excommunicated by the same Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
upon the Point of Rebaptizing
Hereticks; that all these, by being turn'd
out of the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, were also Cut off from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56284:134"/>
Church, and from a possibility
of Salvation. This the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
themselves will not affirm; and yet, if
to be cast out of the Communion of the
<hi>Roman</hi> and the Catholick Church be all
one, they must affirm it.</p>
            <p>3. In consequence of this Proposition,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, they ought to hold, that
all Baptism out of the Communion of
Their Church is void and of none effect.
For if it be good; then it makes the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
baptized, Members of the Catholick
Church; and then those that are out of the
Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may
be true Members of the Catholic Church;
and then the <hi>Roman</hi> and the Catholick
Church are not all one. But the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> holds the Baptism of Hereticks,
and of those that are out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Their Church, to be good;
which is a Demonstration, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church neither is the Catholick
Church; nor if she believe consistently,
can she think her self to be so.</p>
            <p>4. In consequence of this Proposition,
all the Christians in the World, which
do not yield Subjection to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledg his Supremacy,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56284:134"/>
are no true parts of the Catholick
Church, nor in a possibility of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this does not only exclude
those of the Reform'd Religion from
being Members of the Catholick Church;
but the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) <hi>Four</hi> of the <hi>Five</hi> Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Churches of the Christian World;
which taken together, are really greater
than those in Communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> does affirm, concerning all those
Churches and Christians, which refuse
Subjection to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
they are out of the Communion of the
Catholick Church, and a capacity of
Salvation. But surely it is not possible,
that the True Catholick Church of
Christ can have so little Charity as this
comes to; and to a wise Man there needs
no other Demonstration than this, That
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so far from being
the Whole Christian Church, that it's a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Arrogant and Uncharitable Part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly and Lastly;</hi> In consequence of
the Truth of this Proposition, and of the
Importance of it to the Salvation of
Souls, and to the Peace and Unity of the
Christian Church, they ought to produce
express Mention of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56284:135"/>
Church, in the Ancient Creeds of the
Christian Church. For if this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
be true; it was always so, and
always of the greatest Importance to
the Salvation of Men, and the Peace
and Unity of the Christian Church:
and if it were so, and always believed
to be so, by the Christian Church, as
they pretend; What reason can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd,
why the Ancient Christian
Church should never say so, nor put an
Article of such Consequence and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in express Words in their Creeds;
nor why they should not have used the
Style of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, as familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then, as they do now in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church? A plain Evidence that this is
a new Style which they use, when they
give themselves the Title of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Church; and that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Christian Church knew better, than
to call one Part of the Catholick Church
the Whole. I am sure, that <hi>AEneas
Sylvius</hi> (who was afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
the Second) says, that before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice,</hi> little respect was had to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church. But how does this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with their present Pretence, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church is, and always hath been
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56284:135"/>
the Catholick Church; and that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome</hi> is by Christ's appointment,
the Supream Pastor, and Visible Head
of the whole Christian Church? Is it
possible that this should be believed in
the Christian Church before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice;</hi> and yet little respect to be
had at that time to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church?
This indeed was said by <hi>AEneas Sylvius,</hi>
before he sate in the Infallible Chair;
but is never the less true for that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> The next step of their Method
is, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and by this means They have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
remedy against Heresie, and a Judge
of Controversies, from which there is
no Appeal, which We want in Our
Church. And this is a Glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
indeed, if they could prove that
they had it, and that it would be so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a remedy against Heresie, and give
a final Decision to all Controversies. But
there is not one tittle of all this, of which
they are able to give any tenable Proof:
For,</p>
            <p>1. All the pretence for their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
relyes upon the truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Proposition, That the Church of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56284:136"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholick Church, and That
they say is Infallible: And I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
shewn, that That Proposition is not
only destitute of any good Proof, but is
as evidently false, as that a Part of a
thing is the Whole.</p>
            <p>2. But supposing it were true, That
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were the Catholick
Church; yet it is neither evident in it
self, nor can be proved by them, that
the Catholick Church of every Age is
Infallible, in deciding all Controversies
of Religion. It is granted by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were Infallible, in the delivery of
the Christian Doctrine; and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Infallibility by Miracles; and
this was necessary at first for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Faith: but this Doctrine
being once Delivered and Transmitted
down to us in the Holy Scriptures,
Written by the Evangelists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who were Infallibly assisted by
the Holy Ghost; we have now a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Infallible Rule of Faith and
Practice, which, with the assistance and
instruction of those Guides and Pastors
which Christ hath appointed in his
Church, is sufficiently plain in all things
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56284:136"/>
necessary. And as there is no evidence
of the Continuance of Infallibility in
the Guides and Pastors of the Church, in
the Ages which followed the Apostles;
because Miracles are long since ceased:
so there is no need of the Continuance
of it, for the Preservation of the True
Faith and Religion; because God hath
sufficiently provided for that, by that
Infallible Rule of Faith and Manners
which he hath left to his Church in the
Holy Scriptures, <hi>which are</hi> every way <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and able to make</hi> both Pastors and
People <hi>wise unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As for a certain Remedy against
Heresie, it is certain God never intended
there should be any; no more than he
hath provided a certain Remedy against
Sin and Vice; which surely is every
whit as contrary to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and therefore as fit to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against, as Heresie: But it is certain
in Experience, that God hath provided
no certain and effectual Remedy against
Sin and Vice; for which I can give no
other reason, but that God does that
which He thinks best and fittest, and not
what We are apt to think to be so.
Besides that Infallibility is not a certain
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56284:137"/>
Remedy against Heresie. The Apostles
were certainly Infallible; and yet they
could neither prevent nor extinguish
Heresie; which never more abounded
than in the Apostles Times. And Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> expresly tells us, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 19. That
there must be Heresies; that they which are
approved may be made manifest.</hi> And St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> the 2 <hi>Epist. 2. 1. That there should
be false Teachers among Christians, who
should privily bring in damnable Heresies;
and that many should follow their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ways.</hi> But now if there must be
Heresies; either the Church must not
be Infallible, or Infallibility in the
Church is no certain Remedy against
them.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the next Step they make
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> That Christ hath always a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church upon Earth; and that They
can shew a Church, which from the
time of Christ and his Apostles, hath
always made a Visible Profession of the
same Doctrines and Practices which are
now believed and practised in the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but that We can shew
no Visible Church, that from the time
of Christ and his Apostles, hath always
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56284:137"/>
opposed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in, those
Doctrines and Practices which we now
revile and find fault with in their
Church.</p>
            <p>That Christ hath always had,
and ever shall have to the end of the
World, a Visible Church, Professing
and Practising his True Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is agreed on both sides: But We
say, that he hath no where promised,
that This shall be free from all Errors
and Corruptions in Faith and Practice.
This the Churches Planted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves were not, even in Their
times, and during Their abode amongst
them; and yet they were true parts of
the Christian Catholick Church. In
the following Ages, Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and Superstitions did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
creep in and grow up, in several
parts of the Church; as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and
others of the Fathers complain of their
Times. Since that several Famous Parts
of the Christian Church, both in <hi>Asia</hi>
and <hi>Africa,</hi> have not only been greatly
corrupted, but have Apostatiz'd from
the Faith; so that in many Places there
are hardly any Footsteps of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among them. But yet still Christ
hath had in all these Ages a Visible
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56284:138"/>
Church upon Earth; tho' perhaps no
Part of it at all times free from some
Errors and Corruptions; and in several
Parts of it, great Corruptions both in
Faith and Practice; and in none I think
more and longer, than in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for all she boasts her self like Old
<hi>Babylon, Isa. 47. 7, 8. That she is a Lady for
ever; and says in her heart, I am, and
none else besides me;</hi> And like the Church
of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Revel. 3. 17. which said,
<hi>I am rich, and increased with Goods, and
have need of nothing;</hi> When the Spirit
of God saith, <hi>that she was wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked;
and knew it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> boasts;
that She hath in all Ages been the True
Visible Church of Christ (and none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
her) free from all Errors in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and Corruptions in Practice; and
that from the Age of Christ and his
Apostles, she hath always professed the
same Doctrines and Practices which she
does at this day. Can any thing be
more shameless than this? Did they
always believe <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> Let
their Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> speak for them; who
expresly denies, that in the Sacrament
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56284:138"/>
there is any Substantial change of the
Bread and Wine into the Body and
Blood of Christ. Was this always an
Article of their Faith, and necessary to
be believed by all Christians? Let
<hi>Scotus,</hi> and several other of their School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Learned Writers speak for
them. Was <hi>Purgatory</hi> always believed in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as it is now defined in
the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Let several of their
Learned Men speak. In what Father,
in what Council before that of <hi>Trent,</hi> do
they find Christ to have Instituted just
<hi>Seven Sacraments,</hi> neither more nor
less? And for Practices in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they themselves will not say,
that in the Ancient Christian Church
the Scriptures were with-held from
the People, and lockt up in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Tongue; and that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Service of God, the Prayers and
Lessons were Read, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Celebrated, in an Unknown
Tongue; and that the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper was given to the
People only in one Kind. Where do
they find in Holy Scripture, or in the
Doctrine and Practice of the Ancient
Christian Church, any Command or
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56284:139"/>
Example for the Worship of Images;
for the Invocation of Saints and Angels
and the Blessed Virgin; which do now
make a great part of their Religion?
Nay, is not the Doctrine of the
Scriptures, and of the Ancient Fathers
plainly against all these Practices?
With what face then can it be said,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made
a constant Visible Profession of the
same Faith and Practice in all Ages,
from the time of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?
Or would the primitive Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it should now visit the
Earth again, own the present Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the same in all Matters
of Faith and practice, that it was when
they left it?</p>
            <p>And whereas they demand of Us,
to shew a Visible Church from the
time of Christ and his Apostles, that
hath always opposed the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in those points of Doctrine and
Practice which we Object to them;
what can be more impertinent than this
Demand? When they know that in all
these Points we charge them with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in Matters of Faith and Practice,
and say that those things came in by
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56284:139"/>
degrees, several Ages after the Apostles
time, some sooner, some later; as we
are able to make good, and have done
it. And would they have us shew
them a Visible Church, that opposed
these Errors and Corruptions in their
Church, before ever they appeared?
This we do not pretend to shew. And
supposing they had not been at all
opposed, when they appeared, nor a
long time after, not till the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet if they be Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Christian Doctrine,
and contrary to the Holy Scriptures,
and to the Faith and Practice of the
Primitive Church; there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
against Truth. 'Tis never
too late, for any Church to reject those
Errors and Corruptions, and to reform
it self from them.</p>
            <p>The bottom of all this Matter is,
they would have us to shew them a
Society of Christians, that in all Ages
hath preserved it self free from all such
Errors and Corruptions as we charge
them withall; or else we deny the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Visibility of the Catholick
Church. No such matter. We say
the Church of Christ hath always
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56284:140"/>
been Visible in every Age since
Christ's time; and that the several So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
of Christians, professing the
Christian Doctrine and Laws of
Christ, have made up the Catholick
Church; some parts whereof have in
several Ages fallen into great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Corruptions; and no part of
the Catholick, into more and greater,
than the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that it
requires the utmost of our Charity to
think that they are a true, tho a very
unsound and corrupt Part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge likewise, that We
were once involved in the like Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy;
but by the mercy of God, and
pious care and prudence of those that
were in Authority, are happily rescued
out of it: and tho' we were not out
of the Catholick Church before; yet
since our Reformation from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Corruptions of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are in it upon better
Terms, and are a much sounder Part
of it; and I hope, by the Mercy and
Goodness of God, we shall for ever
continue so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:56284:140"/>
So that to the Perpetual Visibility of
Christ's Church, it is not necessary, that
the whole Christian Church, or indeed
that any Part of it should be free from
all Errors and Corruptions. Even the
Churches planted by the Apostles in the
Primitive Times were not so. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
reproves several Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
of <hi>Colosse,</hi> and of <hi>Galatia;</hi> and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, several Things in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Churches of <hi>Asia:</hi> and yet all these
were true Parts and Members of the
Catholick Church of Christ, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these Faults and Errors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they all agreed in the Main and
Essential Doctrines of Christianity.
And when more and greater Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
grew upon the Church, or
any part of it; the greater reason and
need there was of a Reformation. And
as every particular Person hath a
right to reform any thing that he
finds amiss in himself, so far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
himself; so much more every
National Church hath a Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it self, to reform it self from all
Errors and Corruptions, and by the
Sanction of the Catholick Authority
to confirm that Reformation; which
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56284:141"/>
is our Case here in <hi>England.</hi> And
whatever part of the Church,
how great and eminent soever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
from her Communion such a
National Church, for reforming her
self from plain Errors and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
clearly condemned by the Word
of God, and by the Doctrine and
Practice of the Primitive Christian
Church, is undoubtedly Guilty of
<hi>Schism.</hi> And this is the Truth of the
Case between us and the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And no blind talk about a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Visible Church can render Us
guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> for making a Real
Reformation; or acquit Them of it, for
casting us out of their Communion for
that Cause.</p>
            <p>7. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> (to mention no
more) they pretend, that we delude
the People, by laying too much
stress upon Scripture, and making it
the only Rule of Faith and Manners:
whereas Scripture and Tradition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
make up the entire Rule of
Faith; and not Scripture Interpreted
by every Mans private Fancy, but
by Tradition carefully preserved in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56284:141"/>
the Church. So that it ought to be
no wonder, if several of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practices cannot be so
clearly made out by Scripture, or
perhaps seem contrary to it, as it
may be expounded by a private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but not as Interpreted by the
Tradition of the Church, which can
only give the true Sense of Scripture.
And therefore they are to understand,
that several of those Doctrines and
Practices, which we Object against,
are most clearly proved by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their Church, which is of
equal Authority with Scripture.</p>
            <p>In this Objection of theirs, which
they design for the Cover of all their
Errors and Corruptions, there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things distinctly to be considered,
which I shall do as briefly as I
can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whereas it is suggested,
That We delude the People, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much stress upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
(which certainly we cannot
well do, if it be the Word of God)
it ought to be considered, whether
They do not delude and abuse them
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56284:142"/>
infinitely more, in keeping the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
from them, and not suffering
them to see That, which they cannot
deny to be at least a considerable Part
of the Rule of Christian Doctrine and
Practice. Doth it not by this dealing
of theirs appear very suspicious, that
they are extreamly afraid that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
should examine their Doctrine and
Practice by this Rule? For what other
Reason can they have to conceal it
from them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas they affirm, that
Scripture alone is not the Rule of
Christian Faith and Practice; but
that Scripture, and Oral Tradition
preserved in the Church, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
down from hand to hand, makes
up the entire Rule: I would fain
know whence they learn'd this new
Doctrine of the Rule of Faith? I know
that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares it
for the Rule they intend to proceed
upon and make use of, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
and Proof of their following
Determinations and Decrees. But did
any of the ancient Councils of the
Christian Church lay down this Rule,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56284:142"/>
and proceed upon it? Did not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Emperour, at the opening
of the <hi>First General Council,</hi> lay the
<hi>Bible</hi> before them, as the only Rule,
according to which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
and this with the Approbation
of all those Holy Fathers that were
assembled in that Council? And did
not following Councils proceed upon
the same Rule? Do any of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers ever mention any Rule
of Christian Faith and Practice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Holy Scriptures, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Creed; which, because it is an
Abridgment of the necessary Articles
of Christian Faith contained in the
Holy Scriptures, is by them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>the Rule of Faith?</hi> Do not
the same Fathers frequently and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
say, That the Scriptures are a
perfect Rule, and that all things are
plainly contained in them, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Faith and Life; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
cannot be proved by Testimony
of Scripture, is to be rejected? All
this I am sure I can make good, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
express Testimonies of the
ancient Fathers, which are well known
to those that are versed in them. By
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56284:143"/>
what Authority then hath the Council
of <hi>Trent</hi> set up this new Rule, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Christian Church for
1500 Years? and who gave them this
Authority? The plain truth is, the
necessity of it, for the Defence of the
Errors and Corruptions which they
had embraced, and were resolved not
to part with, forced them to lengthen
out the Rule; the old Rule of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures being too short for their
purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas they pretend, that
Holy Scripture, as expounded by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Spirit, may not seem so favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to some of their Doctrines and
Practices; yet, as interpreted by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
which can only give the true
Sense of Scripture, it agrees very well
with them: I suppose they mean,
that whereas a private Spirit would
be apt to understand some Texts of
Scripture, as if People were to search
and read the Scripture; Tradition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
those Texts in a quite other
Sense, that People are not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to read the Holy Scriptures.
A private Spirit would be apt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56284:143"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Discourse, in the
14th of the 1st to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to
be against Celebrating Prayer and the
Service of God in an unknown Tongue,
as being contrary to Edification, and
indeed to common Sense: For he
says, <hi>If one should come, and find them
speaking and praying in an unknown Tongue;
will they not say, Ye are mad?</hi> But
now Tradition, which only knows
how to give the true Sense, can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
this Discourse of St. <hi>Paul</hi> very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
with the Practice of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> in this matter. And so likewise
the Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
with the Worship of Angels; and the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> with offering
the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ in
the Mass a Thousand times every Day.
And to give but one Instance more;
Whereas a Man by his private Spirit
would be very apt to understand the
Second Commandment to forbid all
Worship of Images; Tradition dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the meaning of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be, that due Veneration is to
be given to them. So that at this
rate of interpreting Scripture by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it is impossible to fix any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56284:144"/>
from Scripture, upon any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or Practice which they have a
mind to maintain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas they pretend
the Tradition of their Church, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the Mouth of Christ, or
dictated by the Holy Spirit, and
brought down to them, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by continnal Succession in the
Church, to be of equal Authority
with the Word of God; for so the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> says, <hi>That the Holy
Synod doth receive and venerate these Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
with equal pious Affection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
as they do the written Word of
God:</hi> This we must declare against,
as unreasonable in it self, to make Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
conveyed by Word of Mouth
from one to another, through so many
Ages, and liable to so many Mistakes
and Miscarriages, to be, at the distance
of 1500 Years, of equal Certainty and
Authority with the Holy Scriptures,
carefully preserved and transmitted
down to us; because this (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
is to make common Rumor and
Report of equal Authority and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
with a written Record. And
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56284:144"/>
not only so; but hereby they make the
Scriptures an imperfect Rule; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the declared Judgment of the
ancient Fathers and Councils of the
Christian Church; and so, in truth,
they set up <hi>a new Rule of Faith,</hi>
whereby they change the Christian
Religion. For <hi>a new Rule of Faith
and Religion</hi> makes <hi>a new Faith and
Religion.</hi> This we charge the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> with, and do challenge
them to shew this <hi>new Rule of Faith,</hi>
before the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and
consequently, where their Religion
was before that Council; to shew
a Religion, consisting of all those
<hi>Articles,</hi> which are defined by the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> as necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and established upon this <hi>new
Rule,</hi> professed by any Christian
Church in the World before that time.
And as they have pitch'd upon <hi>a new
Rule of Faith;</hi> so it is easie to see to
what End. For take Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV.
his <hi>Creed,</hi> and we may see where the
<hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Religion parts; even at
the end of the Twelve <hi>Articles</hi> of
<hi>the Aplostles Creed,</hi> which was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christian Faith; to which are
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56284:145"/>
added in Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>Creed</hi> Twelve
<hi>Articles</hi> more, defined in the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> and supported only by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
So that as the Scripture an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
for the <hi>Twelve old Articles,</hi>
which are plainly contained there;
so Tradition is to answer for the
<hi>Twelve new ones.</hi> And therefore the
matter was calculated very exactly,
when they make Tradition just of
<hi>equal</hi> Authority with the Scriptures;
because as many <hi>Articles</hi> of Their Faith
were to be made good by it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon it, as those which are proved
by the Authority of Scripture. But
that Tradition is of equal Authority
with the Scriptures, we have nothing
in the whole World for it, but the bare
Assertion of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should now have added some other
Considerations, tending to confirm and
establish us in our Religion, against
the Pretences and Insinuations of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
Spirits: But I shall proceed
no farther at present.</p>
            <p>The Tenth Sermon, as number'd, follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="note">
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56284:145"/>
THere is a mistake in Numbering
of these Sermons. The Tenth
should be called the Ninth, and so on
to the end. For there are but Fifteen
Sermons in this Volume, and should
be no more.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>HEB. X. 23.</bibl>
               <q>Let us hold fast the profession of our
Faith without wavering, for he is
faithful that hath promised.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words contain an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
and an Argument or Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
thereto, because <hi>he is faithful
that hath promised.</hi> By the Exhortation
to <hi>hold fast the Profession of our Faith
without wavering,</hi> is not meant, that
those who are capable of examining the
Grounds and Reasons of their Religion
should blindly hold it fast against the
best Reasons that can be offered; because
upon these terms, every Man must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56284:147"/>
in the Religion in which he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be fixt by Education, or an ill
choice, be his Religion true or false;
without Examining and looking into it,
whether it be right or wrong; for till
a Man examines, every Man thinks his
Religion right. That which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
here exhorts Christians to hold
fast, is the Ancient Faith, of which all
Christians make a solemn profession in
their Baptism; as plainly appears
from the context. And this Profession
of our Faith, we are to hold in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
instances, which I shall but brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention, without enlarging upon
them.</p>
            <p>1. We are to hold fast the Profession
of our Faith against the Confidence of
Men, without Scripture or Reason to
support that Confidence.</p>
            <p>2. And much more, against the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Men contrary to plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Reason, and to the common
Sense of Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. Against all the Temptations and
Terrors of the World, against the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Fashion and Example, and of
Worldly Interest and Advantage, and
against all Terrors and Sufferings of
Persecution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:56284:147"/>
4. Against all vain promises of being
put into a safer condition, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
hopes of getting to Heaven upon
easier terms than the Gospel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
in some other Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> We are to hold fast the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith without wavering,
against all the cunning Arts and Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of busie and disputing Men,
whose design it is to unhinge Men from
their Religion, and to make Proselytes
to their Party and Faction.</p>
            <p>But without entring into these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I shall in order to Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Reformed Religion which
we profess, in opposition to the Errors
and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
apply my self at this time, to make a
short comparison betwixt the Religion
which we profess, and that of the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> That we may discern
on which side the advantage of Truth
lies; and in making this comparison, I
shall insist upon Three things, which will
bring the matter to an issue, and are, I
think, sufficient to determine every so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and considerate Man, which of these
he ought in Reason, and with regard to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56284:148"/>
the safety of his Soul, to embrace: And
they are these.</p>
            <p>I. That we govern our Belief and
Practice in matters of Religion, by
the true ancient Rule of Christianity,
the Word of God contained in the
Holy Scriptures: But the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> for the maintenance of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Corruptions, have been forced
to devise a new Rule, never owned by
the Primitive Church, nor by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers and Councils of it.</p>
            <p>II. That the Doctrines and Practices
in difference betwixt us and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> are either contrary to this
Rule, or destitute of the Warrant and
Authority of it, and are plain Additions
to the ancient Christianity, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it.</p>
            <p>III. That our Religion hath many
clear Advantages of that of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only very considerable
in themselves, but very obvious and
discernable to an ordinary capacity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first proposal of them. I shall
be as brief in these as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56284:148"/>
I. That we govern our belief and
Practice in matters of Religion, by the
true ancient Rule of Christianity, the
Word of God contain'd in the Holy
Scriptures: But the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for
the maintaining of their Errors and
Corruptions, have been forced to devise
a new Rule, never owned by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, nor by the Ancient
Councils and Fathers of it; That is,
they have joined with the Word of
God contained in the Holy Scriptures,
the unwritten Traditions of their
Church, concerning several points of
their Faith and Practice; which they
acknowledge cannot be proved from
Scripture, and these they call the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
Word of God; and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> hath decreed them to be
of equal Authority with the Holy
Scriptures; and that they do receive
and venerate them with the same pious
Affection and Reverence; and all this,
contrary to the express declaration
and unanimous consent of all the
Ancient Councils and Fathers of the
Christian Church, (as I have already
shewn); and this never declar'd to be
a point of Faith, till it was decreed,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56284:149"/>
(not much above a Hundred Years
ago) in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> and this
surely, if any thing, is a Matter of
great consequence, to presume to alter
the Ancient Rule of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice, and to enlarge it,
and add to it, at their pleasure. But
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having made so
great a change in the Doctrine and
Practice of Christianity, it became
consequently necessary to make a
change of the Rule: And therefore
with great Reason did the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> take this into consideration in
the first place, and put it in the front
of their Decrees, because it was to be
the foundation and main proof of
the following Definitions of Faith, and
Decrees of Practice, for which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this new Rule, there had been no
colour.</p>
            <p>II. The Doctrines and Practices in
difference betwixt us, and the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> are either contrary to the
true Rule, or destitute of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Authority of it; and plain
Additions to the Ancient Christianity,
and Corruptions of it; the Truth of this
will best appear, by instancing in some
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56284:149"/>
of the principal Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
in difference betwixt us.</p>
            <p>As for their two great Fundamental
Doctrines, of the Supremacy of the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the world, and the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Church, there is not one
word in Scripture concerning these
Priviledges; nay it is little less than
a demonstration that they have no such
Priviledges, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a long
Epistle to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes
no notice of them; That the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> either then was, or was to
be soon after, the Mother and Mistress
of all Churches, which is now grown
to be an Article of Faith in the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet it is hardly to be
imagined, that he could have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to take notice of such remarkable
Priviledges of their Bishops and Church,
above any in the world, had he
known they had belonged to them.
So that in all probability he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of those mighty Prerogatives of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwise it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, but that he would have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with more deference and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to this Seat of Infallibility, and
Center of Unity; he would certainly <pb n="284" facs="tcp:56284:150"/>
have paid a greater Respect to this
Mother and Mistress of all Churches,
where the Head of the Church, and
Vicar of Christ either was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
seated, or by the appointment
of Christ was designed for ever to
fix his Throne and establish his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence;
but there is not one word,
or the least intimation of any such
thing throughout this whole Epistle,
nor in any other part of the New
Testament.</p>
            <p>Besides, that both these pretended Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
are omitted, by plain Fact and
Evidence of things themselves, their
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> in that the far greatest
part of the Christian Church, neither
is at this day, nor can be shewn by
the Records of any Age, ever to have
been subject to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
or to have acknowledged his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Jurisdiction over them, and
the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Pope, whether
with or without a General Council,
(about which they still differ) though
Infallibility was devised on purpose,
to determine all differences: I say,
this Infallibility, where-ever it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be, is plainly confuted by
the contradictory Definitions of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56284:150"/>
Popes and Councils; for if they
have contradicted one another, (as is
plain, beyond all contradiction, in several
instances) then there must of necessity
be an Error on one side; and there can
be no so certain demonstration, that any
one is infallible, as evident Error and
Mistake is of the contrary.</p>
            <p>Next, their concealing both the Rule
of Religion and the Practice of it, in
the Worship and Service of God, from
the People, in an unknown Tongue;
and their administring the Communion
to the People in one kind only, contrary
to clear Scripture and the plain Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Blessed Saviour; and then
their Worship of Images, and Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Angels and Saints, and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, in the same Solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and for the same Blessings and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which we beg of God himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the express Word of God, which
commands us to Worship the Lord our
God; and to serve him only; and which
declares, that as there is but one God,
so there is but one Mediator between
God and Man, Christ Jesus; but one
Mediator not only of Redemption, but
of Intercession too; for the Apostle there
speaks of a Mediator of Intercession,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56284:151"/>
by whom only we are to offer up our
Prayers, which are to be put up to God
only, and which expresly forbids Men
to worship any Image or likeness:
And the Learned Men of their own
Church acknowledge, that there is neither
Precept nor Example for these Practices
in Scripture, and that they were not used
in the Christian Church for several Ages;
and this acknowledgment we think
very considerable, since so great a part
of their Religion, especially as it is
practised among the People, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in these points; for the Service of
God in an Unknown Tongue, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Scriptures from the People,
they do not pretend so much as One
Testimony of any Father for the first
600 Years, and nothing certainly can
be more unreasonable in it self, than
to deny People the best means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Will of God, and not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to understand what is done
in the publick Worship of God, and
what Prayers are put up to him in
the Church.</p>
            <p>The two great Doctrines of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
and Purgatory are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by many of their own Learned
Writers, to have no certain Foundation
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56284:151"/>
in Scripture; and that there are seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of the Christian Religion, tho'
it be now made an Article of Faith by the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is a thing which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be shewn in any Council or Father
for above a Thousand Years after Christ.
And we find no mention of this Number
of the Sacraments, till the Age of <hi>Peter
Lombard</hi> the Father of the Schoolmen.</p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the
Mother and Mistress of all Churches,
tho' that also be one of the new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. his Creed,
which their Priests are by a Solemn
Oath obliged to believe and teach, yet
is it most evidently false: That she is
not the Mother of all Churches is plain,
because <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was certainly so, for
there certainly was the first Christian
Church, and from thence all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches in the World derive
themselves; that she is not, (tho' she fain
would be) the Mistress of all Churches,
is as evident, because the greatest part
of the Christian Church does at this
day, and always did, deny that she hath
any Authority or Supremacy over them.
Now these are the principal matters in
difference betwixt us, and if these Points,
and a few more, be pared off from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56284:152"/>
that which remains of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is the same with ours, that is, the
true Ancient Christianity.</p>
            <p>III. I shall shew that our Religion
hath many clear advantages of theirs,
not only very considerable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but very obvious and discernable
to an ordinary capacity, upon the very
first proposal of them; as,</p>
            <p>1. That our Religion agrees perfectly
with the Scriptures, and all points both
of our Belief and Practice, esteemed by
us as necessary to Salvation, are there
contained, even our Enemies themselves
being Judges. <hi>We Worship the Lord
our God, and him only do we serve.</hi> We
do not fall down before Images and
Worship them, we address all our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God alone, by the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Intercession of his Son Jesus
Christ; as he himself hath given us
Commandment, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
plainly direct, giving us this plain and
Substantial Reason for it, Because as
there is but one God, so there is but
one Mediator between God and Men,
the Man Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>The publick Worship and Service of
God is perform'd by us in a Language
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56284:152"/>
which we understand, according to
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s express Order and Direction,
and the universal Practice of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, and the Nature and Reason
of the thing it self: We administer the
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in
both kinds, according to our Saviour's
Example and plain Institution; and
the continual Practice of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches in the World, for above
a Thousand Years.</p>
            <p>2. We believe nothing as necessary
to Salvation, but what hath been own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all Ages to be the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and is acknowleged so to be
by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self; and we
receive the whole Faith of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christian Church, (<hi>viz.</hi>) What
ever is contained in the Apostles Creed,
and in the Explications of that in the
Creeds of the Four first General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills.
By which it plainly appears, that
all points of Faith in difference betwixt
us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
and plain Additions to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christian Faith. But all that we
believe, is acknowledged by them to be
undoubtedly the ancient Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>3. There is nothing wanting in our
Church and Religion, whether in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56284:153"/>
of Faith or Practice, which either
the Scripture makes necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or was so esteem'd by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church for the first Five Hundred
Years; and we trust, that what was
sufficient for the Salvation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the best Ages of Christianity
for Five Hundred Years together, may
be so still; and we are very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to venture our Salvation upon the
same terms that they did.</p>
            <p>4. Our Religion is not only free
from all Idolatrous Worship, but even
from all Suspicion and probable Charge
of any such thing; but this the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is not, as is acknowledged by
her most Learned Champions, and as
no Man of Ingenuity can deny; And
the Reason which the Learned Men
give, why the Worship of Images,
and the Invocation of Angels and
Saints departed were not practised in
the Primitive Church, for the first
Three Hundred Years, is a plain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
that these Practices are
very liable to the Suspicion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
for they say, that the Christians
did then forbear those Practices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they seem'd to come too near
to the Pagan Idolatry, and lest the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56284:153"/>
Heathen should have taken occasion to
have justified themselves, if these
things had been practised among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
and they cannot now be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
what Scandal they give by these
Practices both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi>
and how much they alienate them
from Christianity by this Scandal; nor
can they chuse but be sensible, upon
how great disadvantage they are in
defending these Practices from the
Charge of Idolatry; and that by all
their blind Distinctions, with which
they raise such a Cloud and Dust,
they can hardly make any plausible
and tollerable Defence of themselves
from this Charge: Insomuch, that to
secure their own People from discerning
their Guilt in this Matter, they have
been put upon that shameful shift of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Second Commandment in
their common Catechisms and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
lest the People, seeing so plain a
Law of God against so common a
Practice of their Church, should upon
that Discovery have broken off from
them.</p>
            <p>5. Nor is our Religion incumbered
with such an endless number of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and troublesom Observances, as theirs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56284:154"/>
infiintely is, even beyond the Number of
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies, to the great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Scandal of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the diverting of Mens Minds
from the spiritual part of Religion, and
the more weighty and necessary Duties
of the Christian Life; so that, in truth,
a devout Pastor is so taken up with
the external Rites and little Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Religion, that he hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no time to make himself a good
Man, and to cultivate and improve
his Mind in true Piety and Virtue.</p>
            <p>6. Our Religion is evidently more
Charitable to all Christians that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from us, and particularly to them,
who, by their Uncharitableness to us,
have done as much as is possible to
discharge and damp our Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. And Charity, as it is
one of the most essential Marks of a
true Christian, so it is likewise the
best Mark and Ornament of a true
Church; and of all things that can be
thought of, methinks the want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in any Church should be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to no Man to fall in love with it,
and to be fond of its Communion.</p>
            <p>7. Our Religion doth not clash and
interfere with any of the great Moral
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56284:154"/>
Duties, to which all Mankind stand
obliged by the Law and Light of
Nature; as Fidelity, Mercy and Truth:
We do not teach Men to break Faith
with Hereticks or Infidels, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
and extirpate those who differ
from us, with Fire and Sword: No
such thing as Equivocation or Mental
Reservation, or any other Artificial
way of Falshood, is either taught or
maintain'd, either by the Doctrine or
by the Casuists of our Church.</p>
            <p>8. Our Religion and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of it are perfectly consistent
with the Peace of Civil Government,
and the Welfare of Humane Society:
We neither exempt the Clergy from
Subjection to the Civil Powers, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Subjects upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
from allegiance to their Princes;
both which Points, the necessity of the
one, and the lawfulness of the other,
have been taught and stifly maintain'd
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only by
private Doctors, but by Popes and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils.</p>
            <p>9. The Doctrines of our Religion,
are perfectly free from all Suspicion of
a Worldly Interest and Design, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the greatest part of the erroneous
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56284:155"/>
Doctrines with which we charge the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are plainly calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to promote the end of Worldly
Greatness and Dominion.</p>
            <p>The Pope's <hi>Kingdom is plainly of this
World;</hi> and the Doctrines and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes
of it, like so many Servants, are
<hi>ready</hi> upon all occasion <hi>to fight for him.</hi>
For most of them do plainly tend, either
to the Establishment and Enlargment of
his Authority; or to the Magnifying of
the Priests, and the giving them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
power over the Conscienees of
the People, and the keeping them in
a slavish subjection and blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to them. And to this purpose
do plainly tend the Doctrines of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting
the Clergy from the Secular
Power and Jurisdiction; the Doctrine
of Transubstantiation; for it must
needs make the Priest a great Man
in the Opinion of the People, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he can make God, as they
love to express it, without all Reason
and Reverence. Of the like tendency
is the Communicating of the Laity
only in one kind, thereby making it
the sole Priviledge of the Priest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacrament in both. The
with-holding the Scripture from the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56284:155"/>
People, and celebrating the Service of
God in an unknown Tongue. The
Doctrine of an implicite Faith, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Resignation of their Judgments
to their Teachers. These do all directly
tend to keep the People in ignorance,
and to bring them to a blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to the dictates of their Teachers:
So likewise the Necessity of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Priests, to the saving Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Efficacy of the Sacraments;
by which Doctrine, the People do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter depend as much upon
the good will of the Priest, as upon
the Mercy of God for their Salvation:
but above all, their Doctrine of the
Necessity of Auricular and private
Confession, of all Mortal Sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after Baptism, with all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of them to the Priest; and
this not only for the ease and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Consciences, but as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
condition of having their Sins
pardoned and forgiven by God: By
which means they make themselves
Masters of all the Secrets of the People,
and keep them in awe by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their faults, <hi>Scire volunt secreta
Domus atque inde timeri.</hi> Or else their
Doctrines tend to filthy lucre, and the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56284:156"/>
enriching of their Church. As their
Doctrines of Purgatory and Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and their Prayers and Masses for
the dead, and many more Doctrines
and Practices of the like kind plainly
do.</p>
            <p>10. Our Religion is free from all
disingenuous and dishonest Arts of
maintaining and supporting it self;
such are clipping of ancient Authors,
nay and even the Authors and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of their own Church; when
they speak too freely of any Point:
as may be seen in their <hi>Indices Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorii</hi>
which much against their
wills have been brought to light. To
which I shall only add these Three
gross Forgeries, which lie all at their
doors, and they cannot deny them to
be so.</p>
            <p>1. The pretended <hi>Canon</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice</hi> in the case of Appeals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the
<hi>African</hi> Church. Upon which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
a great while very confidently,
till at last they were convinced by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Copies of the Canons of that
Council.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Constantine's</hi> Donation to the Pope,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56284:156"/>
which they kept a great stir with, till
the Forgery of it was discovered.</p>
            <p>3. The Decretal Epistles of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Popes; a large Volume of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
compiled by <hi>Isidore Mercator,</hi> to
countenance the Usurpations of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of which the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> made great use for several
Ages, and pertinaciously defended the
Authority of them, till the Learned Men
of their own Church have at last been
forced for very shame to disclaim them,
and to confess the Imposture of them:
A like instance whereto, is not I hope
to be shewn in any Christian Church.
This is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
the slight of Men; such as Gamesters
use at Dice; for to alledge false and
forged Authors in this case, is to play
with false Dice, when the Salvation of
Mens Souls lie at stake.</p>
            <p>11. Our Religion hath this mighty
advantage, that it doth not decline
Tryal and Examination, which to any
Man of ingenuity must needs appear
a very good Sign of an honest Cause;
but if any Church be shy of having
her Religion Examined, and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practices brought into the
open light, this gives just ground of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56284:157"/>
Suspicion that she hath some distrust
of them; for Truth doth not seek cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
nor shun the light. Our Saviour
hath told us who they are that <hi>love
darkness rather than light,</hi> viz. they
whose <hi>deeds are Evil; for every one, saith
he, that doth Evil, hateth the light; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cometh he to the light, lest his deeds
should be reproved and made manifest.</hi>
There needs no more to render a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
suspected to a wise Man, than
to see those who profess it, and make
such proud boasts of the Truth and
Goodness of it, so fearful that it should
be examin'd and lookt into, and that
their People should take the liberty
to hear and read what can be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
            <p>12. We perswade Men to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by Human and Christian ways,
such as our Saviour and his Apostles
used, by urging Men with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God, and with Arguments
fetcht from another World. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Eternal Life and Happiness, and
the threatning of Eternal death and
Misery, which are the proper Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion, and which alone
are fitted to work upon the Minds
and Consciences of Men; the terror
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:56284:157"/>
and torture of death may make Men
Hypocrites, and awe them to profess
with their Mouths what they do not
believe in their Hearts; but this is no
proper means of converting the Soul,
and convincing the Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Men; and these violent
and cruel ways cannot be denyed to
have been Practised in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and set on foot by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Councils, and greatly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
and encouraged by Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
Witness the many Croisades
for the extirpation of Hereticks, the
standing Cruelties of their Inquisition,
their occasional Massacres and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
of which we have fresh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in every Age.</p>
            <p>But these Methods of Conversion
are a certain Sign that they either
disturst the Truth and Goodness of
their Cause, or else that they think
Truth and the Arguments for it are
of no force, when Dragoons are their
<hi>Ratio ultima,</hi> the last Reason which
their Cause relies upon; and the best
and most effectual it can afford.</p>
            <p>Again, we hold no Doctrines in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Senses of all Mankind; such
as is that of Transubstantiation, which
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56284:158"/>
is now declared in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be a Necessary Article of
Faith, so that a Man cannot be of
that Religion, unless he will renounce
his Senses, and believe against the
clear Verdict of them in a plain sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
matter; but after this, I do not
understand how a Man can believe
any thing, because by this very thing
he destroys and takes away the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Certainty; if any Man
forbid me to believe what I see, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
him to believe any thing upon
better and surer Evidence. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, that Faith cometh by hearing;
but if I cannot rely upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sense, then the means whereby
Faith is conveyed, is uncertain; and
we may say, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
case, <hi>Then is our Preaching vain,
and your Faith also is vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> (To mention no more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars)
as to several things used and
Practised in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we
are on the much safer side, if we should
happen to be mistaken about them;
than they are, if they should be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
for it is certainly Lawful to
read the Scriptures, and Lawful to
permit to the People the use of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56284:158"/>
Scriptures in a known Tongue: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
we must condemn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and the Primitive Church for
allowing this Liberty. It is certainly
Lawful to have the publick Prayers
and Service of God celebrated in a
Language which all that joyn in it
can understand. It is certainly Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to administer the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper to the People in both
kinds, otherwise the Christian Church
would not have done it for a Thousand
Years. It is certainly Lawful, not to
Worship Images, not to pray to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or Saints, or the Blessed Virgin,
otherwise the Primitive Church would
not have forborn these Practices for
Three Hundred Years, as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by those of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose a Man should pray to God
only, and offer up all his Prayers to
him only by Jesus Christ, without
making mention of any other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
or Intercessor with God for us,
relying herein upon what the Apostle
says concerning our High Priest, Jesus
the Son of God, <hi>Heb. 7 25. That he
is able to save them to the utmost, who
come unto God by him, (i. e.</hi>) by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56284:159"/>
and Intercession, since he ever
liveth to make Intercession for them;
might not a Man reasonably <hi>hope to
obtain of God all the Blessings he stands
in need of, by Addressing</hi> himself only to
him, <hi>in the Name and by the Intercession of
that one Mediator between God and Man,
the Man Christ Jesus?</hi> Nay, why may
not a Man reasonably think, that this
is both a shorter and more effectual
way to obtain our requests, than by
turning our selves to the Angels and
Saints, and importuning them to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
God for us; especially if we
should order the matter so, as to make
ten times more frequent Addresses to
these, than we do to God and our
Blessed Saviour, and in comparison
of the other, to neglect these; we
cannot certainly think any more able
to help us and do us good, than the
great God of Heaven and Earth, <hi>the
God</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> styles him) <hi>that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Prayers,</hi> and <hi>therefore unto him should
all flesh come.</hi> We cannot certainly think
any Intercessor so powerful and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
with God, as his only and dearly
beloved Son, offering up our Prayers
to God in Heaven, by vertue of that
most acceptable and invaluable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56284:159"/>
which he offered to him on Earth;
we cannot surely think, that there is
so much Goodness any where as in
God, that in any of the Angels or
Saints, or even in the Blessed Mother
of our Lord, there is more Mercy and
Compassion for Sinners and a tenderer
sense of our Infirmities, than in the
Son of God. Who <hi>is at the right hand
of his Father, to appear in the Presence
of God for us;</hi> we are sure that God
always hears the Petitions which we
put up to him, and so does the Son
of God, by whom we put them up
to the Father, because he also is <hi>God
blessed for evermore.</hi> But we are not
sure that the Angels and Saints hear
our Prayers, because we are sure that
they are neither Omniscient nor Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent,
and we are not sure, nor
probably certain, that our Prayers are
made known to them any other way;
there being no Revelation of God to
that purpose; we are sure that God
hath declared himself to be a jealous
God, and that he will not give his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to another; and we are not sure
but that Prayer is part of the Honour
which is due to God alone; and if it
were not, we can hardly think but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:56284:160"/>
that God should be so far from being
pleased, with our making so frequent use
of those other Mediators and Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and from granting our desires the
sooner upon that account: That on the
contrary we have reason to think, he
should be highly offended; when he
himself is ready to receive all our
Petitions, and hath appointed a great
Mediator to that purpose, to see more
Addresses made to, and by the Angels
and Saints, and Blessed Virgin, than
to himself by his Blessed Son; and to
see the Worship of himself almost
jostled out, by the Devotion of People
to Saints and Angels, and the Blessed
Mother of our Lord; a thing which
he <hi>never Commanded,</hi> and which so far
as appears by Scripture, <hi>never came into
his mind.</hi> I have been the longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this matter, to shew how unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and needless at the best, this
more than half part of the Religion
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is; and how
safely it may be let alone.</p>
            <p>But now on the other hand, if they
be mistaken in these things, as we
can demonstrate from Scripture they
are, the danger is infinitely great on
that side, for then they oppose an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:56284:160"/>
of Christ, who appointed the
Sacrament to be received in both
kinds; and they involve themselves
in a great danger of the guilt of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and our common Christianity in
the scandal and reproach of it. And
this without any necessity, <hi>since God
hath required none of these things at our
hands;</hi> and after all the bustle which
hath been made about them, the utmost
they pretend (which yet they are not
able to make good) is, that these things
may Lawfully be done, and at the
same time they cannot deny, but that
if the Church had not enjoyned them
they might Lawfully be let alone; and
can any thing be more unreasonable,
than so pertinaciously to insist upon
things so hard (I might say) impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be defended or excused, and
which by their own acknowledgment
are of no great weight and necessity;
in which we are certainly safe in not
doing them, if they should prove Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but if they do not prove so, they
are in a most dangerous condition; so
that here is certain safety on the one
hand, and the danger of damnation on
the other; which is as great odds as is
possible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:56284:161"/>
And they must not tell us that
they are in no danger, because they
are infallible, and cannot be mistaken;
they must prove that point a great
deal better than they have yet done,
before it can signifie any thing either
to our Satisfaction or their Safety.</p>
            <p>I might have insisted more largely
upon each of these Particulars, any one
of which is of weight to incline a Man
to that Religion, which hath such an
advantage on its side, but all of them
together makes so Powerful an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to an unprejudiced Person, as
must almost irresistably determine his
choice, for most of the Particulars are
so evident, that they cannot, upon the
very mention and proposal of them, be
denied to be clear Advantages on our
side.</p>
            <p>And now, to use the words of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I testifie unto you, that this is the
true grace of God wherein ye stand,</hi> that
the Reformed Religion which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and which by the goodness of
God is by Law established in this
Nation, is the true Ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
the Faith which was at first
delivered to the Saints, and which is
conveyed down to us in the Writings
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56284:161"/>
of the Apostles and the Evangelists
of our Lord and Saviour: <hi>Remember
therefore how you have received and heard,
and hold fast, for he is Faithful that
hath promised,</hi> which is the Second part
of the <hi>Text;</hi> the encouragement which
the Apostle gives us to hold fast the
Profession of our Faith without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>he is Faithful that hath promised
to give us his Holy Spirit to lead us
into all Truth, to stablish, strengthen,
and settle us in the Profession of it, to
support and comfort us under all Tryals
and Temptations, and to seal us up to
the day of Redemption,</hi> and <hi>he is faithful
that hath promised to reward our</hi> constancy
and fidelity to him and his Truth, <hi>with a
Crown of everlasting life and Glory. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my beloved Brethren be ye stedfast
and unmoveable, and alwayes abounding in
the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you
know that your labour shall not be in vain
in the Lord; for he is faithful that hath
promised;</hi> and <hi>let us provoke one another
to Charity and Good Works, which are
the</hi> great Ornament and Glory of any
Religion, and <hi>so much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the day approacheth in which God
will judge the</hi> belief and lives <hi>of Men
by Jesus Christ,</hi> not according to the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56284:162"/>
imperious and uncharitable dictates of
any Church, but according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of his Son. <hi>To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Holy Ghost be all Honour and
Glory now and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of Peace which brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from the Dead the great Shepherd of the
Sheep, through the Blood of the Everlasting
Covenant, make you Perfect in every good
word and work; working in you that which is
pleasing in his Sight. And the peace of God
which passeth all understanding keep your
Hearts and minds in the knowledge and love
of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ our
Lord.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the latter part of the former
Chapter, the Apostle declares what
it was that was the great support
of Christians, under the Persecutions and
Sufferings which befel them; <hi>viz.</hi> the
Assurance of a Blessed Resurrection to
another life, Verse 14. <hi>Knowing that
he which raised up the Lord Jesus, shall
raise up us also by Jesus; for which cause,
saith he,</hi> verse 16. <hi>we faint not, but though
our outward Man perish, our inward Man is
renewed day by day;</hi> that is, though our
Bodies, by Reason of the Hardships
and Sufferings which we undergo, are
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56284:163"/>
continually decaying and declining;
yet our Minds grow every day more
healthful and vigorous, and gain new
strength and resolution, by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Glory and Reward of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, and as it were feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by Faith; <hi>for our light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is but for a moment, worketh
for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory; whilst we look not at the
things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he resumes the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
again at the beginning of this
Chapter: <hi>for we know, that if our Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
House of this Tabernacle were dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
we have a Building of God, a House
not made with Hands, eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi>
that is, we are firmly perswaded,
that when we die, we shall but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
these Earthly and Perishing
Bodies, these Houses of Clay, for a
Heavenly Mansion, which will never
decay nor come to ruine: from whence
he concludes, Verse 6. <hi>Therefore we are
always confident,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
therefore what ever happens to us, we
are always of good courage, and see
no reason to be afraid of Death; <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that whilst we are at home in the Body,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:56284:163"/>
we are absent from the Lord;</hi> that is, since
our continuance in the Body is to our
disadvantage, and while we live we
are absent from our Happiness; and
when we die, we shall then enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Possession of it. That which
gives us this confidence and good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
is our Faith; for tho' we be not
actually possest of this Happiness which
we speak of, yet we have a firm
perswasion of the reality of it, which
is enough to support our Spirits and
keep up our Courage under all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and adversities whatsoever, Verse 7.
<hi>for we walk by Faith, not by Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words come in by way of
<hi>Parenthesis,</hi> in which the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
in general, what is the swaying
and governing Principle of a Christian
life; not only in case of persecution and
affliction, but under all events, and in
every condition of Humane life; and
that is, Faith; in opposition to Sight
and present Enjoyment: <hi>we walk by Faith,
and not by Sight. We walk by Faith;</hi> what
ever Principle sways and governs a
Mans life and actions, he is said to walk
and live by it. And as here a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is said to <hi>walk by Faith,</hi> so else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
the just is said to <hi>live by Faith.</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:56284:164"/>
Faith is the Principle which animates
all his resolutions and actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And not by Sight.</hi> The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
which signifies the thing it self in
present view and possession, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a firm perswasion of things future
and invisible. Sight is the thing in
Hand, and Faith the thing only in Hope
and Expectation. Sight is a clear view
and apprehension of things present and
near to us; Faith an obscure discovery
and apprehension of things at a distance:
So the Apostle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.
<hi>Now we see through a Glass darkly;</hi> this is
Faith; <hi>but then face to face,</hi> this is present
sight, as one Man sees another face to
face; and thus likewise the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
distinguisheth betwixt Hope and
Sight, <hi>Rom. 8. 24. 25. Hope that is seen,
is not Hope; for what a Man sees, why
doth he yet Hope for it? but if we Hope
for that which we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it.</hi> Sight is possession
and enjoyment, Faith is the firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
and expectation of a thing; and
this the Apostle tells us was the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
principle of a Christian's life;
<hi>for we walk by Faith, and not by Sight;</hi>
from which words I shall observe these
Three things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:56284:164"/>
I. That Faith is the Governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and that which bears the great
sway in the Life and Actions of a
Christian; <hi>we walk by Faith;</hi> that is, we
Order and Govern our Lives in the
Power and Virtue of this Principle.</p>
            <p>II. Faith is a degree of assent infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to that of Sense. This is sufficient-intimated
in the opposition betwixt
Faith and Sight. He had said before,
that <hi>whilst we are at home in the Body, we
are absent from the Lord;</hi> and gives this as
a Reason and Proof of our absence from
the Lord, <hi>for we walk by Faith, and not by
Sight;</hi> that is, whilst we are in the Body,
we do not see and enjoy, but believe
and expect; if we were present with
the Lord, then Faith would cease, and
be turned into Sight; but tho' we have
not that assurance of another world,
which we shall have when we come to
see and enjoy these things, yet we are
firmly perswaded of them.</p>
            <p>III. Notwithstanding Faith be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
degree of Assurance, yet 'tis a
Principle of sufficient power to govern
our Lives; <hi>we walk by Faith;</hi> it is such
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56284:165"/>
an Assurance as hath an influence upon
our Lives.</p>
            <p>I. That Faith is the Governing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and that which bears the great
sway in the Life and Actions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
<hi>We walk by Faith;</hi> that is, we
Order and Govern our Lives in the
Power and Virtue of this Principle: A
Christian's Life consists in obedience
to the will of God; that is, in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do what he commands, and in
a willingness to suffer what he calls us
to; and the great Arguments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
hereto, are such things as
are the Objects of Faith, and not of
Sense; such things as are absent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not present and in possession; for
Instance, the Belief of an invisible God,
of a secret Power and Providence, that
Orders and Governs all things, that can
bless or blast us, and all our Designs
and Undertakings, according as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
our selves towards him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to approve our selves to him;
the Perswasion of a secret aid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
always ready at hand, to keep
us from Evil, and to strengthen and
assist us to that which is good; more
especially the firm Belief, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56284:165"/>
of the Happiness of Heaven, and
the glorious Rewards of another world,
which tho' they be now at a distance,
and invisible to us, yet being grounded
upon the Promise of God <hi>that cannot lie,</hi>
shall certainly be made good.</p>
            <p>And this Faith, this firm Perswasion
of absent and invisible things, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, was the
great Principle of the Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of good Men from the beginning
of the World. This he calls, <hi>Ch.</hi> 11.
<hi>verse</hi> 1. the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, or the confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of things hoped for, and the
proof or evidence of things not seen,
<hi>viz.</hi> a firm perswasion of the Being
and Providence of God, and of the
Truth and Faithfulness of his Promises.
Such was the Faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> he believed
<hi>that there was a God, and that he was a
rewarder of those that faithfully serve him:</hi>
Such was the Faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warned of God, of things at a
great distance, and not seen as yet,
notwithstanding believed the Divine
Prediction concerning the Flood, and
prepared an Ark: Such also was the
Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Posterity by <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56284:166"/>
such likewise was the Faith of <hi>Moses,</hi> he
did as firmly believe the invisible God,
and the recompence of reward, as if he
had beheld them with his eyes.</p>
            <p>And of this Recompence of Reward,
we Christians have a much clearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
and much greater assurance,
than former Ages and Generations had;
and the firm belief and perswasion of
this, is the great Motive and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a Holy life: <hi>The hope which is
set before us,</hi> of obtaining the Happiness,
and the fear of incurring the Misery,
of another world. This made the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, with so much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to bear the Sufferings and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
with so much constancy to
venture upon the dangers and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
which the love of God and
Religion exposed them to.</p>
            <p>Under the former Dispensation of
the Law, tho good Men received good
hopes of the Rewards of another life,
yet these things were but obscurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to them, and the great induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Obedience were Temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments; the promises
of long life, and peace, and plenty, and
prosperity, in that good Land which God
had given them, and the threatnings of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56284:166"/>
War, and Famine, and Pestilence, and
being delivered into Captivity. But
now, <hi>under the Gospel, Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
are brought to light;</hi> and the great
Arguments that bear sway with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
are the Promises of Everlasting
Life, and the Threatnings of Eternal
Misery; and the firm Belief and Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these, is now the great Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that governs the Lives and Actions
of good Men; for what will not Men
do, that are really persuaded, that as
they do demean themselves in this
World, it will fare with them in the
other? <hi>That the Wicked shall go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Punishment, and the Righteous into
Life Eternal.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>II. Observation, namely; That
Faith is a Degree of Assent, inferiour
to that of Sense. This is intimated in
the Opposition betwixt Faith and Sight;
<hi>We walk by Faith, and not by Sight;</hi> that
is, we believe these things, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
persuaded of the truth of them,
tho we never saw them; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot possibly have that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Assurance concerning the Joys
of Heaven, and the Torments of Hell,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56284:167"/>
which those have who enjoy the One
and endure the Other.</p>
            <p>There are different Degrees of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
concerning things, arising from the
different Degrees of Evidence we have
for them: The highest Degree of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we have for any thing, is our
own Sense and Experience; and this
is so firm and strong, that it is not to
be shaken by the utmost Pretence of a
Rational Demonstration; Men will
trust their own Senses and Experience,
against any subtilty of Reason what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
But there are inferiour degrees
of Assurance concerning things, as the
Testimony and Authority of Persons eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way credible; and this Assurance we
have in this state concerning the things
of another World, we believe with great
Reason, that we have the Testimony of
God concerning them, which is the
highest kind of Evidence in it self; and
we have all the reasonable assurance we
can desire, that God hath testified these
things, and this is the utmost assurance
which things future and at a distance
are capable of.</p>
            <p>But yet it is an unreasonable obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to deny, that this falls very much
short of that degree of assurance which
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56284:167"/>
those Persons have concerning these
things, who are now in the other World,
and have the Sense and Experience of
these things; and this is not only inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
here in the Text, in the Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith and Sight, but is plainly
exprest in other Texts of Scripture,
1 <hi>Cor. 13. 9, 10. We know now but in part,
but when that which is perfect is come,
that which is in part shall be done away.</hi>
That degree of knowledge and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which we have in this Life is very
imperfect, in comparison to what we
shall have hereafter, and Verse 12. <hi>We now
see as through a Glass darkly,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
as in a Riddle, in which there is always
a great deal of Obscurity; all which
Expressions are certainly intended by
way of abatement and diminution to
the certainty of Faith; because it is
plain, that by that which is in part or
imperfect, the Apostle means Faith and
Hope, which he tells us shall cease,
when that which is perfect, meaning
Vision and Sight, is come: We see like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in Experience, that the Faith and
Hope of the best Christians in this Life
is accompanied with doubting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these things, and all doubting is a
degree of uncertainty; but those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56284:168"/>
Souls who are entred upon the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Glory and Happiness; and
those miserable Wretches who lye
groaning under the Wrath of God and
the Severity of his Justice, cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
if they would, have any doubt
concerning the Truth and Reality of
these things.</p>
            <p>But however contentious Men may
dispute against common Sense, this is
so plain a Truth, that I will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the farther Proof of it; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is it reasonable, while we are in
this state, to expect that degree of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
concerning the Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of another Life, which the
sight and sensible experience of them
would give us; and that upon these
Two Accounts;</p>
            <p>1. Because our present state will not
admit it; and,</p>
            <p>2. If it would, it is not reasonable
we should have it.</p>
            <p>1. Our present state will not admit
it; for while we are in this World, it
is not possible we should have that sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Experiment and Tryal how things
are in the other. The things of the
other World are remote from us, and
far out of our Sight, and we cannot have
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56284:168"/>
any experimental knowledge of them,
till we our selves enter into that state.
Those who are already past into it know
how things are; those happy Souls who
live in the reviving presence of God, and
are possest of those joys which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now conceive, understand these
things in another manner, and have a
more perfect assurance concerning them,
than it is possible for any Man to have
in this World; and those wretched and
miserable Spirits who feel the vengeance
of God, and are plunged into the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Eternal Darkness, do believe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
irresistable evidence, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Convictions of the Reality
of that state, and the insupportable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of it, than any Man is capable of in
this World.</p>
            <p>2. If our present state would admit of
this high degree of assurance; it is not fit
and reasonable that we should have it;
such an over-powering evidence would
quite take away the virtue of Faith,
and much lessen that of Obedience. Put
the case that every Man, some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time before his departure out of this
Life, were permitted to visit the other
World, to assure him how things are
there, to view the Mansions of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56284:169"/>
and to survey the dark and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Prisons of the Damned, to hear the
lamentable outcrys of Miserable and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
Souls, and to see the inconceivable
Anguish and Torments they are in; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, what virtue would it be in any
Man to believe these things? He that
had been there and seen them, could not
dis-believe them if he would: Faith in
this case would not be virtue, but nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssity;
and therefore it is observable, that
our Saviour doth not Pronounce them
Blessed, who believed his Resurrection,
upon the forcible evidence of their own
Senses, but, <hi>Blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed.</hi> They might be
Happy in the Effects of that Faith, but
there is not praise, no reward belongs to
that Faith which is wrought in Man by
so violent and irresistable an evidence. It
was the great commendation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
Faith, that against hope he believed
in hope, he believed the promise of God
concerning a thing in it self very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
but it is no commendation at all
to believe the things which we have
seen, because they admit of no manner
of dispute; no Objection can be offered
to shake our assent, unless we will run
to the extremity of Scepticism; for if we
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56284:169"/>
will believe any thing at all, we must
yield to the Evidence of Sense: This
does so violently enforce our assent,
that there can be no Virtue in such a
Faith.</p>
            <p>And as this would take away the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Faith, so it would very much lessen
that of our Obedience. It is hardly to
be imagined, that any Man who had seen
the Blessed condition of good Men in
another World, and been an Eye-witness
of the intolerable Torments of Sinners,
should ever after be tempted knowingly
to do any thing that would deprive him
of that Happiness, or bring him <hi>into that
place of Torment:</hi> Such a sight could not
chuse but affect a Man as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and leave such impressions upon his
mind, of the indispensable necessity of a
Holy life, and of the infinite danger of a
wicked course, that we might sooner
believe that all the Men in the World
should conspire to kill one another; than
that such a Man, by consenting to any
deliberate Act of Sin should wilfully
throw himself into those flames: No, his
Mind would be continually haunted
with those Furies he had seen Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sinners in another World, and the
fearful Shrieks and Outcries of Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56284:170"/>
Souls, would be perpetually ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Ears; and the Man would
have so lively and terrible an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the danger he was running him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon, that no Temptation would
be strong enough to conquer his fears,
and to make him careless of his life and
actions, after he had once seen <hi>how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a thing it was to fall into the hands
of the living God:</hi> So that in this case,
the Reason of Mens obedience would be
so violent, that the virtue of it must be
very little; for what praise is due to any
Man, not to do those things which none
but a perfect mad Man would do? For
certainly that Man must be besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that could by any Temptation be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to live a wicked life, after he had
seen the state of good and bad Men in the
other World; the glorious Rewards of
Holiness and Virtue, and the dismal
event of a vitious and sinful course:
God hath designed this Life for the
Trial of our Virtue, and the exercise
of our obedience, but there would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be any place for this, if there were a
free and easie passage for us into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, to see the true state of things
there. What argument would it be of
any Mans virtue to forbear sinning, after
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56284:170"/>
he had been in <hi>Hell,</hi> and seen the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
end of Sinners? But I proceed
to the</p>
            <p>III. And <hi>Last</hi> Observation; namely,
That notwithstanding Faith be an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
degree of Assent, yet it is a Principle
of sufficient force and power to Govern
our lives; <hi>we walk by Faith.</hi> Now, that the
belief of any thing may have its Effect
upon us, it is requisite that we be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of these Two things.</p>
            <p>1. Of the Certainty and of the great
Concernment of the thing; for if the
thing be altogether uncertain, it will not
move us at all, we shall do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the obtaining of it, if it be good;
nor for the avoiding and preventing of it,
if it be evil; and if we are certain of the
thing, yet if we apprehend it to be of no
great Moment and Concernment, we shall
be apt to slight it, as not worth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard;
but the Rewards and Punishments
of another world, which the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to our Faith, are fitted to work
upon our Minds; both upon account
of the Certainty and Concernment of
them. For,</p>
            <p>1. We have sufficient Assurance of
the Truth of these things, as much as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56284:171"/>
we are well capable of in this state.
Concerning things future and at a
distance, we have the dictates of our
Reason arguing us into this Perswasion,
from the consideration of the Justice of
the Divine Providence, and from the
promiscuous and unequal Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things in this world; from whence
wise men in all ages have been apt to
conclude, that there will be another
state of things after this life, wherein
rewards and punishments shall be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distributed. We have the general
consent of Mankind in this matter: and
to assure us, that these Reasonings are
true, we have a most credible Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these things, God having sent his
Son from Heaven to declare it to us, and
given us a sensible demonstration of the
thing, in his Resurrection from the dead,
and his visible Aseension into Heaven;
so that there is no kind of evidence want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the thing is capable of, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our own sense and experience of these
things, of which we are not capable in
this present state. And there is no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against all this, but what will bring
all things into uncertainty, which do
not come under our Senses, and which
we our selves have not seen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:56284:171"/>
Nor is there any considerable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to hinder Men from the Belief of
these things, or to make them hesitate
about them; for as for the other World,
if at last there should prove to be no such
thing, our Condition after Death will be
the same with the Condition of those
who disbelieve these things; because all
will be extinguish'd by Death: but if
things fall out otherwise (as most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
they will) and our Souls after
this Life do pass into a State of Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Happiness or Misery, then our great
Interest plainly lies, in preparing our
selves for this State; and there is no other
way to secure the great Concernments
of another World, but by believing those
things to be true, and governing all the
Actions of our Lives by this Belief. For
as for the Interests of <hi>this</hi> Life, they are
but short and transitory, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of no Consideration in comparison of
the things which are Eternal; and yet
(as I have often told you) setting aside
the case of Persecution for Religion,
there is no real Interest of this World,
but it may be as well promoted and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
to as great Advantage, nay, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to a far greater, by him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
these things, and lives according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:56284:172"/>
than by any other Person: For the
Belief of the Rewards and Punishments
of another World is the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Encouragement to Virtue; and
as all Vice is naturally attended with
some temporal Inconvenience, so the
Practice of all Christian Virtues doth in
its own Nature tend both to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of Particular Persons, and to the
Peace and Prosperity of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But that which ought to weigh very
much with us, is, That we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
more Assurance of the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of another World, than we have
of many things in this World, which
yet have a greater Influence upon our
Actions, and govern the Lives of the
most prudent and considerate Men. Men
generally hazard their Lives and Estates
upon Terms of greater Uncertainty, than
the Assurance which we have of another
World. Men venture to take Physick
upon <hi>probable</hi> Grounds of the Integrity
and Skill of their Physician, and yet the
want of either of these may hazard their
Lives; and Men take Physick upon
greater Odds; for it certainly causeth
Pain and Sickness, and doth but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
procure and recover Health; the
Patient is sure to be made sick, but not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56284:172"/>
certain to be made well; and yet the
Danger of being worse, if not of dying,
on the one Hand, and the Hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and Recovery on the other, make
this Hazard and Trouble reasonable.
Men venture their whole Estates to
Places which they never saw; and that
there are such Places, they have only
the concurrent Testimony and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Men; nay, perhaps, have only
spoken with them that have spoken
with those that have been there. No
Merchant ever insisted upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Miracle to be wrought, to
satisfie him that there were such Places
as the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> before he
would venture to Trade thither: And
yet <hi>this</hi> Assurance God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give the World of a state beyond
the Grave, and of a blessed Immortality
in another Life.</p>
            <p>Now what can be the Reason that so
slender Evidence, so small a degree of
Assurance will serve to encourage Men
to seek after the things of this World
with great Care and Industry; and yet a
great deal more will not suffice to put
them effectually upon looking after the
great Concernments of another World,
which are infinitely more considerable?
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56284:173"/>
No other Reason of this can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but that Men are partial in their
Affections towards these things. It is
plain they have not the same Love for
God and Religion which they have for
this World, and the Advantages of it;
and therefore it is, that a less degree of
Assurance will engage them to seek after
the one, than the other; and yet the
Reason is much stronger on the other
side: For the greater the Benefit and
Good is, which is offered to us, we should
be the more eager to seek after it, and
should be content to venture upon less
Probability. Upon <hi>excessive</hi> Odds, a
Man would venture upon very small
Hopes; for a <hi>mighty</hi> Advantage, a Man
would be content to run a great Hazard
of his Labour and Pains upon little As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance:
Where a Man's <hi>Life</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
every Suspicion of Danger will
make a Man careful to avoid it: And
will nothing affright Men from Hell,
unless God carry them thither, and shew
them the place of Torments, and the
Flames of that Fire which shall <hi>never be
quenched?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not speak this, as if these things
had not abundant Evidence; I have
shewn that they have; but to convince
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56284:173"/>
Men, how unreasonable and cruelly
partial they are about the Concernments
of their Souls, and their Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>2. Supposing these things to be real
and certain, they are of infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to us: For what can concern
us more, than that Eternal and Unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
State in which we must be fixt
and abide for ever? If so vast a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
will not move us, and have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Government of our
Lives and Actions, we do not deserve
the Name of Reasonable Creatures.
What Consideration can be set before
Men, who are not touched with the
Sense of so great an Interest, as that of
our Happy or Miserable Being to all
Eternity? Can we be so solicitous and
careful about the Concernment of a <hi>few</hi>
Days; and is it nothing to us what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of us for <hi>ever?</hi> Are we so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
concerned to avoid Poverty and
Disgrace, Persecution and Suffering in
this World; and shall we not much more
<hi>flee from the wrath which is to come,</hi> and
endeavour <hi>to escape the damnation of Hell?</hi>
Are the slight and transitory Enjoyments
of this World worth so much Thought
and Care? And is an Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56284:174"/>
in the Heavens not worth the
looking after? As there is no Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
betwixt the things which are
Temporal and the things which are
Eternal, so we ought in all Reason, to
be infinitely more concerned for the
One than for the Other.</p>
            <p>The proper Inference from all this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
is, That we would endeavour, to
strengthen in our selves this great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of a Christian Life, the Belief of
another World, by representing to our
selves all those Arguments and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
which may confirm us in
this Perswasion. The more reasonable
our Faith is, and the surer grounds it
is built upon; the more firm it will
abide, when it comes to the tryal, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the impressions of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and assaults of Persecution: If our
Faith of another World be only a strong
imagination of these things, <hi>so soon as
tribulation ariseth, it will wither; because
it hath no root in it self:</hi> Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Apostle so often exhorts
Christians, to endeavour <hi>to be establisht
in the Truth, to be rooted and grounded in
the Faith,</hi> that when Persecution comes,
they may <hi>continue stedfast and unmovable.</hi>
The firmness of our Belief will have
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56284:174"/>
a great influence upon our Lives; <hi>if
we be stedfast and unmovable</hi> in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of these things, <hi>we shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
in the work of the Lord.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
joins these together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58.
<hi>Wherefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye stedfast
and unmovable, always abounding in the work
of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know your
labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.
Stedfast and unmovable,</hi> in what? In the
belief of a blessed Resurrection; which
the more firmly any Man believes, the
more active and industrious will he be
in the Work and Service of God.</p>
            <p>And that our Faith may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and powerful influence upon our
Lives, we should frequently revolve in
our Minds the thoughts of another
World, and of that vast Eternity
which we shall shortly launch into.
The great disadvantage of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
fetcht from another world, is
this, That these things are at a distance
from us, and not sensible to us, and
therefore we are not apt to be so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with them: Present and sensible
things weigh down all other Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And therefore to balance this
disadvantage, we should often have
these Thoughts in our Minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56284:175"/>
upon our selves the certainty of
these things, and the infinite concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them: we should reason thus
with our selves; if these things be true,
and will certainly be, why should they
not be to me, as if they were actually
present? Why should not I always live,
as if Heaven were open to my view,
and <hi>I saw Jesus standing at the right
hand of God, with Crowns of Glory in
his hands,</hi> ready to be set upon the
Heads of all those who continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and obedient to him? And why
should I not be as much afraid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Sin, as if <hi>Hell were naked before
me,</hi> and I saw the astonishing Miseries
of the Damned?</p>
            <p>Thus we should, by frequent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
represent these great things to our
selves, and bring them nearer to our
Minds, and oppose to the present
temptations of Sense, the great and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Happiness and Misery of the other
World. And if we would but thus
exercise our selves about <hi>the things which
are not seen,</hi> and make Eternity famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to our selves, by a frequent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, we should be very little
moved with present and sensible things;
we should <hi>walk</hi> and <hi>live</hi> by Faith, as
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56284:175"/>
the Men of the World do by Sense, and
be more serious and earnest in the Pursuit
of our great and everlasting Interest, than
they are in the pursuit of Sensual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and should make it the great Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this present and temporal Life, to
secure a Future and Eternal Happiness.</p>

On <bibl>HEB. X. 38.</bibl>

            <q>But if any Man draw back, my Soul
shall have no Pleasure in him.</q>
            <p>THE great Design of this Epistle,
(whoever was the Author of it,
which I shall not now enquire
into) is plainly this, to confirm the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who were but newly converted
to <hi>Christanity,</hi> in the stedfast Profession
of that Faith, which they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and to arm them against that
Temptation, which Christians were
then exposed to, <hi>viz.</hi> the fierce and
cruel Persecutions, which threatned
those of that Profession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:56284:177"/>
And to this purpose, he represents to
them, the excellency of that Religion,
above any other former Revelation,
that God had made of himself to the
World; both in respect of the Author
and Revealer of it, who was the Son
of God, and in respect of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self; which, as it contains bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more perfect Directions of a
good Life, so likewise more powerful
and effectual Motives thereto, better
Promises, and more terible Threatnings,
than were annexed to the Observation
of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, or clearly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
discoverable by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
From these Considerations, he
earnestly persuades them, all along
throughout this Epistle, to continue
constant in the Profession of this Faith,
and not to suffer themselves to be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of it by the Terrour of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
Chap. 2. V. 1. <hi>Therefore we
ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things which we have heard, left at any
time we should let them slip;</hi> and Chap.
4. 1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, lest a Promise
being left us, of entring into his rest, any
of you should come short of it,</hi> and verse
23. of this Chapter, <hi>Let us hold fast
the profession of our Faith, without waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:56284:177"/>
and to encourage them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
he sets before them, the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rewards and Recompences of the
Gospel; Verse 35. <hi>Cast not away there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Confidence,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
your free and open Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
which hath great Recompence
of Reward.</p>
            <p>And then on the other hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them from Apostacy from this
Profession, he represents to them the
horrible danger of it, here in the Text,
<hi>But if any man draw back, my Soul shall
have no Pleasure in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall briefly explain the Words, and
then prosecute that which I mainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in them; <hi>if any Man draw
back,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>: These Words,
with the foregoing, are cited out of the
Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> Chap. 2. Verse 3, 4.
and they are cited by the Apostle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Translation of the LXX.
which differs somewhat from the <hi>Hebrew;</hi>
and the difference ariseth from the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
readings of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word,
which is rendered by the LXX. <hi>to draw
back;</hi> but by the change of a Letter
signifies <hi>to be lifted up,</hi> as we render it
in the Prophet; but however that be,
the Apostle follows the Translation of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56284:178"/>
the LXX. and accommodates it to his
Purpose. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, if any Man
draw back; the Word signifies to keep
back, to withdraw, to sneak and slink
away out of fear, to fail, or faint in
any Enterprize: And thus this Word is
rendered in the New Testament, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, I did not

of St. <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>he slunk away,</hi> or <hi>withdrew
himself, fearing them of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;</hi>
and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word, which is
here rendered by the LXX. <hi>to draw
back,</hi> is elsewhere rendered by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
which is <hi>to fail</hi> or <hi>faint;</hi> from all
which it appears, that by <hi>drawing
back,</hi> the Apostle here means, Mens
quitting their Profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and slinking out of it, for fear of
suffering for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Soul shall have no Pleasure in him:</hi>
These Words are plainly a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, and less
is said than is meant; for the meaning is,
that God will be extreamly displeased
with them, and punish them very severely.
The like Figure to this, you have <hi>Psal.</hi>
5. 4. <hi>Thou art not a God that hast
pleasure in Wickedness,</hi> which in the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56284:178"/>
next Verse is explained, by his hatred
and detestation of those who are guilty
of it, <hi>Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity.</hi>
So that the plain sense of the words is
this, that Apostasie from the profession
of God's true Religion, is a thing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoking to him, and will be most
severely punisht by him.</p>
            <p>In speaking to this Argument, I shall
consider these four things.</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of this sin of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
from Religion.</p>
            <p>II. The several steps and degrees of it.</p>
            <p>III. The heinousness of it.</p>
            <p>IV. The great danger of it, and the
terrible punishment it exposeth men to.
And when I have spoken to these, I shall
conclude all with a short Exhortation,
<hi>to hold fast the profession of our faith without
wavering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. We will consider the Nature of
this sin of Apostasie from Religion; and
it consists in forsaking or renouncing the
Profession of Religion, whether it be by
an open declaration in words, or a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56284:179"/>
declaration of it by our actions; for
it comes all to one in the sight of God,
and the different manner of doing it,
does not alter the nature of the thing:
He indeed that renounceth Religion, by
an open declaration in words, offers the
greatest and boldest defiance to it; but
he is likewise an Apostate, who silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
withdraws himself from the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, who quits it for his interest, or
for fear disowns it, and sneaks out of the
Profession of it, and forsakes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of those who own it. Thus <hi>Demas</hi>
was an Apostate, in quitting Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for some worldly interest. <hi>Demas
hath forsaken</hi> us, <hi>having loved this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10.
And those whom our Saviour describes,
<hi>Mat. 13. 20, 21. who receiv'd the word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
stony ground,</hi> were Apostates out of
fear, <hi>they heard the word, and with joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it, but having no root in themselves,
they endured but for a while, and when tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
and persecution ariseth because of
the word, presently they fall off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is likewise a partial Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
from Christianity, when some Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article of it is denied, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in effect and by consequence, the
whole Christian Faith is overthrown. Of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56284:179"/>
this <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> were guilty,
of whom the Apostle says, <hi>that they err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning the truth, saying that tbe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
was past already, and thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the faith of some,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 17, 18.
That is, they turned the Resurrection
into an Allegory, and did thereby real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy a most Fundamental Article
of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>So that to make a man an Apostate, it is
not necessary that a man should solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounce his Baptism, and declare
Christianity to be false; there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other ways whereby a man may
bring himself under this guilt; as by a
silent quitting of his Religion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
himself from the Communion
of all that profess it; by denying an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Doctrine of Christianity; by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the great End and Design of
it, by teaching Doctrines which directly
tend to encourage Men in impenitence,
and a wicked course of life, nay, to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise
all manner of impiety and vice,
in telling Men that whatever they do
they cannot Sin; for which, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians did look upon the
<hi>Gnosticks,</hi> as no better than Apostates
from Christianity; and tho they retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Name of Christians, yet not to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56284:180"/>
be truly and really so. And there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a partial Apostacy from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan
Religion; of which I shall speak
under the</p>
            <p>II. Head I proposed; which was, to
consider the several sorts and degrees
of Apostacy. The highest of all, is the
renouncing and forsaking of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or of some Essential part of it,
which is a virtual Apostafie from it.
But there are several tendencies towards
this, which they who are guilty of, are
in some degree guilty of this Sin. As</p>
            <p>1. Indifferency in Religion, and want
of all sort of Concernment for it:
when a Man, tho he never quitted his
Religion, yet is so little concerned
for it, that a very small Occasion or
Temptation would make him do it; he
is contented to be reckoned in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those who profess it, so long as
it is the Fashion, and he finds no great
Inconvenience by it; but is so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in his Mind about it, (<hi>like</hi> Gallio,
<hi>who minded none of those things</hi>) that he
can turn himself into any other Shape,
when his Interest requires it; so that tho
he never actually deserted it, yet he is
2 kind of Apostate, in the preparation
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56284:180"/>
and disposition of his Mind: And to
such Persons, that Title which <hi>Solomon</hi>
gives to some, may fitly enough be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<hi>they are Backsliders in Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another tendency to this Sin, and
a great degree of it, is withdrawing
from the Publick Marks and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Profession of Religion, by
forsaking the Assemblies of Christians
for the Worship and Service of God;
to withdraw our selves from those, for
fear of Danger or Suffering, is a kind
of Denyal of our Religion. And this
was the case of some in the Apostles
time, when Persecution grew hot, and
the open Profession of Christianity dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
to avoid this Danger, many
appeared not in the Assemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
for fear of being observed and
brought into trouble for it. This the
Apostle taxeth some for, in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and speaketh of it as a letting go
our Profession, and a kind of deserting
of Christianity, v. 23, 35. <hi>Let us hold
fast the Profession of our Faith without
wavering, not forsaking the assembling of
our selves together, as the manner of some
is:</hi> He doth not say they had quitted
their Profession, but they had but a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56284:181"/>
loose hold of it, and were silently steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away from it.</p>
            <p>3. A light temper of Mind, which
easily receives Impressions from those
who lie in wait to deceive, and seduce
Men from the Truth. When Men are
not well rooted and established in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
they <hi>are apt to be inveigled by the
crafty Insinuations of Seducers, to be moved
with every wind of Doctrine, and to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
shaken in Mind,</hi> by every trifling piece
of Sophistry, that is confidently obtruded
upon them for a weighty Argument.</p>
            <p>Now this is a temper of Mind
which disposeth Men to Apostasie, and
renders them an easie Prey to every
one that takes a Pleasure and a Pride in
making Proselytes. It is true indeed,
a Man should always have a Mind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to entertain Truth, when it is fairly
proposed to him; but the main things
of Religion are so plainly revealed, and
lie so obvious to every ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that every Man may discern them;
and when he hath once entertained
them, ought to be stedfast and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable
in them, and not suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be whiffled out of them, by any
insignificant noise about the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Visible Church; much less
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56284:181"/>
ought he to be moved by any Man's
uncharitableness and positiveness, in
damning all that are not of his Mind.</p>
            <p>There are some things so very plain,
not only in Scripture, but to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason of Mankind, that no subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Discourse, no pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or even Infallibility of any
Church, ought to stagger us in the least
about them; as that we ought not,
or cannot believe any thing in direct
contradiction to Sense and Reason;
that the People ought to Read and
Study the Holy Scriptures, and to serve
God and pray to him in a Language
which they understand; that they
ought to receive the Sacrament as
our Saviour instituted and appointed
it, that is, in both kinds; that it can
neither be our Duty, nor Lawful to
do that which God hath forbidden;
as he hath done the Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Second Commandment, as
plainly as words can do it. Upon any
one of these Points, a Man would
fix his foot, and stand alone against
the whole World.</p>
            <p>4. Another Degree of Apostasie is,
a departure from the Purity of the
Christian Doctrine and Worship, in
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56284:182"/>
a gross and notorious manner. This is
a partial, tho not a total Apostasie from
the Christian Religion; and there have
been, and still are some in the World,
who are justly Charged with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Apostasie from Religion; namely
such, as tho they retain and profess the
Belief of all the Articles of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith, and Worship the only true
God, and him whom he hath sent, Jesus
Christ; yet have greatly perverted the
Christian Religion, by superinducing,
and adding new Articles of Faith, and
gross Corruptions, and Superstitions in
Worship, and imposing upon Men the
Belief and Practice of these, as necessary
to Salvation. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> is my War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for this Censure, who chargeth those
who added to the Christian Religion,
the Necessity of Circumcision, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and thereby
perverted the Gospel of Christ, as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in some degree of Apostasie from
Christianity; for he calls it, <hi>preaching
another Gospel, Gal. 1. 7, 8. There be
some that trouble you, and would pervert
the Gospel of Christ; but tho we, or an
Angel from Heaven, preach any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to you, than that which we have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let him be accursed.</hi> And those who
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56284:182"/>
were seduced by these Teachers, he
chargeth them with having in some
sort quitted the Gospel of Christ, and
embraced another Gospel, V. 6. <hi>I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that ye are so soon removed from him
that called you into the Grace of Christ,
unto another Gospel:</hi> So that they who
thus pervert and corrupt the Christian
Doctrine or Worship, are plainly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a partial Apostasie from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
and they who quit the purity
of the Christian Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and go over to the Communion
of those who have thus perverted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
are in a most dangerous state,
and in the Judgment of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are in
some sort <hi>removed unto another Gospel.</hi> I
shall now proceed, in the</p>
            <p>III. Place, to consider the Heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Sin. And it will appear
to be very Heinous, if we consider,
what an affront it is to God, and how
great a contempt of him; when God
hath revealed his will to Mankind,
and sent no less Person than his own
Son out of his own Bosom to do it,
and hath given such Testimonies to
him from Heaven, by <hi>signs and wonders,
and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56284:183"/>
Ghost;</hi> when he hath transmitted down to
us, so Faithful a Record of this Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of the Miracles wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, in the Books of the Holy Scriptures,
and when we our selves have so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
our firm belief of this Revelation;
yet after all this to fall from it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, or any part of it, or to embrace
Doctrines and Practices plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it: This certainly cannot be done
without the greatest affront and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Testimonies of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
for it is in effect, and by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to declare, that either we do
not believe what God says, or that we
do not fear what he can do. So St.
<hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Ep. 5. 10. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not God, hath made him a Lyar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he believeth not the record which God
hath given of his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all along in this Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Apostle sets himself to
aggravate this Sin; calling it <hi>an Evil
Heart of unbelief, to depart from the living
God, Ch.</hi> 3 12. And he frequently calls it
so, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, and by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as being of all Sins the greatest and
most heinous. <hi>Ch. 10. 26. If we sin
willfully, after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth.</hi> That the Apostle here
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56284:183"/>
speaks of the Sin of Apostasie, is plain
from the whole scope of his discourse;
for having exhorted them before, <hi>v.</hi> 23.
<hi>to hold fast the Profession of their Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering, not forsaking the assembling of
themselves together,</hi> he immediately adds,
<hi>for if we sin willfully, after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the knowledge of the Truth;</hi> that
is, if we fall off from Christianity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have embraced it. And, <hi>Ch.</hi> 12 1.
<hi>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
which so easily besets us;</hi> that is, the great
Sin of Apostasie from Religion; to which
they were then so strongly tempted by
that fierce Persecution which attended
it; and therefore he adds, <hi>let us run with
patience the race which is set before us;</hi>
that is, let us arm our selves with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
against the Sufferings we are
like to meet with in our Christian
course. To oppose the Truth, and resist
the clear Evidence of it, is a great Sin,
and Men are justly condemned for it.
<hi>John 3. 19. This is the condemnation, that
light is come into the World, and men loved
darkness rather than light.</hi> But to desert
the Truth, after we have been convinced
of it, to fall off from the Profession of
it, after we have embraced it; is a much
greater Sin. Opposition to the Truth,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56284:184"/>
may proceed in a great measure from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and prejudice, which is a great
extenuation; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells
us, that after all his violent Persecution
of Christianity, <hi>he found Mercy, because
he did it ignorantly and in unbelief.</hi> To
revolt from the Truth, after we have
made profession of it; <hi>after we have known
the way of righteousness, to turn from the
holy commandment;</hi> this is the great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation.
The Apostle makes wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
an usual ingredient into the Sin
of Apostasie, <hi>if we sin wilfully, after
we have received the knowledge of the
Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this Sin is one of the greatest
affronts to God, so it is the highest
and most effectual disparagement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for it is not so much considered,
what the Enemies of Religion speak
against it, <hi>because they speak evil of the
things which they know not,</hi> and of which
they have had no Tryal and Experience;
but he that falls off from Religion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath made profession of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to the World, that he hath try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and dislikes it; and pretends to
leave it, because he hath not found
that Truth and Goodness in it which
he expected; and upon long experience
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56284:184"/>
of it, sees reason to prefer another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
before it: So that nothing can be
more despiteful to Religion than this,
and more likely to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
and therefore the Apostle (<hi>v.</hi>
29. of this Chapter) calls it a <hi>trampling
under foot the Son of God, and making
the Blood of the Covenant a profane thing,
and offering despite to the Spirit of Grace:</hi>
for we cannot put a greater Scorn upon
the Son of God, who revealed this
Doctrine to the World; nor upon his
Blood, which was shed to confirm and
seal the Truth of it; and upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, who came down in miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Gifts, to give Testimony to it;
than notwithstanding all this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
this Doctrine, and to forsake
this Religion. But we shall yet farther
see the heinousness of this Sin, in the
terrible Punishment it exposeth Men
to; which was the</p>
            <p>IV. And <hi>Last</hi> thing I proposed to
consider. And this is represented to us
in a most terrible manner, not only
in this Epistle, but in other Places of
Scripture. This Sin is placed in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
rank of pardonable Sins, and next
to the Sin against the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56284:185"/>
which our Saviour declares to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unpardonable. And indeed the
Scripture speaks very doubtfully of the
pardonableness of this Sin, as being
near akin to that against the Holy
Ghost, being said to be an <hi>Offering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> In the <hi>6th</hi>
Chapter of this Epistle, V. 4, 5, 6. the
Apostle speaks in a very severe manner,
concerning the state of those, who had
apostatized from Christianity, after the
solemn Profession of it in Baptism, <hi>it
is impossible for those who were once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
(that is baptized) <hi>and have tasted of
the Heavenly Gift,</hi> (that is Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>and were made Partakers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of
God, and the Powers of the World to come,</hi>
(that is, have been instructed in the
Christan Religion, and endowed with
the miraculous Powers of the Gospel-Age,
(for the <hi>Jews</hi> used to call the Age
of the Messias, <hi>Seculum Futurum,</hi>
or the World to come) <hi>it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for those to be renewed again
unto repentance;</hi> where the least we
can understand, by <hi>impossible,</hi> is, that
it is extreamly difficult; for so the
word impossible is sometimes used; as
when our Saviour says, <hi>it is impossible
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56284:185"/>
for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven.</hi> And, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. 26. the Apostle
speaking of the same thing, says, <hi>if we
sin willfully, after we have received the
knowledge of the Truth, there remains no
more Sacrifice for sins;</hi> that is, they who
renounce Christianity, since they reject
the only way of expiation, <hi>there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no more Sacrifice for their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewise expresseth himself
very severely concerning this sort of
Persons, 2 <hi>Epist. 2. 20, 21. For if after
they have escaped the Pollutions of the
World, through the Knowledge of the Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ;</hi> (that is, after
they have been brought from Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism
to Christianity) <hi>they are entangled
therein again, and overcome; the latter end
is worse with them than the beginning.</hi>
He seems loth to say, how sad the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of such Persons is, but this he
tells them, that it is much worse than
when they were Heathens before; and
he gives the Reason, <hi>for it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them, not to have known the way
of Righteousness, than after they have known
it, to turn from the Holy Commandment
delivered unto them.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> calls
this Sin of Apostasie, the <hi>Sin vnto Death;</hi>
and tho he do not forbid Christians
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56284:186"/>
to pray for them that are guilty of it;
yet <hi>he will not say, that they should pray
for them. 1 Epist. 5. 16. If any Man see
his Brother sin a Sin, which is not unto
Death, he shall ask, and he shall give him
Life, for them that sin not unto Death;
there is a sin unto Death, I do not say,
that he shall pray for it.</hi> Now that by this
<hi>sin unto Death,</hi> the Apostle means A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
from the Christian Religion
to Idolatry, is most probable from what
follows, Verse 18. <hi>we know that whosoever
is born of God sinneth not,</hi> (that is this
Sin unto Death) <hi>but he that is begotten
of God keepeth himself, and the wicked one
toucheth him not,</hi> (that is, he is preserved
from Idolatry, unto which the Devil
had seduced so great a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
<hi>and we know that we are of God, and
the whole World,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>is
under the dominion of that wicked one;</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>
the Devil, whom the Scripture else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
calls <hi>the God of this World;) and
we know that the Son of God is come, and
hath given us an understanding, that we
may know him that is true,</hi> (that is, hath
brought us from the Worship of false
Gods, to the knowledge and Worship
of the true God) and then he concludes,
<hi>little Children, keep your selves from Idols;</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:56284:186"/>
which caution hath no manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon what went before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we understand <hi>the Sin unto Death,</hi>
in this Sense; and it is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that it is so to be understood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Apostasie is so often in this <hi>Epistle</hi>
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> called <hi>the Sin,</hi> by way
of Eminency, as it is here, by St. <hi>John,
whosoever is born of God sinneth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that at the very best, the Scripture
speaks doubtfully of the pardon of this
sin; however, that the punishment of
it, unrepented of, shall be very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It seems to be mildly exprest here
in the Text, <hi>If any man draw back, my
Soul shall have no pleasure in him:</hi> But
it is the more severe for being exprest
so mildly, according to the intention
of the Figure here used; and therefore
in the next words, this expression of
Gods taking no pleasure in such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
is explained by their utter Ruin
and Perdition; <hi>But we are not of them
that draw back unto Perdition.</hi> And in
several parts of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> there are
very severe passages to this purpose;
<hi>Ch. 2. 2, 3. If the word spoken by Angels,
was stedfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompence of
reward, how shall we escape, if we neglect
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56284:187"/>
so great salvation?</hi> And <hi>Ch. 10. 26, 27. If
we sin willfully, after we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no
more Sacrifice for sin; but a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
looking for of judgment, and fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
which shall devour the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
he that dispised Moses law, dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy, under two or three witnesses;
of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
shall he be thought worthy, that hath trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under foot the Son of God!</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For
we know him who hath said, Vengeance is
mine, I will recompence, saith the Lord:</hi>
And again, <hi>The Lord shall judge his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
it is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the living God.</hi> What can be
more severe and terrible than these
expressions?</p>
            <p>I will mention but one <hi>Text</hi> more,
and that is <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. where in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of great Sinners, those who
Apostatize from Religion, out of fear,
do lead the Van; <hi>He that overcometh
shall inherit all things,</hi> (which is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in this Book exprest, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<hi>faithful unto the Death.) He that
overcometh, shall inherit all things; and
I will be his God, and he shall be my
Son; but the fearful, and unbelieving,
and the abominable, and whoremongers,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56284:187"/>
and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyars,
shall have their part in the lake, which
burneth with fire and brimstone, which is
the second death. The fearful, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and lyars;</hi> that is, they who
out of fear relapse into infidelity, and
abide not in the Truth, shall be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the first rank of Offenders, and be
punished accordingly.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the
Four things I propounded to speak to,
from these words; the Nature of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie;
the several steps and degrees
of it; the heinous Nature of this Sin;
the danger of it, and the terrible punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in exposeth Men to.</p>
            <p>And is there any need now, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
men to hold fast the profession
of Faith, when the danger of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back is so evident, and so terrible?
or is there any reason and occasion for
it? Certainly there is no great danger
amongst us, of Mens Apostatizing from
Christianity, and turning <hi>Jews,</hi> or
<hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Heathens;</hi> I do not think
there is; but yet for all that, we are not
free from the danger of Apostasie; there
is great danger, not of Mens Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statizing
from one Religion to another,
but from Religion to Infidelity, and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56284:188"/>
Atheism; and of this worst kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
of all other, I wish the Age
we live in, had not afforded us too many
instances. It is greatly to be lamented,
that among those who have profest
Christianity, any should be found,
that should make it their endeavour
to undermine the great Principles of
all Religion; the Belief of a God,
and his Providence; and of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Souls of Men; and a
state of Rewards and Punishments after
this Life; and to bring the most serious
matters in the World into contempt,
and to turn them into jest and raillery;
this is not only a Renouncing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
the Religion which God hath
revealed, but even of the Religion
which is born with us, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Notions which God hath
planted in every Man's Mind; this
is an Impiety of the First Magnitude,
and not to be mentioned without grief
and horror; and this, it is to be feared,
hath had a great hand in those great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which our eyes have seen; and
I pray God, it do not draw down still
more and greater Judgments upon this
Nation: But I hope there are none
here that need to be cautioned against
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56284:188"/>
this horrible impiety, and highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Apostasie from the living God;
that which People are much more in
danger of, is Apostasie from the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Christian Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
so happily recovered by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Reformation, and establisht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, by all the Authority that
Laws, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, can
give it; and which in Truth is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Ancient and Primitive
Christianity; I say, a defection from
this, to those gross Errors and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,
which the Reformation had
paired off, and freed us from. I do
not say, that this is a total Apostasie
from Christianity; but it is a partial
Apostasie and Defection, and a very
dangerous one; and <hi>that those, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have received the knowledge of the
truth, fall off from it,</hi> into those Errors
and Corruptions, are highely guilty
before God, and their condition cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
worse, and more dangerous,
than of those who where brought up
in those Errors and Superstitions, and
never knew better; for there are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
threatnings in Scripture against
those, who fall away from the Truth,
which they once embraced, and were
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56284:189"/>
convinced of; <hi>If we sin wilfully, after we
have received the knowledge of the truth,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>and if any man draw back, my soul shall
have no pleasure in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God considers every Man's Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and Opportunities of Knowledge,
and their Disadvantages likewise, and
makes all reasonable Allowances for
them; and for Men to continue in the
Errors they have been always brought
up in; or, which comes much to one,
in Errors which they were led into by
Principles early infused into them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were in any measure compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judges of those matters; I say, for
such Persons to continue in these Errors,
and to oppose and reject the contrary
Truths, against which, by their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they have received so strong and
violent a Prejudice, this may be in a
great degree excusable, and find Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
with God, upon a general Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for all Sins, both known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;
and cannot be reasonably char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the Guilt of this great Sin of
Apostasie. But not to abide in the Truth,
after we have entertain'd and profess'd
it, having sufficient Means and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of knowing it, hath no Excuse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:56284:189"/>
I would not be rash in condemning
Particular Persons of any Society or
Communion of Christians, provided
they be sincerely devout, and just, and
sober, to the best of their Knowledge: I
had much rather leave them to God,
<hi>whose mercies are great,</hi> than to pass an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Censure upon them, as to their
Eternal State and Condition: But the
Case is far otherwise, where the Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of Knowledge are afforded to
Men, and <hi>men love darkness rather than
light;</hi> for they who have the Means and
Advantages <hi>of knowing their Master's will,</hi>
are answerable to God, as if they had
known it; because if they had not been
grosly negligent, and wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they might have known it.</p>
            <p>And this I fear is the Case of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of those, who have been bred
up to years of Consideration and Choice
in the Reformed Religion, and forsake
it; because they do it without sufficient
Reason, and there are invincible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against it: They do it without
sufficient Reason; because every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us knows, or may know, upon
very little Enquiry, that we hold all
the Articles of the Faith, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Ancient Creeds of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56284:190"/>
Church, and into which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are baptized; that we inculcate
upon Men the Necessity of a Good Life,
and of sincere Repentance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Contrition for our Sins, such as is
follow'd with real Reformation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of our Lives; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, no Man can be saved by any
Device whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Now what Reason can any Man
have, to question whether he may be
saved in that Faith which saved the
first Christians, and by believing the
Twelve Articles of the Apostles Creed,
tho he cannot swallow the Twelve Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which are added to it in the Creed
of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. every one of which,
besides many and great Corruptions
and Superstitions in Worship, are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and invincible Objections against the
Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as I
could particularly shew, if it had not
been already done, in so many learned
Treatises upon this Argument. What
is there then, that should move any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Man to forsake the Communion
of our Church, and to quit the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:56284:190"/>
There are Three things chiefly with
which they endeavour to amuse and
affright weaker Minds.</p>
            <p>1. A great Noise of Infallibility, which
they tell us, is so excellent a means to
determine and put an end to all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
To which I shall at present
only object this Prejudice; That there
are not wider and hotter Differences
among us, about any thing whatsoever,
than are amongst them about this
admirable means of ending all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as, where this Infallibility is feated,
that Men may know how to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to it, for the ending of Differences.</p>
            <p>2. They endeavour to fright Men
with the danger of Schism. But every
Man knows, that the Guilt of Schism
lies at their Door, who impose sinful
Articles of Communion; and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, who for fear of sinning
against God, cannot submit to those
Articles; which we have done, and are
still ready to make good, to be the
Case betwixt us and the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>3. The terrible Engine of all, is, their
positive and confident damning of all
that live and die out of the Communion
of their Church. This I have fully spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:56284:191"/>
to upon another Occasion, and
therefore shall only say at present, that
every Man ought to have better
Thoughts of God, than to believe, that
he, <hi>who delighteh not in the death of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and would have all men to be saved
and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi>
will confirm the Sentence of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Men, as take upon them to
condemn Men for those things, for
which our Saviour in his Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
no Man. And of all things in
the World, one would think, that the
Uncharitableness of any Church, should
be an Argument to no Man, to run into
its Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall conclude with the Apostle's
Exhortation,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>of this Chapter,</hi>
Let us hold fast the profession of our Faith
without wavering, and provoke one another
to charity and good works; and so much
the more, because the Day approacheth, in
which God will judge the faith and lives of
men, by Jesus Christ, according to his
Gospel.</p>

<bibl>MATTH. XVI. 24.</bibl>
            </head>
            <q>Then said Jesus unto his Disciples,
If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his
Cross and follow me.</q>
            <p>THEN <hi>said Jesus to his Disciples,</hi>
That is, upon Occasion of his
former Discourse with them,
wherein he had acquainted them with
his approaching Passion, that he must
shortly go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and there
suffer many things of the Elders and Chief
Priests and Scribes, and at last be put to
Death by them; <hi>then said Jesus unto his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
If any man will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his Cross, and follow
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:56284:192"/>
               <hi>If any man will come after me, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me;</hi> that is, If any man will be my
Disciple, and undertake the Profession
of my Religion; If any man chuse and
resolve to be a Christian; he must be
so upon these Terms; he must <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and take up his Cross and follow me:</hi>
He must follow me in Self-denyal and
Suffering.</p>
            <p>In the handling of these Words, I
shall do these Four things.</p>
            <p>I. I shall consider the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
which our Saviour useth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Proselytes, and gaining Men over
to his Religion: He offers no manner of
Force and Violence to compel them to
the Profession of his Religion; but fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offers it to their Consideration and
Choice, and tells them plainly upon
what terms they must be his Disciples;
and if they be contented and resolved to
submit to these Terms, well; if not,
it is in vain to follow him any longer;
<hi>for they cannot be his Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. I shall endeavour to explain this
Duty of Self-denyal, exprest in these
Words, <hi>Let him deny himself, and take
up his Cross and follow me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:56284:192"/>
III. I shall consider the strict and
indispensible Obligation of it, whenever
we are call'd to it, <hi>Without this we
cannot be Christ's Disciples; if any man
will come after me, or be my Disciple, let
him deny himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. I shall endeavour to vindicate
the reasonableness of this Precept, of
self-denial and suffering for Christ,
which at first appearance may seem
to be so very harsh and difficult; and
I shall go over these Particulars as
briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>I. We will consider the way and
method which our Saviour here useth in
making Proselytes, and gaining men
over to his Religion; he offers no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of force and violence to compel men
to the profession of his Religion, but
fairly proposeth it to their Consideration
and Choice, telling them plainly upon
what terms they must be his Disciples;
if they like them, and are content, and
resolved to submit to them, well; he is
willing to receive them, and own them
for his Disciples; if not, it is in vain to
follow him any longer: For <hi>they cannot
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56284:193"/>
be his Disciples.</hi> As on the one hand, he
offers them no worldly Preferment and
Advantage, to entice them into his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to tempt them outwardly
to profess what they do not inwardly
believe; so on the other hand, he does
not hale and drag them by force, and
awe them by the terrours of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and death to sign the Christian
Faith, tho' most undoubtedly true; and
to confess with their mouths, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
with their hands, what they do
not believe in their hearts. He did not
obtrude his Sacraments upon them, and
plunge them into the water to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
them, whether they would or no,
and thrust the Sacrament of Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their mouths; as if men might be
Worthy Receivers of that Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
whether they receive it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
or no.</p>
            <p>Our Blessed Saviour, the Author and
Founder of our Religion, made use of
none of these ways of violence, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the nature of man, and of all
Religion, and especially of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and fitted only to make men Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
but not Converts; he only
says, <hi>If any man will be my Disciple;</hi> he
useth no Arguments, but such as are
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56284:193"/>
Spiritual, and proper to work upon
the Minds and Consciences of Men:
For as his <hi>Kingdom was not of this
world,</hi> so neither are the Motives and
Arguments to induce Men to be his
subjects, taken from this world; but
from the endless Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of another. The weapons which
he made use of, to subdue Men to the
obedience of Faith, are not <hi>carnal;</hi> and
yet they were <hi>mighty through God,</hi> to
conquer the obstinacy and infidelity
of men. This great and infallible
Teacher, who certainly came from
God, all that he does, is to propose
his Religion to Men, with such Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and such Arguments, as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to convince Men of the Truth
and Goodness of it; and to perswade
Men to embrace it; and he acquaints
them likewise with all the worldly
Disadvantages of it, and the hazards
and sufferings that would attend it;
and now, if upon full consideration,
they will make his Religion their free
Choice, and become his Disciples, he is
willing to receive them; if they will
not, he understands the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
better, than to go about to force
it upon Men, whether they will or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:56284:194"/>
II. I shall endeavour to explain
this Duty or Precept of self-denial, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in these words, <hi>Let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and take up his cross.</hi> These are
difficult Terms; for a Man <hi>to deny
himself,</hi> and <hi>take up his own Cross;</hi> that
is, willingly to submit to all those
Sufferings which the malice of Men
may inflict for the sake of Christ and
his Religion. For this Expression, of
<hi>taking up one's Cross,</hi> is a plain Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Custom, which was
this; That he that was condemned to
be Crucified, was to take his Cross
upon his Shoulders, and to carry it to
the place of Execution; this the <hi>Jews</hi>
made our Saviour to do, as we read,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 17. till that being ready to
faint under it and lest he should die
away before he was nailed to the Cross,
they compelled <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it for him, as is declar'd by the other
Evangelists; and yet he tells them,
<hi>they that will be his Disciples must
follow him, bearing their own Cross;</hi>
that is, being ready (if God call them
to it) to submit to the like sufferings for
Him and his Truth, which he was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undergo for the Truth, and for their
sakes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:56284:194"/>
But tho these terms seem very hard;
yet they are not unreasonable; as I shall
shew in the conclusion of this Discourse.
Some indeed have made them so by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
this self-denyal too far, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more to the latitude of the Words,
than to the meaning and scope of our
Saviour's Discourse: For there is no
doubt, but that there are a great many
things, which may properly enough
be called self-denyal, which yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
never intended to oblige Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to. It is, no doubt, great self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
for a Man, without any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
to deny himself the necessary
Supports of Life, for a Man to starve
and make away himself. But no Man
certainly ever imagined, that our Saviour
ever intended by this Precept, to enjoyn
this kind of self-denyal.</p>
            <p>It is plain then, that there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
nor Necessity to extend this Precept
of our Saviour, concerning self-denyal,
to every thing that may properly
enough be called by that name; and
therefore this Precept must be limited
by the plain scope and intendment of our
Saviour's Discourse; and no Man can
argue thus; <hi>such a thing is self-denyal,
therefore our Saviour requires it of his
Disciples:</hi> For our Saviour doth not
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56284:195"/>
here require all kinds of self-denyal; but
limits it, by his Discourse, to one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
kind, beyond which, self-denyal is
no Duty by virtue of this Text; and
therefore, for our clearer understanding
of this Precept of self-denyal, I shall
do these two things:</p>
            <p>1. Remove some sorts of self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
which are instanced in by some, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this Precept.</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew what kind of self-denyal
that is, which our Saviour here
intends.</p>
            <p>1. There are several things brought
under this Precept of self-denyal, which
were never intended by our Saviour.
I shall instance in Two or Three things,
which are most frequently insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and some of them by very devout
and well-meaning Men; as, that in
matters of Faith, We should deny and
renounce our own Senses and our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
nay, that we should be content to
renounce our own Eternal Happiness,
and be willing to be damned for the
Glory of God and the Good of our
Brethren: But all these are so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
and grosly unreasonable, that
it is a Wonder that any one should ever
take them for Instances of that self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal
which our Saviour requires; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56284:195"/>
considering, that in all his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of self-denyal, he does not so
much as glance at any of these Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or any thing like to them.</p>
            <p>1. Some comprehend under self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,
the denying and renouncing our
own Senses in matters of Faith: and if
this could be made out to be intended
by our Saviour in this Precept, we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not dispute any of the other Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For he that renounceth the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sense, so as not to believe what
he sees, may after this renounce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any thing. For the Evidence of Sense
is more clear and unquestionable than
that of Faith; as the Scripture frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intimates; as <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. where our
Saviour reproves <hi>Thomas,</hi> for refusing
to believe his Resurrection, upon any
less Evidence than that of Sense; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast seen, thou hast believed:
Blessed are they wich have not seen, and yet
have believed.</hi> Which plainly supposeth
the Evidence of Sense to be the highest
and clearest degree of Evidence. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that of St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 5. 7. We
walk by Faith, and not by Sight:</hi> Where
the Evidence of Faith, as that which is
more imperfect and obscure, is opposed
to that of Sight, as more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56284:196"/>
So that to believe any Article of
Faith, in contradiction to the clear
Evidence of Sense, is contrary to the
very Nature of Assent; which always
yields to the greatest and clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Besides that, our Belief of Religion
is <hi>at last</hi> resolved into the certainty of
Sense; so that by renouncing <hi>that,</hi> we
destroy and undermine the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our Faith. One of the plainest
and principal Proofs of the Being of
God (which is the first and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Article of all Religion) relies upon
the certainty of Sense; namely, the
Frame of this visible World; by the
Contemplation whereof, we are led to
the acknowledgment of the invisible
Author of it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
20. <hi>That the invisible things of God, from
the Creation of the World, are clearly seen,
being understood by the things which are
made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the great external Evidence of
the Christian Religion, I mean Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
is at last resolved into the certainty
of Sense, without which, we can have
no assurance that any Miracle was
wrought for the confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>And the knowledge likewise of the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56284:196"/>
Christian Faith, is conveyed to us
by our Senses; the Evidence whereof,
if it be uncertain, takes away all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Faith. <hi>How shall they believe,</hi>
(saith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. 14.) <hi>How shall
they believe in him, of whom they have not
Heard?</hi> And ver. 17. <hi>So then Faith
cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word
of God.</hi> So that to deny and renounce
our Senses in matters of Faith, is to
take away the main Pillar and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</p>
            <p>2. Others, almost with equal absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
would comprehend under our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Precept of Self-denial, the denying
and renouncing of our Reason in matters
of Faith: and this is Self-denial with a
witness, for a Man to deny his own
reason; for it is to deny himself to be
a Man. This surely is a very great
mistake, and tho the ground of it may
be innocent; yet the consequence of it,
and the Discourses upon it, are very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.</p>
            <p>The Ground of the mistake is this,
Men think they deny their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when they assent to the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God in such things, as their
own Reason could neither have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
nor is able to give the reason of:
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56284:197"/>
whereas in this case, a Man is so far
from denying his own Reason, that he
does that which is most agreeable to it.
For what more reasonable than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
whatever we are sufficiently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
is revealed to us by God, who
can neither be deceived himself, nor
deceive us?</p>
            <p>But tho' the Ground of this mistake
may be innocent, yet the Consequences
of it are most absurd and dangerous. For
if we are to renounce our Reason in
matters of Faith, then are we bound
to believe without Reason, which no
Man can do; or if he could, then
Faith would be unreasonable, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
reasonable. So that this Instance
likewise of Self-denial, to renounce and
deny our own Reason, as it is no where
exprest, so it cannot reasonably be
thought to be intended by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in this Precept.</p>
            <p>3. Nor doth this Precept of
Self-denial require Men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to renounce their own Eternal
Happiness, and to be willing to be
Damned for the Glory of God, and
the good of their Brethren. If this
were the meaning of this Precept, we
might justly say, as the Disciples did
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56284:197"/>
to our Saviour, in another Case, <hi>This
is a hard saying, and who can hear it?</hi>
The very thought of this, is enough
to make Humane Nature to tremble
at its very foundation. For the deepest
Principle that God hath planted in
our Nature, is <hi>the desire of our own
Preservation and Happiness;</hi> and into
this the Force of all Laws, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all our Duty is at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
            <p>From whence it plainly follows,
that it can be no Man's Duty in any
case to renounce his own Happiness,
and to be content to be for Ever Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;
because if once this be made a
Duty, there will be no Argument left,
to perswade any Man to it. For the
most powerful Arguments, that God
ever used, to perswade Men to any
thing, are the Promise of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and the Terrour of Everlasting
Torments: But if this were a Man's
Duty, to be content to be Miserable
for Ever, neither of these Arguments
would be of force sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
a Man to it.</p>
            <p>The first of these, namely the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Eternal Happiness, could si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
nothing to him that is to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:56284:198"/>
Miserable; because if he be to be
so, it is impossible that he should ever
have the benefit of that Promise: and the
threatning of Eternal Misery, could be
no Argument in this Case; because the
Duty is just as difficult, as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is powerful, and no Man can be
moved to submit to any thing that
is grievous and terrible, but by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is more terrible; for if it
be not, it is the same thing, whether
he submit to it, or not; and then no
Man can be content, to be Eternally
Miserable, only for the fear of being
so; for this would be for a Man to run
himself upon that very inconvenience
which he is so much afraid of; and
'tis madness for a Man to die for fear
of death. <hi>Quis novus hic furor est, ne
moriare, mori?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this it plainly appears, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
it is to imagin, that by this
Precept of Self-denial, our Saviour should
require Men to renounce Everlasting
Happiness, and to be content to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
for Ever, upon any account
whatsoever; because this were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that God hath imposed that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us as a Duty, to oblige us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
there can be no Argument offer'd,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56284:198"/>
that can be powerful enough. As
for the Glory of God, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the Reason, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
Supposition; because it cannot
be for the Glory of God, to make a
Creature for Ever Miserable, that shall
not by his Wilful Obstinacy and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
deserve to be so.</p>
            <p>But this is only cast in to add weight.
The other Reason of the Good and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our Brethren, is the only
Consideration for which there is any
manner of colour from Scripture;
and two Instances are alledged to this
purpose, of two very Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that seem to have desired this,
and to have submitted to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not so unreasonable as we
would make it, that our Saviour should
enjoyn it as a Duty. The Instances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
are these. <hi>Moses</hi> desired of God
that he might be blotted out of the
Book of Life, rather than the People
of <hi>Israel,</hi> whom he had Conducted and
Governed so long, should be destroyed:
And in the New Testament St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, <hi>That he could wish, that himself
were accursed from Christ, for his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
so earnest a desire had he of their
Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:56284:199"/>
But neither of these Instances are
of force sufficient to overthrow the
Reasons of my former Discourse; for
the desire of <hi>Moses</hi> amounts only to a
submission to a Temporal death, that
his Nation might be saved from a
Temporal ruin.</p>
            <p>For the Expression <hi>of blotting out of
the Book of Life,</hi> is of the same impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with those Phrases so frequently
used in the Old Testament, of <hi>blotting
out from the face of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out one's name from under Heaven;</hi>
which signifie no more than Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
death and destruction; and then
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Wish was reasonable and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and signifies no more, but that he
was willing, if God pleased, to die to
save the Nation.</p>
            <p>As for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Wish, of <hi>being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
from Christ,</hi> it is plainly an
Hyperbolical Expression of his great
Affection to his Country-men the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and his Zeal for their Salvation, which
was so great, that if it had been a thing
reasonable and lawful, he could have
wisht the greatest Evil to himself for
their sakes; and therefore it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it is not a positive and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
wish, but exprest in the usual form
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56284:199"/>
of ushering in an Hyperbole; <hi>I could
wish,</hi> just as we are wont to say, when
we would express a thing to the hight,
which is not fit, nor intended to be
done by us; <hi>I could wish so or so; I
could even afford to do this or that;</hi>
which kind of speeches, no Man takes
for a strict and precise Declaration of
our minds, but for a figurative expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a great Passion.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the
<hi>first thing</hi> I proposed for the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of this Precept, or Duty of Self-denial;
which was to remove some
sorts of Self-denial, which by some are
frequently instanced in, as intended by
our Saviour in this Precept. I proceed
now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing I proposed; which is to
declare positively, what that Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
is, which our Saviour here intends;
and 'tis plainly this, and nothing but
this; that we should be willing to part
with all Earthly Comforts and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
to quit all our Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
and Enjoyments, and even Life
it self, for the sake of Christ and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
This our Saviour means, by <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves;</hi> and then (which is much
the same with the other) that we should
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56284:200"/>
be willing to bear any Temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
and suffering, upon the
same account. This is <hi>to take up our
Cross and follow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the full meaning of
these two Phrases, <hi>of denying our selves,</hi>
and <hi>taking up our Cross,</hi> will clearly
appear, by considering the particular
Instances, which our Saviour gives of
this Self-denyal, when ever he hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of it; by which you will
plainly see, that these expressions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to no more than I have said.
Even here in the <hi>Text,</hi> after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
had told his Disciples, that <hi>he
that would come after him, must deny
himself, and take up his Cross;</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
immediately, <hi>for whosoever will save
his life shall lose it, and whosoever will
lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</hi> You
see here, that he instanceth in parting
with our lives for him, as the highest
piece of Self-denyal, which he requires.
And he himself elsewhere tells us, that
<hi>greater love than this hath no man, than
that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi>
Elsewhere he instanceth in quitting our
nearest Relations for his sake; <hi>Luke</hi> 14.
26, 27. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate
not his father, and mother, and wife, and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56284:200"/>
children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and
his own life also, he cannot be my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and whosoever doth not bear his Cross
and come after me, he cannot be my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which expressions, <hi>of hating Father,
and Mother, and other Relations, and
even Life it self,</hi> are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Rigorously, and in an absolute
Sense, but Comparatively; for it is an
<hi>Hebrew</hi> manner of speech, to express
that Absolutely, which is meant only
Comparatively; and so our Saviour
explains himself, in a parallel <hi>Text</hi> to
this; <hi>Matth. 10. 37, 38. He that loveth
father or mother, more than me, is not
worthy of me: he that loveth son or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
more than me, is not worthy of me:
And he that taketh not his Cross, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, our Saviour instanceth in
quitting our Estates for his sake, <hi>Matth.</hi>
19. 29. <hi>Every one that shall forsake houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, or lands, for my names
sake;</hi> by all which it appears, that this
Self-denyal which our Saviour here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of his Disciples, is to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no farther, than to a readiness and
willingness, when ever God shall call us
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56284:201"/>
to it, to quit all our Temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and Enjoyments, and even Life it
self, (the dearest of all other) and to
submit to any Temporal inconvenience
and suffering for his sake. And thus
much for the Explication of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
here in the <hi>Text.</hi> I proceed in
the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Place, to consider the strict and
indispensible Obligation of this Precept
of Self-denyal, and suffering for Christ,
and his Truth, rather than to forsake
and renounce them. <hi>If any man will come
after me, or be my Disciple, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and take up his Cross and follow me;</hi>
that is, upon these Terms, he must be
my Disciple, in this manner he must
follow me; and in the <hi>Text</hi> I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
before, he declares again, that
he that is not ready to quit all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and even Life it self, for his sake,
<hi>is not worthy of him,</hi> and <hi>cannot be his
Disciple;</hi> and <hi>whosoever doth not bear his
Cross, and come after me, cannot be my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple;</hi>
so that we cannot be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
of Christ, nor be worthy to be
called by his Name; if we be not ready
thus to deny our selves for his sake:
And not only so; but if for fear of
the Cross, or of any temporal sufferings,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56284:201"/>
we should renounce, and deny him; he
threatens <hi>to deny us before his Father which
is in Heaven, (i. e.)</hi> to deprive us of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life, and to Sentence us to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Misery. <hi>Matth. 10. 32. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall confess me before men, him will
I confess before my father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
But whosoever shall deny me before
men, him will I also deny before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven:</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> 8.
38. <hi>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and
of my words, in this adulterous and sinful
generation, of him also shall the Son of Man
be ashamed, when he cometh in the Glory
of his Father, with his holy Angels;</hi> that
is, when he cometh to Judge the
World, they shall not be able to stand
in that Judgment; for that by his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ashamed of them,</hi> is meant, that
they shall be condemned by him, is
plain from what goes before, V. 26, 27.
<hi>What shall it profit a man, if he shall
gain the whole World, and lose his own
Soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
for his Soul?</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
therefore shall be ashamed of me and
of my words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because some have had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to tell the World, that our
Saviour doth not require thus much
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56284:202"/>
of Christians; but all that he obligeth
us to, is to believe in him in our Hearts,
but not to make any outward Profession
of his Religion, when the Magistrate
forbids it, and we are in danger of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for it: I shall therefore briefly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what is pretended for so strange
an Assertion, and so directly contrary to
the whole Tenor of the Gospel, and to
the express Words of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Book called the
<hi>Leviathan,</hi> tells us, That we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not bound to confess Christ, but we
are obliged to deny him, in case the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
require us so to do. His Words
are these: <hi>What if the Soveraign forbid
us to believe in Christ?</hi> He answers, <hi>Such
forbidding is of no effect, because Belief and
Vnbelief never follows Mens Commands.
But what</hi> (says he) <hi>if we be commanded
by our lawful Prince to say with our Tongues,
we believe not; must we obey such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?</hi>
To this he answers, <hi>That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
with the Tongue is but an External
thing, and no more than any other Gesture,
whereby we signifie our Obedience, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Christian, holding firmly in his Heart
the Faith of Christ, hath the same Liberty
which the Prophet</hi> Elisha <hi>allowed to</hi> Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<hi>But what then</hi> (says he) <hi>shall I
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56284:202"/>
answer to our Saviour, saying,</hi> Whosoever
denieth me before Men, him will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
before my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
His Answer is, <hi>This we may say,
that whatsoever a Subject is compell'd to in
obedience to his Soveraign, and does it not
in order to his own Mind, but the Law of his
Country, the Action is not his, but his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign's;
nor is it he that in this Case de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
Christ before Men, but his Governour,
and the Laws of his Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But can any Man, that in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pays any degree of Reverence to
our Blessed Saviour and his Religion,
think to baffle such plain Words by so
frivolous an Answer? There is no Man
doubts, but if the Magistrate should
command Men to deny Christ, he would
be guilty of a great Sin in so doing;
but if <hi>we must obey God rather than Men,</hi>
and every Man must <hi>give an account of
himself to God;</hi> how will this excuse him
that denies Christ, or breaks any other
Commandment of God, upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Magistrate? And to put
the matter out of all doubt, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
forbids all that will be his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
upon pain of Damnation, to deny
him, tho the Magistrate should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56284:203"/>
them to do so, it is very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that in that very place, where he
speaks of confessing or denying him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Men, he puts this very Case, of
their being brought before Kings and
Governours for confessing him, <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 17. <hi>Beware</hi> (says he) <hi>of Men, for they
will deliver you up to the Council, and they
will scourge you in their Synagogues; and
ye shall be brought before Governours and
Kings for my sake, for a testimony against
them and the Gentiles.</hi> But what Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
would this be against them, if
Christians were bound to deny Christ
at their Command?</p>
            <p>But our Saviour goes on, and tells
them how they ought to demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
when they were brought before
Kings and Governours, <hi>v. 19. But when
they shall deliver you up, take ye no thought,
how, or what ye shall speak; for it shall be
given you in that very hour what ye shall
speak.</hi> But what need of any such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Assistance in the case, if they
had nothing to do, but to deny him,
when they were required by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to do it? And then (proceeding
in the same Discourse) he bids them, <hi>v.</hi>
28. <hi>Not to fear them that can kill the Body,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:56284:203"/>
and after that have no more that they can do;</hi>
that is, not to deny him, for fear of any
Temporal Punishment or Suffering the
Magistrate could inflict upon them;
<hi>but to fear and obey him, who can destroy
Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> And upon this
Discourse our Saviour concludes, <hi>v.</hi> 32,
33. <hi>Whosoever therefore shall confess me
before men, him will I confess also before my
Father which is in Heaven; but whosoever
shall deny me before men, him will I also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
And now can any thing be plainer, than
that our Saviour requires his Disciples
to make Confession of him before Kings
and Governours, and not to deny him
for fear of any thing which they can do
to them? But let us enquire a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and see how the Apostles, who
received this Precept from our Saviour
himself, did understand it. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 14.
we find <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> summoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jewish Magistrates, <hi>who strictly
commanded them, not to speak at all, nor
teach in the Name of Jesus. But Peter
and John answered and said unto them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be right in the sight of God, to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
unto you, more than unto God, judge ye.</hi>
And when they still persisted in their
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56284:204"/>
course, notwithstanding the Command
of the Magistrate, and were called
again before the Council, <hi>Ch.</hi> 5. 28.
<hi>And the High Priest asked them, saying,
Did we not straitly command you, that you
should not teach in this Name? and behold,
ye have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine:</hi>
They return them again the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>v. 29. Then Peter and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
answered and said, We ought to obey
God rather than men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let any Man now judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Saviour did not oblige Men to
confess him even before Magistrates, and
to obey him rather than Men. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
how can any Man in reason think,
that the great King and Governour of
the World should invest any Man with
a Power to control his Authority, and
to oblige Men to disobey and renounce
him, <hi>by whom Kings reign, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
judgment?</hi> This is a thing so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that it can hardly be imagined,
that any thing but down-right Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against God and Religion could
prompt any Man to advance such an
Assertion.</p>
            <p>I should now have proceeded to the
<hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> Particular, which I
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56284:204"/>
proposed to speak to; namely, To vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the reasonableness of this Precept
of Self-denial and Suffering for Christ,
which at first Appearance may seem to
be so very harsh and difficult. But this,
together with the Application of this
Discourse, shall be reserved to another
Oportunity.</p>

            <q>Then said Jesus unto his Disciples,
If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his
Cross and follow me.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>THEN said Jesus unto his Disciples;</hi>
that is, upon Occasion of his
former Discourse with them,
concerning his approaching Passion, and
that he must shortly go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and there suffer many things of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Chief Priests and Scribes, and at
last be put to Death by them; <hi>Then said
Jesus unto his Disciples, If any man will come
after me;</hi> that is, If any Man will be
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56284:206"/>
my Disciple, and undertake the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of my Religion, he must do it
upon these Terms of Self-denial and
Suffering.</p>
            <p>In the handling of these Words, I
proceeded in this Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I considered the way which
our Saviour here useth in making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
and gaining Men over to his
Religion. He offers no manner of Force
and Violence to compel Men to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of it, but fairly proposeth it to
their Consideration and Choice; telling
them plainly upon what Terms they
must be his Disciples; if they like them,
and be resolved to submit to them, well;
if not, 'tis in vain to follow him any
longer; <hi>for they cannot be his Disciples.</hi>
And to use any other way than this to
gain Men over to Religion, is contrary
both to the Nature of Man, who is a
Reasonable Creature; and to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Religion, which, if it be not
our Free Choice, cannot be Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I explained his Duty or
Precept of Self-denial, express'd in these
Words, <hi>Let him deny himself, and take up
his Cross;</hi> which Phrase, <hi>of taking up one's
Cross,</hi> is an Allusion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
which was, That the Malefactor
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56284:206"/>
that was to be Crucified, was to take
up his Cross upon his Shoulders, and
to carry it to the Place of Execution.</p>
            <p>Now for our clearer understanding
of this Precept of Self-denial, I told you,
that it is not to be extended to every
thing that may properly be call'd by
that Name, but to be limited by the
plain Scope and Intendment of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Discourse; and therefore I did
in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> Place remove several things
which are instanced in by some, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and required by this Precept.
As,</p>
            <p>1. That we should deny and renounce
our own Sense in matters of Faith. But
this I shewed to be absurd and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
because if we do not believe what
we see, or will believe contrary to what
we see, we destroy all Certainty, there
being no greater than that of Sense:
Besides, that the Evidence of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
less clear and certain than that of
Sense, it is contrary to the Nature of
Assent, which is always sway'd and born
down by the greatest and clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
So that we cannot assent to any
thing in plain Contradiction to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:56284:207"/>
2. Others would comprehend under
this Precept, the denying of our Reason
in matters of Faith; which is in the next
degree of Absurdity to the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no Man can believe any thing,
but upon some Reason or other; and to
believe without any Reason, or against
Reason, is to make Faith unreasonable,
and Infidelity reasonable.</p>
            <p>3. Others pretend, that by virtue of
this Precept, Men ought to be content
to renounce their own Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to be Miserable for Ever, for
the Glory of God, and the Salvation of
their Brethren. But this I shewed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a Duty, for this plain Reason;
because if it were, there is no Argument
left powerful enough to perswade a Man
to it. And as for the two Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
alledged to this purpose; <hi>Moses</hi>
his Wish, of being <hi>blotted out of the Book
of Life</hi> for the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> signifies
no more than a Temporal Death; and
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, of being <hi>accursed from Christ
for his Brethren,</hi> is only an hyperbolical
Expression of his great Passion and Zeal
for the Salvation of his Country-men;
as is evident from the Form of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
such as is commonly used to
usher in an Hyperbole; <hi>I could wish.</hi> And
in the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:56284:207"/>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place, I shewed positively,
That the plain meaning of this Precept
of Self-denial is this, and nothing but
this; That we should be willing to part
with all our Temporal Interests and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
and even Life it self, for the
sake of Christ and his Religion. This
is <hi>to deny our selves.</hi> And then, that
we should be willing to bear any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inconvenience and Suffering upon
the same Account. This is <hi>to take up our
Cross.</hi> And this I shewed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which our Saviour gives of Self-denial,
whenever he had occasion to
discourse of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I considered the strict and
indispensable Obligation of this Precept
of Self-denial, rather than to forsake
Christ and his Religion. Without this
Disposition and Resolution of Mind we
cannot be his Disciples; <hi>And if we deny
him before Men; he will also deny us before
his Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And this
Confession of Him and his Truth we are
to make before Kings and Governours,
and notwithstanding their Commands
to the contrary, which are of no Force
against the Laws and Commands of
God.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have gone. There remains
only the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:56284:208"/>
IV. And <hi>Last</hi> Particular, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to speak to; <hi>viz.</hi> To vindicate the
Reasonableness of this Self-denial and
Suffering for Christ, which at first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
may seem to be so very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
And this Precept cannot be thought
unreasonable, if we take into Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
these <hi>Three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>I. That He who requires this of us,
hath Himself given us the greatest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Self-denial that ever was. The
greatest in it self, in that he denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more, and suffered more grievous
things, than it is possible for any of us
to do: And such an Example, as in the
Circumstances of it, is most apt and
powerful to engage and oblige us to the
imitation of it; because all his Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
and Sufferings were for our sakes.</p>
            <p>II. If we cosider, That he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
all needful Supplies of his Grace,
to enable us to the Discharge of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Duty of Self-denial and Suffering,
and to support and comfort us therein.</p>
            <p>III. He hath assured us of a Glorious
Reward of all our Sufferings and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
beyond the Proportion of them,
both in the Degree and Duration of it.
I shall go over these as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:56284:208"/>
I. If we consider, That He who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
us thus to deny our selves for
him, hath given us the greatest Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Self-denyal that ever was. Our
Saviour knowing how unwelcome this
Doctrine of Self-denyal and Suffering
must needs be to his Disciples, and how
hardly this Precept would go down
with them; to sweeten it a little, and
take off the harshness of it, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their Minds the better for it, he
tells them first of his own Sufferings;
that by that means he might, in some
measure, reconcile their Minds to it,
when they saw that he required nothing
of them, but what he was ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Himself, and to give them the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of it. And upon this Occasion it
was, that our Saviour acquaints them
with the hard and difficult Terms upon
which they must be his Disciples. <hi>V.</hi> 21.
The Evangelist tells us, that <hi>Jesus began
to shew unto his Disciples; how that he
must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
things of the Elders, and Chief-Priests,
and Scribes, and be killed. Then said Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
unto his Disciples;</hi> that is, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon this Discourse of his own
Sufferings, as the fittest time for it, he
takes the Oportunity to tell them
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56284:209"/>
plainly of their own Sufferings; and
that unless they were prepared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to deny themselves so far, as to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all manner of Persecution for his sake
and the Profession of his Religion; they
could not be his Disciples. <hi>If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take
up his Cross, and follow me;</hi> that is, let him
reckon and resolve upon following that
Example of Self-denyal and Suffering,
in which I will go before him. Now
the Consideration of this Example of
Self-denyal and Suffering, which our
Saviour hath given us, hath great force
in it to reconcile us to this difficult Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to shew the Reasonableness
of it.</p>
            <p>1. That He who requires us thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
our selves, hath Himself in his own
Person, given us the greatest Example
of self-denyal that ever was. And,</p>
            <p>2. Such an Example, as, in all the
Circumstances of it, is most apt and
powerful to engage and oblige us to
the imitation of it; because all his
Self-denyal and Sufferings were for our
sakes.</p>
            <p>1. He who requires us thus to deny
our selves, hath Himself in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
given us the greatest Example of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56284:209"/>
Self-denyal that ever was; in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
himself more, and suffered more
grievous things, than any of us can do.
He bore the insupportable Load of all the
Sins of all Mankind, and of the Wrath
and Vengeance due to them. <hi>Never was
sorrow like to his sorrow, wherewith the Lord
afflicted him in the day of his fierce anger. He
was despised and rejected of men; a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with griefs; his
visage was marred more than any mans,
and his form more than the sons of men.
(i. e.)</hi> He underwent more Affliction,
and had more Contempt poured upon
him, than ever was upon any of the
Sons of Men; and yet he endured all
this with incredible Patience and
Meekness, with the greatest Evenness
and Constancy of Mind, and with the
most perfect Submission and Resignation
of himself to the Will of God, that
can be imagined.</p>
            <p>Such an Example as this should be of
great force to animate us with the like
Courage and Resolution, in lesser Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Difficulties. To see the <hi>Captain
of our Salvation</hi> going before us, and
leading us on so bravely, <hi>and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by</hi> greater <hi>sufferings</hi> than we can
ever be called to, or are any ways able
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56284:210"/>
to undergo, is no small Argument and
Encouragement to us, to <hi>take up our
Cross and follow him.</hi> The Consideration
of the unknown Sufferings of the Son
of God, so great as we cannot well
conceive of them, should make all the
Afflictions and Sufferings that can befall
us, not only tolerable, but easie to us.
Upon this Consideration it is, that the
Apostle animates Christians to Patience
in their Christian Course, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Hardships and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that attended it; <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Let us
run with patience the race which is set before
us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of our Faith, who endured the Cross,
and despised the Shame. For consider him,
who endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye also be weary and
faint in your minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Example is more Powerful
for our Encouragement, because therein
we see the World conquered to our
Hands, and all the Terrours and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of it baffled and subdued, and
thereby a cheap and easie Victory
over it obtained for us. By this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
our Saviour endeavours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
his Disciples with Chearfulness
and Courage in this great Conflict;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56284:210"/>
               <hi>John 16. 33. In the world ye shall have
tribulation; but be of good chear, I have
overcome the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Example of our Saviour, is
such, as in all the Circumstances of it,
is most apt and powerful to engage
and oblige us to the Imitation of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all his Self-denyal and Sufferings
were for our sakes, in Pity and Kindness
to us, and wholly for our Benefit and
Advantage. We are apt to have their
Example in great regard, from whom
we have received great Kindness and
mighty Benefits. This Pattern of Self-denyal
and Suffering, which our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
proposeth to us, is the Example of
One, whom we have Reason to Esteem,
and Love, and Imitate, above any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World. 'Tis the Example of
our Lord and Master, of our Sovereign
and our Saviour, of the Founder of our
Religion, and of <hi>the Author and Finisher
of our Faith:</hi> And surely such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
must needs carry Authority with
it, and command our Imitation. 'Tis
the Example of our best Friend, and
greatest Benefactor; of Him, who laid
down his Life for us, and sealed his
Love to us with his dearest Blood; and,
even when we were bitter Enemies to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56284:211"/>
him, did, and suffered more for us, than
any Man ever did for his best Friend.
If we should be reduced to Poverty and
Want, let us consider Him; <hi>Who being
Lord of all, had not where to lay his head;
who being rich, for our sakes became poor;
that we through his poverty might be made
rich.</hi> If it should be our lot to <hi>be perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for righteousness sake,</hi> and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with Sufferings and Reproaches;
<hi>Let us look unto Jesus the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of our Faith, who endured the Cross,
and despised the shame for our sakes.</hi> In
a Word, can we be discontented
at any Condition, or decline it in a
good Cause; when we consider how
Contented the Son of God was, in the
meanest and most destitute; how Meek
and Patient in the most afflicted and
suffering Condition; how he welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Events, and was so perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to the Will of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that whatever pleased God, pleased
him?</p>
            <p>And surely in no Case is Example
more necessary than in this, to engage
and encourage us in the discharge of
so difficult a Duty, so contrary to the
bent and inclination of Flesh and Blood.
A bare Precept of Self-denial, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56284:211"/>
Command to sacrifice our own
Wills, our Ease, our Pleasure, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
yea and Life it self, to the
Glory of God, and the Maintenance of
his Truth, would have sounded very harsh
and severe, had not the Practice of all
this been mollified and sweetned by a
Pattern of so much advantage; by One
who in all these respects denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
much more than it is possible for us
to do; by One who might have insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a greater Right; who abased
himself, and stooped from a greater
Hight and Dignity; who was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into a condition of Meanness and
Poverty, but chose it for our sakes; who
submitted to Suffering, tho he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deserved it. Here is an Example that
hath all the Argument, and all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
that can be, to the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it.</p>
            <p>Such an Example is of greater force
and authority than any Precept or Law
can be: So that well might our Lord,
thus going before us, command us to
follow him, and say, <hi>If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his Cross and follow me.</hi> For if
He thus denied himself, well may We,
who have much less to deny, but much
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:56284:212"/>
more Cause and Reason to do it. He
did it voluntarily, and of choice; but
it is our Duty. He did it for our sakes;
we do it for our own. His own Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
moved him to deny himself for us;
but Gratitude obligeth us to deny our
selves in any thing for him. We did
not in the least deserve any thing from
him; but he hath wholly merited all
this, and infinitely more from us. So
that such an Example as this is, in all
the Circumstances of it, cannot but be
very powerful and effectual, to oblige
us to the Imitation of it. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of this Precept will yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appear, if we consider in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> place, That God hath promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all Sincere Christians all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Supplies of his Grace, to inable them
to the discharge of this difficult Duty
of Self-denial, and to support and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them therein. For the Spirit of
Christ dwells in all Christians, and the
same Glorious Power that raised up
Jesus from the Dead, works mightily
in them that believe; <hi>Eph. 1. 19. That
ye may know</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking in
general to all Christians) <hi>what is the
exceeding greatness of his Power to us-ward,
who believe, according to the working of his
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56284:212"/>
mighty Power which he wrought in Christ,
when he raised him from the dead.</hi> Of
our selves we are very weak, and the
Temptations and Terrors of the world
very powerful; but there is a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
residing in every true Christian,
able to bear us up against the World,
and the power of all its Temptations.
<hi>Whatsoever is born of God</hi> (saith St. <hi>John)
overcometh the world; and this is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
that overcometh the world, even our
Faith. Ye are of God, little children, and
have overcome; because greater is he that is
in you, than he that is in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Grace and Strength was
afforded to the first Christians in a
most Extraordinary manner, for their
Comfort and Support under Sufferings:
So that they were <hi>strengthned with all
Might, according to God's glorious Power,
unto all long-suffering with joyfulness;</hi> as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Colossians,</hi> Ch. 1. 11.
And these Consolations of the Spirit of
God, this Joy in the Holy Ghost, was
not peculiarly appropriated to the first
times of Christianity; but is still afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all sincere Christians, in such
degree as is necessary, and convenient
for them. And whenever God exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Good Men, with tryals more than
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56284:213"/>
humane, and such Sufferings as are
beyond the ordinary rate of humane
Strength and Patience to bear, he hath
promised to endue them with more
than humane Courage and Resolution.
So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 13. <hi>He is faithful that hath promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who will not suffer you to be tempted
above what ye are able, but will with the
temptation also make a way to escape, that
ye may be able to bear it.</hi> And why should
we be daunted at any Suffering; if God
be pleased to increase our Strength, in
proportion to the Sharpness of our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings?</p>
            <p>And Blessed be God, many of our
persecuted Brethren at this day have
remarkably found this comfortable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
and Support; tho many like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have fallen through fear and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
as it also hapen'd in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times. But where ever this Promise
is not made good, it is (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
said) by reason of some Fault and
Failing on our part. Either Men were
not Sincere in the profession of the
Truth, and then no wonder, <hi>If when
Tribulation and Persecution ariseth, because
of the Word, they are offended and fall off:</hi>
Or else they were too Confident to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:56284:213"/>
and did not seek God's Grace
and Assistance, and relie upon it as
they ought; and thereupon God hath
left them to themselves (as he did <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)
to convince them of their own
Frailty and rash Confidence; and yet
even in that case, when there is Truth
and Sincerity at the bottom, there is
no Reason to doubt, but that the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God is such, as by some means
or other to give to such persons (as
he did to <hi>Peter</hi>) the oportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
themselves by Repentance,
and a more stedfast Resolution after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>4. If we consider, in the <hi>last</hi> place,
that our Saviour hath assured us of a
Glorious and Eternal Reward of all our
Self-denial and Sufferings for him; a
Reward Infinitely beyond the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Sufferings, both in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and Duration of it. Now the
clear discovery of this is peculiarly
owing to the Christian Religion, and
<hi>the appearance of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished Death,
and brought Life and Immortality to light
by the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as our Blessed Saviour hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
us of this Blessed State of Good
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:56284:214"/>
Men in another World; so hath he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
assur'd us, that greater Degrees
of this Happiness shall be the Portion
of Those who suffer for Him and his
Truth: <hi>Mat. 5. 10, 11, 12. Blessed are
they which are persecuted for Righteousness
sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
Blessed are ye when men shall revile you,
and persecute you, and speak all manner of
evil against you falsly, for my Names sake.
Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is
your Reward in Heaven.</hi> And nothing
surely can be more Reasonable, than to
part with things of Small Value, for
things infinitely Greater and more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
to forego the Transient Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Enjoyments, and the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Felicities of this World, for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and Perfect, and Perpetual Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Better Life; and to exchange
a Short and Miserable Life, for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life and Blessedness; in a
word, to be content to be driven
Home; to be banisht out of this World
into our own Native Country; and to
be violently thrust out of this <hi>Vale of
Tears, into those Regions of Bliss, where
are Joys unspeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Consideration St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us
supported the Primitive Christians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:56284:214"/>
their sharpest and heaviest Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. For this cause</hi> (says
he) <hi>we faint not, because our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
which is but for a moment, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for us a far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
weight of glory; whilst we look not at
the things which are seen, but the things
which are not seen; for the things which
are seen are temporal, but the things which
are not seen are eternal.</hi> So that our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
bear no more Proportion to the
Reward of them, than Finite does to
Infinite, than Temporal to Eternal;
between which there is no Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to draw
some useful Inferences from what hath
been Discoursed, concerning this great
and difficult Duty of Self-denial for the
sake of Christ and his Religion; and
they shall be these following.</p>
            <p>1. To acknowledg the great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God to us, that all these Laws
and Commands, even the Hardest and
Severest of them, are so reasonable.</p>
            <p>God as he is our Maker, and gave us
our Beings, hath an Entire and Soveraign
Right over us; and by virtue of that
Right, might have imposed very Hard
things upon us, and this without the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56284:215"/>
giving Account to us of any of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and without propounding any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to us, so vastly disproportionable to
our Obedience to him. But in giving
Laws to us, he hath not made use of
this Right. The most Severe and Rigorous
Commands of the Gospel are such, that
we shall be infinitely Gainers by our
Obedience to them. If we deny our
selves any thing in this World for Christ
and his Religion, we shall, in the next,
be considered for it to the Utmost; not
only far beyond what it can Deserve,
but beyond what we can Conceive or
Imagine: For this perishing Life, and
the transitory Trifles and Enjoyments
of it, we shall, receive <hi>a Kingdom which
cannot be shaken, an uncorruptible Crown
which fadeth not away, Eternal in the
Heavens.</hi> For these are Faithful Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and we shall Infallibly find them
true; <hi>That if we suffer with Christ, we
shall also reign with him; if we be persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for righteousness sake, great shall be
our reward in Heaven;</hi> if we part with
our Temporal Life, we shall be made
Partakers of Eternal Life. He that is
firmly persuaded of the Happiness of
the next World, and believes the Glory
which shall then be revealed, hath no
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56284:215"/>
Reason to be so much offended at the
Sufferings of this Present time; so long
as he knows and believes, <hi>that these
Light afflictions which are but for a Moment,
will work for him a for more Exceeding and
Eternal Weight of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Seeing this is required of every
Christian, to be always in a Preparation
and Disposition of Mind to deny our
selves, and to take up our Cross; if we
do in good earnest resolve to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
we ought to fit down and consider
well with our selves, what our Religion
will cost us, and whether we be content
to come up to the Price of it. If we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
any thing in this World, above
Christ and his Truth, <hi>we are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of him.</hi> If it come to this, that
we must either renounce Him and his
Religion, or quit our temporal Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests;
if we be not ready to forego these,
nay, and to part even with Life it self,
rather than to forsake Him and his Truth;
<hi>we are not worthy of him.</hi> These are the
Terms of our Christianity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are required in Baptism solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to renounce the World: And our
Saviour, from this very Consideration,
infers, That all who take upon them
the Profession of his Religion, should
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56284:216"/>
consider seriously beforehand, and
count the cost of it; <hi>Luke 14. 28. Which
of you,</hi> (says he) <hi>intending to build a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
sitteth not down first, and counteth the
cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?
Or what King going to war with another
King, doth not sit down and consult, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with 10000 he be able to meet him
that cometh against him with 20000. So
likewise, whosoever he be that forsaketh not
all he hath, cannot be my Disciple.</hi> You
see the Terms upon which we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
we must always be prepared in
the Resolution of our Minds, to deny
our selves, and take up our Cross, tho
we are not Actually put upon this
Tryal.</p>
            <p>3. What hath been said, is matter of
great Comfort and Encouragement to
all those who deny themselves, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
upon so good an Account; of whom,
God knows, there are too great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at this Day, in several parts of the
World: Some under actual Sufferings,
such as cannot but move Compassion and
Horror in all that hear of them: Others,
who are fled hither, and into other
Countries, for Refuge and Shelter from
one of the sharpest Persecutions that
perhaps ever was, if all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:56284:216"/>
of it be duly considered. But
not to enlarge upon so unpleasant a
Theam, they who suffer for the Truth
and Righteousness sake, have all the
Comfort and Encouragement, that the
best Example, and the greatest and
most glorious Promises of God can
give. They have the best Example in
their view; <hi>Jesus the Author and Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their Faith, who endured the Cross,
and despised the Shame.</hi> So that how
great and terrible soever their Sufferings
be, they do but tread in the Steps of
the Son of God, and of the best and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Man that ever was; and He who is
their great Example in Suffering, will
likewise be their Support, <hi>and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that tho Suffering for Christ be
accounted great Self-denyal, and he is
graciously pleased so to accept it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in denying things Present and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
for things Future and Invisible, we
do not only declare our Affection to
him, but our great Faith and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, by shewing that we rely
upon his Word, and venture all upon
the Security which he offers us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World; yet according to a right
Estimate of things, and to those who
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56284:217"/>
               <hi>walk by Faith and not by Sight,</hi> this which
we call Self-denyal, is, in truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
but a more commendable sort of
Self-love; because we do herein most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
consult, and secure, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
our own Happiness.</p>
            <p>4. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> Since God hath been
pleased for so long a time to excuse us
from this hardest part of Self-denyal,
let us not grudge to deny our selves in
lesser Matters, for the sake of his Truth
and Religion; to miss a good Place, or
to quit it upon that account; much less
let us think much to renounce our Vices,
and to thwart our evil Inclinations for
his sake. As <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servant said to
him, concerning the means prescribed
by the Prophet for his Cure; <hi>If he
had bid thee do some Great thing, wouldest
thou not have done it? How much more,
when he hath only said, Wash and be clean:</hi>
So since God imposeth no harder Terms
upon us, than Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our Lives, we should gladly
and thankfully submit to them. This,
I know, is difficult to some, to <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their earthly Members,</hi> to <hi>crucifie
the flesh, with the affections and lusts of it;</hi>
'tis like <hi>cutting off a right Hand, and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a right Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:56284:217"/>
Some are so strongly addicted to their
Lusts and Vices, that they could with
more ease despise Life, in many cases,
than thus Deny themselves: But in
Truth, there is no more of Self-denyal
in it, than a Man denies himself when
he is mortally Sick and Wounded, in
being content to be Cured, and willing
to be Well. This is not at all to our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prejudice and Inconvenience,
and it directly conduceth to our Eternal
Happiness; for there is no Man that
lives a holy and virtuous Life, and
in Obedience to the Laws of God, that
can lightly receive any Prejudice by it
in this World. Since God doth not call
us to Suffer, we should Do so much the
more for him. Since he doth not put us
to testifie our Love to him, by laying
down our Lives for him, we should
shew it by a greater Care to keep his
Commandments.</p>
            <p>God was pleased to exercise the first
Christians with great Sufferings, and
to try their Love and Constancy to him
and his Truth, in a very Extraordinary
manner; by Severity and Contempt, by
<hi>the spoiling of their Goods,</hi> and <hi>the
loss of all things; by bonds and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
by cruel mockings and scourgings;
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:56284:218"/>
by the extremity of torments, and by resisting
even unto blood; by being kill'd for his sake
all the day long, and appointed as Sheep
for the slaughter.</hi> God was pleased to
make their way to Heaven very sharp
and painful, and to <hi>hedge it in as it were
with thorns on every side;</hi> so that they
could not, but <hi>through many tribulations,
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ought all to be in a Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Resolution to submit to this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if God should think fit at any time
of our Lives to call us to it. But if he
be pleased to excuse us from it, and <hi>to
let this Cup pass from us,</hi> (which may
lawfully be our earnest Prayer to God,
since we have so good a Pattern for it)
there will be another Duty incumbent
upon us, which will take up the whole
Man, and the whole time of our Life,
and that is <hi>to serve him without fear, in
holiness and righteousness before him all
the days of our lives.</hi>

               <q>And confessed that they were Strangers
and Pilgrims on the Earth.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>The whole Verse runs thus:
<q>These all died in Faith, not having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Promises, but having seen them
afar off, and were persuaded of them,
and embraced them, and confessed that
they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the
Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apostle having declared at
the latter end of the foregoing
Chapter, that Faith is the great
Principle whereby Good Men are acted,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:56284:219"/>
and whereby they are supported under
all the Evils and Sufferings of this Life,
Verse 38. <hi>Now the Just shall live by Faith;</hi>
In this Chapter he makes it his main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
to set forth to us at large the
Force and Power of Faith; and to this
Purpose, he first tells us what kind of
Faith he means; <hi>viz.</hi> a firm Persuasion
of things not Present and Visible to
Sense, but Invisible and Future; Ver. 1.
<hi>Now Faith</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of things hoped for, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not seen.</hi> Faith repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to us the Reality of things which
are Invisible to Sense, as the Existence
of God and his Providence; and of
things which are at a great distance from
us, as the Future State of Rewards and
Punishments in another World.</p>
            <p>And then he proceeds to shew, by
particular and famous Instances, that
the firm Belief and Persuasion of these
things, was the great Principle of the
Piety and Virtue of the Saints and
and Good Men in all Ages of the
World; by this <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and
<hi>Noah; Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
and <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Famous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
of the Old Testament <hi>obtained a
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56284:219"/>
good Report, and pleased God,</hi> and did
all those eminent Acts of Obedience and
Self-denyal which are recorded of them.
They <hi>believed the Being of God, and that
he is a Rewarder of them that diligently
seek him.</hi> They dreaded his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and relyed upon his Promises of
Future and Invisible Good things. They
lived and died in a full Persuasion and
Confidence of the Truth of them; tho
they did not live to see them actually
fulfilled and accomplisht. <hi>All these</hi> (saith
he, speaking of those Eminent Saints
which he had instanced in before) <hi>All these
died in Faith, not having received the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but having seen them afar off, and were
persuaded of them, and embraced them.</hi> This
is spoken with a more particular regard
to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> to whom the
Promises of the Conquest and Possession of
a Fruitful Land were made, and of a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Offspring; among whom should
be the Messias, in whom all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth should be blessed.</p>
            <p>These Promises they did not live to
see accomplisht and made good in their
Days; but they heartily believed them,
and rejoiced in the Hope and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, as if they had embraced
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56284:220"/>
them in their Arms, and been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the actual Possession of them: <hi>And
they confessed, that they were Pilgrims and
Strangers in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Saying and Acknowledgment
more particularly and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to those Sayings of the Patriarchs
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 4. where <hi>Abraham</hi> says
to the Sons of <hi>Heth, I am a Stranger and
a Sojourner with you;</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 9.
where <hi>Jacob</hi> says to <hi>Pharaoh, The days
of the years of my Pilgrimage are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty years; few and evil have
the days of the years of my Life been.</hi>
These Good Men were Strangers and
Sojourners in a Land, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be theirs afterwards. They
dwelt in it themselves as Strangers,
but were in expectation that it would
one day become the Inheritance of their
Posterity.</p>
            <p>Now in this, as by a Type and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
the Apostle represents to us the
Condition of Good Men, while they
are passing through this World. They
are Pilgrims and Strangers in the Earth;
they travel up and down the World
for a time, as the Patriarchs did in the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56284:220"/>
Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but are in expectation
of a better and more settled Condition
hereafter; <hi>they desire a better Country,
that is, an Heavenly,</hi> says the Apostle at
the 16 <hi>vers.</hi> of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>That which I design from these
words, is to represent to us our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Condition in this World; and to
awaken us to a due Sense and serious
Consideration of it. It is the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that all the Saints and Holy Men
that are gone before us were in, in
this World; and every one of us may
say with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 39. 12. <hi>I am a
Stranger with thee, and a Sojourner, as
all my Fathers were.</hi> It is a Condition
very troublesome and very unsettled,
such as that of Pilgrims and Strangers
useth to be. This we must all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if we judge rightly of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State and Condition. <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that they were Strangers and
Pilgrims on the Earth;</hi> but yet it was
not without the Hope and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a better and happier Condition
in Reversion. So it follows just after;
<hi>They that say such things,</hi> (that is, <hi>that
confess themselves to be Strangers and
Pilgrims on the Earth) declare plainly,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56284:221"/>
that they seek a Country.</hi> This bore up
the Patriarchs under all the Evils and
Troubles of their Pilgrimage; that
they expected an Inheritance, and a
quiet and settled Possession of that Good
Land which God had promised to
them. Answerably to which, Good Men
do expect, after <hi>the few and evil days
of their Pilgrimage</hi> in this World are
over, a Blessed Inheritance in <hi>a better
Country; that is, an Heavenly;</hi> and
with blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the
Faithful, <hi>They look for a City which hath
Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is
God;</hi> as it is said of that Good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
at the tenth Verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>It is very frequent, not only in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but in other Authors, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
our Condition in this World, by
that of Pilgrims, and Sojourners in a
foreign Country: For the Mind which
is the Man, and our Immortal Souls,
which are by far the most Noble and
Excellent part of our selves, are the
Natives of Heaven, and but <hi>Pilgrims
and Strangers here in the Earth;</hi> and
when the days of our Pilgrimage shall
be over, are designed to return to that
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56284:221"/>
               <hi>Heavenly Country</hi> from which they
came, and to which they belong. And
therefore the Apostle tells us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.
that Christians have relation to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as their Native place and Country.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Our conversation is in Heaven,</hi> so we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the words; but they properly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that Christians are Members of that
City and Society which is above; and
tho they converse at present here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
while they are passing through this
World, yet Heaven is the Country to
which they do belong, and whither
they are continually tending; <hi>Sedes ubi
fata quietas ostendunt,</hi> where a quiet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and a perpetual Rest, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and prepared for them. This
acknowledgment <hi>David</hi> makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himself, and all the People of
God, 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 15. For we are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
before thee, and Sojourners, as were
all our Fathers. Our Days on the Earth
are as a Shadow, and there is none abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
So likewise St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17.
<hi>Pass the time of your Sojourning here in
fear;</hi> And <hi>Chap. 2. v. 11. Dearly beloved,
I beseech you, as Strangers and Pilgrims
abstain from fleshly Lusts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:56284:222"/>
And not only the inspired Writers
of Holy Scripture, but Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
do frequently make use of this
Allusion. <hi>Plato</hi> tells us, it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
saying, and almost in every Man's
Mouth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, the
Life of Man is a kind of Pilgrimage.
And <hi>Tully,</hi> in his Excellent Discourse <hi>de
Senectute,</hi> (concerning Old Age) brings
in <hi>Cato</hi> describing our passage out of
this World, not as a departure from
our Home, but like a Man leaving his
Inn, in which he hath Lodged for a
Night or two, <hi>ex vitÃ¢ istÃ¢ discedo, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
ex hospitio, non tanquam ex domo,
commorandi enim natura Diversorium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
non habitandi dedit:</hi> When I leave
this World (says he) I look upon my
self as departing out of an Inn, and
not as quitting mine own Home and
Habitation; Nature having assigned
this World to us as a place to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ,
but not to Dwell in. Which is
the same with what the Apostle says
in the Text, concerning the Patriarchs,
they confessed that they were Pilgrims
and Strangers in the Earth; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all Christians, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 14.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:56284:222"/>
               <hi>Here we have no continuing City, but we seek
one to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I do not intend to follow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
too close, and to vex and torture
it, by pursuing all those little Parallels
and Similitudes, which a Lively Fancy
might make or find, betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Strangers and Pilgrims, and
the Life of Man during his Abode
and Passage through this World. I will
insist only upon Two things, which
seem plainly to be design'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by this Metaphor; and they
are these:</p>
            <p>1. That our Condition in this World
is very troublesom and unsettled: <hi>They
confessed, that they were Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It implies a tendency to a Future
Settling, and the Hopes and Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a happier Condition, into which
we shall enter when we go out of this
World. For so it follows in the very
next Words after the Text; <hi>They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that they were Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
on the Earth; For they that say
such things, declare plainly, that they seek a
Country. They that say such things;</hi> that
is, they that acknowledge themselves to
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:56284:223"/>
have lived in such a restless and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Condition in this World, travelling
from one place to another, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did,
and yet pretend to be perswaded of the
Goodness of God, and the Faithfulness
of his Promise, in which he solemnly
declared himself to be their God, do
hereby plainly shew, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
some happier Condition hereafter,
wherein that great Promise of God will
be made good to them to the full.</p>
            <p>And these are two very weighty and
useful Considerations; That we should
both understand our present Condition
in this World, and our future Hope and
Expectation after our departure out of
it, that so we may demean our selves
suitably to both these Conditions; both
as it is fit for those who look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as <hi>Pilgrims and Sojourners</hi> in this
World, and likewise, as it becomes
those <hi>who seek and expect a better Country,</hi>
and hope to be made Partakers of a
blessed Immortality in another World.
I shall briefly speak to both these; and
then shew what Effect and Influence the
serious Meditation of these Two Points
ought to have upon every one of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:56284:223"/>
1. That our Condition in this World
is very troublesom and unsettled. This
I take to be principally intended in the
Metaphor of Strangers and Pilgrims.
Such was the Life of the Patriarchs,
which is here spoken of in the Text;
they had no constant Abode and fixt
Habitation, but were continually wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
from one Kingdom and Country
to another; in which Travels they were
exposed to a great many Hazards and
Dangers, Afflictions and Miseries, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Injuries, as we read at large
in the History of their Travels in the
Old Testament. And such is our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this World; it is often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom,
and always uncertain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled.</p>
            <p>'Tis often very troublesom. Not to
insist upon the weak Condition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
and Childhood, the helplesness of
that State, and insufficiency of it for its
own Preservation, and the Supply of
its natural Wants and Necessities: Not
to mention the dangerous Vanity and
desperate Folly of Youth, nor the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Contempts, the many tedious
and wearisom Days and Nights that Old
Age is commonly grieved and afflicted
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:56284:224"/>
withal, to that degree, as to make Life
not only unpleasant, but almost an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Burden to us.</p>
            <p>Not to dwell upon these, which yet
take up and possess a great Share and
Portion of our Lives: If we look upon
Man in his best State, we shall find him,
as <hi>David</hi> hath long since pronounced on
him, to be <hi>altogether Vanity.</hi> We need
not go a Pilgrimage, and travel into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Countries, to make Life more
troublesom and uneasie. In what part
of the World soever we are (even that
which we improperly call our own
Home and Native Country) we shall
meet with Trouble and Inconvenience
enough to convince us, that we are but
<hi>Strangers</hi> in it. More especially good
Men are peculiarly liable to a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Evils and Sufferings upon account of
their Piety and Virtue. <hi>They are not of
the World</hi> (as our Blessed Saviour tells
his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19.) <hi>and because
they are not of the world, therefore the world
hateth them,</hi> and taketh all opportunities
and occasions to vex and persecute them
in one kind or other; either by doing
all manner of Evil to them, or by
speaking all manner of Evil of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:56284:224"/>
But suppose we escape Trouble upon
this account; there are abundance of
common and natural Inconveniences,
which render Human Life very uneasie.
For either we must live alone, or in the
Company and Society of others: One of
these two is necessary and unavoidable.
Suppose we would live alone; How
few are there that can enjoy themselves
tolerably alone for any considerable
time? For though there be a great deal
too much of Self-love in Mankind, and
Men are generally extreamly fond of
themselves; yet I know not how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
(tho so it is) that very few Men
in the World care for their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
or can endure, for any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time, to converse only with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
nay, for the most part, they are
sooner glutted with themselves, and
surfeited of their own Conversation,
than of the worst Company they can
meet with; a shrewd Sign, as one would
think, that they know something worse
by themselves than of any body else, or
at least they know it more certainly.
It is a wise and deep Saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
whoever affects to be alone, must be
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, either a God or a Wild
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:56284:225"/>
Beast; either he must be sufficient for
himself, and want nothing; or of so
wild and savage a Disposition, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
every thing that is weaker, and
to run away from every thing that is
stronger than himself. Now Man is
neither good enough to be contented
and satisfied with himself, nor bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to hate and avoid every body else,
and therefore he must enter into Society,
and keep Company with other Men.</p>
            <p>And if we go abroad into the World,
and try the Conversation of Men, it
cannot but grieve us to see a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, which yet we must see eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Day; the Censoriousness, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness,
and Insincerity of Men
one towards another; to see with what
Kindness they will treat one another
to the Face, and how hardly they will
use them behind their Backs. If there
were nothing else, this one naughty
Quality, so common and reigning among
Mankind, were enough to make an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and true-hearted Man, one that
loves Plainness and Sincerity, to be
heartily sick of the World, and glad to
steal off the Stage; where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
native and sincere, but all perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:56284:225"/>
and acted; where the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a great part of Men is all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
and insidious, full of Flattery
and Flashood, of good Words and ill
Offices: <hi>One speaketh peaceably to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with his mouth, but in his heart he
lieth in wait,</hi> as it is in the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi>
9. 8. And when a Man hath done all the
good turns he can, and endeavoured to
oblige every Man, and not only to live
inoffensively, but exemplarily; he is
fairly dealt withal, and comes off upon
good Terms, if he can but escape the
ill Words of Men for doing well, and
obtain a Pardon for those things which
truly deserve Praise.</p>
            <p>But setting aside these, and the like
melancholy Considerations; when we
are in the Health and Vigour of our Age,
when our Blood is warm, and our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
quick, and the Humour of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
not yet turned and sowred by great
Disappointments, and grievous Losses of
our Estates, or nearest Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
by a long Course of Afflictions,
by many cross Events and calamitous
Accidents; yet we are continually lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all these; and the perpetual Fear
and Danger of them is no small Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:56284:226"/>
and Uneasiness to our Minds, and
does in a great measure rob us of the
Comfort, and eat out the Pleasure and
Sweetness of all our Enjoyments; and,
by degrees, the Evils we fear overtake
us; and as one Affliction and Trouble
goes on, another succeeds in the place
of it, like <hi>Job</hi>'s Messengers, whose
bad Tidings and Reports of calamitous
Accidents came so thick upon him, that
they overtook one another.</p>
            <p>If we have a plentiful Fortune, we
are apt to abuse it to Intemperance and
Luxury; and this naturally breeds Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Pains and Diseases, which take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the Comfort and Enjoyment of
a great Estate. If we have Health, it
may be we are afflicted with Losses, or
deprived of Friends, or cross'd in our
Interests and Designs; and one thing or
other happens to impede and interrupt
the Contentment and Happiness of our
Lives. Sometimes an unexpected Storm,
or some other suddain Calamity, sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
away, in an instant, all that which
with so much Industry and Care we
have been gathering many Years. Or
if an Estate stand firm, our Children
are taken away, to whose Comfort and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:56284:226"/>
Advantage all the Pains and Endeavours
of our Lives were devoted. Or if none
of these happen, (as it is very rare to
escape most, or some of them) yet for a
Demonstration to us that God intended
this World to be uneasie, to convince us
that a perfect state of Happiness is not
to be had here below; we often see in
Experience, that those who seem to be
in a Condition as happy as this World
can put them into, by the greatest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
towards it, are yet as
far, or farther from Happiness, as those
who are destitute of most of those
things wherein the greatest Felicity
of this World is thought to consist.
Many times it so happens, that they
who have all the Furniture and Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
all the Materials and Ingredients
of a Worldly Felicity at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and in their Power, yet have
not the Skill and Ability out of all these
to frame a happy Condition of Life to
themselves. They have Health, and
Friends, and Reputation, and Estate in
abundance, and all outward Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
that Heart can wish; and yet
in the midst of all these Circumstances
of outward Felicity, they are uneasie in
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:56284:227"/>
their Minds, and as the Wise Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
it, <hi>In their sufficiency they are in
streights,</hi> and are as it were surfeited
even of Happiness it self, and do so fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastically
and unaccountably nauseate
the good Condition they are in, that tho
they want nothing to make them Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
yet they cannot think themselves so;
though they have nothing in the World
to molest and disgust them, yet they
can make a shift to create as much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to themselves, out of nothing, as
they who have the real and substantial
Causes of Discontent.</p>
            <p>Which plainly shews, That we are
not to look for Happiness here; 'tis not
to be found in this Land of the Living;
and after our Enquiries after it, we shall
see sufficient Reason to take up <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Conclusion, <hi>That all is Vanity and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Spirit;</hi> which is much the same
with that Aphorism of <hi>David</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which I mentioned before, <hi>That
Man in his best estate is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what Happiness soever our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this World is capable of, 'tis
most assuredly full of Uncertainty and
Unsettlement; we cannot enjoy it long,
and every moment we are in danger of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:56284:227"/>
being deprived of it. Whatever degree
of Earthly Felicity we are possess'd of,
we have no Security that it shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
There is nothing in this World,
but, when we are as sure of it as this
World can make us, may be taken
away from us by a thousand Accidents.
But suppose it to abide and continue;
we our selves shall be taken away from
it. We must die, and in that very Day
all our Enjoyments and Hopes, as to
this World, will perish with us; for
here is no Abiding Place, <hi>we have no
continuing City:</hi> So that it is vain to
design a Happiness to our selves in this
World, when we are not to stay in it,
but only travel and pass through it.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>First;</hi> Our Condition
in this World is very troublesom and
unsettled.</p>
            <p>2. Our Condition in this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a state of Pilgrimage, doth imply a
tendency to a future Settlement, and
the Hopes and Expectation of a happier
Condition hereafter. And so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
reasons immediately after the Text;
<hi>they confessed that they were Pilgrims and
Strangers in the Earth; for they that say
such things, declare plainly that they seek a
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:56284:228"/>
Country;</hi> that is, they who acknowledge
themselves to be Pilgrims and Strangers
in the Earth, and yet withal profess to
be perswaded of the Goodness of God,
and the Fidelity of his Promise, do
plainly declare, that they seek another
Country. This is spoken of <hi>Abraham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who acknowledged
themselves to be Strangers and Pilgrims
in the Earth; and thereby declared, that
they sought another Country. Now,
says the Apostle, this cannot be the
Country from whence they first came,
<hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees, v. 15. And truly,
if they had been mindful of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from whence they came out, they
might have had an oportunity of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither.</hi> And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that the Country which they
sought was a better Country than any in
this World. V. 16. <hi>But now they desire
a better Country;</hi> that is, <hi>an Heavenly:
Therefore God is not ashamed to be called
their God; for he hath prepared for them
a City.</hi> This plainly refers to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Declaration or Promise of God
to the Patriarchs of being their God;
I am the <hi>God of Abraham, the God of
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, the God of Jacob.</hi> Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56284:228"/>
this Promise of God did signifie
some very great Blessing and Advantage
to those faithful Servants of God above
others. This was not made good to
them in this World; for <hi>they confessed,
that they were Pilgrims and Strangers in the
Earth.</hi> Where then is the Blessing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of and signified by the great Words
of that Promise, <hi>that God was their God?</hi>
They met with no such Condition in
this World, as was answerable to the
greatness of that Promise. From hence
the Apostle argues, that they had a firm
Perswasion of a future Happiness; <hi>For
they that say such things, declare plainly,
that they seek a better Country;</hi> that is,
<hi>an Heavenly. Wherefore God is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to be called their God, since he
hath prepared for them a City.</hi> And
tho the Promise of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> did
immediately design the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and the earthly <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
extends it to that which was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by it; <hi>viz. an Heavenly Country,</hi>
the <hi>Jerusalem which is above,</hi> which,
at the 10th Verse of this Chapter, is
called <hi>a City, which hath Foundations,
whose Builder and Maker is God.</hi> And now,
seeing God had designed and prepared
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:56284:229"/>
so great a Happiness for them in another
World, well might he be called <hi>their
God,</hi> notwithstanding that they were
<hi>Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth;</hi> that
is, Tho the full Meaning and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Promise was not made
good to them in this World, yet it was
accomplish'd to the full in the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which was designed for them in
another Life. <hi>And God</hi> need <hi>not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be called their God;</hi> implying, that
if nothing had been meant by it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this World, this Promise, of God's
being <hi>their God,</hi> would have fallen
shamefully short of what it seemed to
import. And this I conceive to be the
true Reason, why our Saviour lays so
much Weight upon this Promise, as to
pitch upon it for the Proof of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
that is, of a future state of
Happiness in another World.</p>
            <p>There are many Considerations apt
to perswade Good Men of another Life
after this: As, That Mankind is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
possess'd with this Hope and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion;
and that the more wise and
virtuous Men have been, the more
plainly have they apprehended the
Hopes of Immortality, and the better
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:56284:229"/>
have they been contented to leave this
World; as if, seeing farther than other
Men, they had a clearer Prospect of the
Happiness they were entering upon:
But above all, that God hath made our
Condition in this World so troublesom
and unsettled, as if he had designed on
purpose to make us seek for Happiness
elsewhere, and to elevate and raise our
Minds to the Hopes and Expectation
of a Condition better and more durable,
than any is to be met with in this
World; which, considering the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, and his gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Care of Good Men, is a thing
of it self extremely credible.</p>
            <p>Having thus, as briefly as I could,
dispatched the <hi>Two</hi> Particulars which I
propounded to speak to for the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Text; I should now shew what
Influence these Considerations ought to
have upon our Lives and Practice.</p>
            <p>And if this be our Condition in
this World, and these our Hopes and
Expectations as to another Life; if we
be <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers in the Earth;</hi>
and <hi>look for a better Country,</hi> that is,
<hi>an Heavenly;</hi> this ought to have a great
Influence upon us in these following
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:56284:230"/>
respects, which I shall at present but
very briefly mention.</p>
            <p>1. Let us intangle and incumber our
selves as little as we can in this our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage;
let us not ingage our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too far in the Pleasures and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of this World; for we are not to
continue and settle in it, but to pass
through it. A little will serve for our
Passage and Accommodation in this
Journey; and beyond that, why should
we so earnestly covet and seek more?</p>
            <p>2. If we be <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers;</hi>
then it concerns us to behave our selves
blamelesly and inoffensively, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering,
that the Eyes of People are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and that those among whom we
live will be very curious and observant
of our Manners and Carriage.</p>
            <p>3. Let us be chearful and patient
under the Troubles and Afflictions of
this present Life. They who are in a
strange Country, must expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
many Injuries and Affronts, and
to be put to great Difficulties and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
which we should endeavour to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:56284:230"/>
bear with that Chearfulness, as Men
that are upon a Journey use to bear foul
Ways and bad Weather, and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Lodging and Accomodations.</p>
            <p>4. The Consideration of our present
Condition and future Hopes should set
us above the Fondness of Life, and the
slavish Fear of Death. For our Minds
will never be raised to their true Pitch
and Hight, till we have in some good
measure conquered these two Passions,
and made them subject to our Reason.
As for this present Life, and the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, What do we see in them,
that should make us so strangely to dote
upon them? <hi>Quae Miseri lucis tam dira
cupido?</hi> This World, at the best, is but
a very indifferent Place; and he is the
wisest Man that bears himself towards
it with the most indifferent Affection;
that is always willing to leave it, and
yet patient to stay in it as long as God
pleases.</p>
            <p>5. We should always prefer our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and a good Conscience before all the
World; because it is in truth more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable,
if our Souls be Immortal, and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56284:231"/>
do survive in another World. For (as
our Saviour argues) <hi>What is a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited,
if he gain the whole World, and lose
his own Soul? Or what shall a Man give
in exchange for his Soul?</hi> And thus
St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned with himself, from
the Belief of a Resurrection of the Just
and Unjust. <hi>For this cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>I
exercise my self alway to have a Conscience
void of offence both toward God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> If we be Sojourners and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
we should often think of our
End, and carefully mind the Way to
it. Our End is Everlasting Happiness;
and the Way to it is a constant and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and universal Obedience to the
Commandments of God. When the
Young Man in the Gospel enquired of
our Saviour the way to Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
saying, <hi>Good Master, what good
thing shall I do, that I may inherit Eternal
Life?</hi> His Answer to him was, <hi>If thou
wilt enter into Life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
We may easily mistake our way;
<hi>For strait is the Gate, and narrow is the
Way that leads to Life, and few there be
that find it.</hi> Therefore we should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:56284:231"/>
pray to God, as <hi>David</hi> does, <hi>Psalm</hi>
119. 19. <hi>I am a Stranger in the Earth,
hide not thy Commandments from me.</hi> And
<hi>Psalm 139. 23, 24. Search me, O God, and
know my Heart; try me, and know my
Thoughts; and see if there be any wicked
way in me, and lead me in the Way Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>

            <q>And confessed that they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Pilgrims in the Earth.</q>
            <p>The whole Verse runs thus:
<q>These all died in Faith, not having
received the Promises, but having
seen them afar off, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
of them, and embraced them,
and confessed that they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I Have lately in this Place (upon a
particular Day and Occasion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to handle these Words: I shall
briefly give you the Heads of what hath
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:56284:233"/>
been already delivered, and proceed
to what remains. And that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
from this Text, was, To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to us our present Condition in this
World, and to awaken us to a due Sense
and Consideration of it. It is the same
Condition that all the Saints and Holy
Men that have gone before us were in,
in this World; and we may all of us
say with <hi>David, Psal. 39. 12. I am a
Stranger with Thee, and a Sojourner, as all
my Fathers were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very frequent, not only in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but in other Authors, to represent
our Condition in this World, by that
of Pilgrims and Sojourners in a far
Country. For the Mind, which is the
Man, and our Immortal Souls, which
are, by far, the most noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Part of our selves, are the Natives
of Heaven, and but Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
here on the Earth; and when the
Days of our Pilgrimage shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
are designed to return to that
Heavenly Country from which they
came, and to which they belong. And
for the Explication of this Metaphor,
I insisted only upon <hi>Two</hi> Things,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56284:233"/>
which seem plainly to be designed and
intended by it.</p>
            <p>1. That our Condition in this World
is very troublesom and unsettled; <hi>They
confessed, that they were Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. It implies a tendency to a future
Settlement, and the Hopes and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of a happier Condition, into
which we shall enter when we go out of
this World.</p>
            <p>And these I told you are <hi>Two</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Weighty and Useful Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
That we should both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
our present Condition in this
World, and our future Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
after our Departure out of it;
that so we may demean our selves suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to both these Conditions; both as
is fit for those who look on themselves
<hi>as Pilgrims and Sojourners</hi> in this World;
and likewise, as it becomes those
<hi>who seek and expect a better Country,</hi>
and hope to be Partakers of a Blessed
Immortality in another World.</p>
            <p>I. That our Condition in this World
is very Troublesom and Unsettled; and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56284:234"/>
this is principally intended by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor
of <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers.</hi> Such
was the Life of the Patriarchs here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Text; they had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Abode and fixt Habitation, but
were continually wandering from one
Kingdom and Country to another;
in which Travels they were exposed to
a great many Dangers and Sufferings,
Affronts and Injuries; as we read at
large in the History of their Travels
in the Old Testament. And such is our
Condition in this World; it is often
Troublesom, and always Uncertain, and
Unsettled: So that whatever Degree of
Worldly Felicity any Man is possest of,
he hath no Security that it shall continue
for one Moment.</p>
            <p>II. Our condition in this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a State of Pilgrimage, it implies
a Tendency to a Future Settlement, and
the Hopes and Expectation of a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
Condition, into which we shall
enter so soon as we leave this World.
For so it follows immediately after the
Text; <hi>They confessed that they were Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and Strangers on the Earth; For
they that say such things, declare plainly
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:56284:234"/>
that they seek a Country. They that say
such things;</hi> that is, They that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
themselves to have lived in
such a Restless and Uncertain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this World, Travelling from one
Place to another, as the Patriarchs
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did; and yet
pretend to be persuaded of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, and the faithfulness of his
Promise; in which He so solemnly
declares Himself <hi>to be their God;</hi> do
hereby plainly shew, that they expect
some Happier Condition hereafter,
wherein that Great Promise of God,
will be made good to them to the full.
So that He need not <hi>be ashamed to have
been called their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having handled at large these <hi>Two</hi>
Particulars, I come now to shew what
Influence the Consideration of them
ought to have upon our Lives and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.
And if this be our Condition
in this World, and these our Hopes
and Expectations, as to another Life:
If we be <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers in the
Earth,</hi> and look for <hi>a better Country,
that is, an Heavenly;</hi> this ought to
have a great Influence upon us in these
following Respects, which I did but
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:56284:235"/>
briefly mention before; but shall now
Prosecute and Press more largely.</p>
            <p>I. Let us Entangle and Incumber our
selves as little as we can in this our
Pilgrimage: Let us not Engage our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
too far in the Pleasures and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of this World, because we are
not to stay in it, but to pass through it.
Upon this Consideration the Apostle St.
<hi>Peter</hi> doth so earnestly exhort Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to preserve themselves from fleshly
Lusts, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11. Dearly Beloved, I
beseech you, as Strangers and Pilgrims, to
abstain from fleshly Lusts, which war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Soul.</hi> The gratifying of our
inordinate Lusts, and our Carnal and
Sensual Inclinations, is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
both to the Nature of our Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits, and to their great Design
and Business in this World. Fleshly
Lusts do not only pollute and defile, but
even quench and extinguish our Divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part, and do work the ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of it; they sink our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into the Mud and Filth of this
World, and do entangle and detain
them there. In a word, they do wholly
indispose and unfit us for that Pure
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:56284:235"/>
and Spiritual, and Divine Life, which
alone can qualifie us for our Heavenly
Country and Inheritance. And therefore
while our Souls are Sojourning in this
World, we should abstain from them,
and preserve our selves Unspotted and
Untainted by them, as being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unuseful, and perfectly contrary
to the Laws and Manners of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Country. If we wallow in bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
and filthy Lusts, as we pass through
this World; our Native Country, when
our Souls think to return to it, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
us and cast us out: when we come
to Heaven's Gate, and knock there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to be admitted, and shall cry,
<hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us;</hi> He will bid
us to <hi>depart from Him, because we have
been workers of iniquity. Nothing that is
unclean can enter</hi> into Heaven. He who
is to receive us into those Blessed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
hath declared it to be his Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Resolution, and Decree, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Holiness, no Man shall see the Lord.</hi>
And therefore, as ever we hope to see
God, in that Happy and Blissful State,
we must <hi>Cleanse our selves from all Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of Flesh and Spirit, and perfect
Holiness in the Fear of God;</hi> that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:56284:236"/>
render'd our selves as like Him
as we can in this World, we may be
capable of the Blessed Sight and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Him in the other.</p>
            <p>And as for the Advantages of this
World, let us not pursue them too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly.
We may take the Conveniences
which fairly offer themselves to us,
and be content to want what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Honestly have, and without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the way of our Duty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that we are Travellers, and
that a little will serve for our Passage
and Accommodation in our Pilgrimage.
And beyond that why should we so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
covet more, and trouble our
selves for that which is not necessary
to our Journey? Why should we at
any time deal unjustly, to attain any of
this World's Goods? They will stand
us in stead for so little a while, that we
can have no temptation to injure or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
any Man, to break the Peace of
our Consciences, and to wound our
Souls, for the attaining of them. If the
Providence of God offer them to us,
and bring them to our hands, in the
use of Honest Diligence, and Lawful
Means; as we are not to refuse them,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:56284:236"/>
so neither are we to set our Hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, nor to suffer our Affections to
be entangled in them.</p>
            <p>The wisest Use we can make of
them, will be, to do like those who
traffick in Foreign Parts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
our Estates into our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, to send our Treasures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us into the other World, that we
may have the Benefit of them when
we come there. And this we may do by
Alms and Charity. Whatever we spend
upon the Flesh, we leave behind us, and
it will turn to no account to us in our
own Country; but whatever we lay out
for the Relief of the Poor, is so much
Treasure laid out and secured to our
selves, against another day. So our
Blessed Saviour assures us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 33.
That <hi>giving of Alms</hi> is <hi>providing for our
selves Bags that wax not old, a Treasure
in the Heavens that faileth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. If We be Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
then it concerns us to behave
our selves with great Caution, and to
live blamelesly and inoffensively; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering
that the Eyes of People
are upon us, and that those among
whom we Sojourn, will be very pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:56284:237"/>
and curious, and narrow Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of our Manners and Carriage.
They that are in a strange Country,
are not wont to take that Liberty
and Freedom, which the Natives of
the place may do, but to keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Guard upon themselves, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how strictly they are observed;
and that they live among those who
bear no Good Will to them; and that
every Bad Thing we do, reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Nation, and is a Reproach to
the Country to which we belong. <hi>Ye
are not of the World;</hi> (says our Lord)
<hi>if ye were of the World, the World would
love its own: but ye are not of the World;
therefore the World hateth you.</hi> Upon
this account the Apostle chargeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to be <hi>Harmless, and Blameless,
and as it becomes the Sons of God to
be, in the midst of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Nation, among whom we should
shame as Lights.</hi> The same Argument
St. <hi>Peter</hi> useth, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11, 12. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech,
you as Pilgrims and Strangers, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from fleshly lusts, having your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
honest among the Gentiles;</hi> that
is, Considering that you are among
Strangers and Enemies, and therefore
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:56284:237"/>
ought to be very careful to bring no
Scandal upon your Holy Profession,
among those who will be ready to
take all advantages against you. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
we who pretend to the same
Heavenly Country, must be kind to
one another; and whilst we live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Strangers, have no Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our Selves. In a Strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
it useth to be a Mighty Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Men to one another, that
they are of the same Country, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Citizens; and this alone is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
sufficient to unite their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and to link their Interests to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But how little of this is to
be seen among Christians? how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do they Quarrel among themselves,
in the midst of Enemies and Strangers!
as if they had no Relation to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and never expected to meet at
last in the same Country, and there
to live together for ever.</p>
            <p>III. Let us be as Patient and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as we can, under all the Troubles
and Afflictions which we meet with
in this Life. They who are in Strange
Countries must expect to encounter
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:56284:238"/>
many Injuries and Affronts, and to be
put to great Difficulties and Hardships.
Those which are lighter and more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
we must bear with Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Upon a Journey Men use to put
on all the Pleasantness they can, and to
make Sport of all the Inconveniences
of the Ways and Weather, and little
cross Accidents that befall them: And
thus, if we had but the Art and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to do it, many of the lesser Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of Humane Life might well
enough be play'd off, and made mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rather of Mirth and Diversion, than
of Melancholy and serious Trouble.</p>
            <p>But there are some Evils and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of Humane Life, that are too
heavy and serious to be Jested withal,
and require the greatest Consideration,
and a very great degree of Patience to
Support us under them, and enable us
to bear them Decently; as the Loss of
Friends and dearest Relations; as the
Loss of an Only Son, grown up to be
well fixt and settled in a Virtuous
Course, and promising all the Comfort
to his Parents that they themselves can
wish: These certainly are some of the
Greatest Evils of this World, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:56284:238"/>
to be born. For Men may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
what they will to Philosophy and
Contempt of the World, and of the
Perishing Comforts and Enjoyments of
it; to the Extirpation of their Passions,
and an Insensibility of these things,
which the weaker and undisciplin'd part
of Mankind keep such a Wailing and
Lamentation about: but when all is
done, Nature hath framed us as we
are, and hath planted in our Nature
strong Inclinations and Affections to our
Friends and Relations; and these Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are as naturally moved upon such
Occasions, and pluck every String of our
Hearts as violently, as extream Hunger
and Thirst do gnaw upon our Stomachs.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is foolish for any
Man to pretend to love things migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and to rejoyce greatly in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them; and yet to be so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented to lose them, and to be
parted from them. This is to separate
things which Nature hath strongly
linked together. Whatever we migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
love, does thereby in some sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
part of our Selves; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hand loose to us, to be separated and
divorced from us without Trouble; no
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:56284:239"/>
more than a Limb that is vitally and by
strong Ligaments united to the Body,
can be dropt off when we please, or rent
from the Body without Pain. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
pretends to have a mighty Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for any thing, and yet at the same
time does pretend that he can content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and without any great Sense or
Signification of Pain, bear the Loss of
it, does not talk like a Philosopher, but
like an Hypocrite; and under a grave
Pretence of being a Wise, is in truth, an
Ill-natured Man. For most certainly,
in proportion to our Love of any thing,
will be our Trouble and Grief for the
Loss of it.</p>
            <p>So that under these great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
Strokes, we had need both of Faith
and Patience. And indeed, nothing but
the firm Belief of <hi>a better Country, that
is, an Heavenly,</hi> another Life after
this, and a blessed Immortality in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, is sufficient to support a
Man in the <hi>few and evil Days of his
Pilgrimage,</hi> and to sustain his Spirit
under the great Evils and Calamities of
this Life. But This fully answers all,
<hi>That the Afflictions and Sufferings of this
present time, are not worthy to be compared
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:56284:239"/>
with the Glory which shall be revealed in us.</hi>
Nay, that if we bear these Afflictions
patiently, and with a due Submission
to the Will of God, (especially our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for his Truth and Cause) it will
certainly increase our Happiness in the
other World, and <hi>work for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. The Consideration of our Present
Condition and of our Future Hopes,
should set us above the Fondness of
Life, and the slavish Fears of Death.
For our Minds will never be raised to
their true pitch and hight, till we have
in some good measure conquered these
two Passions, and made them subject to
our Reason.</p>
            <p>As for this present Life, and the
Enjoyments of it; What is it that we
see in them that should make us so
strangely to dote upon them? <hi>Quae
lucis miseris tam dira cupido!</hi> This World
at the best is but a very Indifferent place,
and he is the wisest Man that bears him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
towards it with the most Indifferent
Mind and Affection; that is always
willing to leave it, and yet patient to
stay in it as long as God pleaseth. And
as for Death, tho' the Dread of it be
natural, yet why should the Terrors of
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:56284:240"/>
it be so very surprising and amazing to
us; after we have consider'd, that to a
good and pious Soul, it is no other but
the Gate of Heaven, and an Entrance
into Eternal Life? We are apt to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see a Man undaunted at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Death, and to be not only
contented, but chearful, at the Thoughts
of his Departure out of this World, this
Sink of Sin, and Vale of Misery and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Whereas, if all things be duly
considered, it is a greater Wonder that
Men are so patient to Live, and that they
are not glad of any fair Excuse and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of getting out of this strange
Country, and retiring Home, and of
ridding themselves of the Troubles and
Inconveniences of Life. For, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the numerous Troubles and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
we are liable to in a long Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
there are really but <hi>Three</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
that I can readily think of,
that can make this World, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Condition in it, in any good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
tolerable to a wise Man; <hi>viz.</hi> That
God governs the World; That we are
not always to stay in it; That there is a
Happiness designed and reserved for us
in another place, which will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:56284:240"/>
recompense and make amends to us
for all the Troubles and Sufferings of
this Life.</p>
            <p>And yet it is strange to see how fast
most Men cling to Life, and that even
in Old Age; how they catch at every
Twig that may but hold them up a little
while; and how fondly they hanker af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a miserable Life, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of Pleasure to be enjoy'd,
nothing more of Satisfaction to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and hoped for in it. When they
are just putting in to the Port, and, one
would think, should rejoyce at their
very Hearts that they see Land; yet
how glad would they be then of any
cross Wind, that would carry them
back into the Sea again? As if they
loved to be tost, and were fond of Storms
and Tempests.</p>
            <p>Nay, the very best of us, even after
we have made that acknowledgment of
<hi>David; I am a Stranger and a Sojourner
with thee, as all my Fathers were;</hi> are apt
with him to be still importuning God
for a little longer Life; <hi>O spare me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that I may recover strength, before I go
hence, and be no more.</hi> And when God
hath granted us this Request, then we
would be <hi>spared yet a little longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:56284:241"/>
But let us remember, that God did
not design us to continue always in this
World; and that he hath on purpose
made it so uneasie to us, to make us
willing to leave it; and that so long as
we linger here below, we are detained
from our Happiness; <hi>While we are present
in the Body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi>
This Consideration made St. <hi>Paul</hi> so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to be dissolved,</hi> because <hi>he knew
that when his Earthly House of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
was dissolved, he should have a
much better Habitation, a Building of God,
an House not made with Hands, eternal
in the Heavens.</hi> This was that which
made him so full of Joy and Triumph, at
the Thoughts of his leaving the World.
2 <hi>Tim. 4. 6. I am now ready</hi> (says he) <hi>to
be offered up, and the time of my departure is
at hand; I have fought a good Fight, I
have finished my Course, I have kept the
Faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a
Crown of Righteousness, which God the
righteous Judge shall give me in that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the Consideration of this (tho
but obscurely apprehended by them)
did raise the Spirits of the wiser and
better Heathen, and fill them with
great Joy and Comfort at the Thoughts
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:56284:241"/>
of their Dissolution. With what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Evenness of Mind did <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
receive the Sentence of Death? And
with what excellent Discourse did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
his Friends just before he drank
off the Fatal Cup, and after he had taken
it down, whilst Death was gradually
seizing upon him? One can hardly,
without a very sensible Transport, read
<hi>Cato</hi>'s Discourse concerning his Death, as
it is represented by <hi>Tully</hi> in his Book of
Old Age. <hi>I am</hi> (says he) <hi>transported with
a Desire of seeing my Fore-fathers, those
Excellent Persons of whom I have Heard,
and Read, and Written; and now I am
going to them, I would not willingly be
drawn back into this World again;</hi> Quod
si quis Deus mihi largiatur, ut ex hac
aetate repuerascam, &amp; in cunis vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
valde recusem. <hi>If some God would
offer me, at this Age, to be a Child
again, and to cry in the Cradle, I would
earnestly refuse it, and upon no terms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it. And now that my Race is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
run, and my Course just finished,
how loth should I be to be brought back,
and made to begin again? For what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is there in Life? Nay rather,
what Labour and Trouble is there not in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:56284:242"/>
it? But let the Benefit of it be what
it will, there is certainly some Measure
of Life as well as of other things, and
Men ought to know when they have enough
of it.</hi> O praeclarum diem, cum in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud
animorum consilium caetumque
proficiscar, &amp; cum ex hac turbÃ¢ &amp;
colluvione discedam. <hi>O Blessed and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Day, when</hi> I <hi>shall go to that
great Council and Assembly of Spirits,
and have got out of this Tumult and
Sink.</hi> And if a Heathen, who had
but some obscure Glimmerings of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life, and of the Blessed State of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Souls, could speak thus chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Death; how much more may We,
who have a clear and undoubted Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these things, and to whom <hi>Life
and Immortality are brought to Light by the
Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. We should alway prefer our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the keeping of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
before all the World: because it
it is in truth infinitely more valuable,
if so be our Souls be immortal, and do
survive in another World, and we must
there give a strict Account of all the
Actions done by us in this Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:56284:242"/>
the Sentence of Eternal Happiness
or Misery, <hi>according to the things done
in the Body, whether they be Good, or
whether they be Evil.</hi> For as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
argues concerning the case of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
him and his Truth, to avoid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Suffering and Death; <hi>What is a
Man profited, if he shall gain the whole
World, and lose his own Soul? Or what shall
a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> When
we are tempted by temporal Interest
and Advantage, or by the Fear of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Loss and Suffering, to deny or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
our Religion, to do any thing
that is sinful in any kind, and contrary
to our Duty and Conscience; let us ask
our selves; What will be the Profit and
Advantage of it? What, if for fear of
Men, and what they can do to me, I incur
the Wrath and Displeasure of Almighty
God? This is infinitely more to be
dreaded; and these Frowns are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times more terrible, than the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
Wrath and cruelest Malice of Men.
What, if to preserve this frail and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Body, I shall evidently hazard the
Loss of my Immortal Soul; and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
a Temporal Inconvenience, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Everlasting Happiness, and plunge
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:56284:243"/>
my self into Eternal Misery and Ruine?
Would not this be a wild Bargain, and
a mad Exchange, for any Temporal Gain
and Advantage, to lose the things that
are Eternal? And for the pleasing of
our selves for a little while, to make our
selves miserable for ever?</p>
            <p>If we confess our selves to be <hi>Pilgrims
and Strangers on the Earth,</hi> and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Promises of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
an <hi>Heavenly Country,</hi> where we
hope to arrive after <hi>the few and evil
days of our Pilgrimage</hi> are over; let us
not, by complying with the Humours of
Strangers, and the vitious Customs and
Practices of an Evil World, bar our
selves of our Hopes, and banish our
selves from that happy Place, to which
we all profess we are going.</p>
            <p>We pretend to be travelling towards
Heaven: but if we <hi>make shipwrack of
Faith and a good Conscience;</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
our own Hopes of ever arriving at
that happy Port. We do not live up to
our Expectation of a future Happiness,
if the unseen Glories of another World
do not raise us above all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Terrors of Sense. Our Faith
and Hope have not their due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:56284:243"/>
Influence upon us; if they do not
govern our Lives and Actions, and make
us stedfast in the Profession of our Holy
Religion, and in the Conscientious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> reason'd himself
into this Holy Resolution, from the
Hopes of a blessed Resurrection. <hi>Acts</hi>
24. 15, 16. <hi>I have Hope,</hi> says he, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, that there shall be a Resurrection
of the Dead, both of the Just and Vnjust:</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>For this cause therefore, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
my self always to have a Conscience
void of Offence, towards God and towards
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> If we be <hi>Sojourners</hi>
and <hi>Travellers</hi> in this World; we should
often think of our End, and carefully
mind the Way to it. Our End is Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Happiness; and the direct Way
to it is by a constant and sincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Obedience to the Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God: And this in it self
is so plain a way, that a sincere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Man can hardly err in it. And
therefore we must not suffer our selves
to be led and trained out of it, upon any
Pretence whatsoever; not by the Wild-fire
of pretended Illuminations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasms;
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:56284:244"/>
nor by the confident Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of an Infallible Guide, that will
needs shew us another way, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to follow him blindfold in it.
Let us not quit <hi>the Infallible Rule of
God's Word,</hi> to follow any <hi>Guide</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
<hi>If an Apostle, or an Angel from
Heaven, preach any other Doctrine</hi> and
Way to Heaven, <hi>let him be accursed. He
who is the Way, and the Truth, and the
Life,</hi> when he was consulted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Way to Eternal Happiness,
knew no other but this. For when the
Young Man ask'd him; <hi>Good Master,
what good thing shall I do, that I may inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
Eternal Life?</hi> His Answer was, <hi>If
thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
'Tis true indeed, that by reason
of our corrupt Inclinations within, and
powerful Temptations without, this
Way (especially at our first setting out)
is rugged and difficult. So our Lord hath
forewarned us, telling us, That <hi>strait is
the Gate, and narrow is the Way that leadeth
to Life, and that there be few that find it.</hi>
Therefore we should <hi>strive to enter in,</hi>
take great Care and Pains to discern the
Right Way, and to overcome the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of our first Entrance into it;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:56284:244"/>
and should often pray to God, as <hi>David</hi>
did, <hi>Psalm 119. 19. I am a Stranger in
the Earth, hide not thy Commandments from
me;</hi> And <hi>Psalm 139. 23, 24. Search me,
O God, and know my Heart; try me, and
know my Thoughts; and see if there be any
wicked way in me; and lead me in the Way
Everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, if we would always have our
End in our Eye; it would both be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to us in our Way, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to quicken our Pace in it;
there being no more powerful Motive
to a good Life, than to be assured, that
<hi>if we have our Fruit unto Holiness, our
End shall be Everlasting Life.</hi>
