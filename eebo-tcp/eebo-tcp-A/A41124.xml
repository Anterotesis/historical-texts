            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE RICHES OF GRACE.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was never any age or time (Chriſtian Reader) ſince the beginning of the world, how corrupt ſoever, that was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this our thrice unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py age, in all kindes of corruption, wickedneſſe, and ſinne, with griefe of Conſcience I ſpeake it, with weeping I behold it, and with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull heart I lament it, and therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

wickedneſſe doth ſo abound, the Lord (leſt his Children (frozen in the dregs of their ſinnes) ſhould periſh with the wicked) raiſeth up, in his mercy, good men (as we ſee the Author of this Treatiſe, a man of Rare parts) to plucke off the Viſard of ſinne from their faces, and to lay it open to the view of the whole world, to the end that every one may ſee the vileneſſe of his wicked wayes and the filthy dregs of ſinne, throwne in their face; may bluſh at the ſame, be aſhamed, repent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and turne to the Lord Jeſus, and ſo eternally be ſaved.</p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe is drawne to the life, the ſinnes and wickedneſſe of Ungodly men, which deſire not the way of the Lord Jeſus; together with the Excellencies, riches, great value of a bleſſed and gracious ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Treatiſe was a man of a Pretious ſpirit, as may appeare by this and other workes of his in <hi>Print:</hi> A Reverent and worthy Divine gives this Teſtimony in his Commendations, that he was <hi>a Miniſter very Conſcientious, one that had a great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity given him of God to Preach Unto, and worke Upon the hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>

               <hi>of men, to awaken the ſleepie, to informe the erronious, to ſettle the doubtfull, to confirme the wounded; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he was a worthy Divine, both in regard of his unweariſome paines in Preaching, conſuming his owne body to ſave the ſoules of others, as alſo of his learning and Exemplary Piety.</hi> They that knew him did love and reverence him; and if any did diſ-eſteeme him, it was becauſe they did not fully know him. He is now a ſhining ſtar in the firmament of heaven; alſo that there were hundreds of people that will bleſſe God to all Eternity for his paines; he needs not our prayſes, but our imitation.</p>
            <p>It is true that this birth is <hi>Poſthumum opus,</hi> and commeth out after the death of the Author; but I hope it will be the more pleaſing, to revive the memory of him, whoſe life and labours were deſervedly pretious in the eſteeme of Gods people.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe is one of the Sparkes of the zealous (dead, yet living) Author, finiſhed by himſelfe, which might have laine covered in the aſhes of forgetfulneſſe, had it not beene blowne up by one (well minded) which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

So the fooliſh Virgins <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. deſired Oyle in their Lampes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loved light, for their deedes were full of darkeneſſe, but they ſaw they ſhould be ſhut out of heaven

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57091:14"/>
and ſeeme to love it, but when the Goſpell and theſe things part, then they and the Goſpell part alſo. But the true deſire of grace is for the goodneſſe that is in it. <hi>Balaam</hi> could deſire even the very heart of a righteous man, but it was when he ſhould be dying: for he ſaw that if he had it, there was hope of heaven and ſalvation, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt downe to hel. But this deſire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now that the true deſire of grace is not in a wicked man, is cleare from <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 2. where the Prophet ſpeaking of Chriſt, who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57091:14"/>
is the fountaine of all grace, ſaith thus, <hi>There is no forme nor comelines, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty in him that we ſhould deſire him;</hi> this is meant of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, for as the learned have writ, Chriſt had all parts in the perfection of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of his ſoule, for it was repleniſhed with all Divine graces; In him dwelleth the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was beauty enough in him to have raviſhed all Angels, yea all the world, and ten thouſand more if there were ſo many.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57091:15"/>
But men in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate ſee not this; we that are carnall, wee that are ſinfull, we that are in our ſinnes, wee that are not truely changed nor renewed in our mindes, we ſee no beauty in him that we ſhould deſire him; unleſſe hee will bring gold and ſilver, Hawkes and Hounds, Cards &amp; Dice; if he would bring theſe, then we ſhould ſee ſome beauty in him, but if he bring nothing but weeping, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and repentance, the ſtrictneſſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſſe, mortifying and crucifying their earthly members; there
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57091:15"/>
is no beauty in theſe things that wee ſhould deſire him: wicked men may have a Would, but not a willing deſire, they wiſh thus &amp; thus, but as the old Proverbe is, Wiſhers and woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were never good houſhoulders, but there is no true deſire in them of ſaving grace.</p>
            <p>Now as no love is love indeede but true love, otherwiſe it is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; no fire, fire indeed but the true fire; no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, holineſſe indeed but true holineſſe, for otherwiſe it is but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, ſo no deſire is deſire indeede but true deſire.</p>

a wicked man may have a great deale of knowledge, that a child of God cannot ſpeake of more truthes, nor underſtand more than he doth, but though a wicked man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth ſpiritual things yet not ſpiritually, but carnally onely and in a carnall ſenſe: this is the reaſon that a worldling had rather have a 1000. pound than true grace, that the covetous man had rather be in his counting houſe, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his intereſt-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and his gaines, than at the Houſe of God to heare a Sermon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are carnally

and therefore we ſpeak; if a man have grace in his inward ſoule, it will caſt forth a ſavour into his lippes, it will ſeaſon his ſpeech; the voluptuous man talkes of his hounds, and Hawkes; the Drunkard of his cuppes, the worldling of his plough, and cart, and cowes; the trades man of his wares, and the women of their houſholdſtuffe, this or that matter, but ſcarce a word of God, or the worke of grace.</p>

Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſwallow up wrath and hatred, and ſpend 1000. ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in revenge, theſe deſire grace no more than the devill: nay grace will teach a man to deny his luſts, and ſinfull pleaſures, and corrupt deſires: I know many think they deſire grace; O they would have it faine, but they will not have it in Gods ſenſe.</p>
            <p>There was a fool ſent to fetch wood from the ſtacke, hee would not

Juſt ſo it is with all men, all the world hath a ſtacke of ſinne lying upon their backes, and conſciences, now they muſt take away the whole ſtacke before they can be converted: True it is, men pray, O Lord convert me, O Lord give mee thy

            <p>And laſtly, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigne that men have not true deſire of grace, for when grace is offered, then they will not accept of it nor take it. Can a man deſire an hundred pound, and yet when it

pound into the Parſons purſe yearely, and yet may be, they are but 10. or 20. pound in the Kings bookes: it is not ſo with grace, but every pound is a pound, every ſhilling is a ſhilling, yea every farthing is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Gods booke: ſo that if God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee wiſedome, knowledge, riches, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, honours, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talent, know that God hath ſet it downe to a farthing, and thy account ſhall bee as ſtrictly demaunded of thee, if thou haſt not grace. Grace would diſcharge a man of all theſe; when all other
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57091:61"/>
goods are but as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to men to ſinke them to hell.</p>

the diſhes, they might cut them, and yet riſe a hungry, and ſtarve for all the nouriſhment they would give. So men cut the meate, and when that is eaten they caſt away the diſhes; Prayer, Preaching, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they muſt ceaſe, if therefore thou haſt not gotten meate out of thoſe diſhes, if thou haſt not received the grace offered unto thee by them, thou art never the better: thou haſt heard the word, but haſt thou received the ſpirit? thou haſt prayed, but haſt thou gotten grace? thou haſt received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57091:62"/>
but haſt thou received Chriſt, and his graces alſo? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thou haſt nothing. O what a ſtrange thing is it, that men ſhould feede upon diſhes, and not ſeeke after the meate in them, and ſo ſtarve their ſoules! Did the Prodigall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. feede upon his fathers diſhes? No, but on his fat calfe; What though I have a golden key, if it will not open the doore? What good is it for a man to have brave gally pots about him, if there be no phyſicke in them to heale his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? A boate, a boate, cryes the paſſenger,

when he would goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the water; what, is it the boate he deſireth? No, but that hee may paſſe over the water. We cry out a Sermon, a Sermon, a prayer, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but to what end? wee ſhould deſire them as a meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God conveyeth grace, uſing them as boates carrying us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holineſſe, to faith, love, meekeneſſe, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, &amp;c. otherwiſe thou wilt bee never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for if a man have a hundred boates, yet if they cannot carry him over the water, what is he the nearer for them? if a man have heard an

hundred Sermons, and have as many prayers, and Sacraments, yet if thereby hee have not grace, nor be carried to holineſſe and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the day of Judgement, he ſhall be at the fartheſt part of the River, of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of bleſſedneſſe.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> No good can ſatisfie but onely grace: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 8.  <hi>All things are full of labour, the eye is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare filled with hearing:</hi> ſuppoſe the eye ſhould ſee all the brave and beautifull things in the world, yet the eye is not ſatisfied with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: ſuppoſe a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57091:64"/>
man ſhould heare all the melodious muſique, yet would not the eare be ſatisfied. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came to draw water at <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, <hi>John</hi> 4. 13. our Saviour tells her, <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of this water, ſhall thirſt againe,</hi> theſe things may allay for a time, but not quench a mans thirſt. For give a covetous man never ſo much wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet his thirſt is not quenched, but there is roome for him to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet againe. Give <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> one world and he will aske for another. Thou art ſick and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt health, thou haſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57091:64"/>
health, yet thou deſireſt ſomething elſe: thou art in Priſon, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt liberty; when thou haſt it, doeſt thou leave off deſiring? No, but thou wouldſt have ſome other thing. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man were worth ten pound, he deſireth to be worth twenty; and when be hath that, hee deſireth an hundred, and ſo a thouſand pound. All the goods in the world is like Ale-houſe Beere, which the travailor drinketh of, but it doth not quench his thirſt; a man can never ſatisfie his deſire, with any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good. If thou
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57091:65"/>
wouldſt have that which will ſatisfie thee, then deſire grace, for grace is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the ſoule. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thou hadſt all the brave ſights in the world, yet thou couldſt not ſee them with thine eyes; ſuppoſe thou hadſt all the ſweete Muſique in the world, yet thou couldſt not heare it; for the ſights are the objects of the eyes, and Muſique of the eares. So all the good things of the world are but for the body, not for the ſoule; riches, honours, pleaſures, and the like, are the objects of the body, and not of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57091:65"/>
ſoule, and therefore the ſoule can never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with them. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his meditations ſpeakes thus, Lord thou haſt made my ſoule for thy ſelfe, and it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at reſt, till it can find reſt in thee. The ſoule is like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove which could finde no reſt (the waters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing the earth) till ſhe returned to <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke againe: ſo unleſſe thy heart hath found God, and bee drawne up to him the center of it; thou mayſt wander up and downe the whole world, and yet never have content. Couldeſt thou get
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57091:66"/>
wealth, honour, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, health, and the like, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace the ſoule is empty, and hath not ſatisfaction. They are all tranſitory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Suppoſe a man could have the world, and yet loſe it againe, it would more vexe him and diſquiet him than if he had never had it. Hence it is that a poore begger, that hath alwayes endured want, can beare it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a broken Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that hath lived in wealth and pleaſures in former time, want and neceſſity is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57091:66"/>
times more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to him: <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 23. 5.) <hi>caſt thine eye upon that which is nothing? for riches taketh her to her wings, as an Eagle that flyeth to the Heavens:</hi> he doth not ſay that riches flyeth like a hawke which by a whiſtle or ſome other meanes will come to the Faulkoner againe; but is like an Eagle, which no Art under heaven can bring backe againe; all thy riches, all thy honours, haſt thou never ſo much of them, they cannot continue long with thee; for either they will leave thee, or thou
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57091:67"/>
muſt leave them at the houre of death, then out goes the ſoule, and God knowes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it may be the more honours thou haſt, and riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, preferments, &amp;c. the worſe thy caſe is, and the greater thy condemnation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe they were permanent, yet they are unnaturall to the ſoule; Can a horſe feede upon fleſh, or a Lyon upon ſtraw? ſo my beloved, can a mans ſoule feede upon ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and pounds? can a mans ſoule feede up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on luſts, and pleaſures and vanities? No, the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57091:67"/>
ſoule is of a ſpirituall ſubſtance, and therefore cannot be ſatisfied with worldly contentments: as it is with the body, ſo it is with the ſoule in this, the neceſſity of the body, and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof is not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſpirituall things, but with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo a ſpirituall empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe muſt haue a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repleniſhment: Can a man fill a houſe with grace? No, a houſe is a body, and therefore muſt have houſhold ſtuffe, and the like, which are bodies to fill it: ſo the ſoule which is incorporeall is not filled with bodies,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57091:68"/>
with ſilver and gold, or any thing in the world; for all the honours, pleaſures, and the like, in the world, are bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honours, bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and therefore cannot fill a ſpirituall emptineſſe; the foole, that our Saviour ſpeaks of <hi>Luke</hi> 12. ſhewed himſelfe to be a foole indeede, in that hee ſayd to his ſoule, <hi>Soule take thy eaſe, thou haſt much goods layd up for many yeares, verſ.</hi> 19. whereas al thoſe goods did onely concerne his body, for notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all them, his ſoule was miſerable, empty,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57091:68"/>
and wicked; his body indeed had much goods, much ſilver and gold layd up for many years, but his ſoule had never a ragge.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the ſoule it ſelfe is unſatiable, and therefore nothing can ſatisfie it. The ſoules of men ever ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy of the ſoule from God, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, have wandred up and downe like Devils, men run one after this luſt, another after that, one after this profit, that preferment, yet finde no reſt in any thing. It is the curſe of God upon mans ſoule, becauſe it would not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57091:69"/>
reſt on God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould not reſt on any thing elſe; the ſoule ſhall never have ſatisfaction, unleſſe grace bring it backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the ſame God, from whence it hath fallen, and ſo ſet it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and Chriſt: A wicked man may ſay he is contented, and he thankes God he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but the reaſon is, becauſ he thinks he hath grace too, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry him to heaven: for if that wicked men knew that they had no grace, or that they had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to free them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hel, were they never
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57091:69"/>
ſo rich, honourable, &amp;c. yet they could have but cold comfort. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. 2. <hi>doe you lay out your ſilver, and not for bread, and your labour without being ſatisfied?</hi> Why doe you beſtow all your thoughts and meditations, all your paines and labours to get the world, to get gaine and preferment, to ſatisfie your luſts? Know this is not bread, it is a Scorpion; it is not fiſh, but a Serpent; will you feede your bodies with them for a while, and ſtarve your ſoules for ever? Suppoſe thou hadſt got all that thou
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57091:70"/>
canſt deſire of theſe goods, and thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to lye upon thy death-bed, afflicted with many paines and aches of thy body, and troubled with the ſtings of an accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in thy ſoule, ſome man would tell thee of thy great honours and preferments, of thy large revenewes, and preſent thy golden cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and ſhould ſay; Sir why doe you complaine of paines, and aches, and agonies? thinke of theſe things: alas, they cannot give eaſe to the leaſt of thy torments, they cannot ſhelter thy ſoule from that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57091:70"/>
doomes ſentence, <hi>Goe ye curſed into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fire:</hi> it is not gold nor ſilver, nor all the wealth in the world, that can deliver a ſinner from the wrath of God: wouldſt thou have true good? God is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good; he is good in the higheſt perfection, he is an abſolute good without evill, all other good hath its mixture of ſorrow, griefe, and hatred, with love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and joy. But God is the onely good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>The deſire of the Righteous is onely good,</hi> he deſires God, and Chriſt, and the eternall love of God in Chriſt
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57091:71"/>
to be manifeſted unto him, and therein hee roules and reſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but the hope of the wicked is indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee onely deſires the baſe pelfe of the world, but the wrath of heaven is with it, and he ſhall bewaile his owne ſoule, that for ſuch baſe things hee ſhould refuſe the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good and neglect it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is eminent in all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all other good hath for the moſt part but one good in it, or three at the moſt, meate will not cloath a man, nor cloth will not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57091:71"/>
feede a man, but in God there is all good, infinitely greater than mans ſoule is or can be capable of. Doſt thou deſire Riches? goe to God, and then thou ſhalt have all that thou canſt deſire. Doſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire honour, and length of dayes, even eternity? goe to God. When a man goes to one place for food, they muſt goe to another place for cloathes; ſhouldeſt thou goe to the Drapers ſhop for cloathes, then thou muſt goe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place for meate. Thou takeſt an hundred wayes in vaine that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt after the things of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57091:72"/>
this world; if thou wouldſt goe to God, thou might'ſt have all thy deſires accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and all thy wants ſupplyed at once in him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is ſuch a good that without him nothing is good, when thou deſireſt gold, thou deſireſt not the earth, but the good of it; if thou couldſt have the good uſe of it, thou wouldſt not deſire the earthen matter of it: the good of gold and ſilver, of apparell and the like, is from God; whatſoever good it be, if God be not in it, it is not its ſelfe;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57091:72"/>
thou haſt money in thy purſe, if thou haſt not God alſo in thy heart, it is not treaſure, but canker; thou that art cloathed with never ſuch coſtly garments, if withall thou art not cloathed with Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, they are not garments to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, but badges of thy loathſomeneſſe, and nakedneſſe before God; the gold, of thy gold; the honour, of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; the pleaſure and delight of thy delights; the garment, of thy garments; is Gods love in them all. In joy God, and thou haſt good of them all, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:57091:73"/>
63. 1. <hi>O God thou art my God, my ſoule thirſteth after thee, my fleſh longeth greatly after thee, in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and dry land without water;</hi> a barren good, the Juyce &amp; ſap of the heart, and the roote of all good is from God alone.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God is ſuch a good, that if thou haſt him not for thy great good, who is of all infinite goodneſſe to his people, who have choſen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for their onely good; The ſame God will be a God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite terrour and wrath to all ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, and choſen

grace; grace, or elſe thou periſheſt; grace, or elſe thou dyeſt; get grace, or elſe thou art damned in hell for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
