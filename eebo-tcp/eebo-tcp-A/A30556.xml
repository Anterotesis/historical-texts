            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Lord had a people in all generations, unto whom he was a God, and they feared him, and served him, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped him, and his name was pretious amongst them, who were his chosen people, and with whom he dwelt, and his power and presence was amongst his people that did walk with him, under what name soever they went in the world; but the first time that ever the people of the Lord were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Christians,</hi> or was known by that name from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the time of the Apostles, who were followers of Christ, as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. <hi>And the disciples were called Christians first in</hi> Antioch, and before that time the people of the Lord were never called Christians, and this name was given to them by the Heathen, because they were for Christ and of his part, and did follow him, and preach him to be followed, and in all things exalted his name, and did and suffered all things for the Name of Christ, therefore were they named Christians, and that name was true unto them, for they had upon them the express image and character of Christ, and followed his Spirit, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him unto all people for life and salvation, and that all people might come to Christ and become followers of him, and therefore they were rightly named Christians, to be known by that name from all other people upon earth, who were not followers of Christ, who could not rightly be called Christians, because they were not of his part; and from thenceforth unto this day, all people whatsoever that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Christ, and became followers of him, and that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, were called Christians, from that original and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the name which then was laid, also you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 28. v. <hi>And</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Again, the Christians <hi>were begotten of God, and born of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 18. <hi>and they were born of the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coruptible seed;</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23. <hi>and they were created in Christ Iesus unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2. 10. <hi>and they were new Creatures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

            <p>But now also, woful are you Christians degenerated from this; for thousands upon thousands of you are not born nor begotten of God, though you have the name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, neither are you born of the word of God which lives for ever, nor of the incoruptible seed, neither are created again: nor become new creatures; nor have put off the body of sin and death, neither are the servants of righteousness, nor free from sin.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, are the servants of sin, and free from righteousness, and are in the corruptible state, and are old creatures, and are not washed, nor purified, as the Saints were, as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. and here is a woful degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christians now, from what the Christians were in the beginning: the Christians then were new creatures; and put off the body of sin, and were washed, and sanctified; but the Christians now, are not so, but the contrary, to wit, unwashed and unsanctified, remaining in the pollutions of the world, and are of the birth which is born of the flesh, and are in the old nature, serving sin and the lusts of their own hearts, and thus are you fallen from that which the true Christians possessed; for being compared to them, you are

not agreeable but rather contrary to them in all these things; and the Lord is now come to search you and to try you; and to all people shall you be discovered, for the Lord is now risen to bring all to tryal and to judgement;</p>
            <p>And again, herein will the Apostacy of the Christians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in respect of unity and fellowship, for the Christians in their beginning while yet the life of God was not darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongst them, they were <hi>of one heart, and one mind, and one soul</hi> as you may read, <hi>Acts the</hi> 4. 32. and the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that he would give unto <hi>his people one heart and one way:</hi> and <hi>Ezek</hi> the 11. 19. the Lord promised to give <hi>his people one heart and a new spirit:</hi> which promise the Christians received, and they that believed <hi>were of one beart</hi> and there was no lack amongst them, but some sold their possessions, and distributed to them that had need: and they were members of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he was head amongst them, and over them: and they were <hi>flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5. 23. 30. and all the Christians were <hi>of one faith,</hi> Eph. 45. and had unity and fellowship in the life which was made manifest in them; for they had tasted and handled, and seen, and heard, the word of life, and they had fellowship with the father, and with his son Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But all ye Christians upon earth, how are you degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and how great is your fall in this, for you are not of one heart and mind, nor in unity and fellowship one with another, but are of divers sorts &amp; sects, and are run into many opinions, and devisions, and are of many ways, and minds, and hearts; divers sorts there are of Papists, and divers sorts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
