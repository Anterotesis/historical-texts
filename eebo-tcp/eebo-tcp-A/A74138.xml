         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his EXCELLENCIE the LORD GENERAL CROMWELL, and his Honourable Councel of the Army at WHITE-HALL.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Petition of ARISE EVANS, living in Black friers, deſireth in Gods glories behalf, the Kingdoms behalf, your Honours behalf, and on the whole Worlds behalf: That you would with your Moſt ſerious thoughts conſider theſe few lines following.</head>
            <opener>Humbly ſhewing,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the <hi>Petitioner,</hi> having the knowledge of Gods ſecret Counſel, being called thereto, hath declared it freely to all, theſe 19. years, as you may ſee in his book called <hi>[AVoice from Heaven,]</hi> Written in the year 1651. and directed to the Common-wealth of <hi>England:</hi> And alſo further the preparation of God in him to the ſame purpoſe from his Nativitie to this time: And the effects thereof you have alſo in his book called <hi>[An Eccho to the voice from Heaven,]</hi> Written in 1652 In which books is ſufficiently ſhewed Gods determination by the actions God hath done, in fullfilling the words of your <hi>Petitioner,</hi> from the date of the ſaid books to this time, &amp; you may conclude God will fulfill the remainder thereof, ſo that, as ſure as the Parliament is diſſolved, ſo ſure ſhall the <hi>King</hi> come to his <hi>Throne.</hi> As it is ſufficiently proved in the aforeſaid books: And indeed if your Honours look into your Petitioners works, and ſeriouſly read his books, you ſhall finde that <hi>he would not turn water into bloud, or ſmite the Earth with a Curſe, Rev.</hi> 11.6. as it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been done by theſe unnatural Civil Wars, but rather would turn bloud into water, and water into wine, to cheriſh the heart of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull: And that the waters and tears of Repentance might waſh away the guilt of bloud, and become wine of conſolation to this Nation, in their Union with their KING. Without which conjunction to their Native and right KING, there is no hopes of peace, certainty, and ſafety to this Nation.</p>
            <p>Moſt Noble Worthies, whoſe actions are glorious, though yet imperfect, the great Mountain Parliament is become a plain before you: Next in order the KING is to be exalted, ſignified by the head-ſtone, as you ſee <hi>Zachar.</hi> 4.7. Crown all your actions by ſetting him up, and be glorious for ever: for I am ſure, if you ſpeedily proclaim him KING, you will glorifle God thereby, and ſave an Ocean of <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud from being ſpilt, and have ſuch conditions of perfect peace from GOD and the KING, that you and your ſeed may be his glorious Nobles for ever: And therefore, becauſe time is ſhort, uſe your Jewel for the beſt advantage, while you have it, leaſt you looſe it, as the ſaid Parliament did, for want of uſing it aright, according to the Petitioners inſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Petitioner <hi>doth humbly deſire your Honours, to ſet up the</hi> KING <hi>upon his Throne,</hi> (Charles Stewart <hi>by Name.</hi>) <q>
                  <hi>Do this and live for ever,</hi>

               </q>

            <p>He Humbly deſires you alſo to reade theſe ſaid books.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Did not think to put this <hi>Petition</hi> into print ſo ſuddenly, but that I finde the general ſpirit of the Nations, and men of all ſorts of judgements exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſquieted, as not knowing what to do at this time, but crying to me, as if they expected that God will do ſome great things by me for the ſettlement and peace of this Nation: It is truth, I dare not deny it, and to Gods glorie be it ſpoken, that I have received Talents from him which I muſt not hide, but ſhew to all how far God is pleaſed to proceed in his work by me: beſeeching all men to look unto him, who is the Man of Peace, to them I mean <hi>King CHARLES:</hi> Every one ſaith to me, why do not you, who have this wiſdom of God, go to the General and ſhew him the way, and to the Councel to ſhew them theſe things? Alas! I am at too far a diſtance from them, for to be heard by them: Men in ſuch places, cannot hear ſuch a low voice as mine is; it muſt be a general <hi>Petition</hi> of the whole Nation joyned together as one Man, that they will hear: Therefore I could wiſh that the Soldiery did but hear a voice behinde them, ſaying, Return to your firſt principles: You went out to fight for <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but now there's none: I know, that God will bring in the <hi>King</hi> again, and my hearts deſire is that I might perſwade men that the <hi>Kings</hi> coming to his Throne might be without bloud-ſhed, and that no party ſhould any longer retain a ſpirit of revenge; And to ſet you in a way of compoſure, I could wiſh, that all (both Souldiers and others) would Petition our worthy Senatours, to make their peace with the <hi>King,</hi> and to receive him upon good and glorious terms, for the <hi>King;</hi> and ſubjects: For it the <hi>King</hi> come in by the ſword, you will become Slaves, and force him to uſe Tyranny: For Tyranny is a fit puniſhment for Rebels; Neithor would I have any to Petition our Worthies with kiſſes, or fine words, as <hi>Judas</hi> came to our Saviour, that had his band of men to ſecond him, or as at the beginning of theſe times the <hi>Scots Presbyters</hi> and Covenanters came with their Petition on their Pikeſ-points to our late <hi>King:</hi> Let not men preſume to do ſo now, be their party never ſo great: For though now they think that the Authority hath a dependency upon them, and that there is no Authority left ſave that: Yet there is a ſpark of fire remaining (as it were) under the aſhes, which is able at an inſtant to devour them all.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you, Petition in ſimplicity and ſingleneſs of heart, to deſire the General and his Councel to make their addreſſes to the <hi>King</hi> for peace, and ye that do this, look for life eternal: And I beſeech you again (Moſt noble Worthies) receive all alike, and doe not countenance, or diſcountenance any, for this notion, or for that notion, or think, that Religion is onely words, but rather deeds of common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and let not any be prided, or exalted above their Brethren with a conceit of conqueſt, but know, that ſuch a minde ſhall be abaſed; and that according to our Chriſtian rule, he that ſuffered moſt is the greateſt Conquerour: For a ſubject cannot Conquer his <hi>King</hi> but by ſuffering meekly, and a <hi>King</hi> ſuffering meekly by the hand of his people, according to the minde of his <hi>King,</hi> was appointed to be Heir of the World, <hi>Revel. 21.7</hi> I have a bloudy Viſion to ſhew, but I look upon it as Gods threatning hand, being perſwaded, that if we repent, and ſhed tears for our Rebellion and evil deeds againſt God and the <hi>King,</hi> we ſhall not bleed, nor ſhed bloud: For why may not God bring the <hi>King</hi> to his Throne, and maintain our peace, as well in that time, as he did when the Parliament was diſſolved: And to men I ſay, he that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and hath an innocent intention may do much. And the Lord bleſs all ſuch. <hi>Amen.</hi>
