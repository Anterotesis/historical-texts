            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The maine point of the controuerſie is, <hi>Whether William Summers was poſſeſſed and diſpoſſeſſed, yea or no.</hi> Whereby there is called into queſtion a matter of fact, a greater then which, can not almoſt fall out to bee deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among the ſonnes of men, namelie touchinge the malice of Satan, and maruellous authoritie of our Lorde IESVS.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a witch by the Queenes Iuſtices, accordinge as in the Treatiſe following is declared) Now to the end there might bee gained ſome ſupplement of proofe to giue colour to the pretended counterfeiting betwene M. <hi>Darrell</hi> and <hi>Som.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Darling</hi> and others haue bin examined vpon their othes by the aforenamed Biſh. &amp; drawen to confeſſe contrarie to the trueth, as them ſelues haue auouched, that <hi>Darling</hi> was a meere counterfeit, and was neither poſſeſſed nor bewitched. Whereby the iudgment giuen by the Queenes Iuſtices againſt the ſaid Alice, for bewitching of <hi>Darling,</hi> is directly <hi>deſeated &amp; impeached,</hi> eſpeciallie, if Sentence ſhould be giuen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For if <hi>Darling</hi> did counterfeit, then hee was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched: and if he was not bewitched, then was the iudgement and execution againſt <hi>Alice Goodridge</hi> erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly and wrongfullie awarded. Whether this practiſe may ſtande with the ſtatute of <hi>Proviſion and Premunire,</hi> and with the honour which is due to the Temporall Courts, your LL. wiſdomes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſt determine.

            <p>By this ſhort recapitulation of indirect proceedinges, and that in a matter concerning Chriſt our common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, contrarie to the Royall commaundement of our moſt gracious and ſoucraine Lady the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, hir Iawes and lawfull liberties of hir loyall ſubiects, you ſee what cauſe I haue to exhiblie this ſhort <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> vnto your LL. humblie crauing that you would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe ſome ſpare time to read it ouer: aſſuring my ſelfe, that though it be penned in ſimplicitie without colours and pompe of humane learning, yet it will leaue ſuch

There are beſides theſe diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as the drawing of his mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, ſometimes to th' one eare, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to th' other: the ſetting of his face againſt his backe: a violent bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his face &amp; head to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the caſting of him ſelf headlong againſt the vvalles, and poſtes of the houſe, ſo as one would haue thought hee would haue ſpoyled or bruiſed him ſelfe greatlie thereby, yet recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he no hurt at all: the gatheringe of him ſelf of a rouud heape, &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>If theſe things, moſt ſtraunge and admirable, can bee done by any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſkill, I denie not but that hee may be a counterfeite: but vntill that ſhall appeare, I muſt needs ſubſcribe them to ſome ſupernatural power, &amp;

For firſt he ſaid and proteſted, that he did not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he did diſſemble, after again that he did not, and laſtlie, he ſaith &amp; faceth it out, that he did counterfeit: Why ſhould we rather beleue him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming then denying, ſeeing (I ſay) he hath ſaide both wayes and alike times of both: yea vvho that is vviſe will giue credit to ſuch a double and falſe tongue? Conſidering alſo hovve notoriouſlie wicked he is: For take him at the beſt, and as him ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would faine haue you: He is an infamous deceauer, hauing faigned to be poſſeſt with a Deuill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (if it were ſo) prophaned the holy

vvorde of God, and the holy exerciſe of prayer and faſting: beſides he is as notorious a lyar as euer was heard or read of, and by conſequent the child of the Deuill, yea not onely a lyar but a forſworn wretch, for he hath ſworn both wayes: laſtlie, he is an horrible blaſphemer, for hee hath ſaide that there is no God, and ſometimes theſe wordes, <hi>I am God,</hi> as is depoſed. Theſe things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, doe not they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie forget themſelues which wil haue <hi>Will.

conceyue nor thinke anie other. 3. It is there reported, in his traunces hee vttered certaine ſpeeches there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned, with his mouth wide open, <note place="margin">Tho.

Moreouer, the Witch <hi>Alice Goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge</hi> by name, ſundry times confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſhe miſtaking <hi>Tho.

But hereof as ſhe will cleare me, ſo it hath not hitherto bin ſaid, that ſhee hath any hande in this counterfeit accuſation, why then doe any charge that vpon me? For ſhe in all reaſon is (at leaſt) as ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with him as I, or any private chriſtian: And therefore alſo I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke not the meanes for <hi>So.</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, till I had three other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to ioyne with me: yea I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the faithfull prayers of

the parties friends may prevaile with God in this caſe: though no Preacher be preſent, as in the diſpoſſeſſion of <hi>Thom. Darling</hi> it was evident. Onely this I holde, that one being poſſeſſed, prayer &amp; faſting is to bee vſed for the caſting out of Sathan, as a meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to that end. And this I doubt not, but I am able to prove by the holy ſcriptures, &amp; further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by the teſtimonies of auncient and late Writers, and by the practiſe of the Church in all ages, &amp; the good ſucceſſe thereof.</p>
