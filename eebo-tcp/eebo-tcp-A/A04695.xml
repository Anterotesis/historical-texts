         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That Adulteres should not be punished,

               </gap>beinge the iust desyers of

the world to drawe faste to an

God sodenly to destroye all, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

be more godly counsel, to punish iustely
this great cryme so wyde spred into so
greate hurt aud corrupcuion of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and comon wealthe. Right heauye
maye euery Christen hert be to se synne
and wickednes take suche strength and

courage in a Christen realme, that any
man vnder any pretence of holines and
charite shoulde stande forthe to defende
the cause of so notable sinners vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
To whome this patrone of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
geueth his sinfull counsell, I can
not tell, he is so sliper a serpent of so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
colors of contradicions, correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions

To geue this counsell to auye priuate

in vayne. For no priuate persone vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the office of a publique Magistrate
in punishinge this open cryme wyth

<pb facs="tcp:21170:6"/>
allowed it for a iust dede, that pacifyed
his wrath. So hainously hateth God the
synne. Yf thys wryter be so malepert,
as to geue his counsel to the kinges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
and to his counsell, he condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
hym selfe two maner wyse by hys
owne wordes, ones he taketh the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite
oute of their handes to punyshe
them wyth deathe, callynge it <q>the cruell
seueryte of Moses lawe nowe abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and maye no more be put in vre.
Another is thys: He sayth: That yf the
tranquyllite of the comon wealth requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
deathe for the offence, and the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
make the lawe,</q> he sayth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
it. But yet he constantly affyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it, that law to be neither profitable
nor necessarye. Wherof it foloweth him
to consent to a lawe neyther necessarye,
nor profytable. But I argewe thus:
What so euer lawe perteyneth to the
publique tranquillite of Christes church
and conseruacion of the comon wealth,
the same is bothe profitable aud necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.
But Goddes sawe is to punyshe
adultery with deathe for the tranquillite
and comon wealth of his church: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hys lawe is bothe necessarye, and
<pb facs="tcp:21170:6"/>
profytable. But here this man wyl deny
the minor, and saye that lawe was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but to the Iewes, and is nowe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated.
But hys sayinge is false: for
this lawe of punishement wyth death is
the lawe of nature, whereof the ten pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
are grounded, and can not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated.
Neyther is there any lawe abro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gated,
whyche beareth in it selfe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure
of God, &amp; the loue to oure neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
but to punish adultery wyth death
pertayneth to Goddes honoure in hys
worde to be obeyed and obserued for the
loue of oure neyghboures, whiche els
shoulde suffer intollerabler iniuries,
then to haue all hys goodes taken from
hym: wherfore it ought to be more puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
then theft. Is not a mans wyfe, or
husbande, or doughter, or seruaunt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer

Christ bode this particlare thefe, or that
murtherer by name to suffer death? But
tell me (I praye you) sayd not Christ: I
am not come to breake the lawe, but to
fulfill it? Christ consequently approued
and confirmed the iudicial lawes saing:
Whoso killeth, is bounde gilty the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And Paul affirmeth the Magistrates

then to declare his highe conninge, he

punished, that is to say, to haue thre flap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes
with a fox tayle for breakinge holye
wedlocke, orels it is as yet no lawe at
al. For it is yet but vnder his consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
which yf it be deathe, it shalbe by
this man nether profitable nor necessary
ergo it is an naughty and wicked lawe.
Thus ye se his fonde presumpcion to
make Gods lawe to geue place to hys
newe lawe, whiche is yet to be made, so
<pb facs="tcp:21170:26"/>
that in the meane ceason they may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
adultery frely vnpunished. But yf the
olde lawe concerninge the punishement,
for breakinge Goddes commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
had bene abrogated, as this wryter
falsely sayth. Christ woulde neuer haue
so oft alledged it agaynst the Pharisais
for the defence and confirmacion of his
doctrine and dedes. He tolde them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly:
That God commaunded it, that
whoso curseth father or mother shoulde
die. Yf this had bene abrogated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
coming, christ would not haue alled<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged

same iudiciall lawe stode in strength af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his coming, as the other lyke lawes
iudicial do, as honor thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.
But this man sayth: It was sayde
to the Iewes and not to vs: whiche yf it
were true, so were we not bounde to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

            <p>
               <q>Or els (sayth he) yf nothinge be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
wherfore are there two testaments?
wherfore hath not the former continued

be abrogated and abolished?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This man should haue learned of Paul
<pb facs="tcp:21170:27"/>
what thinges and lawes be abrogated,
and whiche partes yet stande in effecte,
and wherfore they were abrogated as he
writeth Hebr .vij. That is, euen for their
weakenes, inutilite and imperfeccion
there declared at length. But the morall
and iudicial lawes did bere in them no
imperfeccion, no weakenes nor inutilite,
but the honor of God and conseruacion
of his comon weal by loue mutual, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are not abrogated, as this man
blasphemeth. Yf he had considered the

There shal not one iot ne title passouer,

one couenaunt or testament in substance
and two in the maner of deliueraunce of
the same. For to oure fathers was it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to worship one God in spirit, in faith
in innocencie of liuinge, they had one
rightwismakinge and one redempcion,
and did se with vs in faith and hope one
<pb facs="tcp:21170:29"/>
sacrifice Iesus Christ. But because the
maner of the delyueraunce varied as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chinge
the tyme, persons and the figures
of the verite, therfore in two diuerse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes
one thing hath two accidentary
names, which thinge Paul considering
sayth: Al things happened to them in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
but not so vnto vs, for we haue
him in verite. They reioysed in externe, &amp;
we in spiritual thinges. Wherfore that
geuinge of the lawe, wherby the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was then set forth by figures and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
to the olde fathers, is nowe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the old testament. But that religion
wherby Christ, whiche hath fulfilled all
thinges in the lawe and prophetes nowe
beynge only al in al thinges is deliuered
and geuen vs in very dede withoute all
figures, is now called the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Not therfore because the fathers had not
then Christ, the grace of the Gospel and
remission of their synnes, but because in
comparison of the olde, and for that the
very body at his presence hath abolished
the ceremoniall shadowes and figures.
And this muche be sayde for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

               <q>Yf Adulterers shoulde be punished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge

            <p>Here he declareth his minde playnely,

               </gap>lterers ought not to be punished
because Christ remitted the Adulteres.
Howe soeuer this man wil nowe seke &amp;
hunte for euasions to glose and pot oute
his boke sayinge, that he ment the vse
of the lawe or of the malediccion therof
to be abrogated, yet as it is playne, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the iust vse execucion nor the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diccion
is abrogated and abolished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Adulterers, but from the iustifyed by
fayth in an innocent lyfe, so do this, and
al his other argumentes tende into thys
scope and ende, that Adulterers oughte
not to be punished, nether by deathe, nor
by any other payne. For this is his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
<pb facs="tcp:21170:32"/>
Christ punished not the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res,
but absolued her, and his example
ought to be folowed of euery Christian,
ergo no man oughte to punishe Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
but let them go quiete, absolued, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>punished.
But I answere this man in
fewe wordes, as I answered him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n,
and also other which did set him vp to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uicte
me in this argument and other, yf
they had coulde at that tyme. Because
his father sent him then to saue synners
and not to geue sentence of deathe as a
iudge, he came then himself to be iudged
and to be killed and not to slaye in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement,
he woulde not then take vpon
him the office of a seculare Magistrate,
but refused to diuyde the heretage, and
then, when they woulde haue made him
a kynge he came to constitute a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
kyngedome, wherin he raygneth by
his worde for euer. This man shoulde
haue considered who they were, that
brought the Adulteresse to him, and for
what entent, not to haue Moses law iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stely
executed, but to trap Christ. Wher
he then taughte all iudges and accusers
of other, to be pure in them selues, leste
in accusinge and condempni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge other
<pb facs="tcp:21170:33"/>
they accuse and condempne them selues.
Also this learned man must learne, that
yf Christ had condempned her there stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
alone without sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wytnes, he
had broken his father lawe, whyche he
came to fulfill. And then had the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis
and Scribes the thinge they hunted
fore. To this he bringeth in saint Paul,
exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating the incestuose Corinth.
I answere lykewyse (as I did then by
mouthe) Paule was no seculare Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
he was a priuate preacher, hauing
power to edifye and not to destroy with
deathe him, whome he knewe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and to be conuerted to the churche
by suche delyueringe to Satan. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
hauinge the ecclesiastik kayes, and
censure did he binde and lose him, as
Christ commaunded. But howe formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
is and was that censure to that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it appereth .ij. Corinth .vij. and I haue
sayd it before. Neyther was there then in
that cyty anye seculare Christen Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
as ye se it .i. Cor .vi. to execute the
lawe vpon suche offenders. Neyther is
it a good argument, Christ nor Paule
iudged none to deathe, ergo Adulterers
&amp; murtherers ought not to be punished,
<pb facs="tcp:21170:33"/>
with deathe. Nether is it a iust argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
Magistrates neglecte their office in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stely
punishinge malefactors, ergo the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
murtherers and Adulterers maye
synne vnpunished. Then this man brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth
another argument to proue Adulte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers
not to be punished oute of the .vij.

            </p>
            <p>Yf he take &amp; putte his adulterers in the

to marye his Adulterers to Christe,
takinge the members of an herlet to cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
them to Christ. But it rather thus fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
Adulterers haue forsaken Christ
and haue maried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to their flesh
and to the deuyll, and therfore shal God
iustely destroye them. For that they are
vnder the curse and punishement of the
lawe iudiciall .i. Tim .i. Tell vs, are your
Adulterers vnder the lawe, that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to synne not yet knowne to them

Goddes fauour iustified? Before ye said
the whole vniuersall lawe was abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and so to be no lawe, lefte to punishe
them: wherfore they must be now after
you (as ye here woulde proue it) vnder
grace, vnder a godly grace haue ye put
them: euen vnder a lawles lycenciouse
libertye to synne vnpunished, maryed to
Christ, saye you: God is highly beholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to suche a mariage maker, and so are all
Adulterers, so to couple them to Christe
their spouse. Yf they be not vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law
so is theyr olde housbande, the lawe and
synne knowne by it, deade from them, &amp;
they delyuered from this their former,
olde wyfe maryed to Christ: whyche yf
it be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they no more Adulterers.
Paul sayth with many expresse wordes
that he (whose former wyfe is thus dead
and he losed by her deathe, maryed to
Christ the newe man) is suche one as is
dead from synne, regeuered into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

For they do that as the lawe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
not for feare of the lawe, but
of a redy courage and of a faythfull hert

in deade. But Adultrrers are maried to
synne, and therfore are they vnder the
lawe to be punished therby. Where ye

their open adultery theft and murther?
What wyll ye then do with youre softe

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vse of the

for whom the lawe iudiciall is not
ordined (as Paul sayth) as thoughe the
lawe had the sawe vse, strength and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
vpon iust and vniust, wysely.</p>
            <p>Then he bringeth in the example of the
brason serpent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to Christ, which
<q>(the price payd for synne) shoulde put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

may hisse but to stinge he can not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lo, the lawe may hisse at his Adulterers
that is, geue them a flap with a foxtaile,
and hurte them not. He woulde the iuste
lawes of God to lese their strengthe by
Christes cominge (whiche came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll
them, and not to breake them) that
they shoulde not condempne Adulterers
wherof Paul sayth, the letter, that is, the
lawe slayth. But he sayth, the lawe now
ruleth: whome? Euen them that will not
be ruled, and not to bynde them to their
owne wiues. What a regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and bond
of the lawe this man dremeth, I can not
tel. Paul sayth out of Osee: That nether
the stinge of death, whiche is synne, nor
the strength and power of the sin, which
is the lawe, shal not be taken away, tyll
Christ hath put al his enimies vnder his
fete, and delyuered vp his kingedome to
his father. But be lyke this man imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
suche an holy churche in this world
as shalbe after domes daye: when all
rightwisnes onlye shal dwell upon the
earthe .ij. Pet .iij. But ye shall knowe,
when Christ came, he payd the price for
al penitent synners, and true beleuers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
receyued the benefite of their redempcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:21170:37"/>
and not for comon Adulterers that will
not receyue Christ and his lawes. For
Christ is no gift to them, that wil not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue
him. Christes bloude is no suche a
gift to them that thrust it from them by
infidelite, trede it vnder their fete, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne
so rich a redempcion. Of which
sorte are they, that thincke adultery to be
no synne, ne punishe worthy, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute
all feare of God and man persiste
in their filthy lyuinge. Christ expowned
that similitude of the brason serpent far
otherwyse, then this man wresteth it for
Adulterers. He applyed it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleuers
in him, sayinge: As Moses exalted the
serpent in the wyldernes, so must the
sonne of man be lifted vp on the crosse,
that al that beleue in him peryshe not: he
sayth not, that Adulterers (whose lyfe
sheweth them not to beleue in Christ) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
not, nor yet to not be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
iuste punishment of the lawe. For they
that loked not vp to the serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christ by
fayth, hanginge vpon the crosse, dyed of
the serpents stinginge. Neyther is the
stinge of the lawe plukt out of them that
loked not vp to the brasen serpent. And
therfore ye are but a peruerter of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

wordes. Then in alledginge Austen
ye condempne your selfe. For he speketh

holde vs yet he setteth before vs another
barre to brydle vs from the acte saying:
Thou shalt not commit adultery, nor
steall, nor kyl, &amp;c. And yf this barre wil
not hold vs, then hath he constituted the
Magistrates wyth his lawes to punish
the transgressors with death, whiche is
the last remedy to destroye the offender.
But yf we could kepe the first and most

            <p>Whether he taketh Moses here for his

which in name &amp; office figured Christe.
And Moses shadowed the lawe in thys

dyed in the desert, &amp; coulde not bring the
people into the promysed lande, so could
not the law bringe vs to perfeccion &amp; to

The lawe of Moses is but the cruell let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter

For this sect abrogateth and passeth not
