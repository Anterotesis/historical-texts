         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as all that ſaw that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane butchering and quartering out into pieces of the <hi>Levites</hi> wife by her owne husband, cryed out, and ſaid, <hi>There was no ſuch thing done or ſeen, ſince the time that the Children of Iſrael came up out of the Land of Aegypt, untill that day,</hi> Judg. 19. 30. So doubtleſſe whoſoever ſhall conſider what bloody and horrid intendments and attempts againſt this Nation, have paſſed the hearts and hands of ſome of her own Children, may truly ſay, There hath no ſuch thing been done or ſeen in the Land, ſince God firſt cauſed men to dwell on the face of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:156158:3"/>What ſhall we think of that Legion of Devils (I had almoſt called them) who now poſſeſſe the Land, and after the manner of Devils indeed, ſeek all to rent and teare it in pieces; I meane that Colluvies, that heap, or gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the ſcum, and droſſe, and garbage of the Land, that moſt accurſed confederacy, made up of <hi>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amaleck, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims with the Inhabitants of Tyre,</hi> of Jeſuits and Papiſts, and Atheiſts, of ſtigmaticall and infamous perſons in all kindes, with that bloody and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly Generation, commonly knowne by the name of Cavaliers? Have they not thorough ſome black art or other gotten the chiefe treaſure of the Land, the King, into their poſſeſſion, ſetting him ſtill in the Front of all their deſperate deſignes; which are theſe, and their fellowes: 1. To pull thoſe Stars out of the Firmament of the Land, to diſſolve and ruine that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is by interpretation, or repreſentation (which you will) the whole Nation. 2. When they have opened this doore of hope unto themſelves, to turn the Lawes, and preſent frame of Government upſide downe. 3. To make havock and deſolation, to roote out the Generation of the Saints ruſh and branch, men and women, young and old fearing God, out of the Land. 4. To make rapine and ſpoile of all the goods and poſſeſſions, at leaſt of all thoſe that withſtand them, and are not brethren in iniquity with them. 5. To build up the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> to put <hi>Lucifer</hi> againe into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I meane, to advance the tyrannicall Thrones of the Hierarchie to their former heighth, or higher, if they know how. 6. By their authority and power to excommunicate and caſt out all the pure and precious Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God out of his Houſe, and to ſupply this defect with Antichriſtian, and ſpurious inſtitutions. 7. To ſpread that Veile, or covering of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian darkneſſe again over the face of the Land, which God by a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hand of providence had rent and taken off many yeares ſince; to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the whole lump of the Land, the ſecond time, with the ſoure leaven of Romiſh error and ſuperſtition. 8. And laſtly, as is much to be feared, when they have ſerved their tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rnes with, and upon the King, and uſed him as an Engine to get all the ſtones together for their building, then to make rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge of him, as if they had honoured him ſufficiently, to cauſe ſuch ſacred deſignes as theſe to paſſe thorough his hands, and made him inſtrumentall, or any wayes acceſſory in ſuch Angelicall atchievements. Doe we thinke that the light of the knowledge of God ſhines in the hearts and conſciences of theſe men? Have theſe men the minde of Chriſt amongſt them? Doe they know who is the Lord? Or doe they not thinke rather, that <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Belial</hi> is he? Have all the workers of iniquity (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) no knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they eat up my people as they eat bread? <hi>Pſal. 14. 4. i. e.</hi> That they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure, vex, and conſume them with no more remorſe, regret, or touch of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156158:3"/>
conſcience, then they eat and drinke to preſerve their naturall lives: as if ſuch men as theſe, the people of God, were made for the ſame end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to them that bread is, <hi>viz.</hi> to be eaten up and devoured by them. Have they no knowledge (ſaith the Prophet) that they dare attempt ſuch a thing as this? Implying (as it ſhould ſeeme) that to vex, moleſt, perſecute, and deſtroy the people of God, argues the moſt profound ignorance, and thickeſt darkneſſe in the mindes and underſtandings of men, that can likely be found there; and that the weakeſt impreſſions or glimmerings of any true light of knowledge, would keep men from daſhing their foot againſt this ſtone howſoever. If men had but as much knowledge of God, as <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> wife had in a dreame, they would take heed of having any thing to doe with juſt men. And theſe things (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſciples concerning thoſe that ſhould kill them, and thinke they did God ſervice therein) theſe things (ſaith he) they ſhall doe unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father, nor me, <hi>John</hi> 16. 3. If men had the leaſt degree of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt, they muſt needs have ſome knowledge of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Children alſo: and if they know theſe, this knowledge would be as a hooke in their Noſe, or a bridle in their Lips, to keep them from falling foule upon them, as the knowledge of Chriſt the Lord of glory, would have kept the Princes of this world from crucifying him, had it been in them.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are fallen upon the mention of thoſe men who are ready in a poſture of hatred, and malice, and revenge, with other preparations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable hereunto, to fall upon us, and our lives and liberties, both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and civill, upon our eſtates, our Goſpell and Religion, and all that is, or ought to be deare and precious unto us; and in our miſeries and ruines, to render our poſterities more miſerable then we, and have advanced their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne this way to that maturity and heighth, which we all know and tremble to think of: Give me leave in that which remaines, to excite and ſtir you up, from the greateſt to the leaſt, both young and old, rich and poore, men and women, to quit your ſelves like men, yea, and (if it be poſſible) above the line of men, in this great exigency and ſtreſſe of imminent danger that hangs over your heads, and threatens you every houre, Oh let it be as abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto us, as the very ſhadow of death, to every man, woman, and child of us, not to be active, not to lie out and ſtraine our ſelves to the utmoſt of our ſtrength and power in every kinde, as far as the Law of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will ſuffer us, to reſiſt that high hand of iniquity and blood that is ſtretched out againſt us; to make our lives, and our liberties, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion good againſt that accurſed Generation that now magnifieth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make a prey and ſpoyle of them, to make havock and deſolation of them all at once, if the Lord ſhall yet pleaſe to deliver us out of their

hands. Let not our Lives, our Liberties, our Eſtates, be at all precious or deare unto us in this behalfe, to expoſe them, be it unto the greateſt danger, to prevent the certaine and moſt unqueſtionable ruine of them otherwiſe: Let us reſolve to put all into the hands of God, to prevent the falling of all, or any thing, into the hands of theſe men. There is neither man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of us, neither young nor old, but hath ſomewhat or other, more or leſſe, a Mite or two at leaſt to caſt into the Treaſury of the Publike ſafety. Men that have ſtrength of body for the War, and fingers that know how to fight, let them to the Battell, and not feare to look the enemy in the face. Men and women that have only Purſes and Eſtates, let them turne them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men and ſwords for the Battell. Men that have heads, but want armes and hands for outward execution, let theſe ſtudy and contrive methods and wayes of proceedings: Head-worke is every whit as neceſſary in ſuch a time and exigent, as hand-work is. They that have neither hands, nor heads, nor eſtates, let them finde hearts to keep the Mountain of God, to pray the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies downe, and the Armies of the Lord up: Let them finde tongues to whet up the courage and reſolutions of others. This is a ſervice wherein women alſo may quit themſelves like men, whoſe prayers commonly are as maſculine, and doe as great and ſevere execution, as the prayers of men. As for little Children that know not the right hand from the left, and ſo are uncapable of exhortation, or putting on this way, by their weakneſſe and innocency (innocency I meane, as concerning the enemies, and giving them the leaſt cauſe or colour of their bloody intendments, as likewiſe in reſpect of the crying ſins, and horrid provocations of other men) they doe every whit as much towards the furtherance of the ſervice, as men doe by their ſtrength, by their wiſdome, by their eſtates, or otherwiſe; as we ſee in<note place="margin">Jon. 4. 11.</note> the caſe of Gods ſparing <hi>Niniveh.</hi> The ſixſcore thouſand Children that knew not their right hand from the left, were the great interceſſors, and chiefe mediators in the behalfe of the City with him. Yea, the bruit beaſts themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cattell, their caſe and condition working upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and graciouſneſſe of God, were contributors too in their nature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this ſervice: As is to be ſeen in the laſt clauſe of the place cited from<note place="margin">Jon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4 11.</note> the Prophet <hi>Jonah. And ſhould not I ſpare Niniveh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.—and alſo much Cattell.</hi> Therefore now I beſeech you that are capable of the great evils and dangers that threaten you, and are even at your doore, be not you wanting and backward in any thing that is in your hand to doe, if it be poſſible, and as far as in you lyeth, redeeme your lives with your lives, your eſtates with your eſtates, your Religion with your Religion, out of the hands of thoſe men, ſet them all to work for their own maintenance and preſervation: yea, if you know how to create more ſtrength then you have, or to improve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156158:4"/>
your ſelves ſeventy times ſeven fold above the proportion of any your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent abilities, I beſeech you doe it; at leaſt <hi>be willing</hi> (as the Apoſtle beares the <hi>Corinthians</hi> witneſſe they were, in a caſe not altogether unlike) <hi>above that you are able,</hi> that ſo you may be ſure to give out your ſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your ability, the more freely.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſet an edge upon you, to quicken and encourage you, to ſtrengthen your hand to the worke, by the tender only of two motives, or conſiderations unto you.</p>
            <p>1. Conſider that the cauſe, wherein you are deſired and exhorted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and to engage your ſelves to the utmoſt, is like unto the Law of God it ſelfe in thoſe excellent qualifications of it: it is juſt, and holy, and good: there is nothing in it that ſhould make you aſhamed either before God, or juſtly-judging men, nothing that needs make you tender, or holding off in point of conſcience. You are to ſtand up in the defence of your Lives, your Liberties, your Eſtates, your Houſes, your Wives, your Children, your Brethren, and that not of this Nation only, but of thoſe two other Nations likewiſe united under the ſame government with this, in the defence of thoſe Religious and faithfull Governours, that Honourable Aſſembly of Parliament, whoſe power and priviledges you ſtand bound by your ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation unto God, (beſides many bands of conſcience other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) to defend and maintaine with your lives, power, and eſtates. Yea, in defence of his Majeſties royall perſon, honour, and eſtate; all which are now in eminent danger to ſuffer by that accurſed retinue of vile perſons that are gathered about him, as Ivie about an Oake, which never ſuffers it to thrive or proſper, till it be torne off from it. This, men that have their eyes open, may eaſily ſee and diſcerne; though others make a mock and a ſcorn of ſuch an aſſertion, as ridiculous: But ſo did <hi>Lots</hi> ſons in Sodome, by that ſaying of his unto them, <hi>That the Lord would deſtroy the place and City where they were, Gen.</hi> 19. 14. which yet was a ſerious and ſolemne truth: Yea, and further, you are exhorted to ſtand up in defence of the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the name and honour of your God, your Ordinances, and (which ought to be of very deare and precious conſideration to you) for the ſafe conveyance of that great treaſure of the Goſpel over unto your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities that are yet unborne. Here is nothing in all this but what the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Law of God, and the common light of nature, not only warranteth and alloweth in all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but even leadeth, perſwadeth, yea, urgeth and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them unto. Now how ſhould not the goodneſſe, equity, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the cauſe be as precious ſeed, out of which a generation of ſons and daughters ſhall be raiſed up unto it? Yea, and be ſpirit and life to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof? And encouragement unto them, to plead it with the higheſt

hand of meanes and endeavours they are able to lift up? When there is a cauſe that hath the image and ſuperſcription of God upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo full and lively as this hath, is it not pitty it ſhould want Orators to plead it, that it ſhould ſuffer and fall to the ground, and none be found to take it up?</p>
            <p>Indeede if there were any occaſion to make a ſtand in matter of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if there were any thing doubtfull in the cauſe recommended to you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to detaine your judgements and conſciences in ſuſpence, whether it were lawfull for you or no, to appeare in it, there were juſt cauſe to ſpare and to forbeare you, at leaſt for a time, till you ſhould be fully ſatisfied. But now the righteouſneſſe hereof being as cleare as the light, or as the Sunne at noone day, why tarry you? why are you not up in your might before this, to maintaine it to the uttermoſt?</p>
            <p>Yea, but ſay the Rabbies and great Diſputers that ſtand by your enemies and ſtrengthen their hand that they can not depart from their wickedneſſe, that cover, but it is with the covering of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit of the world, not with the covering of the Spirit of the Lord: It is not lawfull (ſay theſe men) for you to oppoſe them, nor to contend any wayes by force againſt them, becauſe by oppoſing them, you reſiſt the King the Lords anointed, whom God commands ſhould be obeyed and ſubmitted unto. If you conceive him to be your adverſary, yet you ought to oppoſe him, (or rather that adverſe diſpoſition of his againſt you) onely with prayers and teares, and ſupplications unto God for him, and with petitorie and humble addreſments unto himſelfe, but to make no outward reſiſtance at all.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. By way of conceſſion, that the King is to be obeyed, and that by the expreſſe commandement of God. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be unto the King, as ſupreme, or unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evill doers, &amp;c. 1 Pet.</hi> 2 13. Here is ſubmiſſion to the King required in expreſſe termes, and they that yeeld not the ſubmiſſion here required, reſiſt the Ordinance of God (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.) and by ſuch reſiſtance ſhall receive to themſelves (<hi>viz.</hi> without repentance) <gap reason="foreign">

Only
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:156158:5"/>
two things I deſire may be taken notice of from this Scripture where ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Kings is commanded: Firſt, that a King or Kingly Government, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an ordinance of man, or an humane creation (as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall properly ſignifieth) which yet we know is no leſſe generally then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently, and in the face of expreſſe Scripture to the contrary, denyed by the Divinity and learning of the malignant faction, who by ſwelling the Prerogative of Kings to a monſtrous and moſt unnaturall proportion, as if they had a minde to make it crack before they had done, have conſulted all maner of miſeries and calamities to the world, as well to Kings themſelves, as to their People. <hi>Submit to every Ordinance of man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) for the Lords ſake, whether it be unto the King, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore he ſuppoſeth the King or Kingly Government to be the Ordinance, or creation, or creature of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is evident that ſo he is; for there were Kings over the Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the forme of whoſe government God did no wayes intermeddle by way of any command or appointment concerning it, long before there was any King over <note n="*" place="margin">See Gen. 14. 12. &amp;c.</note> Iſrael. Nor was it the order or command of God, that there ſhould be any King over Iſrael, but he was highly offended with the People for deſiring it. <hi>Is it not now Wheat harveſt?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> to the People) <hi>I will call upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſend thunder, and raine, that you may perceive and ſee, how that your wickedneſſe is great, which ye have done in the ſight of the Lord in asking you a King.</hi> And though he condeſcended in a paſſive way, that they ſhould have a King as they deſired, yet as he tells them by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, He gave them a King in his wrath,</hi> and bid them in effect take him at their perils, if they would needs have him, he ſhould deale but hardly by them. <hi>He would take their ſons and daughters, and make them ſervile to him,</hi> as you have it. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11. It is true, in this ſenſe a King, or Kingly power and government may be ſaid to be from God. 1. In a generall or indefinite conſideration, as it is a government, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or in it ſelfe unlawfull: For it is the will and appointment of God, that there ſhould be ſome government or other in every ſociety of men, yet not any government neither, not any that is unjuſt, unreaſonable, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall: And in this ſenſe all formes of government that are lawfull and juſt, whether they be ſimple, as the three commonly known by the names of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, Democracy; or whether they be mixt, having ſomewhat of two, or all of theſe ſimples in them, are equally and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from God: not any one of them determinately, or with excluſion of the reſt. For ſuppoſe all Nations and Societies of men in the world, from the foundations thereof untill now, ſhould have ſet up and exerciſed only one and the ſame form of government amongſt them, as <hi>viz.</hi> That which we call Ariſtocraticall (like that in the Low-countries, by ſome choſen
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:156158:6"/>
amongſt them, whom they call States) ſo that neither the Monarchicall, or Kingly government, nor yet the Democraticall, nor any other government whatſoever had been ever practiſed in the world untill this day, we muſt not thinke that the world had herein ſinned, in not uſing any other, no nor yet neglected any Ordinance of God. Becauſe it is no ordinance or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God that any particular Nation or ſociety of men, ſhould have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that ſpeciall forme of government amongſt them, but only that they ſhould have ſome kinde of government which is juſt and lawfull. Therefore Kingly Government is no Ordinance of God in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as impoſed upon any Nation or People by way of duty or precept to uſe and ſet up amongſt them. But being ſet up in any people, it is warranted, and countenanced by God as lawfull, and obedience &amp; ſubjection ſtreightly enioyned thereunto. And therefore the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. is very expreſſe and punctuall this way. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject unto the higher powers, for there is no power (.i.</hi> no iuſt and lawfull form of government) <hi>but is from God,</hi> the powers that are, are ordained (or rather ordered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of God. The powers that are: Why doth he ſay the powers that are, are ordained, or ordered by God? Doubtleſſe to ſhew, that there are ſome powers or formes of government, <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak) that is, in reſpect of their ſpecies or kinde, which are not <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> actually exerciſed or taken up, nor need they be taken up by any State or People in the world. But for thoſe that are, <hi>.i.</hi> that are <hi>de facto</hi> eſtabliſhed, and ſet up by any People among themſelves, (ſpeaking only of thoſe that are lawfull) theſe (ſaith he) are ordained, or rather ordered by God: <hi>.i.</hi> God by ſpeciall inſtinct and work of providence (q) inclines the hearts of ſeverall Nations, ſome to imbrace and fall upon one, and ſome upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome upon that which is Monarchicall, or Kingly, others upon that which is Ariſtocraticall, ſome upon that which is Democraticall, &amp;c. and withall commands, that that which every Nation or People chooſeth for it ſelfe, ſhould be obeyed and ſubmitted unto by thoſe that have choſen it, and live under it, ſo long as it continueth: For the time is comming, when Chriſt will put downe all rule, and all authority, and power. And this is<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> another ſenſe wherein Kings or Kingly Government may be ſaid to be from God, or to be the Ordinance of God, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe where it is eſtabliſhed and ſet up, he had a ſpeciall hand in ordering and guiding the hearts of the People to chooſe it, before others, and withall commands it to be obeyed, as a Government that is lawfull and authorized by him, not as commanded and enioyned by him.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the firſt thing made plaine to you, which was obſerved from the place in <hi>Peter,</hi> which was, that Kingly power or authority is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156158:6"/>
directly and properly the creation or ordinance of man, though there bee that in it alſo, which in a ſenſe may give it the denomination of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. As warranted or countenanced by him. 2. As order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken up by thoſe Nations, who have ſubjected themſelves unto it, by the ſpeciall diſpoſall and work of his providence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I deſire you would take notice of from the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is this, that ſubordinate Authority, and inferiour Magiſtracy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is as much the Ordinance of God, as Soveraignty and ſupreame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelfe is: and that God by one and the ſame command, requires us to ſubmit our ſelves to inferiour Magiſtrates or Governours, as well as hee doth to Kings themſelves. Reade the paſſage againe. <hi>Therefore ſubmit your ſelves to all manner of Ordinances of man, whether, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is a ſin of the ſame nature, and renders a man obnoxious to the ſame danger or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from God, to be found in diſobedience to ſubordinate Rulers under the King, as to the King himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this for anſwer to the Objection in the firſt place, by way of conceſſion or grant, That the King doubtleſſe is to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly by way of exception I anſwer further, that though the King be to be obeyed and ſubmitted unto, yet this obedience was never intended by God to be univerſall, but with limitatation, <hi>viz.</hi> In ſuch commands wherein a mans obedience to the King ſhould not be found diſobedience againſt God: for in theſe caſes, That of the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to the Rulers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Elders, and chiefe Prieſts, muſt take place. <hi>Acts 4. 19. Whether it be right in the ſight of God to obey you, rather then God, Judge yee.</hi> The debt of obedience to God muſt alwayes be paid, whoſoever looſeth by the hand: Though the truth is, that there is no creature, King nor other, that can loſe any thing due to him, by any mans obedience unto God. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſo confident of the righteouſneſſe of their cauſe in diſobeying their Rulers in that, wherein they obeyed God, that they feared not to make their Adverſaries themſelves their Judges therein: <hi>Judge yee.</hi> If a King ſhould command me not to pray for the generall good, or peace of the Church or State where I live, or to forbeare the doing of any thing, which I conceive I am bound in conſcience unto God to doe for the publique good, I am not in this caſe any whit more bound to obey the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, then the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were to obey the command of the Rulers and Elders who charged them to give over preaching the Goſpell, or then <hi>Shadrack, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were, to worſhip the Golden Image, becauſe <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> commanded it. This limitation is plainly enough expreſſed in that very Scripture, wherein we heard obedience unto Kings commanded. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 13. Submit your ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:156158:7"/>
               <hi>every Ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake.</hi> If we ought to ſubmit for the <hi>Lords ſake: .i.</hi> Either for that love we beare to him, or out of conſcience of that obedience which we owe unto him, we ought not to ſubmit in any thing whereby God may be diſhonoured or diſobeyed. It is ſenſeleſſe to thinke, that any thing can, or ought to be done for the Lords ſake, which cannot be done but to his diſhonour, or (which is the ſame) with diſobedience to him.</p>
            <p>Yea, but it will ſtill be objected, though it be true, that Kings are not to be obeyed in any of thoſe commands that are unlawfull, in an active way, we are not alwayes to doe what they would have us doe, nor to ceaſe or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the doing, of what they would have us forbeare; yet are they even in ſuch caſes to be obeyed paſſively: Men are to ſuffer patiently any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they deſire to inflict upon them, for refuſing any ſuch obedience; or however, they are not forcibly to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>To theſe things likewiſe I anſwer: 1. That the unlawfull command of a King, may poſſibly be of that nature and condition, that a Subject cannot diſobey it, but by a ſtrong hand, and taking up of Armes, though not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly or directly againſt the King, yet againſt the command of a King. In ſuch a caſe, diſobedience to Kings by a ſtrong hand, and with forcible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, is not only lawfull, but even matter of duty and obedience unto God. For inſtance, A Chriſtian hath ſolemnly vowed and proteſted before God, to defend the lives of his godly and faithfull Governours to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power: or whether he hath made ſuch a Vow and Proteſtation or no, it is not much materiall in this reſpect, becauſe he ſtands bound in conſcience otherwiſe, and by the Law of God, to doe it. Now ſuppoſe ſuch a man cannot performe this Vow, or doe that which is his duty to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe therein, but by a ſtrong hand, and taking up Armes; In this caſe, if a King commands ſuch a man not to take up Armes in relation to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, it is evident that this unlawfull command of a King cannot be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but by taking up Armes againſt it. There are many other caſes of the ſame conſideration and rule with this.</p>
            <p>2. I anſwer further, That it is one thing to offer violence to the perſon of a King, or Ruler, or to attempt the taking away of his life; another to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a mans own life, or the life of another, whom we know to be innocent, and much more the publike ſafety, by ſtrengthening a mans ſelfe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the violent execution of any unjuſt command from a King, by thoſe that have no right or lawfull authority at all, to doe any ſuch execution upon us. As for offering violence to the perſon of a King, or attempting to take away his life, we leave the proofe of the lawfulneſſe of this, to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found diſputers the Jeſuits, who ſtand ingaged by the tenour of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Doctrine and practiſe, either to make good the lawfulneſſe thereof, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156158:7"/>
elſe to leave themſelves and their Religion, an abhorring and hiſſing unto the world. As for us who never travelled with any deſires or thoughts that way, but abhor both mother and daughter, doctrine and practiſe together, we conceive it to be a juſt Prerogative of the Perſons of Kings in what caſe ſoever, to be ſecure from the violence of men; and their lives to be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Corne, meet to be reaped and gathered only by the hand of God himſelfe. <hi>Davids</hi> conſcience ſmote him, when he came but ſo neare the life of a King, as the cutting off of the lap of his garment.</p>
            <p>But as concerning a forcible withſtanding, or reſiſtance making, againſt a violent execution of any unjuſt command from a King, attempted by thoſe that have no rightfull or lawfull authority to do ſuch execution either upon us or others, yea though the King himſelfe be at hand to ſecond his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the execution of ſuch commands, we have ſufficient warrant for the lawfulneſſe hereof in the Scriptures themſelves. When <hi>Ahab</hi> ſent a Cavaliere (you may call him) a man of blood, to take away the Prophet <hi>Eliſha's</hi> head, as he ſate in his houſe amongſt the Elders, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 32. did <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſet open his doore for him, and ſit ſtill till he took off his head, in obedience to the King? No, he beſtirred himſelfe for the ſafeguard of his life, and called upon others to ſtand by him, and aſſiſt him againſt that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and violence intended againſt him: yea and this without any brand or blemiſh of any rebellion or diſobedience to the King; yea though he ſpake ſomewhat roundly and freely of the King himſelfe. <hi>See yee not</hi> (ſaith he to the Elders that were with him) <hi>how this ſon of a murtherer</hi> (meaning no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, no leſſe then <hi>Ahab</hi> himſelf, the King) <hi>hath ſent to take away mine head?

So when <hi>Saul</hi> the King would needs have had <hi>Jonathan</hi> put to death, yea, and had bound himſelfe with an oath or curſe to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Neither is there the leaſt aſperſion or imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion caſt upon this People for this fact of theirs, as if they had beene any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:156158:8"/>
wayes injurious or diſobedient to their King. Nay it appeares by the ſequell of the Story. that <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe, though a man not of the beſt diſpoſition, when the <hi>turbidum intervallum,</hi> the fit of paſſion was over, took it no wayes amiſſe at the hands of the people, that they had reſiſted him, in that unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and inconſiderate deſigne of his againſt <hi>Jonathan:</hi> but went on, and raigned peaceably over them. <hi>David</hi> in like manner, being unjuſtly perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and thoſe graceleſſe and baſe flatterers that aſſiſted him in that ungracious deſigne, and being in danger of his life by them, did hee either ſit ſtill, to ſee whether God would in an extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous way protect him or no? Or did he ſubmit himſelfe to <hi>Sauls</hi> mercy, and lay downe his life at his feet? No, but on the contrary, he provided himſelf with weapons, the beſt that were to be had. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 89. And willingly entertained for the ſafeguard of life, and to make reſiſtance againſt <hi>Saul</hi> and his party, all the help of men he could come by, making himſelfe an head or Captaine over them. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 2.

Now then the queſtion is, whether it be lawfull for you to ſtand upon your guard in this caſe, and to ſeeke the preſervation of your lives, and of thoſe that belong unto you, wives, and little ones, &amp;c. and if there be no other likely meanes for your ſafety, to deſtroy the lives of thoſe that ſeek to deſtroy yours; whether the command of the King (ſuppoſe ſuch a thing were, which yet I much queſtion) to wicked inſtruments to take away your lives, or the lives of thoſe whom you are bound, by oath or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to protect; whether (I ſay) ſuch a command ought more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with you to ſit ſtill and ſuffer the deſtroyer to execute his Commiſſion upon you, to take away your lives, or the command of God and nature

which lies upon you to defend your lives, and the lives of ſuch others, as we ſpake of, when they are aſſaulted, or in danger of aſſault?

            <p>If it be here objected and ſaid, it is true, ſuch acts as you have related were indeed done by theſe men: but, <hi>Quo jure,</hi> whether they did well, or lawfully in ſo doing, is yet in queſtion: An act done by a good man, fearing God, is not therefore good, or lawfully done, becauſe ſuch a man doth it: The ancient Fathers were generally Polygamiſts: yet the plenty of their practiſe is but a defective proofe of the lawfulneſſe of Polygamy. In like manner, the actions mentioned, having no teſtimony of approbation from the Scriptures, may very poſſibly be workes of darkneſſe, though done by children of light; yea, though there be no expreſſe brand of unlawfulneſſe ſet upon them by God: for Polygamy it ſelfe hath this negative teſtimony of its innocency.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, firſt in generall: That though the goodneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the perſon be not ſufficient to authorize an act for lawfull, yet whilſt the unlawfulneſſe of it be clearly evicted by a contrariety in it to ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, it is a ſtrong preſumption, that an act performed by ſuch a perſon, is lawfull: To the inſtance of Polygamy in the Fathers: I anſwer, that it was apparently a breach of the ſeventh Commandement, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the firſt inſtitution of marriage by God; the tenour whereof, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Saviours own extract out of the ancient Record, runs thus, <hi>Mat. 19. 5. And they twaine</hi> (not they three, or they foure, or more) <hi>ſhall be one fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh.</hi> And beſides, it is plainly branded and condemned by the Spirit of God, as ſinfull, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. as the generall vote of Interpreters upon this place carryeth it. But there is not the leaſt intimation given throughout the whole Scriptures, of any thing ſinfull or diſpleaſing unto God, in what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eliſha,</hi> or the people, or <hi>David</hi> did, in the particulars mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thoſe acts of <hi>Solomon,</hi> commanding <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Shimei</hi> to be put to death, without any tryall or due proceſſe of Law againſt them, 1 <hi>King</hi> 2. and ſo that of <hi>David,</hi> giving away <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> eſtate to <hi>Ziba,</hi> onely upon a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure conceived againſt him, with ſome others of other Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> of like conſideration, ſmelling too ranke of prerogative oyle, are much more queſtionable in point of lawfulneſſe, and of farre more difficult reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with principles of reaſon and equitie, and with the Law of God it ſelfe then thoſe other. But,</p>
            <p>2. To the particular I anſwer. Firſt, for the fact of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> calling out to thoſe that were with him, to lay hands upon him that came
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:156158:9"/>
armed with the Kings authority and command, to take away his head, and to ſhut the doore againſt him; that in this he did nothing but what was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto God, appeares from the circumſtance of time, and that poſture of ſpirit, wherein the Prophet thus contended for his head againſt him that would needs have had it from him. He was now full of the Spirit of God, and of prophecy: and was in that very inſtant, wherein his head ſhould have beene taken from him, ready to cry out as a woman in travaile, and to bee delivered of that gracious meſſage, which immediatly followes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſucceeding Chapter. Now that ſo holy a man, and ſo great a Prophet, ſhould in that very point and inſtant of time, wherein he was full of the Spirit of God, and ready to deliver a meſſage from him of that high importance and unexpected grace to his people, fall into the ſoule ſinne of rebellion againſt his lawfull King, is doubtleſſe an incredibilitie of the firſt magnitude.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Elders or Stateſmen of the Kingdome, who were preſent, complyed with him in his motion, and aſſiſted him in his oppoſition againſt the Kings meſſenger, who came for his head; laid hands upon him, and ſuffered him not to enter: which appeares from hence, becauſe the Prophets head ſtood ſtill upon his ſhoulders. And this is yet a further confirmation of the lawfulneſſe of that reſiſtance, which he made, becauſe it is unreaſonable to thinke, that perſons of that qualitie, and who cannot be conceived but to have underſtood themſelves ſufficiently in a buſineſſe of that nature, being the Peeres or chiefe officers of the Kingdome, ſhould have involved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the danger and guilt of rebellion againſt the King: which (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) they had done, had that act of the Prophet, wherof they were abettors, had any ſtreine or touch of Rebellion in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, the King himſelfe (it ſeemes) comming very ſhortly after into the place where the Prophet and Elders were, finding the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which in hot blood he had commanded, not done, the heate of his paſſion being ſomewhat over and abated, ſate downe amongſt them, and never ſo much as reproved either Prophet or Elders, for making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they did to his meſſenger: which it is like he would have done, and that upon high termes, had he conceived either the one or the other to have beene within the verge of a Rebellion; or any other injury or indignitie offered either to his perſon, or to his Crowne and dignitie.</p>
            <p>Againe ſecondly for the people who delivered <hi>Jonathan</hi> out of the hand of <hi>Saul,</hi> there is no colour to conceive any thing unlawfull or unjuſtifiable therein. Evident it is that themſelves looked upon this fact before it was done, not only as a thing lawfull for them to doe, but as matter of dutie, and that which in conſcience they were bound to doe. That expreſſion of theirs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156158:9"/>
implies as much: <hi>Shall Jonathan die, who hath ſo mightily delivered Iſrael? God forbid.</hi> (1 Sam. 14. 45.) <hi>As the Lord liveth there ſhall not one haire of his head fall to the ground.</hi> They conceived, that it had beene a ſinne of a very high nature in them, if they ſhould not have appeared for his reſcue and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, whom they not onely knew to be innocent, and to have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy of death, but alſo <hi>to have wrought with God</hi> for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Nor is it eaſie to conceive what other ground or motive ſhould have induced this people to runne the hazard of the Kings diſpleaſure in <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> protection, then conſcience onely: though its true, there is no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation given of my complaint made, nor of any offence conceived by <hi>Saul</hi> againſt the people for this fact of theirs, which is another argument of the lawfulneſſe thereof, yea and of the unprejudicialneſſe or in-offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it to <hi>Sauls</hi> kingly Throane and dignitie, conſidering how tender and jealous <hi>Saul</hi> was of theſe, and how impatient of the leaſt touch (yea though but imaginary onely) in them, as appeares in the ſequell of his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, eſpecially by his violent perſecution of <hi>David,</hi> upon very light and looſe grounds of ſuſpition this way.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, concerning <hi>Davids</hi> gathering a ſtrength of men and armes to him, whereby to make reſiſtance againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> or rather againſt that bloody aſſociation which conſpired with him in a moſt unjuſt way, to take away his life; evident it is,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>David,</hi> all the time of this his unjuſt perſecution by <hi>Saul</hi> and his complices, being ſtill in eminent danger of his life, was more ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcienced then ordinary, and more afraid of ſinning againſt God; yea and prayed both more frequently and more fervently unto God to bee preſerved from ſinne, then at other times; as appeares by many Pſalmes compoſed by him, during this his triall. Now it is a thing altogether incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, <hi>that a man</hi> otherwiſe <hi>according to Gods owne heart,</hi> under the beſt and ſofteſt frame of ſpirit and conſcience, that ever he liv'd in, and whilſt hee made it his earneſt prayer unto God daily to be kept from ſinne, ſhould ſo fouly miſcarry, as to live in the ſinne of Rebellion againſt his lawfull King without repentance.</p>
            <p>2. That he reſpected and honoured <hi>Saul</hi> very highly, and was very tender of doing him the leaſt harme. It is ſaid, <hi>that his heart ſmote him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had cut off but the lap or skirt of his garment, 1 Sam.</hi> 24. 5. uſing more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over theſe words to his ſervents, whoſe fingers itch'd to have made ſure worke with <hi>Saul; The Lord forbid that I ſhould doe this thing to my maſter the Lords annointed, to ſtretch forth mine hand againſt him, ſeeing he is the anoynted of the Lord,,</hi> verſ 6. Therefore certainly <hi>David</hi> in defending himſelfe againſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156158:10"/>
               <hi>Sauls</hi> Cavaliers with armes and men, neither offended God, nor wronged <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe in the leaſt meaſure. Yea,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe overcome with this expreſſion of <hi>Davids</hi> love and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe unto him, acknowleded his innocencie, and the uprightneſſe of his heart towards him, <hi>verſ. 16. Is this thy voyce, my ſonne David</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saul) and lift up his voyce and wept. And ſaid to David, thou art more righteous then I: for thou haſt rendred me good, and I have rendered thee evill. And thou haſt ſhewed this day that thou haſt dealt well with me, &amp;c. Saul</hi> did not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him from thoſe high crimes, of treaſon, rebellion, ſedition, &amp;c. but from all manner of injury or iniuſtice at all done to him. And if <hi>Saul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the offence (if any) had beene committed, iuſtifieth him, who ſhall with any colour of or equitie condemne him?</p>
            <p>Laſtly (for this particular) the holy Ghoſt himſelfe gives this expreſſe teſtimony concerning <hi>David; That he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned from nothing that he commanded him all the dayes of his life, ſave onely in the matter of Vriah the Hittite, 1 King.</hi> 15. 5. whereas, if that fact of his, defending himſelfe by force of armes, againſt <hi>Saul</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in blood againſt him, had beene of any ſuch interpretation as ſome would make it, (by making other caſes like unto it) as either treaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, or the like; doubtleſſe this had beene an higher and greater matter of exception againſt him, then the matter of <hi>Vriah</hi> it ſelfe. But yet further that their practiſe in the particular mentioned reſpectively, and ſo yours, being onely conformable thereunto, was, and is every wayes iuſtifiable; and of perfect conſiſtence with the rules of reaſon, equity and all good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and no wayes derogatory to Kingly power and authority, I remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and prove by this one conſideration.</p>
            <p>Men that have no lawfull authority or power to take away the lives or goods of men, may very lawfully be reſiſted in any attempt they ſhall make, to doe either; and if their lives miſcarry in ſuch attempts, they have their meanes in their owne hands, (as we ſay) their blood is upon their owne heads. This I ſuppoſe is a pregnant and knowne principle both in reaſon and religion. If a man aſſaults another upon the high way, and ſeekes to take away his mony or life from him; if the perſon aſſaulted ſlayes the other <hi>ſe defendendo</hi> (as the Law ſpeakes) there is neither Law nor conſcience will take hold on, or reprove him for it. This propoſition is manifeſt. I go on therefore and adde,</p>
            <p>But men can have no lawfull authority or power, by any warrant or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from a King to take away the lives, or goods, of thoſe that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and have not tranſgreſſed the Law, no not of thoſe that are not in a lawfull way convicted for tranſgreſſors of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:156158:10"/>Therefore ſuch men as theſe may lawfully be reſiſted in any attempts they ſhall make either upon our lives, or our goods, notwithſtanding any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Commiſſion, or command they have, or pretend to have, from a King to doe it. And take that along with you which apparently followes from hence: If ſuch perſons ſo aſſaulted may lawfully reſiſt ſuch aſſailants, then may they every whit as lawfully provide themſelves before hand of ſuch meanes, where with they may be able to make the reſiſtance when time comes. As, if it be lawfull for a Traveller to kill a Thiefe upon the way in the defence of his life, or money; certainly it is lawfull for him to ride with a Sword, Piſtoll, or the like, wherewith he may be able to doe it; It is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to grant the lawfulneſſe of an end, and to deny a lawfulneſſe of meanes neceſſary and ſufficient to attaine that end.</p>
            <p>But ſome (it may be) will deny that propoſition, which affirmeth, that thoſe men have no lawfull power or Authority to ſeize upon mens lives or goods who are innocent, and as yet ſo reputed by the Law, having the authority and command of the King to doe it. That therefore no unjuſt, or unrighteous command of a King, can enable any man with any lawfull power to put in execution any ſuch command, I thus demonſtrate (though indeed it be a thing evident enough in it ſelf without any demonſtration) no King can derive any power or authority to another, to any miniſter, officer, or the like, but only that wherewith himſelfe is inveſted, and poſſeſſed of, either formally, or by way of eminencie and ſurpluſſage. But no King is himſelf inveſted with any authority or power to doe any thing which is uniuſt, or unrighteous therefore hee can not impart or give any ſuch power to another: and conſequently thoſe that attempt or doe any thing by vertue of any uniuſt command from a King, had every whit as good doe the thing upon their owne heads and authority, without any warrant or commiſſion from the King at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the fact as touching the lawfullneſſe of it, is but of one and the ſame conſideration in both caſes. Now that a King himſelf hath no power or authority at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to doe any thing that is uniuſt or unequall, is yet more evident then the former, thus: All power that a King hath in point of government, is derived upon him, either by God, or by men, or both: but it is a truth of the cleereſt evidence that neither the one, nor the other, neither God, nor man conferreth any power upon him to doe unjuſtly. Concerning God, there is not the leaſt queſtion to be made: he gives no man Authority to ſin; but layes his Authority and command upon all the world to doe righteouſly: and as for men, ſuppoſing they be but reaſonable men that have conferred the power upon a King, it cannot be thought, or once imagined, that they ſhould give a power out of themſelves, againſt themſelves; a power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156158:11"/>
or to wrong either them or their poſterity. And though they ſhould be conceived to do a thing ſo inconſiſtent with reaſon and even common ſence, yet ſuch an act of theirs, were a meere nullitie: the King was never the more poſſeſt of any ſuch power, becauſe they that are ſuppoſed to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it upon him, had it not in themſelves, nor the leaſt right or power to derive it upon any other.</p>
            <p>Yea, but (will the malignant Doctors) ſtill object and reply, who ſhall be Judge in this caſe, Whether the command or commiſſion of a King, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to an Officer, or other ſubiect, to be put in execution, be uniuſt, or no? Is it not fit, that rather the King himſelfe ſhould be iudge in this caſe, then every private man? Is it fit to give way or allow, that every private man ſhould ſcan, examine, iudge, and determine either the righteouſneſſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe of the Kings command? Doth not ſuch a liberty as this tend to diſſolve the bands of obedience to Superiours? To poure contempt upon Kings and Rulers, and to fill the world with confuſion?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, that for many things that are commanded by Kings and Superiours, there needs little or no examination or ſitting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be lawfull, or no. Their unlawfulneſſe is written (as it were) in their foreheads, with ſuch Capitall Letters, that he that runs may reade it. A man needs no skill either in Arithmetique or Geometrie, nor the uſe of any rule or ſquare, to try either whether the bow be ſtreight, or the ſtring bent and crooked. Halfe an eye is ſufficient proviſion for this deciſion. The command of that Idolatrous King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> with his Nobles, that men ſhould worſhip his golden Image, was ſo notoriouſly wicked, that thoſe three ſervants of God, <hi>Shadrack, Meſhack,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were <hi>not carefull to anſwer the King concerning it. Dan.</hi> 3. 16. that is, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take time to ſtudy or conſider whether they ſhould obey it, or no. Such was the command of the Elders and Rulers to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn, When they commanded them that in no wiſe they ſhould ſpeake or teach in the name of Ieſus. Act.</hi> 3. 18. 19. Beſides many others both upon Sacred, Eccleſiaſtick, and Civill Record, of like condition and importance.</p>
            <p>2. If it be not lawfull for inferiours to examine and enquire into the commands of Kings, and other their Superiours, whether they be lawfull or no; then is there a neceſſity lying upon men by way of duty, to make men equall with God, and to iudge them as unerringly, as univerſally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and holy, as he; which a man of conſcience will hardly forbeare to call blaſphemy. The ſequell is evident: Becauſe men can riſe no higher in their thoughts and apprehenſions of God himſelfe in this kinde, then to iudge him abſolutely and unqueſtionably righteous, worthy to be obeyed, in whatſoever he ſhall command, without examination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:156158:11"/>3. If men were either bound to, or lawfully might obey their Superiors without all examination, there would be no place left for that command of our Saviour, wherein he prohibites his friends and ſervants, to feare thoſe that could only kill the body; meaning by ſuch, either only, or principally Kings and Rulers, who are commonly ſaid to have <hi>poteſtatem vitae &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccis,</hi> power of life and death. There is no reaſon to thinke, that either Kings or Rulers ſhould take away the lives of thoſe that will comply with them in all their deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and commands: and as little reaſon is there for any man to thinke, that men ſhould run the hazzard of being killed, by diſobeying the commands and will of Kings, if they might ſafely, and with the peace of a good conſcience obey and comply with them.</p>
            <p>4. It is no more diſparagement or diſhonour to Kings or Rulers to have their commands examined by thoſe to whom they are directed and given, then it was for <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles to have their Preachings and doctrines examined by the inferiour ſort of Chriſtians that heard them. Theſe were every whit as great (if not far greater) in Spirituall authority and dignity, as Kings themſelves are in politique and civill. Now the Holy Ghoſt is ſo far from reproving thoſe, who examined the things which they heard from <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, that he hath left it upon Record as matter of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commendation to them, <hi>That they daily ſearched the Scriptures, whether things were ſo or no,</hi> as he had taught them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. Yea, the Apoſtles themſelves were ſo far from looking upon it, as any matter of prejudice to them or their reputations, that what they delivered and taught, ſhould bee brought to the touch-ſtone by thoſe that heard them, that they required this at their hands by way of duty, and exhorted them unto it. See 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 14. 1 Theſ. 5. 21. &amp;c.</hi> And yet far greater reaſon is there, why the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles ſhould have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>.i.</hi> priviledged from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then the commands of Kings: becauſe they had a promiſe of ſuch a preſence of the <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> with them, <hi>that he ſhould lead them into the way of all truth;</hi> whereas Kings, both in the framing and publiſhing of their Commands, are left to an arbitrary aſſiſtance from heaven, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other men.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The wrath of God hath been revealed from heaven, .i.</hi> hath been ſhewed in very remarkable and exemplary manner, upon thoſe who have ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the commands of Kings, and ſubmitted unto them in things unlawfull. Thoſe Officers that obeyed King <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> command in caſting thoſe three innocent ſervants of God into the fiery furnace, were ſuddenly conſumed by the flame that came out of the furnace; whereas thoſe that ſtreined at the Kings command, &amp; exchanged it (as the Scripture phraſe is) meaning (I conceive) for the commandement of God, obeying this in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:156158:12"/>
ſtead, remained untouched of the fire in the midſt of the furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 22. So the men of Iſrael that had obeyed the commandement of <hi>Saul</hi> in giving their aſſiſtance to him for the perſecuting of <hi>David,</hi> were puniſhed together with <hi>Saul,</hi> fleeing and falling down wounded before the Philiſtines, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr</hi> hath well obſerved upon 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 1. So of that great Hoſt of Aſſyrians, that joyned with their King in an unlawfull war againſt the Church and People of God, there were 185000. ſlaine in one night by an Angel, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 35. To paſſe by all other examples of the ſeverity of God in this kinde, that is moſt worthy conſideration, which is recorded, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. It is ſaid, ver. 17. <hi>That after the death of Jehoiada, the Princes of Iuda came and did reverence unto the King, and that the King hearkened to them.</hi> Not long after, <hi>They conſpired together againſt Zachariah,</hi> a faithfull Prophet of the Lord, for dealing faithfully with them, <hi>and at the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ſtoned him with ſtones, in the Court of the houſe of the Lord, ver. 21. But</hi> (ſaith the Story, ver. 23.) <hi>it came to paſſe at the end of the yeare, that the hoſt of Syria came up againſt him: and they came to Iuda and Ieruſalem and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the Princes of the People from among the People, &amp;c.</hi> The juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging hand of God, ſingling out from amongſt many thouſands, thoſe perſons by name, who had obeyed the King in a way of unrighteouſneſſe, though they were the chiefeſt and greateſt of them, and in that reſpect (in all likelihood) kept furtheſt off from the danger, and had more outward proviſion for their ſafety, then others.</p>
            <p>6. (And laſtly for this) If this liberty we ſpeak of, of examining the commands of Kings and other Superiours, were granted unto, and uſed by thoſe that are in ſubjection, it would not deveſt or bereave Kings or Rulers of any obedience at all, that were worth the having or receiving from men, or that were truly honourable or ſafe for them to receive. All that in reaſon it could be conceived to doe in this kinde, is to prevent and cut off all ſuch obedience from Kings, which would endanger their cutting off, and their States and Kingdomes with them. If this liberty, or duty rather, of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Commands of Superiours, had been preached and preſſed upon the conſciences of men with that authority and power, which the truth and high concernment of it will beare, or rather (indeed) required, thoſe crownes might have flouriſhed upon the heads of Kings, which now begin to droope and languiſh; and thoſe Nations enioyed abundance of peace under them, the foundations of whoſe ſafety are now ſhaken. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in judgement, becauſe he willingly followed the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz.</hi> of King <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who commanded the worſhipping of the golden Calfe. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 11.

The Holy Ghoſt aſcribes this to the obedience of the People in this behalfe: <hi>And this thing turned to ſin: for the people went to worſhip before the one, even unto Dan.</hi> Clearely implying, that that ſin which was the ruine and rooting out of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and his houſe, was not ſo much his wicked and Idolatrous command, conſidered ſimply and in it ſelfe, but as it found obedience and ſubiection in the people. The people in true accompt, who magnified <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> in his commands, above God in his, were they that ruined both <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and his houſe. And generelly, all that Kings and Princes gaine, by an unlawfull ſubiection and obedience from their People, is little elſe but the kindling of the fire of Gods iealouſie againſt them. <hi>I am the Lord (</hi>ſaith God, <hi>Eſa. 42. 8.) this is my Name: and my glory will not I give to another, .i.</hi> I will not ſuffer it to be given to, nor to be received by another; I will ſell it deare to him that ſhall own it, and will recover it out of his ruine.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156158:13"/>
to cloath Kings and Princes, or whomſoever, with the ſpoiles of his Name, as all thoſe doe, who obey them with diſobedience unto God, as in one ſence they make them gods, ſo in another, by making them gods, they make them indeed more men then they were, more obnoxions to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, who hath the command of their life and breath. Conſider that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage (to omit many others of like importance) which you ſhall finde, <hi>Eſa. 1. 31. And the ſtrong, .i.</hi> the Idoll, either becauſe in the Idolaters conceit, it is ſtrong like a god, or rather ſtrong, in reſpect of the firmneſſe and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of the matter of it, <hi>Shall be as Tow, and the maker therof, as a Spark: they ſhall both burne together, and none ſhall quench them.</hi> Marke well: How ſtrong and durable ſoever the matter is, whereof the Idoll is made, whether it bee the beſt heart of Oake that can be gotten, or the hardeſt and firmeſt ſtone, ſilver, gold, or the like, or if there be any thing more durable, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting corruption, then theſe, yet being made an Idoll, it becomes <hi>as Tow, i.</hi> of a very weake and periſhable nature: <hi>and the maker of it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be as a Sparke, viz.</hi> to ſet this Tow on fire; meaning that he is the cauſe both why that good ſubſtance, which was made into an Idoll, periſheth ſo ſuddenly, and likewiſe of his owne periſhing by the hand and iudgement of God. In like manner, when men or women ſhall make Idols of Kings and Princes, and great men, and fall downe before them, and worſhip them with divine worſhip, as all they in effect doe, who yeeld obedience unto them againſt God, what doe they elſe but ſhake the very foundations of their lives, and preſent beeings in the world, and call for the fire of Gods iealouſie from heaven to conſume them: Whereas on the contrary, thoſe that ſoberly, and out of conſcience refuſe to obey them upon ſuch termes, I meane, againſt God, they doe them as good ſervice, if they would pleaſe ſo to apprehend and interpret it, as <hi>Mordecai</hi> did to King <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> when he revealed the Treaſon of the two Eunuchs againſt him. He that refuſeth to obey a Superiour in an unlawfull command, giveth notice to him, that his foote is in a ſnare of death, and that his preſervation ſtands in his deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and repenting.</p>
            <p>I ſhall mention only one obiection more wherewith that unhappy lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the contrary ſide, uſeth to be very importune, and to triumph much in it. The Chriſtians in the primitive times ſubmitted themſelves with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe moſt uniuſt and cruell commands of the heathen Emperors, when they ſent their officers to put them in execution, and to take their lives from them: they never reſiſted, nor ſtood upon their guard, but tooke even death it ſelfe, yea, and many times torments worſe then death, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. And whereas this might otherwiſe be ſufficiently anſwered, that they made no reſiſtance, becauſe they were not able, they had no conſiderable
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156158:13"/>
ſtrength to make good any reſiſtance; to take away this anſwer; They uſually cite a place out of one of the Fathers, <hi>Tertullian</hi> by name, wherein he<note place="margin">Si enim &amp; hoſtes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertos, non tantum vindices occultos, agere vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſet nobis vis nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum &amp; copiarum?—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terni ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra omnia implevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, urbes, inſulas, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtella, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipia, concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula, caſtra ipſa, &amp;c.—Cui bello non idonei, non prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pti fuiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp;c.

            <p>Becauſe this objection is matter of ſo much confidence and triumph to the adverſary, I ſhall deſire leave to examine it the more thoroughly, and to ſearch the bottome and foundations of it in my anſwer to it, I ſhall firſt ſpeake to the teſtimony propounded, and conſider the validitie or likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the truth thereof; and ſecondly, (for argument ſake) the truth of it being granted or ſuppoſed, we ſhall indeavour to ſhew of how little force or concernment it is, any wayes to diſable the truth of that poſition we have in hand, which juſtifieth a reſiſtance againſt the violent execution of any unjuſt command from Kings, in thoſe that are aſſaulted under pretence thereof; therefore as concerning the teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> touching the ſufficiencie of ſtrength the Chriſtians in his time ſhould have to reſiſt the Emperour and all his power. I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this Father might eaſily be miſtaken in taking the proportion, and making the eſtimate of the ſtrength and power of Chriſtians within the compaſſe of the Roman Empire, in compariſon of the ſtrength of thoſe that were ready to oppoſe them. This was no point of faith, nor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; and therefore a devout father might eaſily fall under a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion herein. The common ſaying indeed is, that <hi>unicuique in arte ſua credendum, i. e.</hi> every man is to be beleeved in his owne art or profeſſion, but no rule of charitie or reaſon bindes us to believe another in any thing which belongs to the art or profeſſion of another, and wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is little verſed or exerciſed. Now to weigh the ſtrength of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, State, or Empire, (as it were) in a ballance, and to make an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of, and compare together the power of ſeverall parties or diviſions of people in it with ſo much exactneſſe, as to determine which is the ſtronger, and which the weaker, belongs to the profeſſion and imployment of a States-man, not of a Divine, orminiſter of the Goſpell, of one that ſits at the ſterne of the empire, not of one whoſe heart, and time, and ſtrength are taken up with the ſtudie of the myſteries of heaven, yea for a States-man himſelfe to be able upon ſufficient grounds, preciſely to determine ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as we ſpeake of, I meane betweene the ſtrength and ſtrength of different parties in a State, where there is any neereneſſe or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an equality, wil require both double diligence and treble ſufficiency in him otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:156158:14"/>2. How eaſily might he miſtake and miſcarry in a matter quite beſide his profeſſion and courſe, who not long after miſcarryed ſo grievouſly in his owne, as to turne <hi>Montaniſt,</hi> who called himſelfe the Holy Ghoſt, and to approve of the dreames and furious fancies of thoſe two vile women, <hi>Maximilla</hi> and <hi>Priſca (Montanus</hi> his wicked aſſociates) for true prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Yea ſtayed not here neither, but joyned himſelfe with thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques called <hi>Cataphryges,</hi> who condemned ſecond marriages as adulterous and prohibited by God: beſides divers other miſpriſions in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which would take up too much time to inſiſt particularly upon: a memorable example and warning (as it were) from heaven, how unſafe and dangerous it is to build upon the authority of men.</p>
            <p>3. It is well obſerved by one, that there is an aptneſſe and proneneſſe of inclination in much devotion, in perſons devoutly given, to over-value the workes and piety of other men. Now this Father out of ſuch a principle or inclination as this is, deſirous to extoll and magnifie the patience of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, might eaſily draw in ſuch a circumſtance as this for ſuch a purpoſe, upon very weake and ſlender grounds for it.</p>
            <p>4. It is generally obſerved and knowne by the writings and records of theſe times, that even in the pious and Orthodox Fathers themſelves there were ſome touches and ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eines, ſome <hi>fibrae</hi> of that roote of bitterneſſe which afterwards grew ranke, and flouriſhed above meaſure in the times of Popery, yea and brought forth fruit abundantly unto death. I meane, an inclination to credit and countenance their Religion in the ſight of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and the world about them, by very ſlender reports and relations of things, as of Miracles, Viſions ſtrange accidents, &amp;c. which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected, as fabulous and falſe, by the ſounder and more conſiderate knowledge of theſe latter dayes.</p>
            <p>5. Supoſe there might be conſiderable numbers of men of the Chriſtian party in the Empire (though to me it is one of the things I leaſt beleeve) to withſtand the heathen party therein, yet doubtleſſe theſe were kept under, as the Iſraelites were in Aegypt, when they began to multiply. It is no wayes likely, that if they were any wayes formidable for their numbers, that they ſhould be ſuffered to have any proportion of armes or meanes, either of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or defence, in caſe they were aſſaulted. It being contrary to all reaſon and rule of State, to ſuffer a party of an oppoſite Religion to the State, and worſhipping another God then the State allowed, growing to any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable numbers within them, to have farther any ſuch proportion or quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of weapons, armes, or meanes in any kinde, whereby they might endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and become formidable to the State. Now then granting that which this Father ſpake concerning the numbers of Chriſtians amongſt the heathens,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156158:14"/>
that they had number for number, man for man, and in this reſpect might ſeeme to ballance them, and be able enough to reſiſt them; yet wanting armes and other meanes of defence, wherewith it cannot be conceived but that the adverſe party abounded, it had been in vaine for them to have made reſiſtance when violence was offered unto them. And thus much for the firſt part of my Anſwer, to ſhew the queſtionableneſſe, or rather indeed the great unlikelihood of the truth of that teſtimony, which is brought to ſupport the objection propounded, which otherwiſe would fall to the ground of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>I goe on to the ſecond part of my Anſwer, which is to prove and to ſhew, that though the teſtimony be admitted for truth, yet the objection will not reach the queſtion, or caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſuppoſe we the Father that ſpake as we have heard, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Chriſtians under the Heathen Emperours ſhould be able enough to have defended themſelves, yea to have oppoſed the Emperour himſelfe with his party, ſpake nothing herein but the truth; yet it doth not follow, that all thoſe of his profeſſion, I meane all the Chriſtians that were ſcattered up and downe the face of the Empire ſhould have the ſame apprehenſions with him herein, ſhould thinke themſelves ſtrong enough to reſiſt their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in caſe they were oppoſed. Thoſe particular perſons that were called out here and there, ſome after others, to ſuffer, might very probably, yea, could not lightly but conceive and thinke, that if they ſhould have made any reſiſtance againſt them that came to lay violent hands upon them, and to put them to death, they ſhould have but enraged their malice againſt them the more, and ſo have encreaſed their own torments: yea, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have provoked the Heathen party, to rage ſo much the more againſt their Chriſtian Brethren, who yet remained amongſt them. So that in thoſe that were called to ſuffer, it had been both want of wiſdome, in reſpect of themſelves, and of charitie in reſpect of others, if they ſhould have made the leaſt reſiſtance againſt thoſe unjuſt and bloody officers, that were ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them to take away their lives.</p>
            <p>If it be here replyed and ſaid; yea but the whole body and partie of Chriſtians throughout the Empire, having ſufficent ſtrength might have agreed to have riſen up at once, and have ſuppreſſed their adverſaries, if they had Judged it lawfull.</p>
            <p>To this, Anſwer hath in part been made already: as firſt, that it is no waies probable that they had any ſufficiencie of ſtrength, no not of men, to have made good ſuch an attempt, much leſſe that they had any competent proviſion of meanes otherwiſe, which had been requiſite therunto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that though it ſhould be granted, that they had a ſufficiencie of ſtrength both wayes, yet is it no wayes neceſſary that therefore they ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156158:15"/>
all be of the ſame minde and judgement touching this ſufficiencie; that they ſhould all be perſwaded that their party were ſtrong enough to deale with their adverſaries. We know that many attempts, projects, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings which have been in treaty and agitation, have been deſerted and laid aſide, only through the different judgements and apprehenſions of thoſe that vvere concerned, and to have been engaged therein, touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience or feaceableneſſe of them. As that proiect of <hi>Achitophell</hi> for the immediate and cloſe following of <hi>David,</hi> was deſerted by <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and his<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4.</note> party, and not put in execution, becauſe of the different adviſe which <hi>Huſhai</hi> the Archit gave. A late inſtance hereof vve had likewiſe amongſt our ſelves: that dangerous deſigne of bringing up the Army out of the North againſt the Parliament, proved abortive, the execution of it never ſeeing the light of the Sun, through the different opinions of thoſe that were, &amp; were to have been in ſpeciall maner concerned therin; ſome conceiving it to have been a proiect deſerving the name of <hi>none ſuch;</hi> others no wayes daring to adventure themſelves, their lives, and fortunes, nor ſome (perhaps) their conſciences, upon it. In like manner for the Chriſtians living within the Romane Empire, to have made head and riſen up ageinſt the maine body and State of the Empire to ſuppreſſe them, had been an enterpriſe of that dangerous and grievous conſequence, in caſe it had miſcarryed: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the grounds of the ſucceſſe of it being ſo uncertaine and weake as they were, that it hath not the leaſt appearance or ſhew of likelihood, that ever it ſhould be generally conſented unto by the whole ſociety of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; without which there was no attempting the putting of it into execution.</p>
            <p>To this may be added.</p>
            <p>3. That ſuppoſe the Chriſtians wee ſpake of had been generally confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their ſtrength and had made little queſtion but that they might have carried it againſt the Emperor and his; yet having no invitation, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or command from any Authoritie, rule, or lawfull power in the Empire to attempt any ſuch thing, their caſe was farre differing from ours who are invited, countenanced, encouraged, and ſome waies commanded by as great and as lawfull an Authority as this ſtate hath any, to doe what you have been exhorted to doe in oppoſing the rage and violence of that malignant and blood-thirſty generation, who having ſtollen away the heart of the King, make uſe of his name to make havock and ſpoile of your Lawes, Liberties, Eſtates, Lives, Religion, yea of the Peace, Honour, and ſafety of the whole Kingdome. It is the expreſſe command and ordinance of God that inferiour Magiſtrates, and Rulers ſhould be obeyed as well as Kings, as we obſerved formerly out of that of <hi>Peter, 2 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Therefore ſubmit your ſelves unto every, or all manner of ordinance of man, for</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:156158:15"/>
               <hi>the Lords ſake, whether it be unto the King as unto the Superiour, or unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, as thoſe that are ſent of him, for the puniſhment of evill-doers, &amp;c.</hi> So that inferiour Governours are by the expreſſe Commandement of God to be obeyed, as well as the Superiour. Now then put the caſe that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Governour requires that which is only honeſt, agreeable to the Laws of God and of Nature, as, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould doe our beſt to defend our ſelves againſt thoſe that contrary to all Law and conſcience aſſault us; the ſuperiour, that which is contrary to both, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſit ſtill whileſt our Lawes, Liberties, Eſtates, Lives, friends, godly Magiſtrates, and Religion it ſelfe, are indangered, and ready to be taken from us; the queſtion in this caſe, whether we are to obey the inferiour or ſuperiour Authority; (the command of God indifferently extending it for obedience unto either, in things that are lawfull) is eaſily reſolved, except men will complaine and ſay it is darke at noone day. When it ſhall be ſubſtantially proved unto us, that an unlawfull command from a ſuperiour Magiſtrate, diſſolves and makes void that commandement of God, whereby we ſtand bound to obey the inferiour, in that which is lawfull; We may then have cauſe to make a demurre touching the goodneſſe of the cauſe; but till then we may be bold to ſay, it is day, when the Sun ſhineth. This then is a difference very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, between the caſe of primitive Chriſtians, and ours, in the point in hand, ſuppoſing they had power to defend themſelves againſt the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting agents and inſtruments of the Emperour, yet had they not any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or command from any Authority in that State to doe it, which we have in ours.</p>
            <p>4. Still ſuppoſing (that which yet is never to be granted, till it be better proved) that the Primitive Chriſtians we ſpake of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had a ſufficiency of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to have defended themſelves againſt the perſecuting Emperours, and did it not, yet there may be this reaſon given, why they ſhould rather patiently ſuffer, than make reſiſtance, becauſe whileſt they were yet heathen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted to the Chriſtian Faith, they conſented to that power or authority in the Emperour, whereby he made thoſe bloody Edicts for the perſecuting and murthering of poore Chriſtians. Now it had been a very unreaſonable thing and juſtly offenſive, both in the eyes of God and men, if the ſame perſons who had eſtabliſhed a power or authority in the hand of a Ruler, ſhould have reſiſted or oppoſed him, or his Agents and Miniſters in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it. A ſervant of God, <hi>though he ſweares</hi> or bargaines to <hi>his owne hurt,</hi> yet muſt he <hi>not change,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. But wee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no ſuch ingagements, or bands, and therefore have a liberty which they had not: For though a mans conſent to an unlawfull power, be in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſimple conſideration a meere nullity, and ſuch a power never the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:156158:16"/>
more lawfullized thereby; yet by all rules of reaſon and equity, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ought to be a bar againſt him that hath given it, that he ſhall not, for any carnall benefit or advantage, breake out againſt him that exerciſeth this power by vertue of ſuch conſent, meerly for ſuch exerciſe ſake.</p>
            <p>5. Be it granted that the Chriſtian party in the Romane Empire was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great (as is pretended) yet could it in no ſence be called or looked upon as the whole State or body of the Empire, as the Paril mentary Aſſembly is amongſt us. This in a repreſentative and legall conſideration, is the whole body of the Nation, and of all the perſons in it, having the ſame power and authority by Law, and in conſcience too, to do every whit as much in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect, as the whole Nation, and all the particular perſons therein could have, if they were met together. Now that may be lawfull for an entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or ſociety of perſons to doe, which may not be lawfull for a part, or ſome few of the ſociety, ſave only in conjunction with the whole. The Parliament (we know) being interpretatively, and in conſideration of Law, the whole body of the Kingdome, hath a lawfull power, both to doe and command many things, which a far greater part or number of men in the Kingdome, have not; no, all the Kingdome beſides hath no ſuch power, as they: and many things may be done very lawfully, and with a good conſcience, by vertue of their appointment and command, which could not be done upon any ſuch termes without it, though a thouſand times more men or perſons then they are ſhould command them.</p>
            <p>6. Suppoſing they had ſuch a power as we have oft ſuppoſed (but never granted poſitively) and that it was lawfull for them to have made reſiſtance accordingly, yet may God by way of ſpeciall diſpenſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for very great and conſiderable ends of his, hide this liberty we ſpeake of from their eyes; that they ſhould not ſee it to make uſe of. Wee know there were many in the Apoſtles time, who <hi>eat hearbs,</hi> when as yet it was as lawfull for them, in reſpect of any command of God to the contrary, to have eaten fleſh; but yet they did better to content themſelves with hearbs, when God had not revealed and cleared up this liberty unto them. And yet they did as well as they too, who ſeeing their liberty in this kinde by the cleare light of the Goſpell, did take it, and eate fleſh. Conſider that paſſage of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom. 14. 6. He that obſerveth a day, obſerveth it unto the Lord: and he that obſerveth not a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſerveth it not unto the Lord. He that eateth, eateth unto the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he giveth God thanks: and he that eateth not, eateth not unto the Lord, and giveth God thankes.</hi> Whereby it is evident that the forbearance of ſome actions by ſome men, wherein they approve themſelves unto God, doth not at all prejudice or gaineſay the like acceptation of others in their doing them: yea that ſome men may be bound in conſcience to forbeare
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156158:16"/>
that, which another with a good conſcience may doe. And this doubtleſſe is (if the teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentioned be true) the caſe betweene thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, and Chriſtians in theſe dayes. They might out of tenderneſſe of conſcience, and out of an apprehenſion of ſome unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it, forbeare to vindicate themſelves againſt thoſe bloody bucthers, that were ſet on worke by the Emperours to deſtroy them: and yet Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in theſe dayes, ſeeing their liberty in this kinde, may as lawfully reſiſt thoſe that ſhall come againſt them in the like manner, as the other forbare it.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected and ſaid that it is no wayes like that the Church of God ſhould generally be ignorant of ſuch a libertie as wee ſpeake of and challenge, if there were any ſuch liberty indeed; is it credible that God ſhould hide ſuch a point of truth as this from them all?</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, It is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe that it ſhould bee hid from them all without exception: it is ſufficient for our purpoſe if it were hid from their teachers, and thoſe that were leaders to the reſt, upon whoſe judgement (in things of this nature) the generality of people then much depended. But ſecondly, if there were many miniſters of the Goſpell and teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in the Apoſtles times themſelves, that were ignorant of that liberty which the Goſpell brought with it to the world, for the eating of fleſh, the non-obſervation of dayes and of circumciſion, &amp;c. or at leaſt were ſo faire ignorant, that they were not able to informe and ſatisfie the generall ſort of Chriſtians therein, it may very well be conceived, that ſome hundreds of yeares after, when the light began to darken and wax dim (in compariſon) they might now be generally ignorant of ſuch a point of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as this we now ſpeake of, at leaſt ſo farre ignorant, as not to be able to ſatisfie the generalitie of their people therein. Eſpecially if we conſider,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that from the dayes of the Apoſtles, untill their numbers and ſtrength were raiſed and increaſed to the ſuppoſed pitch of a ſufficiencie to reſiſt (which was not leſſe then neere 200. yeares) there was no occaſion, of ſtudying, or looking into the point: they had beene in never the better caſe, whether they had had that liberty we ſpeake of or no; and therefore it is no marvaile if they neglected the ſearching after it. And when caſes of conſcience (as this was) lie unſtudied and uninquired into, neither is it any marvaile if the reſolution or ſtate of the truth in them, bee not generally knowne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that Spirit of courage, patience and conſtancy, which God poured out abundantly upon his Church &amp; ſervants in thoſe times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were ſo ſtrengthned and incouraged to ſuffer, that martyrdome ſeemed a deſirable thing unto them, might be a ſpeciall reaſon and meanes to take them off from inquiring into, or ſo much as thinking what their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156158:17"/>
lawfull liberty might be in the caſe we ſpeake of. Men that have a full eſtate in faire rents, as much as they can well ſpend, and as their heart deſireth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not like, have no occaſion to buſie themſelves in ſtudying the caſe of uſury, as whether it be lawfull to take increaſe for the lone of mony, or no; which he that hath his eſtate in mony, hath. Whilſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed by God in an extraordinary way by Manna from heaven, there was no neceſſitie or occaſion for them to plough and ſow. So whilſt Chriſtians were furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an extraordinary ſtrength from heaven, to offer themſelves up in martyrdome, their edge muſt needs be taken off hereby, as from ſeeking meanes to eſcape it, ſo from ſtudying caſes and queſtions about the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of eſcaping.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, whilſt there lay a confeſſed neceſſity of ſuffering upon Chriſtians, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the ſuppoſed ſtrength of reſiſtance came to them (which as was noted before, could not be much leſſe then 200. yeares) Martyrdome was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and magnified by the generall acclamations of the miniſters, and continuall panegyricks, and orations made in praiſe thereof, that it is like no man would for a long time be endured, that ſhould teach any doctrine that might any wayes ſeeme to take men off from the deſire thereof. As there are many doctrines and points of Religion amongſt our ſelves that have beene a long time taught with ſo high an hand, and generally received with ſo full an applauſe, that it is not ſafe for any man to appeare ſo much as in a ſeeming oppoſition to them, (though with never ſo much modeſtie and tenderneſſe.) But,</p>
            <p>Sixtly (and laſtly for this) whether God was pleaſed to make uſe of one or both of their particulars laſt mentioned, or any other like unto them, as a meanes to hide that libertie of reſiſtance wee ſpeake of from the eyes of the primitive Chriſtians, or no; certaine it is, that the frame and tenour of his after diſpenſations, did require, that ſuch a libertie ſhould be hid from them; or at leaſt that they ſhould not make uſe of it; as on the contrary, the nature and purport of thoſe diſpenſations which God hath now in hand, requires that this libertie ſhould be manifeſted and made knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtians. We know that according to the counſell and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, Antichriſt was then to come into the world: as now wee know that he is about to be deſtroyed and caſt out of the world. Now this is a generall rule, looke what truthes were neceſſary to be ſhut up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the Churches of Chriſt, that Antichriſt might paſſe by, and get up into his throane; the diſcovery and letting out of the ſame into the world, are neceſſary for his pulling downe. For certaine it is, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt could never have gotten up into that throane, whereon hee yet ſits and ſhewes himſelfe in his ſacrilegious glory, had not God by ſpeciall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156158:17"/>
ſuffered him to make many truths his footſtoole. If all truths had beene clearely taught in the Church of Chriſt, and accordingly received and beleeved, it had beene impoſſible that ever ſuch a monſter ſhould have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the temple of God, that ſhould <hi>exalt himſelfe above all that which is called God.</hi> But God cauſing a dead ſleepe (as it were) to fall upon thoſe truthes, which ſhould in ſpeciall manner have oppoſed him, hee had the opportunity without much contradiction or noyſe to ſteale and convey himſelfe into that <hi>Cathedram peſtilentiae,</hi> that chaire of papall ſtate, which yet he poſſeſſeth. Now amongſt many other truths that were of neceſſity to be laid aſleepe, for the paſſing of this beaſt unto his great power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for the maintayning and ſafe-guarding of him in the poſſeſſion hereof, this is one of ſpeciall conſideration; that Chriſtians may lawfully in a lawfull way, ſtand up to defend themſelves, in caſe they be able, againſt any unlawfull aſſaults; by what aſſailants, or by what pretended Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoever made upon them. For had this opinion beene timeouſly enough, and ſubſtantially taught in the Church, it would certainly have cauſed an abortion in Antichriſts birth, and ſo have diſappointed the divell of his firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne. Had not the ſpirits, and judgements, and conſciences of men beene as it were cowed and marvellouſly imbaſed and kept under, (and ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Antichriſts lure) by doctrines and tenents, exceſſively advancing the power of ſuperiours, over inferiours, and binding Iron yokes and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthens upon thoſe that were in ſubjection, doubtleſſe they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have bowed downe their backes ſo low as to let ſuch a beaſt goe over them, they would never reſigned up their judgements and conſciences into the hand of ſuch a ſpirituall tyrant as he. So that you ſee, there was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall neceſſitie for the letting of Antichriſt into the world, yea and for the continuance of him in his Throne, that no ſuch opinion as this which wee ſpeake of, whether truth or untruth ſhould be taught and beleeved; I meane, which vindicateth and maintaineth, the juſt rights, and liberties, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of thoſe that under authority, and ſubjection unto others.</p>
            <p>Whereas, now on the contrary, that time of Gods preordination and purpoſe, for the downefall of Antichriſt, drawing neere, there is a kinde of neceſſitie, that thoſe truths, which have ſlept for many yeares, ſhould now be awakened: and particularly that God ſhould reveale and diſcover unto his faithfull miniſters, and other his ſervants the juſt bounds and limits of Authoritie, and power, and conſequently the juſt and full extent of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full liberties of thoſe that live in ſubiection. Evident it is, that they are the commonaltie of Chriſtians, I meane Chriſtians of ordinary ranke and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that ſhall be moſt active, and have the principall hand in executing the judgements of God upon the Whore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conſider that place, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4, 5, 6.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156158:18"/>
               <hi>And I heard another voyce from heaven ſay, goe out of her my people, that yee be not partakers in her ſinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her ſins are come up unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities. Reward her even as ſhe hath rewarded you, and give her double according to her workes, and in the cup that ſhe hath filled to you, fill her the double.</hi> Now that this ſervice ſhall be performed unto God by them (Chriſtians I mean of under rank and qualitie) contrary to the will, deſires, or commands of thoſe Kings and Princes under whom they live, it appeares by that which immediatly followes, <hi>verſe 9. And the Kings of the earth ſhall bewaile her and lament for her, which have committed fornication and lived in pleaſure with her, when they ſhall ſee the ſmoake of her burning.</hi> It is evident that the people of God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, were ſubiects to theſe Kings, that ſhould bewayle the whore in her ruine; for they are ſuch as come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> which could not be, except they had lived under thoſe Kings that were Babyloniſh, and had given their Kingdomes to the whore, and by whom Babyloniſme had been countenanced and ſet up. And that theſe (or at leaſt the greateſt part of them) ſhould no wayes conſent to the deſtruction of the whore by their ſubiects, it is evident by this; they ſhould <hi>waile and lament over her,</hi> when ſhe is deſtroyed. As for that which is found in the former Chapter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the 10. Kings <hi>(Rev. 17. 17.) Into whoſe heart God hath put it to give their Kingdomes or power to the Beaſt,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>that theſe ſhould hate the whore and make her deſolate, and naked, and eat her fleſh, and burne her with fire;</hi> I conceive this is not meant of the perſons of Kings, but of their States and Kingdomes, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the generalitie of their people under them.</p>
            <p>1. The expreſſion, will fairely, and with full conſonancie to the Scripture language elſewhere, carry this ſence and interpretation; the bodies of States or Kingdomes indefinitely taken and conſidered, being uſually ſignified by their heads, as Dukedomes by Dukes, Kingdomes by Kings, &amp;c. as wee have had occaſion formerly to obſerve more at large when we produced ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall inſtances from the Scriptures of this kind of phraſe. I ſhall (for the preſent) be your remembrancer onely of that one, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 17. with verſe 23. where verſe the 17. <hi>the foure great Beaſts</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>foure Kings that ſhall ariſe out of the earth.</hi> Yet verſe 23. it is ſaid that <hi>the fourth Beaſt ſhall be the fourth Kingdome upon earth, which ſhall be diverſe from all Kingdomes, i. e.</hi> all the other three Kingdomes formerly expreſſed by three Kings. I could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to ſeverall other Texts of Scripture where the ſame manner of ſpeaking is found; but that I haſten. 2. If we take the word, Kings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, <hi>i. e.</hi> preciſely for the perſons that are the heads and chiefe rulers of Kingdomes, in that Scripture, and will ſay, that theſe <hi>ſhall hate the whore and make her deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> I apprehend no poſſibility (for the preſent) of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156158:18"/>
this place, with that other mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciouſly with her, ſhall bewaile her, and lament for her, when they ſhall ſee the ſmoke of her burning.</hi> Certainely they that ſhall <hi>hate her,</hi> and helpe to <hi>make her deſolate,</hi> and to <hi>burne her with fire,</hi> will not bewayle her, nor lament over her, after ſuch a manner, as is farther expreſſed in that which followes in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for that Expoſition, which by the Kings of the earth that ſhould bewaile and lament over the Whore in her burning, underſtandeth Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. who in their port and pompe are as Kings, it ſeemeth not probable; I rather conceive theſe to be the <hi>Merchants of the earth that ſhould weepe and waile ever her, becauſe no man buyeth their wares any more, verſ.</hi> 11. and who are ſaid <hi>to have waxen rich,</hi> by that long trade and trafique they had had with the world, in thoſe Babiloniſh commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. Therefore they are the ten Kingdomes indefinitely conſidered. <hi>i.</hi> perſons living within the ten Kingdomes, not the ten Kings perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and properly taken, that ſhall hate the Whore and make her deſolate, and burne her fleſh with fire. Now this promiſe and prediction of God concerning the deſtruction of the Whore by Chriſtians of inferiour ranke and qualitie, can hardly be conceived however it ſhould be fulfilled or take place, except the judgements and conſciences of men ſhould be loſed and ſet at libertie from the bands and fetters of thoſe enſlaving Doctrines and apprehenſions, wherewith they had beene formerly oppreſſed and made ſervile above meaſure, to thoſe that were in place and authority over them. Thus then we ſee a ground and reaſon fully ſatisfactory, both how and why the Chriſtians in the Primitive times, whileſt Antichriſt was in comming, might well be ignorant of that liberty, the knowledge whereof would have kept him from his Throne; and alſo why that liberty ſhould now be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God and taught unto his people; the ignorance whereof would ſtill keepe and continue him upon his Throne, when Gods Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is that he ſhall be throwne downe. And this for Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection laſt propounded; and for the ſixt Particular, by way of Anſwer to the maine Objection. But,</p>
            <p>7. (And laſtly) whatſoever the credit or authority of <hi>Tertullian</hi> may be for the ſtrength of Chriſtians in Primitive times, to make reſiſtance againſt their enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; how juſtifiable, or commendable ſoever the patience &amp; ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Chriſtians in ſuffering as they did, may be by ſome conceived to be, ſuppoſing they had ſuch a power to have defended themſelves, as is ſuppoſed; yet moſt certaine it is, that as well the authority of the one as the ſubmiſſion of the other, yea and both together, being both Apocriphall, are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:156158:19"/>
too light to weigh againſt the authority of the practice of that great Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who made reſiſtance againſt the Kings Meſſenger, that was ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to take away his head (as we inſtanced to you in the former part of this Diſcourſe) as alſo againſt <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, who being but a private man, ſtrengthened himſelfe as well as hee could, both with men and armes, yea and with <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword to boote, to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt the unjuſt and bloody perſecution of <hi>Saul;</hi> both which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (beſides others of like importance) are Canonicall. <hi>Eliſha</hi> muſt not be cenſured as an evill-doer, nor <hi>David</hi> condemned for a Traytor, or Rebell, either becauſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that there were Chriſtians enough in the Romane Empire, to make their party good againſt the Emperour &amp; his wicked inſtruments, nor yet becauſe theſe Chriſtians did not ſtand up in their owne defence, having ſufficiency of ſtrength to have done it. Thus we ſee there is nothing at all in the patience or ſubmiſſion of the primitive Chriſtians, ſo much urged and inſiſted upon, to diſcountenance that cauſe and ſervice, wherein your beſt concurrence hath been deſired, of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or concernment that way. To riſe up in your owne defence, in the defence of your lives, your eſtates, your liberties, your wives, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, your friends, your lawes, your religion, againſt thoſe, who without any lawfull Authority or Warrant either of God or men, are riſen up with all their might, and all their power to make havock, and ſpoile, and ruine of all, is no wayes offenſive either in the ſight of God, or reaſonable men.</p>
            <p>And (to conclude) if any man be afraid that Martyrdome ſhould ſuffer by this, as either that the glory hereof ſhould be eclipſed, or that all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of expreſſing our ſelves unto God and Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſhould be cut off, and taken away by ſuch an opinion. I anſwer, No: The glory and praiſe of Martyrdome will remaine as entire, with this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as without it, and the opportunities of ſhewing our ſelves in our love and faithfulneſſe unto Chriſt in ſuch a ſervice, will no wayes be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed hereby.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the glory and praiſe of Martyrdome or ſuffering for Chriſt, doth not conſiſt in lying down, and ſuffering proud and wicked men to ride over our heads, in ſitting ſtill whileſt our eſtates, liberties, wives, children, friends, are ruined and deſtroyed before our faces, when God puts an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity into our hand to defend them; the name and Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt would rather ſuffer loſſe by ſuch a patience as this, then any wayes gaine; it were more Infidell-like, then Chriſtian, not to make the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion we can, for the ſafety of thoſe that are ſo neare to us in ſuch a caſe. But the grace and glory of Martyrdome lyeth in this; Firſt, when a man is reſolved to profeſſe the name, and faith of Chriſt, what danger ſoever hee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:156158:19"/>
incurs, what loſſe ſoever he ſuſtaines, or is like to ſuſtaine by it. Secondly, When it comes to the neceſſity of ſuffering, that he baulkes not, nor ſaulters with Chriſt: that he is not any wayes aſhamed of him, or any of his words, or wayes. Thirdly, When a man diſdeignes deliverance upon any baſe termes, or by unworthy meanes, that ſcornes to fly away for the enjoyment of any reſt, except it be with the wings of a Dove (the Scripture Embleme of innocency) <hi>which is covered with ſilver wings</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>and her feathers like yellow gold.</hi> It is ever honourable to fly with ſuch wings as theſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) when God doth not open a doore of lawfull eſcape unto him, either by flight or otherwiſe, but hedgeth him up (as it were) with thornes into the hand of the perſecutor, that he patiently and with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and compoſedneſſe of ſpirit, without any breakings out in one kinde or other, without any expreſſion of diſcontent either againſt God or man, ſubmitteth himſelfe unto the ſtroke, in what kinde ſoever it falls upon him.</p>
            <p>And ſecodly, for opportunities of Martyrdome, of ſuffering for Chriſt, and that in numbers more then we deſire, they will not be wanting, though we ſhall not-ſuffer every baſe Cavalier, that ſaith he is for the King to cut our throats, or to plunder our Cities, Townes, or Houſes, to commit out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and inſolencies upon Wives, Children, Friends, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. It is a ſuffering for Chriſt (and ſo a degree or kinde of Martyrdome) to ſuffer thoſe things which we doe, in feares, in dangers, in diſtractions, in runnings, or removings up and downe, in diſappointments of our affaires, in the loſſe, expence, or forbearance of our eſtates, by thoſe men of <hi>Belial,</hi> that are as thornes in our eyes, and ſcourges in our ſides, only or chiefly becauſe we will be that in open and conſtant profeſſion, which by the grace of God we are inwardly and in the truth of our ſoules; becauſe we will not proſtitute our conſciences to the luſts of their Father the devill, we will not give the right hand of fellowſhip to them, in thoſe deſperate courſes of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and prophanneſſe wherein they are engaged, and wherein (it ſeemes) they meane to weary, yea and weare themſelves out before they will give over.</p>
            <p>2. We lie open to the hatred and malice, to the mockings and ſcoffings, to the rayling and revilings, to the ſlanders and lyings of the whole malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party round about us; and that becauſe we hold forth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his holineſſe and purity, in his power and authority over the world, in his truth, and faithfulneſſe, in his mercy, and goodneſſe, in his glory, and Majeſty, in our lives, and converſations. And this is a Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome too, or ſuffering for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) we know not how ſoon or ſuddenly we may be called out by God, to ſuffer even a perfect and compleate Martyrdome indeed, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:156158:20"/>
lay downe our lives for Chriſt; when God will hedge up every way of eſcape againſt us with thornes, and leave us in <hi>Peters</hi> ſtreights, <hi>To ſtretch forth our hands, and have another to gird us, and to lead us whither we would not. John</hi> 21. 18. So that we ſhall leave occaſions, and opportunities enough, even as many as God himſelfe ever made, for the expreſſing of our love and faithfulneſſe unto Chriſt and his Goſpell in wayes of ſuffering, though we ſtand up like men, and quit our ſelves with all our might, and all our ſtrength, againſt thoſe aſſacinates, and ſworne Sword-men of the devill, who have conſpired the death and ruine of all that feareth God in the Land.</p>
            <p>Only for a cloſe of all that I have to ſay in this point, let me adde this one thing by way of caution, that opportunities of ſuffering Martyrdome will not alwayes continue in the Church for the ſervants of God: yea, the time draweth neare, when they ſhall ceaſe and be no more. The ſad retinue of <hi>the firſt things,</hi> (as they are called <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4) which hath been a long time in paſſing by, even for many Generations, is now almoſt quite paſſed; God is now bringing up the reere of this hoſt of ſorrowes, and when this is paſſed, he will turne the wheele of his providence and diſpenſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his own Church, and the Synagogue of Sathan. That ſide which hath been down hitherto, ſhall be upward, and that which hath been above, ſhall be below: Now the devils Saints, and the Children of the Whore, even all <hi>fearefull and unbeleeving ones, and abominable, and murtherers, and Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Sorcerers; and all lyars,</hi> they ſhall be called to their Martyrdome, and the Saints of the moſt high ſhall give them double, of their owne cup. <note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 13. 10.</note> 
               <hi>They that led into captivity</hi> hitherto, <hi>ſhall</hi> now <hi>goe into captivity</hi> themſelves: <hi>and they that killed with the ſword</hi> hitherto, <hi>ſhall</hi> now <hi>be killed with the ſword</hi> themſelves. And who they are that ſhall now lead into captivity, and ſlay with the ſword, you may informe your ſelves, <hi>Rev. 18. 6, 7. Reward her, even as ſhe hath rewarded you:</hi> you, <hi>viz.</hi> in your Brethren, that have walked in the ſteps of the ſame faith and holineſſe with you: <hi>And give her double, &amp;c. This is the honour which the Saints ſhall have, to execute the judgement that is written, upon the whore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another motive to ſtrengthen your hand the ſame way, may be to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as the cauſe recommended to you is every waies juſtifiable, ſo is it a matter of the higheſt &amp; deepeſt concernment unto you to ſtand by it &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it to the utmoſt you are able, yea (if it were poſſible) above &amp; beyond what you are able to do. All your intereſts, relations, &amp; concernments in this world are bound up in it: yea, it narrowly concernes you in relation to the world which is to come, your everlaſting eſtate and condition is not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in it. Firſt, what have you in this world amongſt all that which you call yours, any wayes deare or precious unto you, but that the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:156158:20"/>
line of this cauſe, whatſoever it proves, is like to be ſtretched upon it: the cauſe which is now depending and pleading between you and your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, will certainly be either the riſing or falling of it.</p>
            <p>1. For your Eſtates, theſe are already deſigned, by your enemies, for a reward and recompence of their labour and travell in procuring your ruine. Your ſilver, and gold, your houſes, and lands, with all your precious and pleaſant things beſides, muſt call you Maſters no more, if you fall into the hands of theſe devourers. If they prevaile, they will be like a <hi>ſweeping raine</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>that will leave no food.</hi> You muſt looke for no other <hi>mercies</hi> from them, but thoſe that <hi>are cruell;</hi> you heare daily from divers parts of the Land, of what ſpirit they are in this kinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ſpoyle and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine they make of the precious ſubſtance of your Brethren, where they have opportunity to fall; notwithſtanding they are not yet in a poſture to their mindes, to follow this occupation of ruine and ſpoile, as they deſire and hope to doe. They have a bridle of ſome feare in the jawes of their fury, they cannot ſtay by their work, they cannot gather in their harveſt ſo cleane as they deſire. But if they doe theſe things being but yet in the valley, what will they doe, if they ſhould make good the mountaine? if they commit ſuch inſolencies as theſe in the day of their feares, what will they doe in the day of their power, if ever this Sun ſhould ariſe upon them? I beſeech you conſider this, you that have lived at eaſe, and in all fulneſſe hitherto, and have wanted nothing of all that your hearts could deſire, to make your lives comfortable unto you; that have had food, and rayment, and lodging, and harbour, upon ſuch termes, that your fleſh it ſelfe, though apt enough to murmure and complaine, hath yet been aſhamed to complaine of any want or ſcarcity in any kinde; tell me how, or what will you do in ſuch a day, wherein your faire necks, that never had yoke upon them to this day, ſhall be wrung and galled, and torne with thoſe Iron yokes, of poverty, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hunger, cold, contempt, want of all things? Will not the dayes and yeares of your former plenty and fulneſſe be ſeen upon you in abundance of ſorrow and extremity? And is it not in vaine for you to thinke that this cup ſhall paſſe by you, that you drinke not of it, if ever it be in the power of thoſe enemies of yours we ſpeake of, to make you to drinke? Doubtleſſe they muſt want of their will if you doe not drinke, yea and ſuck out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dregs of it. Whereas on the contrary, if you ſhall only this one time make good your ſtandings againſt them, and break this enterpriſe, as far as humane reaſon is able to judge, and according to the ordinary courſe of Gods admiſtration of things in the world, they are never like to riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, nor to endanger the peace of your outward enjoyments the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. If you will now be perſwaded to give out your ſelves like men,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:156158:21"/>
to advance the cauſe in hand, that which you doe is like to be a bulworke, and an impregnable defence for the time to come, to your poſſeſſions, and eſtates, againſt all violence and oppreſſion of men in this kind.</p>
            <p>2. For your liberties, this is another pretious poſſeſſion of yours in the world. I ſpeake here onely of your civill or politick libertie, which is of equall accommodation and deſirableneſſe (if not of ſuperiour) with your eſtates: and this likewiſe will certainly be oppreſſed and ſeized upon, and turned into a miſerable ſlavery and bondage, if that bloody generation ſhall carry the day againſt you, and make themſelves Lords over you. That of <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 19. is like to come upon you in this caſe: <hi>of whomſoever a man is overcome, of the ſame he is brought into bondage.</hi> It may be you are not generally ſo apprehenſive and ſenſible of the pretiouſneſſe and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your liberties, as of your eſtates; you doe not place ſo much of your outward comfort and contentment in the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the other. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof I conceive to be partly becauſe wee are generally borne free, and therefore take no care or paines to come by it, whereas many are borne poore, and to inherit little but what they can get by the ſweat of their browes: partly becauſe libertie is as plentifull amongſt us as ſilver was in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes; which was therefore little eſteemed becauſe it was <hi>as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull as the ſtones in the ſtreet, and as the wild Figtrees that grew abundantly in the plaine;</hi> there is none amongſt us but is as free as another; but there is great difference in reſpect of eſtate; partly alſo, becauſe we ſee few in any ſuffering or hard condition, we heare few cryes or complaints for want of liberty, whereas we both heare and ſee daily what hardſhip and things grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to fleſh and blood, are endured by many, both men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for want of meanes, and an outward eſtate. Haply for theſe and other reaſons that might be given, our liberties are not ſo high priſed with us as matter of eſtate is; but if we did judge righteous judgement (as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeakes) or if we had but the ſenſible advantages and quicknings to raiſe our thoughts and apprehenſions concerning our liberties, which wee have in reference to our eſtates, and which many others in the world have, in reference to liberty it ſelfe; we would thinke our liberties every whit as worthy to be placed at our right hands, as our eſtates. I muſt not ſtand to diſcourſe the benefit and ſweetneſſe of this bleſſing of libertie; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, many great and excellent things might be ſpoken. I ſhall onely ſay this, that if we lived but a while in thoſe States, where the poore ſubject is yoked with an Iron yoke of bondage, and bowes downe the backe, and grones under the heavy preſſure of uſurpation and tyrannie, as under the great Turke, or in the State of Perſia; yea or in France it ſelfe (which is neere at hand) and did but obſerve the miſerable and hard termes and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:156158:21"/>
conditions, that by reaſon of ſuch ſlavery and bondage they live under, then a dram of that libertie which yet we enjoy, would be as pretious to us, as a drop of could water would have beene to the rich man in hell, when he was ſo grievouſly tormented in thoſe flames. Now then this is that which I hold forth unto you in this motive to be conſidered of, that if ever you ſhall ſuffer the hand of the Malignant partie, which is now up in rage, and great fury againſt you, to find their enterpriſe, if the day falls to be theirs, you muſt looke to be dealt withall in your liberty, as in your eſtates; there will no partialitie be ſhewne by theſe men betweene them, they that will not ſpare you in your eſtates, neither will they favour you in your liberties: they have bands, and chaines, and fetters already prepared for your hands and feet, and Irons that will enter into your ſoules. You muſt know that they are animated and acted againſt you, with the ſpirit of that fourth beaſt in <hi>Daniel, which was unlike unto all the others, very fearefull, whoſe teeth was of Iron, and his nayles of Braſſe, which devoured, brake in pieces, and ſtampt the reſt under his feet.</hi> They are of a Lordly, inſolent, domineering and tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſpirit, ſporting themſelves in their cruelties, and delighting to ride over the heads of men, that they can get under them. Therefore now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (I beſeech you) how intolerable and grievous a thing it is like to bee unto you to beare the yoke of that cruell bondage and ſlavery which theſe men have prepared for your neckes; to live by the lawes of their luſts and pleaſures, to be at their arbitterments and wills in all things, to doe and to ſuffer, to have and to poſſeſſe as they ſhall appoint and thinke meet for you; how intollerable a condition (I ſay) this is like to prove unto you, who have beene free men and women all your dayes, and have had the diſpoſall of your ſelves and of all your wayes, and of the good things that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath caſt in unto you upon your labours or otherwiſe. Oh you will finde the change very ſharpe and terrible, beyond what I am able to expreſſe, or your ſelves for the preſent, able to apprehend. Whereas on the contrary, if you ſhall hold out this one impreſſion and onſet which they are now making upon you, and make good the ground you ſtand on againſt them; you ſhall breake their cords in ſunder, and caſt their bands from you for ever; you ſhall make ſuch an intaylement of this pretious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we ſpeake of, your libertie, to your children, and childrens children, that they ſhall never be able to cut off. If they be but now broken, they are not like ever to make themſelves whole againe: if you will be perſwaded to be men of wiſedome once, you may be men of comfort and peace ever after.</p>
            <p>3. For your wives and children, theſe (I make account) are another part of your pretious injoyments in this world: But as for theſe, neither are they like
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:156158:22"/>
to finde any better quarter in their kind from theſe bags of blood and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then your liberties and eſtates in their kind. Nay as theſe are capable of the impreſſions of more of thoſe vile affections which rage in theſe men, ſo are they like to ſuffer upon termes yet more grievous, even according to the utmoſt of their capacities in this kind: The rage of their luſts (I meane of many of them) is as barbarous and cruell, as the rage of their crueltie it ſelfe. And what meaſure you are to expect both in the one and in the other, in luſt and crueltie towards theſe, your wives (I meane) and children; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have proclaimed in your eares aloud in thoſe patternes and examples of this kinde, which in ſeverall places of the land, they have ſet for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to follow in their future courſe. I preſume you have heard of divers inſolencies and outrages of abomination committed by them with an high hand, ſuch as have made both your eares to tingle in the hearing. Therefore conſider and weigh it well with your ſelves: put your hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deepe and ſad, and ſerious apprehenſions of it, how grievous and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking and ſoule-cutting a ſight it would be unto you to ſee the honour and chaſtitie of your wives, &amp; daughters plundred by the barbarous luſts of thoſe brutiſh men, who are ready to poure out their abhominable filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uncleanneſſe where ever they be-come, and when they have done execution upon their honours, with the luſts of uncleanneſſe in the Front, to bring up the luſts of crueltie in the Reare, to doe the like execution upon their lives and blood. Aſſure your ſelves, that the divell hath the driving of them, and he will make them runne and keepe his pace, as far as ever the ſtrength of any vileneſſe and wickedneſſe in them will hold out. And ſo for your little ones that are not for their luſts: it is much to bee feared that in that reſpect, they will double their cruelties upon them, as you have heard (I preſume) that their Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> baptiſed into the ſame ſpirit of blood and abhomination with them, have done. Oh, bow can you beare the thoughts of ſuch a day likely to come upon you, wherein your young children ſhall be taken by the hand of an inhumane monſter, and daſhed in peeces againſt the ſtones, or torne one limbe from another, or toſſed upon the point of the Pike or Speare. Aſſure your ſelves that the day of all theſe aſtoniſhing things, and perhaps of things more intollerable and aſtoniſhing then theſe, is like to come upon you, except you will bee perſwaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme it, and buy it off, at the rate of your utmoſt endeavours, and of all you are able to doe to prevent it, if God will vouchſafe the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to you, to let you have it at any rate.</p>
            <p>4. That honorable Senate of both Houſes of Parliament, conſiſting of moſt of the worthies of the Land. (I meane for men of their ranke and qualitie) to whoſe unwearied labours, and diligence, and faithfulneſſe, and zeale,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:156158:22"/>
and expence, under God, you and your whole Nation owe your lives &amp; liberties, both ſpirituall and temporall, yea eſtates and all your ſweet enjoyments hitherto; and in whoſe peace and preſervation all you yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as farre as reaſon is able to diſcerne and judge, is bound up; (ſo that I may well reckon theſe amongſt your temporall enjoyments) theſe are like to periſh and to be cut off by the right hand of iniquitie, if that generation of men whoſe bloody cruelties you both have beene heretofore, and are now againe exhorted with all your might to oppoſe, ſhall ever get the upper hand. We know it is this aſſembly, that have ſtood by you and ſtucke cloſe to your liberties, and the truth and purity of that Religion you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe; that are the bulwarke and defence againſt the furious impreſſions of thoſe wicked ones, upon you, and all that is yours; And they know as much too, and looke upon them accordingly: they are they that have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe beares of their whelpes, that have ſhaken the foundation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Prelacy, and prophanneſſe in the Land; and that are at worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it night and day, to make it a land of righteouſneſſe, which is an element that theſe kinde of Creatures know not how to live in. And in this regard, theſe are the men of their rage and hatred above others; theſe are the mountaines that ſtand in their way; and what will they not doe, what will they not ſuffer to remove them, or caſt them downe, and make them into a plaine? doubtleſſe they are ſicke, and long for their blood, as much as ever <hi>David</hi> longed for the waters of the well of <hi>Bethleem.</hi> And if they ſhall ever be but able to diſſolve the power and proceedings of this Parliament now ſitting, the way will be open and ready for them, either to ſtave off all Parliaments for the future, or (which is of more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the two) to make them themſelves: and ſo the Sunne of the glory and peace of this Nation is like to ſet upon it for ever. Therefore now conſider (I beſeech you) of how lamentable and unſupportable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it would be, if this <hi>Spring</hi> ſhould be <hi>troubled</hi> (as <hi>Solomons</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is) if theſe righteous ſhall fall before theſe wicked ones; and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers Swords drinke Senators blood: And how would it be a blot upon you, and make your memoriall an infamy and reproach throughout all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if it ſhould be ſaid, that you ſate ſtill and did nothing, but keepe up your mony, while theſe men periſhed at your ſide, who had beene a guard and ſafety to you and to all that you had: yea that laboured and travailed with the honours and ſafetie of the whole Land, and were ready to cry out, and to have beene delivered, but that in the very breaking forth of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, your covetouſneſſe, and your unfaithfulneſſe, and remiſſeneſſe betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the hands of their enemies, who cruelly deſtroyed both Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children at once. Not to <hi>feede your enemie when hee hungers, or when he is thirſty,</hi> not to <hi>give him drinke,</hi> is by the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:156158:23"/>
interpreted; to be a revenging your ſelves on him; and withall to be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of high diſpleaſure and offence unto God. I beſeech you, if not to ſave the life of an enemy when it is in danger, nay if not to ſupplie ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his, which yet perhaps doe not touch his life, be a ſin of that provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the ſight of God; What ſin will that be, or by what name ſhall it be called, or what ſhall the meaſure of the provocation of it in the eyes of God be, when men ſhall ſuffer the greateſt and faithfulleſt freinds they have, that for a long time together have laboured for them in the very fire night and day, in the very midſt of their ſore conflicts and ſtrivings with men, and that cheifely for their ſakes, to periſh by the hand of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when it was in their hand and power to relieve them? Surely men muſt create a New Name, and God will create a new puniſhment or hell for ſuch a ſin.</p>
            <p>5. (And laſtly for matter of this worlds concernment) what doe you thinke of your lives themſelves; if thoſe men of blood ſhall carry the day, and ever come to ſet up their banners amongſt you? Will they not be ſold as cheap as Sparrows were among the Jewes, five for two farthings? Nay, will they not be trodden down and trampled upon like clay and mire in the Streetes, by the foot of the pride, and rage, and inſolency of theſe men? Would not your fleſh be as a feaſt of fat things unto them, and your blood as new Wine? Or if they did ſpare your lives, would it not be only out of a deſire and intent to adde unto your miſeries, to gaine opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting many deaths upon you? Perhaps they have learned a deliberate cruelty, from that bloody Emperour <hi>Nero:</hi> who when any perſon that was accuſed, and under the ſtroke and dint of his power; deſired of him that he might be diſpatched, and put to death, was wont to make anſwer, <hi>Non ita tecum in gratiam redii: .i.</hi> He was not yet ſo far friends with him, as to give him leave to die: he meant to have more ſatisfaction out of them, then ſo. So if theſe men give you your lives for a time, you muſt not looke to have them given you upon ſuch termes, as God ſometimes in common deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions gives his ſervants their lives: <hi>viz. For a prey,</hi> or <hi>booty:</hi> No, they will be given you only as meanes or engines wherewith to torment you. It may be they will deſire to reſerve and keep you aliue, to make ſpectators of you, of all that bloody Tragedy they meane to act upon all that belongs to you, in ſetting your Houſes, and Cities on fire, in taking away your goods, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering villany to your wives, and your daughters, and then mangling and maſſacring them when they have done. And then when they have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcourged you with ſuch ſcorpions as theſe, it is like they will deliver you into the hand of death. Certaine it is, that the ſpirit that works in theſe curſed children of diſobedience which are now your adverſaries, luſts not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:156158:23"/>
onely to your temporall ruine and deſtruction, but to your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ruine and deſtruction alſo, as farre as it knowes how to bee active in it. Our Saviour himſelfe ſeemes to imply as much, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28. where he commands us <hi>not to feare thoſe which kill the body: but are not able to kill the ſoule:</hi> as farre as they are able to goe in hatred and malice againſt the Saints, they doe goe, <hi>they doe kill the body</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) Hee doth not ſay, feare not thoſe that can kill the body, but, which <hi>doe,</hi> actually, frequently and from time to time, <hi>kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule;</hi> doubtleſſe intimating, that if they were able, they would kill body and ſoule, and all. And ſomewhat more plainely (I conceive) <hi>Joh. 10. and I give unto them eternall life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man plucke (or pull) them out of mine hand;</hi> cleerely implying, that the divell and his inſtruments, wicked men, are ready to pull and tugge hard to get even his elect themſelves out of his hands, out of that hand of election and grace, which hee hath layd upon them, and whereby he holds them faſt. Thus the ſtory of the martyrs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that when the Popiſh Prelates, and Prieſts were ready to have execution done upon that faithfull ſervant of God <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> they uſed theſe words, <hi>Now wee commit thy ſoule unto the Divell:</hi> And when <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> through long and grievous impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grew very ſicke, and (as himſelfe thought) neere unto death, deſired that hee might have a confeſſor (being it ſeemes, conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous this way) the ſtory ſaith, that very hardly, and with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie it could bee obteyned: which ſhewes, that it was griefe and torment to his enemies, that hee ſhould have any thing, that in their opinion might bee a meanes to ſave his ſoule, after hee was dead; beſides many other like ſtreynes of the ſame ſpirit, which that ſtory preſents unto the diligent Reader. Now then, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpirit of this profound, deepe, and divelliſh enmitie againſt you, working in the Bowells and inward parts of theſe men, to deſire not onely your temporall, but eternall death alſo, it is none other like, but if they ſuſpect and doubt of the ſtrength of their arme, for the ſending of you by death into Hell (as I make little queſtion but they doe, they have no great hope of hunting your ſoules into the bottomleſſe pit, which is reſerved for their owne) they will themſelves create a Hell for you, as full of torment and cruell burnings as they can make it, and caſt you into it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:156158:24"/>
before you die, and ſo be gotten out of their reach. So that there is nothing to bee looked for from theſe men but death, or that which is worſe then death, a life to contribute towards the increaſe of the paines and ſorrowes of your death: and ſo indeed death howſoever. Therefore I beſeech you conſider the weight of this branch of the preſent motive alſo. Will you thinke of keeping or ſaving your eſtates, to the loſſe or imminent danger of your lives? Shall you not keepe your money to make a goodly purchaſe, if you bring all theſe great evills and miſeries upon you thereby? Though in many other caſes you might make much gaine and advantage by making the Divell a lier, yet it will bee your wiſedome, to juſtifie him in that his ſaying; <hi>skinne for skinne,</hi> (or rather skinne after skinne, or, skinne upon skinne) <hi>and all that hee hath will a man give for his life,</hi> If you have ſo much of men in you, as Sathan your enemy ſuppoſeth (it ſeemes) that you have) to value your lives at any ſuch rate above all your poſſeſſions whatſoever, ſhew it this day, and make a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and bulwarke of all that you have for their defence and ſafetie; <hi>Solomon</hi> (we know) made ſome hundreds of Targets and Shields of Gold: it ſhould not be grievous to any man to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his eſtate, his Gold and Silver upon the ſervice of his life. There is a time to keepe (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) and a time to ſpend, or to caſt away, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 6. Certainely of all other, that is no time to keepe, when a mans life lies at the ſtake, and is in all likelihood not to bee redeemed but by caſting away. Thus much for your temporall and outward injoyments, they are all involved and concerned to the utmoſt, in the preſent occaſion and ſervice, which you have beene exhorted, to promote and further with all your ſtrength, and all your power.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, it were well (at leaſt it were leſſe to bee layd to heart, it were a matter of farre lighter moment and importance) if your outward concernments onely, though it were even to life it ſelfe, were imported in that great occaſion, which is now on foot, and hath beene againe and againe recommended unto you; but behold greater things then theſe. Your ſpirituall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, are like to ſuffer, and that in a very high degree, if <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> prevaile, if ever you come to bee at the allowance of Cavaliers, Papiſts, and Athieſts, that have taken the field againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:156158:24"/>
you, for the things of Heaven. You are like to have ſtones in ſtead of bread, and Scorpions in ſtead of Fiſh. Thoſe golden Pipes, by which Heaven and Earth are (as it were) joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and have lively communion each with other; I meane your pure ordinances of worſhip, which have both the wiſedome, and grace, and goodneſſe of God abundantly in their frame, will be cut off, and others of Lead laid in their ſtead; ordinances I meane of an humane conſtitution and frame, whoſe chiefe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or ingredients will bee the wiſedome and will, <hi>i. e.</hi> the folly and corrupt affections of men, by which, not Heaven, but Hell, and the world will bee joyned together, and the trade and traffique betweene both places, much quickned and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, ordinances which will bee ready to bee caſt as dung into your faces by God, when you have beene exerciſed in them. You muſt never looke to ſee the goings of God in the Sanctuary, as you have done, to ſee any more viſions of life and immortalitie let downe from Heaven unto you, in theſe houſes of viſion: thoſe excellent raviſhments and raptures of ſpirit, thoſe takings up into the third Heaven by ſeeing him that was greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory, will ceaſe from you. Thoſe pure ſtreames of the Goſpell will bee all bemired and ſoyled, when they are given unto you to drinke: Yea hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and poyſoned too, by the influence of the corrupt minds and judgements of thoſe that ſhall give them unto you. You muſt looke to have the Goſpell turned upſide downe, and to be made to ſtand in perfect conjunction with Hell, with looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wickedneſſe, and prophaneneſſe, and in oppoſition to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Grace and Holineſſe; to be made a Savour of death to thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved; and a Savour of life to thoſe that ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. It will bee made to frowne upon thoſe that are godly, and to looke cheerefully and comfortably upon looſe men. So that if your ſoule ſhall luſt for theſe Sommer fruits, if you ſhall deſire to have communion with God in communion and fellowſhip with his Saints, If you ſhall deſire at any time to bee rained upon by a ſhower of life and peace from Heaven; you muſt repaire againe to the woods and mountaines, or to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of ſome cloſe and ſecret place, where you muſt eate the bread of your ſoules in perill of your lives; as your forefathers did in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:156158:25"/>
Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, on with danger of ſuffering whatever the malice and revengefull ſpirit of your enemies ſhall thinke good or can deviſe to inflict upon you.</p>
            <p>Therefore now conſider, you that have had the liberty of your Sanctuaries, and of your publike aſſemblies, that have beene <hi>fed with hony out of the Rocke, and with the fineſt wheate</hi> of Heaven, you that have had an open and free trade to Heaven, and have had glorious returnes from them day after day, to whom the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpell, hath beene as the wings of the morning, as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of fire to carry you up and downe as it were in ſpirituall ſtate and triumph betweene Heaven and earth; Oh how will that day be as the ſhaddow of death unto you, wherein you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change your Quailes and Manna from Heaven, for the Garlike and Onyons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when you ſhall heare the Pope and his Hierarchie preached up to the Heavens, and Jeſus Chriſt with his Saints preached downe to the earth, and made to ſit at their footſtoole, when your ſoules and conſciences ſhall bee compaſſed about with lies and errors and the Commandements of men, in the Miniſtery of the word, in ſtead of thoſe ſpirituall and glorious truths, which were wont to bee as ſo many Angels ſent from the preſence of God to comfort you; doubtleſſe if ever you <hi>ſaw the heavens opened</hi> over your heads by an effectuall and ſound Miniſtery, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God in glory,</hi> as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, if ever you ſmell the ſavor of life by Jeſus Chriſt preached; the day wherein ſuch a miniſtery ſhall bee taken from you, will bee like the day wherein the Sunne ſhall bee covered with Sack-cloath, and the Moone turned into blood, and the Starres in the Firmament of Heaven loſe their light. The change will bee every whit as ſad unto you, as that was unto <hi>David,</hi> when hee was driven from the Sanctuary and preſence of God, and compelled <hi>to dwell in Meſech, and make his habitation in the Tents of Kedar.</hi> If this exchange made him cry out, <hi>woe is me:</hi> you muſt thinke it will bee a double woe unto you, when the <hi>Arke of God</hi> ſhall be taken from you, and <hi>Dagon</hi> ſet up in its ſtead, when the diſpenſations and adminiſtrations of Heaven, which were ſpirit and life, the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it ſelfe unto you, ſhall bee exchanged for the ſtatutes and ordinances of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are like tombes and <hi>ſepulchers,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:156158:25"/>
nothing in them but rottenneſſe and dead mens bones. If ſuch a day were now upon you, what would you give to buy it off? and is not the purchaſe of the prevention of it worth as much?</p>
            <p>It may be there are ſome amongſt you whoſe ſoules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were never yet engaged, eyther by the puritie or power of any of the ordinances of God; who never yet knew what it was to bee kindly touched from Heaven by any ſpirituall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; to ſuch as theſe it is like <hi>Dagon</hi> may bee as good as the Arke; the devices and inventions of men, as beautifull, as ſavory, in the houſe and worſhip of God, as thoſe ordinances themſelves which have the perfect image and ſuperſcription of God upon them: a miniſtery that is low, and cold, and ſet in conſort with the Earth, and the things thereof; as that which is calculated for the Meridian of Heaven, and breathes life and immortalitie in the faces of mens ſoules continually. If ſuch as theſe lend but a dull or deafe eare to the motion, cannot finde ſo much as two mites in their eſtates to caſt into the treaſury of God, it is not much to be marveiled at. But for you that know how little the chaffe is to the wheate; I beſeech you to have this ſence of the buſineſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to you, that when you have done the utmoſt of what you are able to doe for the advancement of it, you would yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly deſire to doe more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To engage you yet further to give out your ſelves fully &amp; freely as you have bin exhorted, you may pleaſe to conſider, that as all your pretious intereſts, whether in the things of this life, or of that which is to come, are deepely concerned in it, ſo are all the like intereſts of all your brethren, the godly perſons in the land concerned likewiſe. And if the cauſe ſhould ſuffer or miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it would bee as a ſword that would paſſe through all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſoules throughout the land; it would bring ſuch a day of ſorrow, lamentation, and woe upon the generation of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God throughout the Kingdome, as ſcarce hath beene heard of in all ages: it will cauſe all their hands to hang downe, and their knees to wax feeble, and their hearts to wither as the graſſe; it will fill all their eyes with teares, and their hearts with heavineſſe: there will bee no end of thoſe great evills and miſeries which will come upon them in that day. The breach that will bee

made upon them will bee like the great breaches of the Sea which cannot bee repaired. It was a night of much ſadneſſe to the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when God ſlew in every houſe one through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Land: the Text ſaith, <hi>There was a grievous cry throughout the whole land of Egypt upon it:</hi> But this cup was given to the Egyptians to drinke: And yet this ſtroke fell not ſo ſore upon them neither, as the miſcarriage of that great action wee ſpeake of, would doe upon the Iſraell of God amongſt us. That did but touch the Egyptians in the lives of one in every Family reſpectively: but the ſtroke which is now lifted up, and likely to be given in the land, whereever it light, ſhould it fall upon the right hand, upon the people of God, it would wound them all, and that very ſore, yea and that not in ſome, but in all their concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and injoyments whatſoever, as well in thoſe which relate to this world preſent, as in thoſe, whoſe accommodations are more peculiarly for that world which is yet to come (as hath beene ſhewed already) If ever that mountaine of prophanneſſe, which now you are exhorted to put to your ſhoulders to remove, ſhall be eſtablſhed, doubtleſſe it will magnifie it ſelfe againſt all that is called Holy in the Land; it will lie heavy and oppreſſe, if not overwhelme and bury under it, all that have the marke of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God upon them. Therefore I beſeech you conſider what you doe: If this great evill ſhall come upon the Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God amongſt you, and you bee found dull and heavie, negligent and remiſſe in the preventing of it, and not improve your ſelves to the utmoſt that way, when as it hath beene ſo fully and feelingly, and frequently both repreſented and recommended unto you, ſhall you not bring the guilt of it all upon your heads? Shall you not bee looked upon both by God and men, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries (if not principalls) in all thoſe ſore afflictions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, which in this caſe ſhall fall upon them? will not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their ſorrowes, and their teares, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and all the extremitie they ſhall endure at your hsnds? <hi>When I ſhall ſay unto the wicked</hi> (ſaith the Lord to his Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel) Oh wicked man, thou ſhalt die the death, if thou doſt not ſpeake and admoniſh the wicked of his way, that wicked man ſhall die for his iniquitie, but his blood will I require at thine hand, Ezek.</hi> 33. If God will require the blood of a wicked man at the hand of his Prophet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:156158:26"/>
in caſe he did not ſeeke to prevent it by admoniſhing him: will he not much more require the ſorrowes, ſighings, troubles, teares, extremities, blood of a whole nation of Saints, at the hand of thoſe by whoſe unfaithfulneſſe, coldneſſe, covetouſneſſe, negligence in any kind, they ſhall come upon them. <hi>The Sonne of man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>goeth his way, as it is written of him: but woe be to that man, by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had beene good for that man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 24.</note> 
               <hi>if he had never beene borne:</hi> In like manner the Church and people of God amongſt us may yet ſuffer grievous things, but woe bee to thoſe, whomſoever they bee, bee they fewer, be they more, bee they rich, be they poore, by whom their peace and ſafety ſhall bee betrayed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) All our owne concernments and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of all our deare brethren in the faith throughout the land, are bound up in the buſineſſe, which hath bin ſo frequently and affectionately recommended unto you; ſo are the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of others of our brethren alſo, partakers of like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith with you, in other lands and Kingdoms, bound up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe herein; though not all (perhaps) in the ſame degree. There is a common report of a ſtrange ſympathie between Hippocrate's twins, that they alwayes cried together, and laughed together. And doubtleſſe there is ſome ſuch ſimpathye betweene all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches (as we call them) in theſe parts of the world: amongſt which likewiſe I comprehend thoſe plantations of our Brethren of this Land, in <hi>America,</hi> and other Weſterne parts, at leaſt betweene all that are truely faithfull and ſound in that profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they make in theſe Churches. I doe not ſpeake here of that inward or ſpirituall ſimpathie, which in reſpect of reciprocall affections and mutuall tenderneſſe, intercedes betweene all the true and living members of the myſticall body of Chriſt, though never ſo remote aſunder, but of that mutuall dependencie which the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affaires and condition of every one hath, upon the condition of the other, ſo that the proſperitie and well eſtabliſhed peace of any one, hath an influence into, and contributes more or leſſe towards the like eſtabliſhment of the other: As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the ſhaking, trouble, ruine, or deſtruction of any one wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the ſtrength, and impaires more or leſſe the ſecuritie of all the other. So that they muſt needs all weepe together, and all laugh
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:156158:27"/>
together. Now then, this is that which I ſay and hold forth to your Chriſtian and godly conſiderations in this motive; that the action wherein the Church and people of God in the Land are now inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and which is yet depending betweene them, and their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, will in the iſſue, cloſe, and fall of it, bee of very remarkable concernment to all the Saints of God in all thoſe other Churches mentioned; if it falls on the right hand, it will bee the riches, ſtrength, and increaſe of them; if on the left, it will be the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, ſhaking, and impairing of them, therefore conſider I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, the great weight and importance of the opportunitie that is before you, if through your zeale, and forwardneſſe, and faithfulneſſe to advance it, and the bleſſing of God upon it, your preſent ſervice ſhall proſper, your light will be like the <hi>lightning which</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith) <hi>ſhineth from the Eaſt even unto the Weſt:</hi> the heate and warmth and living influence thereof, ſhall pierce through many kingdomes great and large, as <hi>France, Germany, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, Hungaria, Polonia, Denmarke, Sweden,</hi> with many others, and finde out all the children of God, and all that are friends to the Kingdome of Heaven, and will bee a cheering and refreſhing to them: Eſpecially to your brethren in their ſeverall plantations in farre countries; and moſt of all to thoſe in theſe united and neere kingdomes, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> it will be as a feaſt of fat things, and of wines well refined: and particularly to poore bleeding, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ireland,</hi> it will be as a reſurrection from death unto life. Now then in-as-much as God hath ſet you this day, as the Sunne in the firmament of Heaven, from whence hee hath an opportunitie and advantage to ſend forth his beames, and to furniſh and fill the world with his light and influence round about him; ſince you have the commodiouſneſſe of ſuch a ſtanding, that you may doe good to all that is Gods, I meane to all the Saints in all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpertions and quarters throughout ſo many kingdomes, and ſuch a conſiderable part of the world as hath beene mentioned, ſo that you may cauſe them to riſe up before you and call you bleſſed; I beſeech you doe not betray this firſt-borne opportunitie of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: looke upon it as a great and ſolemne invitation from God himſelfe unto you, to do greater things for the world, at leaſt for the Chriſtian world, then ever you did unto this day; or then ever you are like to doe the ſecond time, yea then any particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:156158:27"/>
State ever did, or is like to doe while the world ſtands. God hath prepared and fitted a Table for you large enough, if you will but ſpread and furniſh it with ſuch proviſions as are under your hand, that you may feaſt, and give royall entertainment, to the whole houſhold of faith, almoſt throughout the whole world at once. And ſhall it now ſeeme any great thing in our ages, or bee in the leaſt meaſure grievous unto any man or woman of you, even to laviſh his gold out of bagges, to beſtow his whole ſubſtance to deveſt himſelfe of all he poſſeſſeth in the world, even to his ſhooe Latchet, to furniſh and ſet out ſuch an occaſion as this is, like it ſelfe? Shall not the very conſcience and comfortable remembrance of ſuch a thing as this done with uprightneſſe and ſimplicitie of heart by you, be a thouſand times better then any ſuperfluities of ſilver or of gold, or of meates, or of drinkes, or of houſes, or of or of jewels, or apparell whatſoever? Nay if we ſhall bring povertie and nakedneſſe, and hunger and thirſt upon our ſelves, to purchaſe and procure it, will it not bee better then an eſtate, then cloathing, then meates and drinkes unto us? will it not take out the burning, and allay the bitterneſſe of all theſe? Doubtleſſe the honour and conſcience of the fact, will beare all the charges, and anſwer all the expence of it to the full. The opportunitie and occaſion is ſo rich and glorious, that it calls to remembrance (as ſometimes the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth the ſubſtance) the great opportunitie that was before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the ſalvation of the world: We know that he <hi>being rich,</hi> became poore, that the world thorough his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty might be made rich. You have the patterne in the mount be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: See that according to your line and meaſure, you make all things like to it.</p>
