            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This is either an unwritten, or a written Law, (to borrow <hi>Plato</hi>'s distinction.) The most famous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Law is that of <hi>Nature;</hi> which <hi>Iustinian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <note place="margin">

               <hi>Aquinas</hi> defines the Law of Nature to be, <hi>the</hi>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51365:3"/>
Not to describe, to enwrap it in a cloud; the Law of Nature is, <hi>a judgement naturally engrafted in our hearts, for the discerning of good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the soveraign Rule, the Pole-star for the Heathens. <hi>For if the Gentiles which have not a Law, do</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>by nature the things contained in the Law, they having not a Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iustinian</hi> mentions three Precepts cast in this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iustit. Iur. Civ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 1.</note> mould: to live honestly, to hurt no man, to render to every man his own. But our blessed Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the most renowned law of nature, even in the judgement of Heathen Sages, so much magnified by <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour, that he commanded it to be engraven in his Palace; <hi>Whatsoever you would that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 12.</note> 
               <hi>men should do unto you, do you even so to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature it self prompts us this equality, indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shift the scenes; to look upon our own actions with that rigour, as if they were another mans, and upon another mans actions with that candor, as if they were our own. But because this Law was not sufficient to bridle the disorderly passions of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, God hath seconded and reinforced it with divers written lawes to his people.</p>
            <p>The 1. for the deciding of their controversies. This was the <hi>Iudiciall</hi> Law, raised to the Meridian of <hi>Iewry,</hi> framed to the Climate of <hi>Palestine</hi> (which as to other nations may indifferently be abrogated, or retained.)</p>
            <p>The second for the regulating of their Ritualls, the ordering of their Circumstantialls in Religion. This was the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> not to be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, blended with the Evangelicall doctrine, (as the <hi>Ebionites</hi> heretically asserted) not to be observed or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51365:3"/>
approved under the Gospel. The Synagogue is solemnly interred, the Iudiciall Law dead, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall deadly.</p>
            <p>The third sort, the <hi>Morall</hi> law (the practicall test, the rule for conversation) is not yet destitute of life, or vigour. The Gospell gives no bill of divorce to this law, unstings onely, but not unsinews it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits believing repenting soules from the curse, not the observance; from the penalty, not the duty of it.</p>
            <p>This Morall law is of eternall force, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the ten Commandments, which <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chthon</hi> accounts the law of nature rightly expounded. These are not to be engraven in tables of stone one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not in tables of brasse, (as the lawes of <hi>Solon</hi> were;) but to be imprinted in the tables of our hearts, to be copyed out in our lives.</p>
            <p>I shall at this time (by Gods gracious assistance) take into consideration one distinct branch of it.
<q>Thou shalt not bear false witnesse against thy neighbour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Before I treat of the matter of the prohibition, I shall offer at a cursory survey of the manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; like a limmer, that frames a rude draught of his work, before he drawes out the severall linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in full proportion.</p>
            <p>That dreadfull Iudge, who will require of us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every idle word, dictate's none himself.</p>
            <p>Though there were many thousands of <hi>Israelites</hi> present, yet the charge is framed in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>(Thou)</hi> not in a loose generality prescribed to all, lest in a loose neglect it be observed by none. This denotes the divine mercy, That he vouchsafes to take
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51365:4"/>
care of every man in particular; and chalks out our duty, That every man in particular make application of Gods law to his own conscience, as a compasse to steer by, as a rule to live by.</p>
            <p>The Charge is in a future severe tenor, <hi>(Thou shalt.)</hi> This imports the perpetuity of the obligation, &amp; the authority of it. It was proclaimed with thunder, and accented with lightning. If our obedience to Gods Law be not active, it shall be passive. If his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement be not punctually observed, his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be sharply inflicted; it shall and must be endured.</p>
            <p>This Law is Negative: not an Edict, an Injunction limited with opportunityes, conveniencies, to allay it's rigour; but an Interdict, a Prohibition, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no dispensation of time or place, to mince, or qualifie it.</p>
            <p>This Prohibition serves as a glasse to present the <note place="margin">Mufculus.</note> uncomely complexion of the soul, it's unholy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, a swinge, a bent to false testimonies. Other offences are sorted, severed among the sonnes of men, but this is communicable to all. <hi>Every man a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> (at least in a corrupt, vehement inclination of a heart unregenerated.)</p>
            <p>To proceed. Our <hi>English</hi> translation is too low &amp; flat <hi>(Thou shalt not bear:)</hi> it is in the Originall <hi>lo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnaneh,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> thou shalt not answer a false testimony.</p>
            <p>It abates the lustre, the credit of a disadvantagious testimony (against a neighbour,) for to be voluntary.</p>
            <p>An evidence that is commodious (behoofefull) may (in some cases) be tendred; but if discommodious, it <note place="margin">Ioh. P. <hi>de Fer. in proct. For. jur. Test.</hi>
               </note> ought to be required: it is justified onely by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51365:4"/>
to be cited, required, examined.</p>
            <p>That discovery which sounds an unmeet detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a dart of slander at the Table, may amount to a meet deposition, a fit Evidence at the Bar.</p>
            <p>In the one case the rule of Charity debarres it, in the other case the rule of Iustice warrants it.</p>
            <p>It is not expressed, <hi>Thoushalt not bear witnesse at all,</hi> but <hi>Thoushalt not bear false witnesse.</hi> Courts of judicature are not abrogated, condemned in my text; but directed, regulated.</p>
            <p>If no evidence could be produced, no innocence might be defended, no justice executed.</p>
            <p>Whilst God brands and sorbids a false testimony, he allowes, injoyns a true.</p>
            <p>My Text explodes a false testimony expresly at the first blush that is pernicious, but secondarily, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a false testimony that is officious also. An Evidence is not to be byast by favour, but truth. It is taynted not by the damage which accrewes to another, but the falshood which the Witnesse himselfutters. As the expression of the Act, so of the Object challengeth our consideration, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a propriety of relation, <hi>Thy neighbour.</hi> There is much emphaticall Divinity in Pronounes. The relation it self is presented in the widest latitude of sense, though the softest dresse for language. <hi>Reang,</hi> a friend, a neighbour. A name that is a charme of truth.

            <p>The Apostle layes it to the charge of some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>Corinth,</hi> That they who were injurious, were querulous, contentious.

            <p>Our blessed Saviour diverts, takes off his edge from the interests of possession, to the interests of Salvation.</p>

When the Evidence is indirect, it insensibly sets a false by asse on the Verdict, and the Decree. For the degrees of justice are not unlike those of concoction: An errour in the first degree is not to be corrected or redressed in the second, or the third. A false witnesse misguides, betrayes the Iury, and the Iudge. He is an hammer, a sword, and an arrow (saith <hi>Solomon.</hi>) An <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 18.</note> Hammer to the Iudge, whom he stounds &amp; amazes, that he cannot distinguish betwixt truth and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: a Sword to the party that corrupts him, a sword to fight for him, and a sword to pierce his soul: an <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Arrow to the innocent party, a poyson'd arrow to fester, to wound him (with a ranckling venom) in his life, his fortune, or his reputation.

to dissemble in ordinary conference is hainous; but in judiciary evidence monstrous. Subtle doubling expressions, dark winding reservations of witnesses, have perhaps been the lewd practice of all Ages, but the owned tenet onely of the <hi>Romish</hi> Casuifts of the last Age. The guilt of a false witnesse is much enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his guile. He is worse then a murderer. A mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer destroyes the body naturall, but a false witnesse banes the body politick, (the administration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which depends on the truth of witnesses, being the sinewes, nay the vitall spirits of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.) To raise this to a higher key of guilt. A false witnesse is worse then an Idolater. An Idolater makes an idoll a God; but a false witnesse makes God an idoll, makes a direct mockery of the Deity, as not discerning, regarding his falshood. He seems to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, to outbrave Gods omnipotence, his omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to deride, as it were to summon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from his throne in heaven, to countenance, to abett his villany on earth at the bar.
