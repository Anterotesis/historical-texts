         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The true Art therefore of Iugling, consisteth in Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine:

mony of this priest, which is the third part of this art,

which is the most difficult poynt in this art, and a rare

vnto him such iustructions, as therby within short
time he should become infinitely rich, and all through this
art of multiplication: and this is the most common point
in this science, for héerein they must be skilfull before they
be famous or attatns to any credit: the Preist disliked

indeede, but seeme so to bee in appearance: As Castles
and Towers doe seeme to be built in the ayre, whereas
the representations there shewed, are nothing else, but
the resemblance of certaine obiects belowe, caused in some

I will now drawe to an ende, leauing to speake of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable

for such: as had Phisitions and Surgions, knowe

madde doggs, the stinging of a Scorpion, the tooth-ache,
for a woman in trauell, for the kings euill: to get a thorne
out of any member, or a bone out of ones throate: for sore
eies, to open locks, against spirits: for the botts in a horse,
for sower wines, and diuers others.</p>
                  <p>There are also diners books imprinted, as it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the authoritie of the Church of Rome, wherin are
conteyned many medecinall prayers, not only against all
deseases of horses, but also for euery impediment, and fault
in a horse, in so much as if a shoot fall in the middest of
his iorney; there is a prayer to warrant your horses hoofe
so as it shall not broake, how farre soeuer he be from the
smythes forge: But these of all the rest are the fondest

toyes, that euer were deuised, therefore we wil passe them
ouer, and yet how many in these dayes are addicted to the
beleefe of these charmes it is incredible, I will giue you a
taste of two or three, because you shall see the foolery of
the rest.</p>
