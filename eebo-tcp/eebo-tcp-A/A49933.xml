            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Play, when it was Acted, in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Princess of <hi>Iainville,</hi> had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of <hi>Marguerite</hi> in the Massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> Sister to <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and Wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Navar</hi>: That fatal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which cost the Blood of so many Thousand Men, and the Lives of the best Commanders. What was bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in the Action is left out in the Print, and quite obliterated in the minds of Men. But the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was Notorious for a bolder Fault, has wrested two whole Scenes from the Original, which after the Vacation he will be forc'd to pay. I was, I confess, through Indignation, forc'd to limb my own Child, which Time, the true Cure for all Maladies, and Injustice has set together again. The Play cost me much pains, the Story is true, and I hope the Object will display Treachery in its own Colours. But this Farce, Comedy, Tragedy or meer Play, was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for the Refusal of the other; for when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb facs="tcp:100348:3"/>
the most polish'd Hero in <hi>Nemours,</hi> I gave 'em a Ruffian reeking from <hi>Whetstone</hi>'s-<hi>Park.</hi> The fourth and fifth Acts of the Chances, where <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is pulling down; Marriage <hi>Alamode,</hi> where they are bare to the Waste; the <hi>Libertine,</hi> and <hi>Epsom-Wells,</hi> are but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of his Villany. He lays about him like the <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> in the Park; they may walk by, and take no notice. I beg your Lordship to excuse this account, for indeed 'tis all to introduce the Massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> to your Favour, and approve it to be play'd in its first Figure.</p>

            <head>THE PROLOGUE.</head>
            <l>TRust was the Glory of the foremost Age,</l>
            <l>When Truth and Love with Friendship did engage;</l>
            <l>When Man to Man cou'd walk with Arms entwin'd,</l>
            <l>And vent their Griefs in spaces of the Wind;</l>
            <l>Express their minds, and speak their thoughts as clear,</l>
            <l>As Eastern Mornings op'ning to the year.</l>
            <l>But since that Law and Treachery came in,</l>
            <l>And open Honesty was made a Sin,</l>
            <l>Men wait for Men as Dogs for Foxes prey,</l>
            <l>And Women wait the closing of the day.</l>
            <l>There's scarce a man that ventures to be good,</l>
            <l>For Truth by Knaves was never understood;</l>
            <l>For there's the Curse, when Vice o'er Vertue rules,</l>
            <l>That all the World are Knaves or downright Fools.</l>
            <l>So they may make advantage of th' Allay,</l>
            <l>They'll take the Dross and through the Gold away.</l>
            <l>Women turn Vsurers with their own affright,</l>
            <l>And Want's the Hag that rides 'em all the night.</l>
            <l>The little Mob, the City Wastcoateer,</l>
            <l>Will pinch the Back to make the Buttock bare,</l>
            <l>And drain the last poor Guinea from her Dear.</l>
            <l>Thus Times are turn'd upon a private end,</l>
            <l>There's scarce a Man that's generous to his Friend.</l>
            <l>But there's a Monarch on a Throne sublime,</l>
            <l>That makes Truth Law, and gives the Poets Rhime;</l>
            <l>Be his the bus'ness of our little Fates,</l>
            <l>Our mean Contentions, and their high Debates.</l>
            <l>By Sea and Land our most Imperial Lord,</l>

                  <l>I slept, and dreamt I saw</l>
                  <l>The bosom of the Flood unfold;</l>
                  <l>I saw the Naked Nymphs ten Fathom down,</l>

                  <l>Where in their busie Arms <hi>Nemours</hi> appear'd:</l>

                  <l>While each kind Goddess dew'd his Senseless Face</l>
                  <l>With Nectars drops to bring back Life in vain:</l>

                  <l>I think there is a Bosom secret still,</l>
