            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALthough there be nothing more assured, both in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and experience of all, then that the most important events of this worlds concernes, do much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, and are frequently turned by, the observation or neglect of certain midses and expedients only, yea great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, recommended by this their subservient aptitude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; yet, on the other hand, it is no lesse evident, that in the matters of God, and of our souls everlasting wellbeing, even the Ordinances of life, by him thereto appointed, are, for the most part, slighted by an abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undervalue: But, as it is beyond all controversie that the full perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and just estimation of these high and glorious ends, whereunto they are designed, would quickly intend our care about all things and circumstances thereunto ordered in an agreeable proportion, and also extend our comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded circumspection to a fidelity even in the things that are least; so it is only unseriousness and insincerity in the main, together with the diversion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temptations, that occasioneth all the indifferencie, contempt and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, wherewith we finde the simplicity &amp; meanness of Gospel-institutions commonly entertained; and hence it is, that not only they are despised, and perverted by the vain pretenders to liberty, gallantrie, decencie, civil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or the like; But also they are all contending for them, under the specious affectations of more calme, sublime and serene contemplations, and the saucy reproaches of hote disputations and bitter wranglings is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be eluded, and the things vilified into empty formalities, and thereby an inlet made, in the righteous judgement of God, to the delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mens inventions.</p>
            <p>How much of these truths may be remarked in the ensuing discourse, I shall not here anticipat by an unnecessary reflection; the point I aime at is to exhort every one, desirous to be faithful to God in the midst of this evill generation, wherein the strange variety and opposition of events that vve have seen do suggest such strong temptations, and interest hath not more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced mens mindes unto an irreligious lukvvarmness, then their Spirits are most perniciously debauched by vvanton and vvild cavillation, to studie, in the first place, to have the minde enlightned vvith the true knovvledge of the most High soveraignity, and most pure holiness of God, the most vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful love and marvellous condescendence of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the great perfection of the holy Law, and excellencie of all Gospel O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and next to have the heart established through the grace of God, by suitable faith and fear cleaving unto God with the whole soul and strength, and hating every vain and false way: Surely he that is thus qualified shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved; but as he will be of a good, sound, and quick understanding in all things, so in these so much tossed debates, vvhereby the most part of this backsliden and light generation, at best only seeking therein the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their own curiosity, are many times sadly stumbled unto greater irreligion, he will easily discerne and lay hold upon the will and way of the Lord, being convinced that the meanest of his matters are not of a lower ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, then of a high and in estimable tendencie.</p>
            <p>To such therefore it is that I recommend and submit the ensuing disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (if the unconcerned world do laugh, if the foolish mock, &amp; the wicked rage, yet, I hope, my work is with my God, &amp; its fruit shall be to all the lovers of our Lord Iesus Christ in sincerity) being moved by the excessive silence of the one, &amp; the immoderate boasting of the other of the two parties ingaged in this affaire, to interpose for truth thus unequally treated, that by this poor essay it may be, in some measure, vindicat, and a check gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the pride and swelling words of the Adversaries, is all my aime. As for these of our opposites who may finde themselves more nearly touched in the few sheets subjoyned, if they think me therein transported to any excesse I do assure them, that it is from the ungrateful violence of their provocation, and not at all the choise of my own inclination: I acknowledge also, that there are other Papers emitted by them, then the two that I do particularly review and annexe, specially a long Letter supposed to be. G. B's. and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by way of amplification of the former: But seing I do fully discusse his Text, &amp; after trial discover that his excellent &amp; noble friend's gold, as he speaks, is but drosse, I hope he will easily pardone my not prosecuting a further fruitless search into what he calls his own ore. And thus I dismiss my Reader unto the perusal of vvhat follovves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>It is not to be doubted, but my L. Commissioner his Grace will make good what he offered, anent the establishment of Presbyteries and Synods: and we trust his Grace will procure such security to these Brethren for declaring their judgement, that they may do it without any hazard, in contraveening any Law: and that the Bishop shall humbly and earnestly recommend this to his Grace.</hi>

               <p>The thing then which comes first to be noted in point of fact, and which I shall represent with that truth and impartiality, that I hope none shall deny it, is, that this Church, having in the Year 1638. abrogat and abjured the Government of the Kirk by Bishops, and set up Presbyterian Government in its purest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and paritie, we together with the renewing of the National Covenant, solemnly engadged, <hi>Constantly to adhere unto, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the true Religion then established, in Doctrine, Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to all the novations and corruptions from which it was at that time reformed; and to labour by all means, for the purity and liberty of the Gospel, as it was established and professed before these novations.</hi> After which time the Church, in our acknowledgement, did enjoy a Ministrie and Government truely Ecclesiastick, committed to them by, and depending upon our Lord Iesus Christ alone, as King in Zion, and Head of his Church. Thereafter, by an Act Rescissorie, it was declared and statute, by both King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Year 1640. and 1641. agreeably to the Oath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, that the sole and only power and jurisdiction within this Kirk, did stand in the Kirk of God as it was then reformed; and in the General, Provincial and Ptesbyterial Assemblies, with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96182:6"/>
the Kirk Sessions established by <hi>Act.</hi> P. 1592. &amp; in like manner, by the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> entred into in the Year 1643. the whole Kingdome doth again swear to the preservation of the Reformed Religion of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Discipline and Government; and to extirpate Popery, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie, Schism, Superstition, Profannesse, and whatsoever shall be found contrary to sound Doctrine, and the Power of Godliness: Which engagement, we are bound <hi>all the dayes of our life zealously aud constantly to continow in, against all opposition; and to promove the same, according to our power.</hi> Thus matters stood, both in obligation and general observance, until the Year 1661.</p>
               <p>At which time, the Parliament then sitting, having prepared their way by exalting of the prerogative, in opposition to, and for the overthrow of the practices of bygone times, specially that of entering into Leagues and Bonds; they at one blow rescinde all Parliaments after the year 1633. and the Government of the Church, being thereby wholly deprived of the civill sanction, and its continowance, by another <hi>Act,</hi> permitted and declared to be only precarious, during the Kings pleasure: Afterward, all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick meetings in Synods, Presbytries and Sessions, are, by proclamation the 9 Ianuary 1662. discharged, untill they should be authorized and ordered by the Archbishops and Bishops then nominat by his Maiestie, upon their entering into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their respective Sees. By which means, the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being overturned and razed unto the very foundation, at least as much as the wit and power of man could effectuat, the next thing that offers, is the new structure and frame that is raised in its place: And in the year 1662. the Parliament again meeting, by their first Act for re-establishing of the Government of the Church by Bishops, laying it for the ground, <hi>That the disposal of the external Government of the Church doth properly belong unto his Majestie, as an inherent right of the Crown, by vertew of his Supremacie,</hi> They do thereby redintegrat the estate of Bishops, not only to their places in Parliament, and their accustomed dignities and priviledges; but also to their Episcopal function, Presidency in the Church,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96182:6"/>
and power of Ordination, Censures and all Church-discipline to be performed by them, with the advice of such of the Clergie as they should find to be of known loyalty and prudence. And, for removing of all scruples, the Parliament doth furder rescinde all former <hi>Acts,</hi> by which the sole and only power and jurisdiction within this Church, doth stand in the Church, and its Assemblies; and all other Acts whatsomever, giving any Church-power, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction or Government to its Office-bearers or Meetings, other then that which acknowledgeth a dependance upon, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination unto the Soveraigne Power of the King as Supreme; and which is to be regulated and authorized, in the exercise thereof, by the Bishops and Archbishops, who are to be accountable to his Majesty for ther administration: And moreover, by the same Act, the Act 1592. (whereby Presbyterian Government was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed, and which, by vertew of the above mentioned Act Rescissory, did now in so far, by the Act 1612. stand rescinded) in respect that it doth also limite the Kings prerogative to be without prejudice or derogation to the priviledge that God hath given to the Spiritual Office-bearers in the Kirk, concerning heads of Religion, Heresie, Excommunication, Collation, or Deprivation of Ministers, or any such like Censure, specially grounded in the Word of God. This Act, I say, 1592. is now for this reason totally annulled, in all the heads, articles and clauses thereof: from which Act of Restitution, although the nature of our present Church-constitution may be very obviously gathered; yet there are two other also, to the same purpose, of which I cannot but take notice. The one is that concerning a National Synod, wherein his Majesty, by vertew of his Supremacy, doth more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely appoint and determine upon the manner and members thereof, then if it were a meer civill Court, unquestionably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon his Royal Authority; reserving to himselfe, aswell the proposal, as the final approbation of all matters to be therein treated. The other is the late <hi>Act</hi> 1669. asserting the Supremacie, whereby the Supreme Authority over all persons, &amp; in all causes Ecclesiastick, is so fully declared to appertaine to the King, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96182:7"/>
that by vertew thereof, he may dispose upon the Government and Persons Ecclesiastick; and enact concerning the Churches meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and matters therein to be proposed, as he shall think fit, that a more absolute power in any thing can hardly be devised in his favours.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Acts</hi> lying so well together, I could not but lay them forth to a joint consideration. And from them, I suppose, it will be very evident, that the work of the last revolution, was not only an invasion made upon the Churches Government, by the setting up of Bishops, and their usurpation over Presbyteries and Synods, as hapened in their former introduction, preceeding the year 1612: But that the alteration made, is plainly fundamental: and that, by his Majesties assuming all Church-power to himself, as the proper right and prerogative of the Crown, without so much as pretending, with the Pope, a Commission from Iesus Christ for this effect; and conveying the same by these communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations alone, which he is pleased to dispense; and to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and meetings as he thinketh good to appoint, and maketh to himself accountable; there is not so much as that <hi>Genus</hi> of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Government recognosced by Presbytery, as only fountained in, and derived from our Lord as Head of the Church; let be its specification from our Classical form, at present to be found in being in this Church.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, that I seem to make a difference betwixt the former and the latter erection of Episcopal Government in this Church; and yet when Bishops were brought in, in the year 1606. the Kings prerogative was, by the then Parliament, first enacted, and by the next Act, their restitution is thereon also founded; and in like manner, by the Act 1612. Presbyteries and Synods are turned to exercises of the Brethren, and Diocesian visitations; and the power of ordination, deposition, and excommunication is given to the Bishop: and to compleat all, by the same Act, the Act 1592. was also rescinded: So that it appeares, that betwixt the former practices, and the late establishment, there is no great disparitie. 'Tis answered, the apparent resemblance of the things
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96182:7"/>
objected, is nevertheless accompanied by such reall and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall differences, that it doth only the more notablie evince the strangeness of the methods, and nature of the present establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beyond all that the same designes in former times could suggest. King <hi>Iames</hi> was indeed bent for Prelacie, as all do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; but by seeking thereby to qualifie and oversway the Government of the Church, in effect to subvert all Government, given by our Lord unto his Church, is an absurditie which his better understanding did prudently forbear; and nothing, save either the mysterie of this growing iniquity, or the precipitancie of our times could have produced.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the true state of the difference betwixt our, and the former times, the particulars following will easiely evince. And <hi>first,</hi> it is true, the Parliament 1606. doth, by their first Act, declare the Kings prerogative, but only upon the narrative of the accession of the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in general, over all estates, persons, and causes, without the least derogation to the explication made in favours of the Church by the Parl. 1592. Whereas, in our dayes, this Supremacy hath been asserted, declared and exercised, in order to Ecclesiastick Persons, meetings and matters, not only far beyond any thing pretended to in civils; but above all that ever was arrogate, either by Pope, or temporal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate. <hi>Next,</hi> by the second Act of the fore-mentioned Parliament 1606. the Estate of Bishops is indeed restored; and that upon the ground of the Kings prerogative: but to what? To ecclesiastick power, presidencie, jurisdiction, &amp;c. Fye! Not at all; but only to their former honours, dignities, prerogatives, priviledges, livings, lands, teinds, rents, &amp;c. And chiefly and especially against the Act of annexation. 1587. These, though unjustly bestowed, were yet proper subjects for a King and Parliament: as for other things, purely ecclesiastick, they rightly judged them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their line: Whereas, by the late Act. 1662. the King, with consent of the Estates, restores the Bishops, both to the same things, and also to the exercise of their Episcopal function, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency, power of ordination, and others above rehearsed: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96182:8"/>
himselfe to be the proper and supreme Head, whence all Church-pover doth flow, and to whom the Bishops ought to be accountable: An attempt so impertinent to secular Powers, and subversive of the very subject matter of Ecclesiastick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the former times, not from any greater tenderness in these things, but meerly from a clearer knowledge of their inconsistencie, did not once dream of: and therefore, in the third place, King <hi>Iames,</hi> who knew well eneugh, that neither did his prerogative extend to the proper power and jurisdiction of the Church, nor could this be thereupon founded; and that for him to assume the disposal and dispensing thereof, was in effect to destroy it; although by vertew of his Supremacy, he restored the Bishops to their honours, temporalities and possessions; yet, as to the power Ecclesiastick by them acclaimed, he applyed himself to compass the same only by the suffrage &amp; determination of Church-assemblies: and accordingly we see the <hi>Act, Parliament,</hi> 1612. gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto Bishops their Church-power and jurisdiction, not to be founded in, nor flow from the Supremacy; but to proceed simply, by way of ratification of an Act of a General assembly, made two years preceeding; and by the same <hi>Act.</hi> 1612. The <hi>Act</hi> 1592. establishing aswel the Protestant Religion, as Presbiterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and also limiting the prerogative, as I have said, is only rescinded, in so far as the same is derogatorie to the Articles then concluded: whereas, the King, with consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the <hi>Act</hi> 1662. laying down the Supremacy for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, and ascrybing to himself the origen of Ecclesiastick power, restores the Bishops, in the same manner, as if they were his own Commissioners and Delegates. And to the effect the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy may transcend all, the <hi>Act</hi> 1592. is totally rescinded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as a reserve for the Protestant Religion; as is above declared. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in former times, whatever were the errors and wrongs, either of Church, or State, or both, in the bringing in of Bishops; yet this is very certain and important, that the Church-assemblies, at first, conveened by warrand of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches intrinsick power, and after, confirmed by the Parliament
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96182:8"/>
1592. were not upon the change discontinued; but honest men did therein maintain both their right and possession, except in so far as the same were invaded, and they hindered by the Bishops their prevalencie: whereas of late, not only were the former Presbytries and Synods raised &amp; dissolved, but the new meetings, now conveened in their place, were appointed to sit down, as they sould be authorized &amp; ordered by the Bishops and Archbis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops; who thereafter, are, by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament, restored and impowered by the King, as supreme, over Persons and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Ecclesiastick, and declared Arbiter by right of his Crown in these matters: So that it is evident, that they both are called in his name, and do sit and act, by vertew of a power, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a subordination unto, and dependence upon his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity; by reason whereof, they are also to him made accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. I grant, that for better concealing the mysterie of this Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie &amp; Prelacie, the present meetings were set up, for the most part, in the same bounds, &amp; much under the same forme and name with the old presbyteries and synods: But seeing their precarious dependence on Bishops, with the Bishops their proper &amp; absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te subordination to the King, as Supreme over the Church, is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable from the above cited <hi>Act.</hi> 1662. that therefore the present Church-government, as it is freqently called in the late <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> so <hi>de facto,</hi> is his Majesties government, and not that of our Lord Iesus, who hath not invested him therewith, either by deputation or surrender, is evident above exception. Neither are these things so, only in the law and appointment, as is by some alledged; no, the frequent examples of Bishops, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and suspending in Synods, after having asked, meerly <hi>pro forma,</hi> the advice of a few next to them, without the vote of the whole; their renversing the deeds of Presbyteries, &amp; control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whole Synods by themselves alone, with his Majesties gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the High Commission, impowering Seculars to appoint Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be censured by deposition and suspension, as well as Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks to punish by fining, consining &amp; imprisoning; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and placing Bishops at his pleasure; and his late granting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96182:9"/>
a Commission of oversight or episcopacie, for the Diocesse of <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi> to him who mostly scrupled at a Patent of the Bishoprick, because of its temporalitie: These examples, I say, do clearly bring up our practice the full length of all enacted.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained the condition of our present Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick constitution, in its authority, principles and practices, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from any model that ever was seen in this Church, I think, were it not for the clearness of method, I might leave the description of the present Prebyteries and Synods, to the Readers own ingenuous collection: but tò render my discourse the more easie, I say, that the Presbiteries and Synods, which are now so termed amongst us, are meetings for Church-matters, conveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Majesties call, acting by his authority, in a precarious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Bishops, and absolute subordination to the Supremacie: and this definition, is so manefestly the result of what is premised and composed as it were of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and supremacy, and proclamation so often mentioned, that none can deny it. Neither is it the present question, whether we may simply joyne in these meetings or not? For seeing, that not only this conjunction would be an acknowledgement of the supremacie, nothing different from, yea rather worse then the sitting in the High Commission, and an active submission to, and owning of Prelacie in its highest usurpation; But even the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Accommodation, by offering a mitigation, do evidently suppose it to be inconsistent with Presbyterian principles: It is clear, that a simple unqualified Union, with and in these meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is not the case of the present debate.</p>
               <p>The point therefore that comes next to be examined, is, whether or not the Articles do indeed contain such condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and conditions, as may fully releive us of our just exceptions? Which leads me to take notice of the Fifth Article (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in the first place, as that which appears to be most direct to this purpose: And the contents of it are; <hi>'Tis not to be doubted, that my L, Commissioner his Grace will make good what he offered, ane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> the establishment of Presbyteries and Synods; and we trust, his Grace will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96182:9"/>
procure such security to these brethren for declaring their judgement, that they may do it without any hazard in contraveening any Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and that the Bishops shall humbly and earnestly commend this to his Grace.</hi> These are the termes of the Article, and for all that I have yet heard, I am not so doubtful of the Comissioner's performance, as I am still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of what was offered: The Brethren, who conferred in the <hi>Abbey,</hi> told us, that Presbyteries were offered to be set up, as before the Year 1638. and that the Bishop should passe from his Negative voice, and so forth: But what may be the import of the first part of this offer, or how far it may conduce to the clearing of our Consciences, I confess I am still in the dark. That which the dissenting Brethren do, and every true Minister of Iesus Christ ought to seek after, is a Court, meeting in the Name, and acting by the authority and rules of our Lord and Master: Any other Court called by the King, and acting by an authority derived from the Supremacie, If in matters properly <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed usurpation against Christ, whose the Government is, both in the Constituent and actors: If in <hi>Civils,</hi> then it is wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Ministers Sphaere, and not to be medled in by them. Now that before the 1638. the Presbyteries and Synods then sitting, were, for the most part, our Lords Courts, in so far as they were by Succession the same with these, which at first, by warrand of Power by him given to his Church, did set up in his Name, and were not depraved from his institution by the Bishops their usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and the subsequent corruptions, is not doubted. But these being lately discharged and discontinued, &amp; I am sure, not intended to be again set down, either according to the first war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and rule, or as they were purged after the 1638. but plainly by vertew of the Supremacie, and in resemblance to that conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prelacie and Presbyterie, that was by Law established before the 1638. and consequently, both upon a wrong founda, tion, and in their most corrupt condition, I can not so much as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> apprehend, what ease to scrupling consciences can be herein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed. I have indeed heard it sometimes alledged, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our present withdrawing, and in that di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ering from the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96182:10"/>
practice of our Predecessours under the last Bishops, that the then Presbyteries and Synods did meet by warrant of Law, which now they want: But this reason, is in its termes so extrinsick to that which a true Minister of Iesus Christ ought mainly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and in truth so groundless, the <hi>Act</hi> 1592. confirming the proper right of these meetings, being by the <hi>Act</hi> 1612. (though not totally, yet in so far as it was derogatorie to the Articles therein set down,) rescinded and made void, that I cannot but judge both scruple &amp; solution offered, impertinent. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be true dealing intended, and any real respect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in this matter, it is evident, that it is neither by the re-authorizing of abrogat and abjured corruptions, nor yet by any new devised frame, by vertew of, and depending upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, that we can be cleared: But the only proposal to any good purpose that can be made in this behalfe, should be of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Presbyteries, founded upon our Lords warrand, and his Churches priviledge; and consequently to restore them, either as they were first allowed by the <hi>Act</hi> 1592. or which is all one, in the condition wherein they were dissolved in the Year 1661. with an abolition of all inconsistent Acts and practices.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, if we be reponed to the same Estate wherein our Predecessours were, how can we prove disconforme in our practice? 'Tis answered, the dissolution and discontinuance of true Presbyteries with this new erection, first appointed to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Archbishops and Bishops, and then setled upon the foot of the Supremacie, do so evidently difference the cases, according to what is already more fully declared, that this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of no moment. And if it be urged, that as a restitution repones against a discontinuance; so, if Presbyteries and Synods be really set up, it is but a peevish nicety to stick upon the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie how the same is done: the returne is easie, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not questioned, but a full and fair restitution doth indeed repone; and therefore, if it would please his Majestie to restore the Church, to its meetings and Priviledges which it enjoyed in the Year 1661<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

if not really made the foundation of the Churches power, contrary to the very nature and being of the right restored, would prove no long demurre. But as for the restitution offered, seeing it is not adjusted to our distresse, but expresly referreth to a juncture, which was in it self very corrupt, and needed reformation; and whereunto, if bottomed upon the Supremacy, and not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the old foundation, the faithful men of these dayes, had doubtless never joyned; it is but ane emptie conceit, no wayes reaching the question in hand. From which ground, it is also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that as we have good reason to declare, that we might have continued in these judicatories, had they not been once rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and setled again upon a new basis; and that though a Bishop had come and obtruded himself upon us, we might have sit still, after a free protest given against his usurpation; so, <hi>G. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> endeavour, in a letter, supposed to be from him, perswading to this Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, to represent this as a methaphysical nicety, of no more value, then the emptie difference of sitting still, though a Bishop come in, and of sitting down again when a Bishop is alreadie there; and yet acknowledging, in the same passage, the <hi>case</hi> to be different, if the Court &amp; constitution of the Iudicatorie be not the same, doth manifestly bewray the Doctors grosse inadvertencie; &amp; that the more to be regrated, that he is not affrayed to obtest us, as before God, to answere for our sticking at such a <hi>punctilio,</hi> when yet he himself, in a short but untrue supposition of the samness of the former and present Episcopal courts, insinuateth a very obvious reason, rendering the difference very material and important.</p>
               <p>To be plain therefore, seeing the Supremacy, as at present established, hath clearly everted and swallowed up all true Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick-government; and the Presbyteries and Synods now bearing that name, are only its unwarrantable Conventicles; unless that these prevailing floods of this prerogative be abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the true establishments of the government of the Lords house discovered; I do not see where the disire of any to be innocent can rest, or how the Lords faithful servants can be satisfied, and comply with this part of the overture. I might here
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96182:11"/>
adde, that seeing there may be in some cases just reason for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, aswel because of the quality of the members, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the constitution, the rectification of the latter can as little in our case as in any be respected as a full ground of satisfaction: but the defectivenesse of thir Articles will more properly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward come to be considered.</p>
               <p>And therefore I shall novv go to the First, to see vvhat is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by further offered: and here vve find it proposed, <hi>That, if the dissenting brethren will come to Presbyteries and Synods, they shall not only not be obliged to renounce their own private opinion, anent Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and swear and subscrive any thing thereto; but shall have libertie, at there entrie to the said meeting, to declare &amp; enter it in what form they please.</hi> If I were enclined to use sharpness, I might on just ground say, that this Article, certainly to be understood of entering to sit &amp; act, &amp; not only to protest &amp; testifie, doth contain no better <hi>Salvo</hi> for our exceptions, then what, if admitted, will equally allow the same accesse to the Pope's Conclave, or any other the most unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and corrupt meeting upon earth; is as evident, as that a Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick reservation of opinion, and declaration without any effect, or a protestation contrarie to fact, is thereby judged a sufficient exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. But to come to the purpose closely, I affirme that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Presbiteries, here invited to, are not truely such, but meerly nominal and pretended: being in effect Courts authorized by Bishops, and subordinat to his Majestie in matters purely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick, over and about which he himself hath no such power. And for the former part of the assertion, the Acts &amp; other things by me premised do abundantly clear it. As for the latter, that the King hath no such power in and over the Church; it being uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Presbyterian perswasion, and the Supremacy, made the ground of the abovementioned <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Restitution,</hi> being to them a greater cause of offence, then any of these difficulties in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conjunction with Presbyteries &amp; Synods intended by the <hi>Accommodation</hi>; it was the part of the <hi>Accommodators,</hi> either by conviction or condescendence, to have removed it. However I may not digresse; only I am assured, if these three things be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96182:11"/>
which I am readie to demonstrat against whatsoever Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent; (1.) That this Ecclesiastick power is the sole prerogative of Iesus Christ, whereof the administration was committed by our Lord to his Church, when no Magistrat was a Member thereof; and that upon the Magistrats becoming Christian, there is no ground adduceable whereupon it could accrease to him: (2.) That all the power of the Magistrat is, under God, from the People, and in such things over and about which the original po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer was to them competent, to which this Church-power can in no sort be reckoned. (3.) That all the extraordinarie interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good Kings and Emperours, in matters of Religion, did no wayes flow from any inherent right or prerogative they had conversant in these matters; but were the pure product of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, sustained by the righteousness of the work, &amp; deficiency of the more proper means. These things, I say, being duely considered, I am very confident, that all the pretensions of the Supremacy, will very quickly evanish: and therefore it inevitably followes, that, seeing the Kings Supremacy is a high usurpation against our Lord &amp; Master, all Courts depending thereon, and acknowledging the same, &amp; partaking therein, what ever opinion a man do reserve, or whatever declaration be made anent it, must also be rejected.</p>
               <p>But here there ariseth a great noise and clamor, what! are the present Presbyteries and Synods no Presbyteries and Synods? then are the present Ministers no Presbyters? But their is no such haste; neither have these things any further connexion, then that the present Ministers are not Presbyters, in so far as the same denotes a power of ruling committed by Iesus Christ, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think in ingenuitie they can not deny; specially seing, that although they hold themselves to be Ministers by mission from Christ; yet they do nevertheless acknowledge their power of Ecclesiastick Government and Iurisdiction to be from the King, on whom they grant that the Ministerie, as to other things, doth not in such a manner depend: Whereupon it evidently followeth; that if the power of government, do as well and in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner flow from Iesus Christ, as the power of order (as the Schools
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96182:12"/>
speak) doth; and that thereby true Presbyteries and Synods do only subsist; then, these meetings, which recognosce his Majesty as Supreme for and in the exercise of the power which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, can no more be truly such, then he who, by vertew of his Soveraign's mission, would pretend himself to be a Minister. But what need of more words; if the present conform Ministers, and there meetings, have disclained Iesus Christ for their immediat Head, in matrer of Government, and owne no power thereof, but what acknowledgeth a dependence upon, and subordination to his Majesty as Supreme; wherewith nevertheless he himself is not at all vested; and if on the other hand, we do disallow all Church-Government, and medlings and meetings thereof, which do not hold their commission and warrant from Christ alone, as the Head of the Body; what concurrence can we make, in on and the same Assembly? Or by what <hi>salvo</hi> may my sitting and acting be justified in a meeting, in the power whereof I hold it unlawful to partake? For my part, since, in the matter of Ecclesiastick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they do not hold the true Head, but have betaken themselves to another, to whom they do referr, &amp; are accountable for all their power; if we, who in Conscience do both detest this usurpation, and disclaime all share in any power, save what our Lord hath committed unto us, desire to be excused from these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies; I think, until they first convince us of our mistake in these things, they cannot rationally blame us for Separation. And therefore, what ever may be the effect of an entrie, qualified either by declaration or protestation, in order to the freeing of the partie from an apparent constructive accession, to certain acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental corruptions that may be in a meeting, to which he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obliged to joine; yet sure I am, in this case, where the very constitution it self is so unwarrantable and corrupt, that non can actively partake therein, without sin; this remedie here offered is altogether insignificant.</p>
               <p>The next thing that here occurres, is, that although this reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of opinion and declaration permitted, could be a <hi>salvo,</hi> as to the evills of the constitution; yet, without doubt, there is a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96182:12"/>
consideration to be had, in such conjunctions, of the persons also with whom it is to be made. There may be an Assembly, nay a Presbyterie or Synod of evill doers, which we are bound to hate; and even the Assembly of the wicked who inclosed him, and pearced his hands and his feet, wanted not a specious name, yea it was the house of his friends: sure no man will think that a simple protestation may warrant constant presence in these cases; but rather encline, with <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to leave and to draw from an assembly of treacherous men. What for assemblies the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church-meetings are, I can be no more tender, then it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous to utter: only this I will say, that if it be once granted, that such may be the condition of a meeting, by reason of the quality of its members, that no declaration can warrant any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship therein; I am certain that the subsumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that such are the Courts to which we are invited, may be, to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all unbyassed men, upon these sufficient grounds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious perjury, intrusion, profanitie and insufficiencie, unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably made out.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to the next Article, bearing, <hi>That all Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires shall be managed, in Presbyteries and Synods, by the free vote of Presbyters, or the Major part of them.</hi> This is indeed the main &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal condescendence: and it is to this place, that, aswel for the satisfaction of such Brethren as possibly will not so easily, at first, admit of the foregoing reasons, as for a full answere to all that can be said for this <hi>Accommodation,</hi> I have reserved to discourse upon it at more length, and on all fair and probable Suppositions. In supplement therefore of this Article, and to take it in the most advantageous sense that the Proposers can desire, I adde, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently therewith, it seems the Bishop is to be reduced to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Moderator: whence in prosecution of my declared purpose, waving any further exceptions against the nullity of the present Presbyteries and Synods, I clearly state the Question thus. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a constant Moderator, or fixed <hi>Proeslos,</hi> for terme of life, in Church-meetings, be a thing in it self lawful? And how far it is by us admissible? And what complyance we may have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or it?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96182:13"/>
And because there are some papers gone abroad from the Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> as is supposed, upon this subject, and that the current of the speeches at <hi>Pasely</hi> wereof the same strain; I conceive, for rendering of the debate more certain, it will not be amisse, that I bring them to a particular and exact review.</p>
               <p>And in the beginning of these Papers, we find it asserted, <hi>That Episcopal Government, managed in conjunction with Presbyters in Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries and Synods, is not contrary either to the rule of Scripture, or the example of the primitive Church; but agreeable to both.</hi> That this position doth hold forth no more then the lawfulness of an <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Praeses,</hi> &amp; that upon negative grounds, giving the asserter the easier part of defence, is obvious to the first observation. To have affirmed an obligation to this model, though the Author's choise had not been convenient: <hi>the thing which hath been, it is that which shall be,</hi> and an agreeablenesse to Scripture and antiquitie, is for the time a very colourable pretension, and all that the Author dare adventure to affirme: But that as much may be said for a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian paritie, exclusive of this presidencie; I think our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries themselves will not deny: And it is very evident, that it is the thing they have no inclination to redargue. Which advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, lying equally and fairly on our side, and being confirmed by possession strengthned by an Oath, and to the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of all (mostly arising from the contrary effects of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie) sealed with the seal of good Gospel fruits, one of the great evidences produced by <hi>Paul</hi> for his Apostelship; how much it doth impugne the late change, and justifie the aversion and non-compliance of all good men therewith; all rational men may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. But, seeing our cause is not as theirs, leaning only to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative probalities, and the power wherewith it is supported, to deal clearly in this matter, though we do not pretend to a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, expresse, and particular Scripture-precept, as well against the presidencie, as for the parity pleaded; yet, that we have an equivalent divine warrant, more pregnant then what in other particulars is acknowledged for such, even by our Opposites: The following heads do plainly evince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96182:13"/>And <hi>first,</hi> That Iesus Christ King in Zion, sitting and ruling upon His Throne, to whom all Power is given, and who is the Head of the Body, when He ascended on high, sent forth His Apostles to gather, feed, and rule His Church, promising to be with them to the end of the World; and thereby hath appointed a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in His house, suitable to these holy ends for which it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, is not more evidently founded upon the Scripture-grounds insinuat, then firme in its connexion and inference.</p>
               <p>2. As the Apostles and their Successors were the only perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pastors ordained by our Lord; (for as for the mission of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> what ever allusions after Ages, according to their then model, did draw from it, without all peradventure, accòrding to is own tenour, it did expire before our Lords suffering) so they were by him constitute in an exact paritie, as Brethren: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this equality, and the nature of their Ministrie, our Lord forbids among them all distinction of authoritative Superioritie, the very name of <hi>Rabbi</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> then abused, and all ambition &amp; affectation of these or any other elating dignities and titles; but they are only commanded to outstripe and exceed on another, in that diligence and humilitie recommended to them in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon service, whereunto they were destined.</p>
               <p>3. According to this command given, so they conversed and behaved in the Church of God, without the least vestige of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either in power or presidencie: Nay on the contrary, with a manifest equality, except it be in some notes of apparent prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in these, by men esteemed inferior, expresly, as it seems recorded, to counter-ballance the vanity of ambition of after Ages, who in favour of others, might imagine a Superiority. And such are the principal resort made to <hi>Iames,</hi> his moderating rather then <hi>Peters</hi> in the meeting at <hi>Ierusalem, Pauls</hi> resistance to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the right hand of fellowship given to him by <hi>Iames, Cephas</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>4. The pastors appointed by the Appostles being their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, both in their ordinarie power and blessing, whatever might be the inequalitie betwixt them and the Appostles, either from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96182:14"/>
the immediacy and extent of the Apostles their mission, their infallible assistance and greater eminency of gifts, or by reason that the Apostles were the Lords chosen witnesses, and authors of conversion to most of them whom they ordained; yet, as to the perpetual and ordinary power given to, and transmitted by them in the Church, it is evident from Scripture, that, in that, they neither claimed nor exercised either superiority or presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie over other Ministers. Hence it is, that as they call and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them their brethren, partners, fellow-labourers, and themselves fellow-elders with them; so we finde, that what in on place <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes to the laying on of his own hands, in another he attributes to the laying on of the hands of the Presbyterie: And the same <hi>Paul,</hi> who was not a whit behind the very chiefest Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, receiving a solemn mission from a Presbyterie, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Fellow-apostles, but of other Prophets and Teachers. Gifts there fore were indeed diverse and unequal, and imploiments also were various in the dayes of the Apostles, according to the then exigence of a growing spreading Church: but that either among the Apostles themselves, or them and the Pastors by them ordained, or among the Pastors themselves there was the least imparity, in respect of that ordinarie and standing power continued in the Church, as the passages mentioned do plainly confirme the negative; so there can no instance be adduced from Scripture in the contrary.</p>
               <p>We know <hi>Timothie, Titus,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches, are much talked of, as the first superior Bishops: and to this it is as easily reponed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is nothing enjoyned or recommended in <hi>Pauls</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to <hi>Timothie,</hi> which is not proper for every Pastor, unlesse what is evidently referable to his office of an Evangelist there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The command given to <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders, was by way of expresse commission, and not in the least exclusive of the concurrence of other Elders where they might be found in the place.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96182:14"/>3 That it is in these very Epistles, more then any where els in Scripture, that both the names of Bishops and Elders are promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously used, and the thing and office thereby signified held forth to be the same.</p>
               <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> that the known use &amp; elegancie of the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the plural, with the figurative speech and tenor of the seven Epistles in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> do no more allow the Angels, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Pastors, then the Stars signifying the same thing, nay or the Candlesticks the Churches, to be taken for single persons. But for further clearing of all these and like objections, I referr the Reader to the many Authors, by whom these things are more fully handled.</p>
               <p>These grounds then being all undoubtedl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Scriptural, with what confidence can it be demanded, where doth the Scripture hold out a paritie among Ministers? Or how can it be affirmed, that the <hi>Episcopus Praeses</hi> contended for, specially with his necessary presence in Ordination, as we will afterwards hear, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but agreeable to the word of God? By all which it appears, that as our Presbyterian paritie is plainly warranted, both by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Gospel-rules, and very expresse instances contained in Scripture; So the apparent lawfulness of any other form of mans devising, can be no justification thereof.</p>
               <p>But it is objected, <hi>If this ground be rejected, how will we maintain, or where will we finde an expresse command or rule for our own model of Kirk-sessions, Presbyteries, Syonds Provincial and National, with a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Kirk, in their several dependencies and subordinations, and the changing of the moderator in these meetings, excepting that only of the Kirk-sessions, wherein the Minister doth constantly moderat; for without this expresse Kule, a Bishop or fixed President may very well consist with that frame, which we conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In answering this objection, I must begin with its latter part, which is so directly contradicted by the present constitution, both in its legal establishment, and known exercise, as I have already proven, that I marvel how it could escape any person of ordinary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96182:15"/>
understanding. As for the main thing objected, having from the Scripture asserted the warrant of our parity, its difficulty is easily satisfied: for seeing that by Divine institution the Church is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one Society, and officers in an equal parity for its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and Government thereto appointed; And seeing that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very concession, the things natural and proper to what is conced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed must be understood to be therein imported; the libertie and power of common counsel, together with the subordination of the parts to the whole, do thence necessarily result. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses of which argument, being so consistently composed of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reason thereon dependent, I need not here enlarge in any explication. Sure I am, he who duely perpendeth these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible Scripture-truths; That the Church is gathered into one body; that the Apostles together, the Pastors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders together are incharged with its oversight and rule; that the Spirit of the Prophets is subject unto the Prophets; and that where two or three are gathered together in the Lords Name, there he is in the midst of them; It is impossible he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main doubtful of the Divine warrant and authority of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Conforme to which truths and principles, we not only finde, in the Acts of the Apostles, the Church governed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon counsel, but the same Meetings and Councels inspired and directed by that humilitie, love and harmonie, that no more then a chair man for the time, &amp; no sixed moderator can therein be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. If these grounds were not both solidly and evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of all necessarie for me to prove, I might easily, without either worming or straining (as our moderatists phrase it) adduce and make out from Scripture precedents more exactly correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our formes: But seeing the right and Priviledge of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counsel for Government, in order both to the whole and certain of the parts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96182:15"/>Now, as for the <hi>Commission of the Kirk,</hi> whereof Scripture warrant is also required, seeing we do not hold it to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Church-judicatorie; but do only regard it as a delegation from the preceeding National-assembly elicit by extraordinary exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and precisely accountable to the next ensuing, Its right is so certainly parallel to that of every Committee, appointed by any meeting for dispatch, that unlesse it were alledged, that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of commissionating is by Scripture inhibite; it must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be understood to be founded in the same warrant with the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, from which it doth flow &amp; receive its con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irmation. I contend not, but our observance in practice might have had its own failings in this point: but seeing the excesse in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if any was, did probably flow from the mistake of a suppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed expediencie; the evidence of its warrant and right use, by such and error in fact, cannot at all be impugned.</p>
               <p>But the ministers their being constantly moderators in Kirk-ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, among the Elders joyned with them for Discipline, is that wich our adversaries do urge, as a great advantage for proving the lawfulness of the fixed Moderator in Presbyteries and Synods, and our inconsequence in denying the same. In the fond conceit of which argument, it hath been, and is so frequently by them inculcat, that here is a Presbyter, having a fixed presidencie among presbyters, that I am sure it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustly nauseat or move to laughter any indifferent observer.</p>
               <p>To begin therefore with this childish emphasis, taken from the terme Presbyter, and the calling of the minister and parochial-elders, both of them presbyters; such indeed they are: but seeing the scripture doth warrant the office of our Ruling Elder, &amp; also attributeth several other names to Ministers, agreeable to the main labour, and to these Parochial Elders, only that of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Elders; and yet on the other hand, the classical Assemblies, principally consisting of Ministers, are commonly called Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: If use, for distinction, hath appropriat to these Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-elders the name of Elders, rather then that of Presbyters, what folly is it to think, that a contrary usurpation of names can be of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96182:16"/>
any import; or wherefore do not our adversaries, if they have such a complaisance for these conceits, tell us further what a qstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thing it is to see a Presbyterie (for so a Kirck-session may well be termed) consisting only of one Minister and all the rest Laiks, as they speak, and withal reflect upon these more pungent retorsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nearer Home, <hi>viz.</hi> that in their way, a Bishop pretends to a-Superiority or presidencie over many Bishops, and a single Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter must have the preheminence over his Fellow-presbyters.</p>
               <p>But leaving these fopperies, and taking words according to the determination of custome in such cases, in answer to what is material in the objection, I say (1.) That where there are two Ministers in a parish, they moderat in the Session by turnes. (2) Where the Session doth consist of one Minister, both a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ruling Elder, and the other Elders of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are but his helpers in discipline, his different quality, with the double honour allowed to him by the Apostle, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly determine the moderatorship in his favours. (3.) If a Minister, who is the Pastor and teacher of the whole flock, do preside amongst the Elders of a secondarie order, joined to him for his assistance; will it therefore follow, that one Minister should fixedly preside over many, in the same order with himself, and equally concerned in all the affaires of the meeting? What Logick can knit together such inferences?</p>

               <p>For evincing whereof I observe .2. that as it is not unto this fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed presidencie as such, but unto the more abounding grace of God, under these frequent and grievous persecutions wherewith the Church was then exercised, that the singular order, unity and charity of the primitive times is to be ascribed; So the gradual advance of this <hi>Prostasia,</hi> together with the joint and perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines of true knowledge &amp; piety, &amp; concurring increase of pride, contention, irreligion &amp; superstition, are very pregnant eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its vanity. I need not note that the first times to which this presidencie can lay any claime were the purest; its first setting up, as most acknowledge, was in the second Centurie, in a simple <hi>Protocathedria</hi> to the <hi>Senior</hi> Presbyter: Shortly thereafter it turned to a <hi>Prostasia</hi> given by election; and then stil ascending, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the discountenance and persecution of the Heathenish pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and people, it did notwithstanding, what by wresting the election in many places from the Presbyters, and what by usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the power of ordinantion and censures, advance to a very high degree of Prelacie: as is aboundantly confirmed by what may be gathered from the Records of these times, and especially by good <hi>Cyprian</hi> his words to his Presbyters <hi>Epist.</hi> 6. <hi>A primordio Episcopatus mei, statui nihil sine consilio vestro privata sententia gerere:</hi> whereby as it were in opposition to the then corrupt custome of other Bishops, he plainly insinuateth his contrary resolution. Now what, under this progresse of the <hi>Prostasia,</hi> still pretending to be a remedy, was the growth of the evils both of contentions, schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96182:18"/>
and heresies (specially in the intervals of the Churches suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, wherewith these several degrees were manifestly attended, needeth not to be enforced by many instances. That of <hi>Victor</hi> as to superstition, contention and schisme, who for a different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Pasch</hi> (a weighty point forsooth) did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat the better halfe of the Christian world, may stand for a thousand: and as for Heresies, their catalogues are almost end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: But though its rise under so great pressures, doth very convincingly argue the strong and subtile Spirit working in its elevation; yet it was from the time of <hi>Constantin's</hi> Empire, and the rising of the Sun of prosperitie upon the Church, that it did yet more evidently begin to discover itself in its proper collours: And from this period indeed it was, that, more and more exalting and explicating its powers, it ceased not, until through proud and fervid contentions of the prelats amongst themselves for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie (more dangerous by far then al the pettie contests that could arise among Presbyters) and these still varnished with he pretexts of unity, peace, and apostolick example, but really ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat by pride and ambition, and accompanied with covetousness, luxurie, neglect of truth, abounding of errors, superstition and irreligion, it at length arrived at the papacie; which, by its ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous infallibility and implicit faith, did in the end indeed bring forth, in the destroying of true knowledge and conscience, an apparent peace and unity, most like to that indifferencie in the matters of religion, and surrender and abjection of conscience, which the abettors of our supremacie do, under the same plausible names and pretenses, so much endeavour to introduce. This being then the growth, progresse and product of this <hi>Prostasia</hi> &amp; its lying pretense of remedying &amp; preventing schism (in effect nothing els then the sutable revelation of that mysterie which at first did more latently begin to work under its lesse discernable appearances) what judgment is to be made of it, I leave to every mans ingenuity.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that although the ensuing of Prelacie and Papacie, and all their evils upon the ancient Episcopacy may give a colour to the premised discourse; yet it is easie in such matters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96182:19"/>
to strain observations; and these consequences may be only its accidental and not its proper effects. 'Tis answered, not to insist upon the natural and gradual connexion of the things represented, more easie to be discerned by impartial reflection, then perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by superfluous arguing, it is very observable, <hi>First,</hi> that the great, if not the sole reason, that from the beginning hath been or can be alledged for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I need not observe, that it is upon this ground that the Popes Primacie and Headship is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry justly charged with all <hi>Romes</hi> Superstitions and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: If of old, <hi>I sent them not, therefore they shall not profit this People,</hi> was by the Spirit of the Lord made a sure and firme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, shall not then the visible accomplishment, I appointed it not, and it hath not profited, but been attended with many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous mischiefs, prove an evidence equally convincing?</p>

If then this fixed <hi>Praeses,</hi> at first set up in the Church, be a thing unwarrantable and anti-scriptural; that the <hi>Episcopus Praeses</hi> offered to us must be much more such, cannot be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; in as much as there are several material differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the one and the other all aggravating against the present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, as this short comparison of the two doth abundantly hold out. The <hi>Episcopus Praeses</hi> in ancient times was at least in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning chosen by the Presbyterie over which he presided, and consequently was by them censurable; as also he did only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over one, and that oftentimes a very small <hi>Classis,</hi> the taking of the election from the Presbyters, the exempting the then <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus Praeses</hi> from their controll, and the superinduction of Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans and Arch-bishops being all posterior inventions. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Praeses</hi> poposed to us is to be nominat and appointed by his Majesty; and for any thing we know by him only deposable or removable: As also the least of them is to be over many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries or Classes, whereof any one is by far too large for a conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Gospel oversight, and two of them over several Synods, not to mention their extrinsick and absurd secularities, clearly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible both with the nature and work of their office. Which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to be both certain and material, it were easie for me to make out: But since our rejecting of this <hi>Prostasia,</hi> doth proceed upon far more solid and comprehensive grounds, I shall not urge them: Only, that I may a little recreat my Reader, the returne made at <hi>Pasely</hi> by a worthie Doctor, to that disparitie of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Praeses</hi> his being nominat by the King, is very observable; and after he had meenly declared the manners of old elections, and how the People sometime aswel as the Presbyters had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest therein, and having made his answer, that the Church did then appoint and choose this <hi>Praeses,</hi> for want of a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat, with no better consequence then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96182:20"/>
that for the same reason the Church did then, and the Magistrat might now, ordain Ministers, he proceeded to prove the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of his Majesties appointment and nomination, partly from the prerogative of universal Patron, competent to him <hi>jure coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> and by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and partly because that an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Patron by presenting a Minister to the Kirk of his presentation, doth thereby make him a <hi>Proestos</hi> over the parochial Elders. Was not this grave and judicious reasoning? But seeing the right of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage is in it self a civil right (though indeed a sad incumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Church) only respecting the benefice, by vertue whereof the Patron conferreth no Ecclesiastick power, or any thing pertaining to the office, but, in that regard, referres the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son presented intirely to the tyral of the Church, which alone admitts him to the function, and conveys to him any Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick power thereto competent, I only wish the Doctor that reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sobrietie as may hereafter prevent such flegmatick mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</p>
               <p>The next argument against this fixed presidencie, and why we can not consent unto it, I take from the Oath of God that is upon us; not that I account these Covenants to be the main, if not the only, ground of Scrupling, as the Bishop alledgeth to be by many of us pretended: No, I am more perswaded, that there is nothing sworne to, or renounced by us, in these ingagements, which is not antecedently either duety or sin, then to be in love with their Arguments, who, from the determination that may arise from an oath in things within our power, do thence conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Episcopacie as in it self a thing indifferent, and by our oath only abjured. But seing Covenant-breakers do now turne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-interpreters, and it is the authors own undertaking to prove that a fixed presidencie is not contrary to this our oath, and seing that the same oath doth indeed superadde a special obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we shall afterwards hear, I shall first shew, that this <hi>Episcopus preses</hi> is by us abjured, and then review the authors obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the contrary.</p>

It is therefore certain, that as, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we had not in <hi>Scotland</hi> that <hi>species</hi> of Prelacie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly described in the second Article of the <hi>Solemn League,</hi> but the same was therein insert, mainly in order to our neighbour Churches; so the Episcopal Government, at this day restored in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is the same, and worse then what we had before, and the Presidencie now proposed was one of these very corruptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which we are bound for ever to preserve this Church at that time therefra reformed.</p>
               <p>But the Author sayes, <hi>That the Presbyterians in</hi> England <hi>do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take notice of this distinction,</hi> viz. <hi>That by the Covenant the Prelacy only therein described, and not moderat Episcopacie,</hi> that is, <hi>a form of Synodical Government conjunst with a fixed Presidencie is abjured.</hi> And for proving this assertion, he cites the two Papers of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls to his Majesty by the Presbyterian Brethen, <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. <hi>Master Baxter</hi> in his treatise of Church-government, and <hi>Theophilus Thimorcus,</hi> in his vindication of the Covenant not to be against all manner of Episcopacy, but that Prelacie only therein specified. It is answered; to measure our main obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Covenant, in order to the Church of <hi>Sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, seing that he himself doth note, that when that Covenant was framed, there was no Episcopacie at all in being in <hi>Scotland</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> only. Is it not a wonder, that thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that the extirpation of that frame only could then be

But where there hath appeared no conscience in keeping; why do we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much sense in interpreting? And we all know, what kinde of person it is of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>that his eyes are in the ends of the earth.</hi> To bring him back therefore to the purpose, it is the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> &amp; Members thereof in order to its self, anent which we do now inquire, &amp; for clearing thereof it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by the Solemn League the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> being then established, the preservation of that establishment, with the duty of extirpation in so far as is necessary thereunto, is only covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which, though it do sufficiently exclude this fixed Presidencie, as contrary to that establishment, and also unto sound doctrine &amp; the power of godlinesse; yet it is by the <hi>National Covenant</hi> &amp; its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined explication whereby not only the Episcopal Government which then was amongst us, &amp; is now restored &amp; advanced, but the Bishops their constant Moderatorship, as a novation and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Church, is plainly abjured. By all which it is evident, that as the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> being referred to the <hi>National,</hi> by which the establishment in the former sworne to be preserved was first setled, doth mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now as to the citations of the <hi>English</hi> Authors adduced, it is certain as to the present question we are not therein much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; they speak of the obligation of the Covenant in order to <hi>England,</hi> and how that Article of extirpation for that Church prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally provided is to be understood, the thing that pertaineth to us is to consider, how far, either by the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> or any other ingagement lying upon us, we are bound against all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96182:24"/>
corruptions to the preservation of the setlement we then enjoyed, which are subjects quite distinct; and thereby this heap of citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gathered by the Author is by one blast dissipated. But lest it may appear hard that we should be bound to such a precise form in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in that same Covenant left to such a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it is answered, not to reflect upon what might have been the secret designs of some unsound men in this matter which we neither were bound nor could distinctly know, this one thing is evident, that for us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who could not expect that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> groaning to be delivered from Prelacie, should instantly upon our grant of assistance embrace Presbytery in all its forms, of which they had not full and exact knowledge and no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and withall, seing we did hold Presbyterian government to be according to the word of God, and knew the common estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then made in <hi>England</hi> of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of both parties, that the then Prelacie was only expresly abjured, and not all Episcopacie, seeing no species of Episcopacie was on the other hand either by them reserved, or by us consented to, doth nothing contradict why both the rejecting of all Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; setting up of Presbytery might not still be covenanted unto under the general provisions: And therefore, seeing it is very agreeable both to Truth and Righteousnesse, that a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of evils, but not so enlightned as to the remedies; may covenante against the evils in particular, and also to endeavour a full reformation according to the word of God; and, by vertue of this general obligement, become bound to make a more exact search, anent the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse of things, anent which in the time of the covenanting they were more hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and after discoverie to reject even that which formerly they thought more probable, It is very evident that all the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England</hi> anent moderat Episcopacy, at the time of these ingagements, do nothing impede, why both they and we, in our respective stations, are not still obliged to reform that Church from all Episcopacie, and to extirpate it as contrary to the Doctrine, which is according to godlinesse. So that <hi>Englands</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as to this point, is rather apparent then real, and our obligations in order to both Kindomes are in effect <hi>objectivè</hi> the same.

               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:96182:25"/>As for the other grounds contained in the Author's citations, <hi>viz.</hi> the agreeablenesse of this presidencie to the scripture &amp; primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and the custome of our Kirk-sessions; they are already answered: &amp; what <hi>Mr Baxter</hi> addeth anent the Superintendents &amp; Visitors, which we had in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the begining of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is as easily removed by the then infancy of our Church, and extreme penurie of Pastors, as his other argument from the temporary moderators, chosen by Synods for the occasion and to them accountable, is concludent as to the fixed presidents now under question.</p>
               <p>To these Authorities the Author subjoines that, <hi>Though we have the names of</hi> Dean, Chapter <hi>and</hi> Commissarie, <hi>yet that none of these under that name exerce any part of the discipline, nor is this done by any other having delegation from the Bishops with a total exclusion of the communitie of Presbyters, which is a great part of the difference betwixt that model of Prelacie to be extirpat and this with us.</hi> Who would not pity such folly? who knows not that <hi>Englands</hi> Prelacie was ever dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any Episcopacie that we had in this Church since the Reformation, (although by the way I must reminde my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er how much by the late restitution it is advanced) but if by the particular obligation <hi>to extirpate,</hi> contained in the second Article of the <hi>League,</hi> we be only bound to extirpat <hi>Englands</hi> Prelacie, doth it therefore follow, that notwitstanding of the obligement to preserve Presbyterie then setled in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in general to extirpate every thing contrary to sound Doctrine and the Power of Godlinesse, and especially by vertue of the abjuration, made by us of our former Episcopacy in the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> that yet we are not bound to dissent from &amp; oppose the late restitution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Presbyterian Govern. being overturned, the same, yea a worse bond of Episcopacie then what we abjured, is restored.

               <p>As to what is added in the Papers of the aversion of some in <hi>England</hi> against the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as being against all Episcopacy, it is evidently a strain of the former ravery; and therefore, mis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding both the objection and solution, I come to the next pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, wherein the Author, casting off all fear of God, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the most learned and pious Assemblies that ever sat in <hi>Britain,</hi> respect due to as wise and honourable Parliaments as ever these Nations beheld, the good opinion and charity he ought to have for men and Christians truly such, and regard to his own credit, being once far engaged in these wayes, proceeds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least verification to give a character of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and its courses, made up of such reproaches of simplicity or cheatry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all ingaged in it, perplexity and vexation of all that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adhere to it, and insolent mocking at the overthrow of Gods work and desolation of His Sanctuary, that malice it self could have uttered nothing more false and virulent. <hi>The truth is</hi> (saith he) <hi>that besides many other evils, the iniquity and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of such Oaths and Covenants lyes much in this, that being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly formed by persons, that even amongst th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there is not one enumerat? Must we believe the <hi>Covenant</hi> to eb worse then can be expressed, because the Accuser can prove noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And why is this accusation pretended to be in general of all such Covenants, when yet it is expressely intended against the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant?</hi> Is it because the Author would have us to reckon it amongst the worst of combinations? Or because he hath the same regard and faith for all Covenants, or at least t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at by such a general he may the better cover the pointednesse of his calumnie only levelled at this.</p>
               <p>But taking all to be spoken of our <hi>Covenant,</hi> it is said, <hi>that it was framed by Persons amongst themselves not fully of one minde, but serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their different opinions and interests.</hi> But, 1. Whatever might have been the unsincerity and byasse of a few Persons, as there is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfect; yet that the Bodies of both the Parliaments, Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and People of these Nations, were acted in the matter of this <hi>League</hi> with such unanimity, straightnesse and zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberty, as can not readily be instanced in any Age or Nation, and could only be the effect of a Divine presence and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, is unto this day no lesse the comfort of its faithful Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, then the confusion of all its Adversaries. 2. As the matter it felf was thus carried, so I can appeal to the remembrances of thousands, that the taking &amp; renewing of our Covenants, both in this &amp; our neighbour Land was attended with more sincere mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, serious repentances, and solid conversions, then almost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ath been in any dispensation of the Gospel since the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. 3. Admitting that the Persons and motives influencing this <hi>Covenant</hi> had been such as is represented, yet, I am perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that, such is the truth, righteousnesse, plainnesse, and consistencie of all its Articles, that considering their brevity, the mighty parties ingaging, and how circumstantiat, with their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal and most important concerne, that which is offered to make its reproach, is the most visible Argument of the Lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling Providence, and evidence of the Covenants glory.</p>
               <p>But it is further alledged, <hi>That it is patched up of so many several Articles and clauses, and these too of so versatile and ambiguous termes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96182:27"/>
that it proves a most wretched snare.</hi> Certainly, in fair, yea in charitable, dealing, if the Author had intended either the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ignorant, or the conviction of the obstinat, or had but tendered his own repute, so broad and foul a challenge should at least have been qualified by a condescendence. It were easie for me to oppose one general to another; nor do I fear any losse from the inequalitie of our credit. But I am so perswaded, both from Conscience, Reason, and the common sense of all impartial men, of the falshood of this calumnie, that I am angrie that, by this disappointment, he should robe me and our cause of so probable an advantage. I shall not resume the quiblings of the <hi>Oxfoord</hi> Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and others: I freely refer my Reader both to their writings and the answers they have received, yea to the Covenant it self for the best solution. If I may here guesse at the Authors meaning by such circumstances as occurre, the <hi>versatile ambiguitie,</hi> he would objecte, is mostly in the certainty of the obligation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in order to <hi>England,</hi> (For as to the variety and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of the many Articles and clauses that he mentions, within a little, we shall finde him more particular) and as to this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, I have so fully evinced the lawfulnesse of the <hi>League</hi> in the matter of the extirpation Covenanted, wherein both parties did clearly agree, and the warrantablenesse of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the next place he tells us, <hi>That by reason of this variety and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity, the Covenant becomes a most wretched snare, a thicket o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the truth is, the Author hath wickedly broken the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and to disguise it, he would have the world believe, that all who remain faithful are caught in the briars, and detained against their wills. I shall not ask what these snares<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thickets and contentions are, whereof he accuseth this ingagement: It is below his dignitie to be so put to it. We know that many<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> part openly part more covertly, have dealt very treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erously in this matter; &amp; if thereafter, to palliat their perjury, they have moved debates anent it, is the <hi>Covenant</hi> therewith to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? One thing only I must say, that as many of these disputs have taken their various pretensions not from the Covenant it self, but from the word of God to which it referres, and which I wish the Author do not account liable to the same exceptions; so, of all the objections moved by such, who, in the succeeding alterations of Providence, have thereby endeavoured to excuse their unstedfastnesse, the Author, of all the greatest changeling, hath here given the poorest and meanest account, scarce sufficient to give a colour to his reproach: and this leads me to notice the great pretense of this complaint, <hi>viz,</hi> that in the revolutions we have seen the <hi>Covenant</hi> hath proven so uneasie. I shall not say that, in this, the very Scriptures of Truth may also be construed an hundered fold more uneasie: But of this I am most assured, that he, who, for himself and others, pleads for a compliant liberty for all these so contrary changes that are gone over us, must not only slack the bonds of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the Command of God; but of all honesty and ingenuity among men: It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he that would be faithful, aswel as he that would live godly, must resolve to suffer persecution; the contradiction of sinners, and the crosse of Christ have alwayes been the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a foolish world: but who, through uprightnesse and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for this trouble, do attain unto the promised peace shall never be moved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:96182:28"/>As for the Authors observe, that the models &amp; productions of such devices are not usually long-lived; we judge not by such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: our establishment is, that God liveth and reigneth, &amp; our Lord is risen again &amp; alive for evermore This was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive consolation: and who knoweth but he may also make this triumphing, as he hath made many the like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to be but for a moment.</p>
               <p>But now, when my Author hath run his first carreer against the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> poor man, what is all this to <hi>Scotlands</hi> principal obligation against all manner of Episcopacie, <hi>viz.</hi> the bond of the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> entered into with so great unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, explained in such evident and certain termes, confirmed both by treaties and pacifications<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and at last by the full autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both of King, Parliament and General Assembly? Certainly this is that which never entered into his thought, his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the <hi>League</hi> doth so transport him, that there is nothing else which he seemeth to regard: and therefore he goes on, and <hi>first</hi> he insinuats an excuse for some who he sayes, <hi>in yeeldance to the power that pressed it, and in conformity to the general opinion of this Church, did take the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And no doubt his sense thereof, aswel for Popery as Prelacie, is as moderate and little schismatick as may be; sor all know him to be large as catholick (in the common exception) as Christian. But as for the obligement to preserve the Reformed Religion of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which this debate mainly respects, I believe he is the first that ever thought it capable of two senses, let be to make choise of the more moderat.</p>
               <p>But next, <hi>he sayes, he cannot clear them of a great sin, that not only framed such an ingine, but violently imposed it upon all ranks of men, not Ministers and other publick persons only, but the whole body and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next thing objected is, <hi>that droves of ignorant persons were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to they knew not what; and, to speak freely, to such a hodge podge of various concernements religious and civil, &amp;c:</hi> who would forbear a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of their being by others abused, and yet I am bold to affirm, that he himself bewrayes as crasse ignorance, in this passage, as is to be found in any among the droves he mentions, and (according to the same proportion) an imposing upon the beliefe of others superlatively presumptuous: And for proving of this, I only ask him, is not every soul bound by the Law of God to maintain his King, his Countrey, and his Neighbours rights, prerogatives, and privileges? Who can deny it? But is he therefore bound to know them all, or to contend for them? Who seeth not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous vanity, if not blasphemy, of such an emptie <hi>dilemma.</hi> To be clear therefore and distinct in this matter; to the conviction of the very stiffest Opponent, I say.</p>
               <p>1. That an oath, binding simply to particulars of meer fact, doth no doubt require, to the effect it may be sworne in Truth, Righteousnesse, and Iudgement, that the taker both know the things sworne to, and be perswaded that they are true and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: thus he who ingageth by oath to certain specifick privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges agreed unto, is, no doubt, in conscience first obliged to know both their nature and qualitie, else can not satisfie the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned command.</p>
               <p>2. On the other hand, if an oath do bind not to matters of meer fact, but to a certain duty, either generally or special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed, and in such a manner as clearly intimateth the antecedent rule, whereby it is determined, then this Oath being thus safely cautioned, and in effect only an accessory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, exciting and intending former obligations, but no wayes extending them beyond their limits, the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the duty in general is sufficient, without any further knowledge, to fit the person to bind his soul by such an Oath: for example, he who knoweth no more then the general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteousnesse may no doubt lawfully sweare to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all righteousnesse, although for the time he do not so much as know its common astract precepts, let be the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concret deeds that may thereon depend: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because, in effect, such an oath doth, in the first place,

bind to endeavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ain particulars, but yet only binding to their observance, under the notion, and in the supposition that they are righteous, although because of the condescendence it doth no doubt prerequire knowledge; yet righteousnesse being its determining and regulating object, it alloweth upon a better discoverie, not only a rectification of the same particulars without perjury, but also an extension of the Oath to such things, which, being for the time unknown, do afterward fall within its rule and line: thus, if, upon a particular occasion, I swear to my neighbour to maintain his rights, as it doth indeed bind, in the first place, to the definite defence of these which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oath, yet so as to admit of an alteration in any thing that shall be afterward found not to be righteous, and consequently no right; so no doubt, as to all his supervenient rights, though afterward only coming to my knowledge, the same Oath doth very justly extend its obligation.</p>
               <p>4. As the foregoing rules do abundantly explain the matter of this Oath, with what measure of knowledge it both supposeth and importeth; so the limitation and restriction, to the ingagers place and calling, doth make it in such sort accessory to the former duties incumbent to him, that, in effect both as to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and performance whereto it binds, it rather intends then ampliats their predetermined obligation. I might have added, in this place, that every affirmative Oath, whether particular or general, doth undoubtedly, in the first place and most obviously, bind <hi>nega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ivè</hi>; that is, that the person swearing shall do nothing contrary to, nor obstruct that whereunto he is positively bound. But this is a thing in it self so evident, that though it may be of use in the explication in hand; yet I conceive it sufficient to have observed its omission.</p>
               <p>And furder, both for illustration and application, I shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no other examples then the things objected. And <hi>first,</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

the mention here made of things religious and civill, which, no doubt, may be very consistently both commanded and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto together, the swearing of the people to Church - disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and government is instanced. But if Christ hath in his Church appointed both, and if all Christians be bound to maintain them, as they are thereto called, I am very certain, that to oblige them in their place and calling thereto by oath cannot be disproven. But it may be said, that by the <hi>Covenant</hi> the people became obliged to a particular species of government, of which, in probability, they could not know all the parts, let be to know their warrant. 'Tis answered, the corruptions of Episcopacie having had such an universally grievous influence upon all ranks, and these, with the opposite true form of Presbytery, having been so expresly and plainly laid open and abjured, in the year. 1637. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>8. And 1639. as the people ought in duty to have had a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in these matters; so it is very assured, that their knowledge therein was abundantly clear and distinct, as the very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remains of it to this day do evince.</p>
               <p>The second instance is made of the <hi>privileges of Parliament, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the subject, and condign punishment of Malignants.</hi> But seing the Kings authority, to the defence whereof the <hi>Covenant</hi> doth also bind', doth undoubtedly include all the righteous prerogatives of the Crown, which ar as far, if not more, removed from the knowledge of the common people, then the other heads menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, wherefore were they omitted in the condescendence? Is it not because the duty of allegeance binding unto the same things, and whereunto certainly all may lawfully swear, is in effect, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the same exception? 2. Although this Oath, in order to privileges and liberties, be not meerly indefinit, binding to righteous privileges and liberties in general, to which no doubt every on may lawfully swear; but also assertory of such privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and liberties, as were at that time by the arbitrarie course of adversaries more especially drawn in question; yet were these privileges then not only upon the same occasion generally known, as concerning, in effect, the very being of Parliaments,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96182:31"/>
and just freedom of men; but in such manner ingaged unto, under the notion of <hi>righteous,</hi> &amp; what the limitation of the ingagers <hi>place and calling,</hi> that it is most manifest, that this Article of the <hi>Covenant</hi> hath both righteousnesse, for its formall &amp; regulating object, and also that it neither supposeth nor obligeth any man to more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then either <hi>de facto</hi> he had before, or is obliged to have by the antecedent duty of his particular vocation: So that the import of this part of the <hi>Covenant</hi> being plainly the same, with that either of our allegeance to the King, or of every citizen to the corporation whereof he is a member, <hi>viz,</hi> that we all maintain and preserve the prerogatives &amp; rights, which in our station we know or ought to know to be such, and to be righteously such, the absurdity here endeavoured to be fastned upon the Covenant, as tying either to know simply, or to contend blindfold, is but an empty pitiful vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 3. As to that of the <hi>condign punishment of Malignants,</hi> it is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly explicable by the same rule: for the men so termed, having, by their mischief, made themselves but too well known, and we being tyed to the discoverie, only as righteous, &amp; in our place &amp; calling, it is as little possible to taxe this or any other the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of excesse for its generality, as an Oath to performe all righteousnesse, wherein, no doubt, all these things are included, &amp; which, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which grounds adduced, with what might be further her alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the mutual Covenants both of men &amp; nations, wherein they lawfully ingage both offensively &amp; defensively to maintain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rights, without so much as the necessity of a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie thereinto for the time, do, without all peradventure, most convincingly redargue these weak quiblings bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96182:31"/>
Can not these thing lye easily enough together in an Oath, which yet are all comprehended in the Law of God? Are the Churches true Government, the righteous privileges of Parliaments and liberties of the Subject, and the duty of endeavouring in our place and calling that evill do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or is it because that our Author hath, by confounding and trampling upon all these things, and betraying at this time the Churches government unto the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, as formerly under the Usurpers, he little regarded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Subjects liberty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or can he assigne us a better reason for his assertion.</p>
               <p>He sayes, <hi>It is hard enough for the wisest and learnedest to draw the just lines of these things, and to give plain definitions of them.</hi> But will it therefore follow, that none but such have any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in, or obligation to them: No, this were in effect an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence no lesse, nay more absurd, then to alledge that none are bound, or may swear to maintain his Majesties authority, but such as can draw the just lines of all his prerogatives; or rather that none are obliged to defend his person, but such as can draw his picture to the life. It is therefore certain, that, as all men have undoubtedly an interest more or lesse remote in these matters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so they either really have, or ought to have, a knowledge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their ingagement thereto, to which an Oath for confirmation is most properly accessory.</p>
               <p>The Author add's that <hi>These things are as far from the reach of poor Country Peoples understan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing, as from the true interest of their souls.</hi> And O how desirable is it, that this, the one thing necessary, were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96182:32"/>
indeed the speciall and main care of all men; but to offer to confine poor Peoples knowledge and obligations to their souls interest alone, with an aime so palpable to have all other things aband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to lust and tyranny, according to the great design of these adversaries, against which this <hi>Covenant</hi> was ingaged in, savours more of hypocrisie then true spirituality: And therefore I say. 1. that the true Discipline and Government of Gods House are in themselves, and have been experimented to be, of such important influence, as to the promoving the great work and ends of the Gospel, the great concern of Gods glory, and wherein no doubt the interest of all souls is involved, that whatever may be in this pretense of abstraction and self- confinement; yet he must needs be of a very <hi>Gallio</hi> - temper that careth for none of these things. 2. Although privileges and liberties, and the punishment of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants have no such direct tendencie; yet I am not only assured that, in the then juncture of affaires, their defence was of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subservience to the preservation and reformation of Religion principally covenanted; but that of themselves, and as to the main of their import, they are so much within the reach of the sense, let be the knowledge, of the meanest of men, that to take them off from their concernment therein, and ingagement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by the insinuation of their souls true interest, will be judged by all ingenuous persons a very cunning and deceitful imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.</p>
               <p>Now from the premises that we have heard, the Author concludes in these terms, <hi>So that to ty them</hi> viz. <hi>the common people) by a religious &amp; sacred Oath, either to know all these, or to contend for them blindfold without knowing them, can there be instanced a greater oppression &amp; tyranny over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science then this? &amp;c.</hi> But seeing it is most certain, that the Oath doth neither tye to know all these, nor yet to contend for them blindfold; but, being entered into from the universal feeling of all ranks of the invasions made and threatned both against Religion and Libertie, did, according to the nature of all such assertory and accessory Covenants, only bind every on in his place and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sutably to that measure of knowledge, which he either
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96182:32"/>
had, or ought to have, of such general and important concerns to stand to their defence against the common enemie; the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and insolence of this inference doth in deep astonishment only prompt me to say, the Lord rebuke the O Adversarie, The Lord, who hath chosen this poor Church, rebuke thee; Is not the small remnant of the faithful as a brand pluckt out of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e fire?</p>
               <p>But behold how he wipes his mouth; <hi>Certainly</hi> (sayes he) <hi>they who now govern in this Church cannot be charged with any thing near or like unto it.</hi> No? All pious, holy, tender souls. But seing I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the calumny, the subject of the comparison I will not recriminat; yet we must hear a little of the mens praise, <hi>viz. That whatever they require of Intrants, they neither require subscriptions nor Oaths of Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s already entered, far lesse of the whole People.</hi> But 1. Seing there can be no solid distinguishing reason given for this practice, we must conclude Policy to be the only motive of this pretended moderation. 2. The Oath, with the <hi>Act</hi> 1612. prescribed to be taken of Intrants, is so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely chargeable with a laxe dubious and insnaring gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, that, I am certain, all the light and knowledge, to be found in the most of these who conform to it, will not prevent the Authors being confounded with his own argument. I shall not tell you that therein they sweare to the Supremacy, an infinite mysterie of iniquitie; But the point wherein this Oath is really peccant, in all the foul reproaches, wherewith the <hi>Covenant</hi> is falsly loaded, is, that thereby they are bound to defend all Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Privileges, Preheminencies, and Authorities grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and belonging to his Highnesse, or united to his Royal Crown: Whereby it is clear that they are not only obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ged <hi>positivè</hi> to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Priviledges and Prerogatives granted and belonging to the King, without the destinction of righteous or unrighteous; but also without any restriction to their place &amp; callings. Now (not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the Authours impertinencies, as if this Oath did tye all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trants either to know all these things, or to contend for them, blindfold without knowing them) whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her this be lawful &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96182:33"/>
&amp; whether the common People be more knowing in their own Liberties and their representatives Privileges, or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers in his Majesties sublime prerogatives and extensive Iurisdictions, I leave it to every impartial discerner. But 3. What strange hodge podge indeed do we find in this ingagement! all things spiritual, ecclesiastick, and temporal confounded in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, is not enough; but the poor Intrant must further abjure all forreign Powers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urisdictions, swear to defend all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Authorities and Privileges, acknowledge upon Oath, that he holds the Church and his possession of it (if of the King's presentation) <hi>under God, of his Majestie,</hi> doing homage unto the King (and not unto God) for the same (if at the presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another) <hi>under God, by the King, of the Patron thereof:</hi> And lastly swear obedience to his Ordinarie in all lawful things, even his Majesties authority, though just now so fully recognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not excepted. Is not this an odde medly to be hudled up in a sacred oath? Whereof whether every Article therein be more impertinent for an Intrant Minister of the Gospel, or in it self more obscure and indistinct, really I can not define?</p>
               <p>But the Author goes on and tells us that <hi>It were ingenuously done to take some notice of any point of moderation, or any thing else commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable even in our enemies, and not to take any partie in the World for the absolute Standart and unfailing rule of truth and righteousnesse in all things.</hi> And so it were indeed; but I freely appeal to all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous men, if ever they heard ingenuitie exhorted to, by two such disingenuous insinuations. As <hi>first,</hi> to recommend the moderation of a partie, who, after that they themselves had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously broken their <hi>Covenant</hi> both to God and their Brethren, did in such manner instigat the Powers to rigours, exclusions, and persecutions, against all who in conscience did only refuse to owne and countenance their wicked Apostasy, as had almost ruined a great part of the Kingdom and did at length wearie the very Actors. And <hi>next</hi> to give out as if we were so implicitly wedded to our partie, whereof the least Argument or vestige hath not been made appeare, no nor is so much as alledged, but

labours so much by his extenuation to cloak the Apostasy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he and others have rebelled against God, broken the Covenant and changed the Ordinances, would yet seriously consider, that God will not thus be mocked. I grant there may be cases, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may sufficiently acquit ourselves by a free declaring of our opinion, and a modest desiring and waiting for a redresse, and so continuing in the performance of our own duty, though others do, or seem to transgresse theirs.</hi> But as it were ridiculous, to make this a <hi>salvo</hi> for all cases, and, in effect, it doth only hold, where our silence at another's trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression by breaking that command, <hi>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy brother and not suffer sin upon him,</hi> may strengthen the sinners hand, and scandalize others; So, I have already proven, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation here made of our deserting of our duty, to be such an absurd calumny, and the compliance required of us such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest partaking in other mens sins, that I wonder at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's disingenuity and weaknesse, in attacquing us by such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
               <p>What can be then said to what he subjoines, <hi>viz. Otherwise if we think our selves obliged for every thing that is, or that we judge, faulty in other persons, or the frame of things in the Church, to relinquish either our communion with, or our station in it, what will there be but endlesse swarms of separation and division in any Church under the sun.</hi> Surely this, as to us, must be a very pertinent and convincing reflection; seing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

state and phrase the difference of present practice, from that of the ancient Church; But on the contrary, I have often and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that the sin attending the compliance urged is the plain cause and measure of our withdrawing: Yet that our abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the present Church-meetings, so widely differing from these of the ancient Church, and invironed with circumstances no lesse variant, doth not give ground to so much as that seeming opposition in practice, which the Author objects; But on the contrary, is the very same, which all the faithful therein would have chosen, upon the like exigence, I am confident, all true and serious observers will very readily acknowledge; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that this the Authors <hi>one and last word,</hi> notwithstanding of the enforcing epithets of undeniable and very considerable, wherewith he seconds it, is neverthelesse nothing singular from all the rest premised.</p>
               <p>Having thus largely digressed in the review of these Papers, and therein discussed most of the arguments used for this <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi>; it remains that I follow forth the second Article, where I left: And though, for the better reaching of the outmost of our Adversaries pretensions, I have supposed Prelacy to be thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a simple Presidency, and, in this sense, argued against it; yet since it is certain, that the nomination and election of the <hi>Episcopus Praeses,</hi> who when present is to preside, and when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, doth, at best, only permit a precarious suffection, is not to be committed to the Presbyteries suffrage, but absolutely reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his Majesty; and, next, that the general of, <hi>all Church-affaires,</hi> and what may be meant by <hi>management,</hi> whether the decision only, when proposed to the Assembly, or both the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and deciding, do seem to require a further explication. I think the Article is further liable to these exceptions.

a clear explanation, whether the power and liberty of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing be aswel offered in this Article to the free vote of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as the power of deciding seems thereby to be conceded; or whether, according to the scheme of our National Synod, as now setled by Authority of Parliament, the power of proposing is not still to be the privilege of the constant moderator<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I shall not criticize, nor ask how the proposal came to be set down in these terms, <hi>That all Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires shall he managed</hi> in <hi>Presbyteries &amp; Synods by their free vote, rather then thus, that they shall be managed</hi> by <hi>Presbyteries &amp; Synods &amp; their free vote.</hi> Onely this I may affirme, that the second member of my doubt is no lesse probable, &amp; consonant to the tenor and prescript of the <hi>Act</hi> mentioned, then evidently elusory of all the other liberties proposed.

                  </gap> The thing here principally to be observed is, that as, by the present establishment, annexing Church power and jurisdiction, to the Kings Crown and Prerogative, and thereby subverting all true Church-government, and making the pretended Presbyteries and Synods only the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is with this second article, and all the offer of liberty therein held out, plainly inconsistent: for proof whereof, I only desire that the two may be impartially compared. The Article sayes, <hi>that all Church-affaires shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in Presbyteries or Synods by their free vote.</hi> And the <hi>Act</hi> of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy statutes <hi>that his Magesty may enact, concerning all meetings and matters Ecclesiastick, what in his Royal misdome he shall think fit.</hi> How then can these two consist? or in what manner can they be reconciled? If these Meetings and the power of the Supremacy were both of the same kinde, and did stand in the same line, I know the subordination of Synods and Presbyteries to General Assemblies might easily explain the difficulty, but seing a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96182:45"/>
would, in effect, distroy their true being and essence; and, on the other hand, to imagine that by this <hi>Accommodation,</hi> there is any derogation of the Supremacy intended so much as to be connived at, were foolish and presumtuous. It is clear that the Supremacy, and the liberty here pretended cannot rationally be composed; if therefore the Accommodators would deal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in this affair, let them <hi>first</hi> shew us where these Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods are, to which they would have us to come, and <hi>next</hi> cause us to understand the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But while they suppose things for uncontroverted grounds, which are warrantably and plainly by us denied, and then would ingage us by a form of specious concessions, wanting al real foundation, they only discover their own palpable weaknesse or more unpardonnable disingenuity.</p>
               <p>The third Article bears, <hi>If any difference fall out in the diocesian Synods betwixt any of the members thereof it shall be lawful to appeal to a Provincial or their Committy.</hi> That this Provincial is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, and overswayed by the Supremacy; and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The singularites that here occurre are, that the constitution of a Provincial Assem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That this provincial is to have a Committie which being yet very unlawfully esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for a perpetual Court, can only conduce to the greater strengthening of the Archbishop's primacy, and the oversway of the subjected Assemblies: But seing the Bishop, in his last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, hath passed from this Article, I shall not pursue it any

further; only the gradation here traced of Presbyteries, Synods, and Provincial Assemblies moveth me to enquire, wherefore no mention of National Assemblies, a Court not only the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in that scale, but so distinctly defined by a particular <hi>Act,</hi> viz. <hi>Act</hi> 4. 1663. in its Members, methods of procedor, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of power, that I cannot judge its omission accidental and undesigned; nay in effect it is a reserve which doth so unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably secure the whole interests and designs of Prelacy, and so evidently redargue all the proposals made of a trepanning mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that as I seriously marvel, how the Accommodators, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ultimate resort, so strongly complicated of all the strength of the Supremacy and Prelacy, did not extend their other concessions to all things else that could be demurred; so I am no lesse to seek, wherefore the Brethren, who treated, did except so little against it. I need not here exhibite any long description of this Court, which I have several times above mentioned: The <hi>Act</hi> is full and plain to the meanest capacity: The King, in the very entry, assumes to himself not the indiction only (Which was all that, after long contendings, the more consistent usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of former times did by the <hi>Act</hi> 1612. ascribe unto him) but the constitution of this National Synod, whereby having named and appointed the members and the Archbishop of <hi>S.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, with the advice of the Estates, confirmeth the same, as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful constitution of our Church-assemblies, provided that the King or his Commissioner be alwayes present, and that no <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And lastly, that no Act, matter or cause be debated, consulted, and concluded, but what shall be allowed and confirmed by his Majesty or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96182:46"/>
for the time. Now, I say, this Act and Constitution still standing &amp; remaining, let any ingenuous person declare sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what he thinketh all the proposals so long tinckled upon can signify, or what liberty have the dissenting Presbyterian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which may not hereby be restrained and rendered ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual? And what abatement is there condescended unto of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant powers of Prelacy, which is not here either formally or virtually repaired? And, in a word, what good can we expect by any Accommodation, which may not by this frame be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly frustrat and made void. I have not, in this place, noted the strange and palpable usurpations of the Supremacie against the Lord, and over his Church, which this device and project con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From all which it may very easily be gathered that the Bishop's policy, in his silence on this point, was no lesse necessary for the carrying on of his intention, then the reservation of the thing the very <hi>colluvies</hi> of all corruption of Church-government<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth Article is, <hi>that Intrants being lawfully presented by the Patron and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tipend or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Intrants (all other things being plain) should stand off and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96182:46"/>
may not lawfully enter that way; No, though patronages be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in themselves a heavy grievance, and in their exercise, for the most part, partial and sinful, and upon these grounds, by an expresse <hi>Act</hi> in the year 1649. abolished; yet to Intrants other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise innocent they are certainly only the greatest injurie. But the thing I except, is, 1. That according to this proposal it seems Ministers formerly lawfully called and ordained, and now wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully outed, shall have no regresse to the exercise of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, save by this method, which certainly in these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can not but render the pressure far more uneasy. 2. What shall become of Patronages pertaining to Bishops, and of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are of their patrimony? Certainly this is a point not so far without our line, but at least in a conjunction with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things that justly grieve us it may make a part of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grete.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to take notice of the manner of Ordination here discribed, and passing the trial previously appointed, It is propos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>there shall be a day agreed upon by the Bishop and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>esbytery for their meeting together, for the solemn ordination of Intrants</hi>: By which it is evident, that it is not the vote of the plurality, that in this matter, can make a determination; no, the Bishop and Presbytery must both agree to this appointment, the whole Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cannot overrule him in it. And here I cannot but observe the cunning slieness of this draught. The Bishop in all his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and treaties hath still, in this point of Ordination, kept himself in the clouds; To assume to himself the sole power of Ordination or a negative voice and part in it is more then all his musty alledgeances, from obscure antiquity, and declining pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for his fixed presidency, will amount unto; and to descend to posterior Ages of the Church, would be of a consequence no lesse dangerous, as to the many corruptions that then were crept in, then the ascending to the prior times of scripture light would prove contrary to this prelatick arrogance. On the other hand, seing both the humor and design of Episcopacy ingage him to be principal in the action of Ordination, therein to be subject to the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96182:47"/>
determination of the susfrage of the Presbytery, is nothing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and can not be digested. And what variety in his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses this halting ambiguity hath produced, I leave it to such as have had the opportunity to observe: But now that we have him in write, it is worth our pains to consider the contrivance.</p>
               <p>We have heard, in the second Article, that he is willing that <hi>Chnrch-matters be managed in Presbyteries and Synods by the vote of the plurality,</hi> a fair insinuation that the matter of Ordination shall be in the same manner transacted: And in this Article he leaves the trial to the Presbytery, consents that, if possible, the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be at the parish Church, where one shall be appointed to preach, and, lastly, is content differences falling in be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Superior Courts; all fair generals. But wherefore no mention who shall be the actual ordainers, whether the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop and whole Presbytery, or the Bishop alone in behalfe and as Mederator of the Presbytery, or the Bishop alone as indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater (whether as in a superior order, or only in a higher degree is but a School nicety) then either a Presbyter, or the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, &amp; to whose office this part doth properly belong? And, as to these things, though we be left in the dark, yet many pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable indications lead us to feel this last to be the thing designed, against which, if I might now stand to debate, I could show this not only to be contrary to Evangelick parity and simplicity and Apostolick practice, and destitute even of these pretended testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the next Ages for a fixed <hi>prostasia</hi>; but that it hath been one of the main impostures of the prelatick Spirit, first injuriously to usurpe, and then mysteriously to involve the matter of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that the Bishops might have the dignity to be its proper dispensators and the mystery of iniquity be the more thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
               <p>But the point here most remakable is, that apprehending his condescendencies might render him, as being obnoxious to the plurality of voices, of lesse power and influence in this affair, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how craftily he goeth about to salve his <hi>negative,</hi> which he may not, for fear of a discovery, plainly owne, and that is, by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96182:47"/>
making the appointment of the day for ordaining to depend on his and the Presbyteries joynt agreement, wherein if he please to be a dissenter, It is certain that his not assenting to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will be of no lesse consequence for his purpose, then if he had reserved unto himself an inhibiting <hi>veto,</hi> upon the substance of the whole businesse.</p>
               <p>Now, that this power, in what sort soever by him couched and covered, is not to be allowed, his want of any sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it doth aboundantly evince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And further what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Apostolick rule in this affair is, these few considerations may in this place satisfie.</p>
               <p>1. That the power of Ordinantion is certainly annexed to, &amp; dependent upon, the pastoral charge; for, seing that the cure committed to the Apostles, and by them to succeeding Pastors, could not be perpetuat without a succession, the evident reason of the thing it self, with the import of that command, <hi>The things that thou hast heard of me, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also,</hi> do plainly perswade the assertion.</p>
               <p>2. As we find in Scripture the Apostles and others upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by themselves alone ordaining, so whereever a concurrence did offer, we may observe the Act to be alwayes joyntly done and administrat; so we find the twelve joyntly ordaining and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands upon the seven Deacons, without any preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acclaimed by <hi>Peter,</hi> who yet, if falshoods may be compared, hath more apparent grounds in Scripture for his Primacy, then can be shewed for the Presidency of any Bishop. Next we have the fraternity of Prophets and Teachers at <hi>Antioch</hi> sending forth and imposing hands upou <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> by a like equall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>3. It is said of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> that they (in a plural union) Did ordain Elders in every Church</p>
               <p>And 4. it is manifest that <hi>Paul,</hi> by reason of his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with other Presbyters in the Ordination of <hi>Timothie,</hi> doth attribut the same act indifferently to his own hands and, to the hands of the Presbytery. Which Scripture-grounds

I shall not here offend the Reader by a vain repetition; but seing the grounds formerly laid down are very material, and yet by the most part little adverted to, it will not be amisse that, after the full and plain account I have given of these matters, I again run over them; and</p>
               <p n="1">1. That according to the principles of truth, Presbyteries are not

founded in any humane establishment, but in the right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which our Lord hath given unto his Church, is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant perswasion: so that, though the accessory confirmation and countenance of the powers may be of great use to, and no lesse acceptance with the Church, yet it is no part of their original right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before the 1638. and even until the Year 1661. Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were founded and did continue in this Church, not by vertue of any <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arliament,</hi> whereby they were properly authorized; but upon the <hi>basis</hi> of that intrinseck right, which I have already mentioned. Thus having conveened and settled themselves shortly after the Reformation, they continued their possession un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted until the Year 1661. It is true, they obtained the confirmation of King and Parliament in the Year 1592. as also in the Year 1612. many corruptions introduced, and invasions made by the Prelats upon the rights and privileges of these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. All that can be probably gathered from what is promised, is, that possibly to some such apparent mixture of Episcopacy and Presbytery, now to be formed, as did result from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nction may be interposed: But since now the case is vastly altered, and that in effect, at present, there is not so much as any kinde of true Ecclesiastick-government or meeting to be found among the Prelats and their Dependents; nay, that all we are to expect is some hodge podge device of Supremacy accommodat to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and directly and absolutely subjected to its pretended om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, it is clear and certain, that this mistaken project can aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd us no clearing: If any man judge me uncharitable, how glad would I be to be found really in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he wrong? But seing it is evident, that the Supremacy is rather more and more ascendent, and that there is not the least probability either of its mitigation, or of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96182:49"/>
rescission of the <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Restitution,</hi> &amp;c. Anno 1662. and yet far lesse the retreating of the Proclamation <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1662. dissolving Presbyteries, and of their, and their true members reestablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all requisite to give the Lord Commissioner's offer (if any such was made) a genuine and satisfactory meaning, why should we preserve an illusive charity to plain and solid ingenuity.</p>
               <p>But if any man will still contend, the comparing together of the first and second part of this Article, I am certain, will prove sufficient to convince the most inflexible opiniaster. In the first part, <hi>It is not doubted, but the King's Commissioner will make good his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, viz.</hi> to set up Presbyteries as before 1638 In the second, <hi>it is hoped, that he will procure due security to the Brethren in the free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their judgment.</hi> But if true Presbyteries be rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored this security is clearly superfluous; and if they shall not be restored in that integrity, but by vertue of the Supremacy, on which they depend, reduced to the figure of the then model, by authorizing the above mentioned mixture, it is evident, that in place of resolution, we have only an arbitrary politick alteration, a compliance wherewith no declaration &amp; protestation can in any wise purge, as I have already fully proven: And this is indeed one of the reasons, why I termed the Bishops trust ridiculous. But yet I confesse there are other causes that do more provoke me to this character, the one is, that it should be imagined, that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours will give an antecedent licence to transgresse lawes, which neverthelesse in all probability they have not the least intention to repeal; the other is, that the Bishop should suppose that a testimony, requisite upon the account of duty, may be either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born or suspended, for want of an assured immunity; whereas it is most certain, that whereever faithfulnesse to God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our appearance, though in the things that are least, the fear of man, that bringeth a snare, is not to be regarded, much lesse to be therewith ballanced. I acknowledge indeed, that the faint and pusillanimous dealing of some of the Brethren, who conferred, in making this their scruple, seems to have drawn from the Bishop this insinuat sollution, and I should verily have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96182:49"/>
taken it for a scornful indulgence, if he had not to his hope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the promise of his humble and earnest intercession. But seing it is to be by all regreted, &amp; we hope shall be by the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themselves bitterly mourned for, that being in so just and so good a cause not only called, but in effect openly provoked and bafled to give an answere whith reasons, to the demand made unto them, they did not so sanctify the Lord God in their hearts, and with their tongues, as to shew a readinesse thereto with meeknesse and fear, let be to give a testimony for God in such an important exigence, it is evident that this pitiful caveat with the promise annexed are at best but the effects of a carnal conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendence unto a sinful fear. If the Lord call for our confession, who ever heard that that, which is its special grace, even the obvious apprehension of hazard, should be its hinderance? Nay, who is man in that case of whom we should be afraid? But and if the Lord require it not, this is certainly a foolish antidote to a vain solicitude.</p>
               <p>And thus we are arrived at the sixth &amp; last Article, <hi>That no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant shall be ingaged to any canonical oath, or subscription unto the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop; and that his opinion anent tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> government shall not prejudge him in this, but it shall be free for him to declare.</hi> And this is truly the only fair condescendence that of them all hath any thing of a just ease; But seing it is very inadequat to the main difficulty, and for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent liberty of opinion doth certainly tend, according to the late morality of these times, to involve us in many sinful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent practices, I shall not further urge it.</p>
               <p>And now having finished the examination of these six Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, &amp; therein, amongst many other empty pretensions, and inextricable ambiguities, rencountered a most cunning &amp; vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous invective against the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> consisting of the like number, as if it were a meer politick complication of doubts and snares, for the more clear redargution of the Authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and malice, I cannot but desire my Reader, imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to consider both, and what, and with what successe boht of us have objected, and, I am confident, that though an al most
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96182:50"/>
infinite over proportion of matter for importance, aswel as variety, the greatest diversity of humors, interests, opinions, nay and almost of Nations, that ever concurred in one treaty, with the no lesse disproportion of parts and abilities in us, the two Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, do every way increase and accumulat the disadvantages on my part; yet it will appeare, that such is the power and vertue of a righteous cause that where in the attacquing the Covenant the Authour hath carried back nothing but his own shame and our scorne, the truth, not I, hath, on the other side, dissipated and routed his Articles with an entire victory, which if he or any man account vain, or a preposterous triumph, it is only truths confidence, and I do hereby confirm it with a no lesse resolute defiance.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have examined this overture of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> according to its terms contained in the above-written Articles. As for the exceptions that may be made against it from its contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, tendency, and circumstances, the inconveniencies that would ensue upon it, and other more remote arguments, they are so easily deduceable from the preceeding grounds, that it were superfluous to prosecute them by any more distinct proposal. That we may therefore, once for all, review and summe up the manifold and manifest evils of this device, not more conceited and boasted of by its contrivers, the Servants of men, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly rejected by all the true Ministers of our Lord Iesus Christ: Notwithstanding of all the specious pretexts and fair smoothings that have been adhibite for triming up this <hi>Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> to an alluring and taking condescendence; yet, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that who ever seriously ponders what hath been said upon it, will be quickly convinced that the difficulties following do still remain as invincible impediments to all conscientious men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That a conjunction with and in the present Church meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is a certain acknowledgment of, and participation with the present Ecclesiastick-government, which in effect is not truly such, but a meer politick constitution wholly dependent upon,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96182:50"/>
and resolving in the Supremacy, wherein no faithful Minister can take part,</p>
               <p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly,</hi> That this conjunction doth evidently infer a consent and submission to this Supremacy, as arrant an usurpation upon the Kingdom of Iesus Christ in and over his Church, as ever did dare the King of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings, and Lord of Lords in any age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That though this consent could not be objected, yet such is the present elevation of this all-swaying Prerogative, not intended to be depressed, that all other conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssions, though in themselves satisfying, would thereby be deprived of any consistent assurance; and rendered wholly elusory. And really, when I reflect upon these particulars, I cannot forbear to ask, with what conscience can Ministers rather partake in Church-meetings framed by, and under the power of the Supremacy, then if the Bishops were therein still to domineer after the rate of the highest Prelacy? Or what delusion can be more ridiculous, then that men excepting against meetings, because of the Bishops usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, should upon the vacating and reassuming of this power by the King as Supreme, be thereby entised unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as these meetings are founded upon, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely subjected unto the Supremacy; so the often cited <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itution</hi> tell us, that they are authorized and ordered by the Archbishop and Bishop; and consequently do in such manner derive their Authority from them, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do only act therein as the Bishops their Delegates, or rather as the subdelegates of his Majesties Delegates, a strange accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of absurdities, which, I am certain, this constitution standing, cannot be salved by any overture whatsomever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The meetings, whereunto we are invited, do consist of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch members for their perjurious intrusion, and canonical ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude (to say nothing of their more extrinseck delinquencies of profanity, insufficiency, and irreligion) as may not only war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a non-conjunction, but a positive separation. And certainly if the lower degree of these crimes, in the time of the former Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which observation, I must confesse, is to me so obvious, that it hath been alwayes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no lesse perswasion, that if the Bishop did not judge our consciences as peevish and fickle, as he asteemeth the matters in difference frivolous and empty trifles, he would not have this risced his own reputation, in all the business and stir he hath made about such a nothing of condescendence.

               </opener>
               <p>in the late Conference I had with your Friend, the sum of what I said was this.</p>
               <p>1. That Episcopal-Government, managed in conjunction with Presbyters in Presbyteries and Synods, is not contrary either to the rule of Scripture, or the example of the primitive Church, but most agreeable to both.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, it is not contrary to that very Covenant, which is pretended by so many as the maine, if not the only reason of their scrupling: And for their sakes it is necessary to adde this. For notwithstanding the many irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities both in the matter and forme of that Covenant, and the illegal and violent wayes of pressing and prosecuting of it, yet to them who remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conscience of its full force and obligation, and in that seem invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly perswaded, it is certainly most pertinent, if it be true, to declare the consistence of the present Government even with that obligation. And as both these assertions, I believe upon the exactest (if impartial and impas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionat) inquirie, will be found to be in themselves true; so they are own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the generality of the Presbyterians in <hi>England</hi>; as themselves have published their opinion in print under this Title, <hi>Two Papers of proposals hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie presented to his Majestie by the Reverend Ministers of the Presbyterian perswasion, Printed at</hi> London <hi>Anno</hi> 1661. Besides other passages in these Papers to the same purpose, Page 11, and 12. are these words, <hi>And as these are our general ends and motives, so we are induced to insist upon the form of a Synodical Government, conjunct with a fixed Presidency or Episcopacy, for these reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. We have reason to believe that no other termes will be so generally agreed on, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. It being agreeable to the Scripture &amp; primitive Government, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest to be the way of a more universal concord, if ever the Churches on Earth arrive to such a blessing; However it will be most acceptable to God, and well informed Consciences.</q>.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. It will promote the practice of Discipline &amp; Godliness without disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and promote order without hindering Discipline and Godliness.</q>

                  <q>4. And it is not to be silenced (though in some respect we are loath to menton it) that it will save the Nation from the violation of their solemn vow and Covenant, without wronging the Church at all, or breaking any other Oath, &amp;c. And a little after they add, that the Prelacie disclaimed in that <hi>Covenant,</hi> was the ingrossing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>That they understand it not to be against all Episcopacy, but only against the particular frame, as it is worded in the Article it selfe: For our principal model in <hi>England,</hi> and the way of managing of it, whatsoever is amisse (and it can be no wrong to make that supposition concerning any Church on Earth) or whatsoever they apprehend to be amisse, though it may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mistake, the Brethren that are dissatisfied, had possiblely better acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their dutie by free admonitions and significations of their own sense in all things, then by leaving of their station, which is the one thing that hath made the breach (I fear) very hard to cure, and in humane appearance near to incureable: But there is much charity due to them, as following the dictat of their own Conscience; And they owe, and, I hope, pay the same back again to these that do the same in another way; &amp; whatsoever may be the readiest &amp; happiest way of reuniting those that are mutually so minded, the Lord reveal it to them in due time.</q>  This one word I shall add, That this difference should arise to so great a hight, may seem somewhat strange to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That this is utterly untrue, I thus demonstrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>VVhen that</hi> Covenant <hi>was presented to the Assemblie with the bare name of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy joyned to Poperie, many grave and reverend Divines desired that the word</hi> Prelacie <hi>might be explained, because it was not all Episcopacie they were against, and thereupon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96182:55"/>
the following concatenation in the Parenthesis was given by way of explication in these words.</hi> That is Church - Government by Arch - Bishops, Bishops, there Chancellors <hi>and</hi> Commissaries, Deans <hi>and</hi> Chapters, Arch - Deans, <hi>and all the other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that Hyerarchie. By which it appears, that it was only the</hi> English <hi>Hierarchie, or frame that vvas covenanted against, and that which vvas then existent, that vvas taken dovvn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>VVhen the House of Lords took the</hi> Covenant, Mr Thomas Coleman, <hi>that gave it them, did so explain it, and professe that it vvas not their intent to Covenant against all Episcopacy, and upon this explication it vvas taken; and certainly the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament vvas most capable of giving the due sense of it, because it vvas they that did impose it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>And it could not be all Episcopacy that vvas excluded, because, a Parochial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy vvas at the same time used and approved commonly here in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>And in</hi> Scotland <hi>they had used the help of visiters for the Reformation of their Churches, committing the care of a Countrey, or Circuit to some one man, vvhich vvas as high a sort of Episcopacy, at least as any I am pleading for. Besides that they had Moderators in all their Synods, vvhich vvere temporarie Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>Also the chief Divines o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the late Assemblie at</hi> Westminster, <hi>that recommended that</hi> Covenant <hi>to the Nations, have professed there ovvn judgements for such a moderat Episcopacy as I am here defending, and therefore never intended the exclusion of this by Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he adds, <hi>As vve have Prelacie to bevvar of, so vve have the contrarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to avoid, and the Churches peace (if it may be) to procure; And as we must not take down the Ministry, least it prepare men for Episcopacie; so neither must we be against any profitable exercise of the Ministrie, or desireable order amongst them for fear of introducing Prelacy.</hi> Thus far <hi>Baxter's</hi> own words.</p>
               <p>There is another that hath write a Treatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> on purpose, &amp; that zealous &amp; strict enough, touching the obligation of the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> under the name of <hi>Theophilus Timorcus.</hi> And yet therein it is expresly asserted, that <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at first, it might appear, that the Parliament had renounced all Episcopacy, yet upon exacter inquirie, is was evident to the Author, that, that very scruple was made by some members in Parliament, and resolved (with the consent of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in</hi> Scotland) <hi>that the Covenant was only intended against Prelacie, as then it was in being in</hi> England, <hi>leaving a latitude for Episcopacy, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be noted, that when that <hi>Covenant</hi> was framed, there was no Episcopacie at all in being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> only; so that the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of that frame only could then be meant and intended. Likewise it would be considered, that though there is in <hi>Scotland</hi> at present the name of <hi>Dean,</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Commissaries,</hi> yet that none of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ose at all do exerce any part of the Discipline under that name, neither any other as Chancellor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96182:56"/>
or Surrogat &amp;c. by delegation from Bishops, with a total exclusion of the community of Presbyters from all power and share in it, which is the great point of difference betwixt that model and this with us, and imports so much as to the main of Discipline. I do not deny, that the generalitie of the People, yea even of Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they took the <hi>Covenant</hi> might likewise understand that Article, as against all Episcopacy whatsoever, even the most moderat, especially if it should be restored under the expresse name of Bishops and Archbishops, never considering how different the nature, and model, and way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> exercising it may be, though under the same names, and that the due regulating of the thing is much more to be regarded, then either the retaining or altering of the name. But though they did not then consider any such thing, yet certainly it concernes them now to consider it, when it is represented to them, that not only the words of the Oath it selfe do very genuinly consist with such a qualified &amp; distinctive sense, but that the very Composers or Impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers of it, or a considerable part of them, did so understand and intend it. And unless they make it appear, that the Episcopacy novv in question vvith us in <hi>Scotland</hi> is either contrarie to the vvord, or to that mitigated sense of their ovvn Oath, it vvould seem more suitable to Christian charitie &amp; moderation, rather to yeeld to it as tolerable, at least, then to continue so inflexibly fast to their first mistakes and excessive zeal, as for love of it to divide from their Church, and break the bond of peace.</p>
               <p>It may likevvise be granted, that some learned men in <hi>England,</hi> vvho refused to take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> did possiblie except against that Article of it, as signifying the total renounciation and abolition of all Episcopacie; And seeing that vvas the real event and consequent of it, aud they having many other strong and vveightie reasons for refusing it, it is no vvonder that they vvere little curious to enquire vvhat past amongst the contrivers of it, and vvhat distinction or different senses either the vvords of that Article might admit, or those contrivers might intend by them. And the truth is, that besides many other evils, the iniquitie and unhappiness of such <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> lies much in this, that, being commonly framed by persons that, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And vvhatsoever may be said for their excuse in whole or in part, who, in yeeldance to the power that press'd it, and the general opinion of this Church at that time, did take that <hi>Covenant</hi> in the most moderate &amp; least schismatical sense that the termes can admit; yet I know not what can be said to clear them of a very great sin, that not only fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med such an engine, but violently imposed it upon all rankes of men, not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters &amp; other publick persons only, but the whole bodie &amp; community of the People, thereby ingaging such droves of poor ignorant persons, to they know not what, &amp;, to speak freely, to such a hodge podge of various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, Religious and Civil, as Church-Discipline and Government, the Priviledges of Parliament and Liberties of Subjects, &amp; condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Malignants, things hard enough for the wisest and learnedest to draw the just lines of, and to give plain definitions and decisions of them, &amp; therefore certainly as far off from the reach of poor countrey Peoples under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as from the true interest of their souls; &amp; yet to tye them by a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and sacred Oath either to know all these, or to contend for them blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold without knowing them, can there be instanced a greater oppression and tyrannie over Consciences then this?

somewhat allayed by this consideration, that this very form of Government, which is so hateful to them, is by the Presbyterians of the Neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome accounted a thing, not only tolerable, but desireable: And I might add, that, upon due enquiry, the reformed Churches abroad will be found in a great part much of the same opinion; Yea, I am not affrayed to say yet further, that I think there is good reason to believe, that it were not only Lawfull for these that now governe in this Church but, if prejudice hindered not, might prove expedient and useful for the good of the Church it self, that they did use in some instances a little more authoritie nor they do, and yet might still be very far off from proud and tyrannical domination, never applying their power to obstruct what is good, but to advance it, and not at all against the truth, but alwayes for it, and while they do so, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme and profanness that abounds cannot reasonablie be imputed to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Government, as too commonly it is by some, but rather to the schisme that is made by withdrawing and dividing from it: For there is not a greater enemie in the World to the power of Religion then the wranglings and bitter contentions that are caused about the external formes of it. <gap reason="foreign">

Oh when shall the loud and harsh noises of our debates be turned to the sweeter sound of united prayers for this blessed peace, that we might cry with one heart and voice to the God of peace, who alone can give it, <hi>Pacem te poscimus omnes</hi>: and if we be real supplicants for it, we would bewar of being the disappointers of our own desires, and of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the blessing we pray for, and therefore would mainly study a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per receptive of it, and that is great meekness and charitie, and certainly whatsoever partie or opinion we follow in this matter, the badge by which we must be known to be followers of Iesus Christ is this, that we love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that law unquestionably is of divine right, and therefore would not be broken by bitter passion and revilings, and rooted hatreds one against another for things about which the right is in dispute betwixt us; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, are we Christians?

            <head>An APPENDIX In Answer to a Narrative of the Issue of the Treaty anent Accommodation.</head>
            <p>SInce the finishing of these sheets, I have seen a narrative of the last passage a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d issue of this Treatie for Accommodation, which again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth me to take my pen. And in this Discourse, the Author (and 'tis like one of the two, whom I have already rencountered) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising the Articles that we have heard, exhibiteth the words, and manner of the Brethrens refusal to close therewith, and then resumeth the Accommodators their Arguments, concluding with a short additional reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon both our <hi>Covenants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the first part, touching the Brethrens refusal and their declining to give in their reasons, or to debate the matter without an express command, I do neither contradict nor apologize. Only of this I am assured, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever influence, the manifold transgressions and mightie sins of the present times, the intractableness of adversaries, or the hopeless self-conceit of the party with whom they dealt, might have had upon their prudence to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; yet neither can a cause, so righteous and evident, be there throw justly prejudged, nor will the duty of a testimony, for God and his Truth in so cleare on exigent, be thereby satisfied.</p>
            <p>The Arguments by the Author resumed, are little or nothing different from these, that I have already discussed, and when I come to re-examine them, I shall take them rather as they shall fall in then as they lye.</p>
            <p>But seeing that both the strain of this Paper, and certain other grounds of conjecture, do probably in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he diversity of the fixed <hi>Praeses,</hi> and ambulatory Moderator, doth mainly stand. For clearing of which position, it may be considered,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96182:59"/>
that seeing the distinction of right and dominion, from a precarious use, doth mostlie arise from, and it is valued by the certain continuance of the former, consequent to the nature of the thing, which in the later, subject to anothers arbitrarie interruption, is not to be found; how in the case of this Presidencie, <hi>fixedness,</hi> doth superinduce a kind of proprietie, to which the changeable Moderator can lay no claime, is very easy to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He who by a permissive benevolence doth only enjoy for an uncertain sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may nevertheless have a very full and plenary use; but that this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment is obnoxious to anothers pleasure, whereas that of right, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject remaining, can only be terminat by the owners consent or deed, is the great disparitie, whereby not only these titles are in themselves distinguished, but from which, the power of a free disposal, peculiar to right, doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie flow. Whence it may be further collected, that as the free civil abuse (so to speak) as well as the use, is founded in, and warranted by the nature of right, and the independencie from the will of any other, which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; so the fixedness of any power or office, doth certainlie in so far, nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly capacitat the person therein stated, to a more free and incontrollable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.

               </gap>o the former, which unto the second, for this very cause, they make incompetent, is not for one to dip further into, then may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce for the illustration of common reason. Only, as he vvho is elected to an ordinary office of fixed Presidencie <hi>ad vitam,</hi> may well and truly be said, to be <hi>jure suo Praeses,</hi> whereas the other, who is thereto chosen by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re, during pleasure, and no longer, doth by the same rule <hi>alieno tantum beneficio praesidere</hi>; so, that this <hi>fixedness,</hi> imported by the <hi>jus suum,</hi> arising from the investiture of the office, doth considerably advance the <hi>Episcopus Praeses,</hi> and discriminat him from a Moderator, nominat only during pleasure, and absolutly depending upon the <hi>beneplacitum</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have hitherto for avoiding confusion, opposed to the fixed <hi>Praeses</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator appointed simplie during pleasure, if any man think that this doth not so exactlie quadrat to our custome, where by our moderators were chosen, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is answered, it is not the simple omission, or adjection of a certain space, that is to be regarded in this matter, a person may be commissionat, not only ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

force to restrain the granters revocation; but the true point of the difference, doth plainly stand in this, that the office of presidency once being declared to be fixed, and so made a right of its own nature, not oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rwise terminable, then with the <hi>Praeses</hi> his life, as his continuance therein, is from the nature of his right, and cannot be understood to flow meerly from the electors their free pleasure, like to the case of a trust committed by simple mandat; so he is no more obnoxious to their revocation, then any other person, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a grant from a community of an ordinary superior office during his life, can be turned out of it, at the granters arbitrement; whereas, on the other hand, there being no such constant office established, the person called sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to officiat, whether indefinitly or for a set time, attaineth to no right, but the same remaineth entirely with the meeting electing, and he is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly subjected to their determination. By which also it further appears, and may conduce for the better uptaking of this distinction, that as in this second case, the right abides with the presbyterie, and the naked exercise of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is intrusted to the person thereto appointed; so in the former, the erecting of this presidency, unto an ordinary fixed office, is without ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a manifest derogation from, and abridgment of, the Presbyteries an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent priviledge, so that in summe, it may be certainly and evidently concluded, that as the erecting of a superior office, by a perpetual constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby retrinching the constituents their original power, and making to the person therewith invested, a proper right, notwithstanding that the actual nomination and election of persons to that office, may still remain with them, doth clearly and exceedingly diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, from a commission given by way of mandat (though for the exercise of the same employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) whether indefinitly, or for a certain space, neither diminishing the mandators their inherent power, nor granting to the person commissionat, any certain right; so the offices of the constant <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If it be further objected, That I seeme to forget, that even the fixed, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> is not accountable, but may be removed upon his delinquency, and that <hi>ad vitam,</hi> which doth much impare the difference here assigned, I shall not, in answering, divert my Reader to the doubt, whether this <hi>Praeses</hi> may be removed from his presidency upon peculiar and lesser faults, not inferring a remove from his ministry, or whether, according to the perpetual custome in this case, these deprivations are not to be divided, which certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth much to the <hi>Praeses</hi> his establishment. But seeing the common &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inction of an appointment <hi>ad vitam</hi> or <hi>culpam,</hi> or only, <hi>durante beneplacito,</hi> doth sufficiently insinuat the solution, it is obvious, that though

an ordinary office given <hi>ad vitam,</hi> may according to the evident rules of right and reason (which do in no case permit the same to be absolute, or exempt it from all control) be takan away, upon a just ground of forfeiture, duely, tryed and proven; yet the disparity of a commission, given meerly <hi>ad beneplacitum,</hi> and revocable at pleasure, without so much as the necessity of alledging a reason, is abundantly manifest, and plainly establisheth the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tinction now in agitation; and in a word, to be removeable from a trust <hi>ad libitum,</hi> and deposible from a right only, <hi>pro culpa,</hi> are so sensibly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the objection doth not deserve any further answer. Only, that the influence thereof upon practice, or upon the right or wrong manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affaires, may be the better apprehended, it would be considered, that almost in every trust and employment, let be in this which we treat of, there are, below that excess of malversation, which can be charged and proven to be a fault to conclude a removel, a great many inferior degrees of mal-administration, which though by reason of their quality, they do not amount to a just cause of rejection, yet may nevertheless be of singular pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>judice, and just as a free election doth deliberat upon proper and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, so may these smaller transgressions, very rationally require a charge, without meriting deposition. Whence it easily follows, that beside the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Presbyteries power and priviledge, this fixed <hi>Proestos,</hi> doth also impose upon them, an inconvenient restriction of their just liberty of change, which in many cases may prove singularly prejudicial.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I observe, That as the fixed <hi>Praeses</hi> is constitute, not by an arbitrary mandat, but by a proper right, resulting from the erection of the office, in the manner that I have described; so the office it self, consisting in a priority of direction and conduct, it certainly thereunto addeth a peculiar dignity. I say the office consisting in a priority of direction; for that there are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient offices, such as that of a <hi>Clark</hi> or <hi>Recorder,</hi> which may be fixed, and enjoyned by a proper right, and have also the general esteem of praise wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy employments, and yet do not intitle to any eminency, is sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and its difficultie removed out of my way, by the simple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal. But the thing here rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ked, and wherein the difference of the <hi>Proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos</hi> and Presbyerian Moderator is further apparent, is, that the former hath by vertue of his right of presidencie a concomitant special honour above his Brethren, which cannot be denied to him, without a gross s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rauldrie. The temporary Moderator is indeed attended by an agreable respect; but as he is vested with no proper right to the place, wherein he simplie officiats, by the Assemblies free nomination, and as its instrument and mouth, which during pleasure, it chooseth for the more orderlie management of its affaires; so the estimation and honor that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96182:61"/>
the employment, is of no higher degree, and equally transient; whereas the fixed <hi>Praeses,</hi> being rather set up to be a head for Governing the assembly and its actions, must of necessitie on this account, be adorned with a more high and permanent dignitie.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that it is an easie matter to represent the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Praeses</hi> in as diminishing characters, and by saying, that he simplie officiats, at least enters unto the office by the free vote of the meeting, and as its mouth, and not its head, by them thereto elected for time of life, to resolve all the difference of the two, and this eminencie of respect appropriat to the fixed, unto the bare specialitie of the distinct period set to his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and no doubt words are easily turned; but as it must be acknowledged, that these things, <hi>viz.</hi> for one to be set, though by a free suffrage, in a place formed and erected in an ordinarie office, with its known special powers and priviledges, and to pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, seeing he doth injoy his place <hi>jure suo,</hi> (as Lawyers speak) and doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouslie hang <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or the continuance of its exercise, upon the Presbyteries free and simple goodwil, as our changeable Moderators do, he cannot in this respect be said to be only an instrument for order, dignified with no higher esteem, but is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now from these things thus explained, the differences of the fixed <hi>Praeses</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the former imports an ordinary setled office, including a proper right, and power to the person thereto appointed; whereas the later doth only imply a bare exercise, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dependent upon the Presbyteries pleasure. 2. That the setting up of the first, doth derogat from the Presbyteries right, by transferring it upon him; whereas after the nomination of the second, the Presbyteries right remaineth still entire, and neither is, nor can be impaired by the intrusting of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Member with its meer actual exercise. 3. The fixed <hi>Praeses</hi> deprives the Presbytery of a great measure of their libertie, he being exempted from their arbitrarie control and power of changing; whereas our Moderator is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together obnoxious to their determination. 4. The fixed <hi>Praeses</hi> is created by a deed convoying a right; whereas our Moderator is made by simple man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, imparting nothing, save a precarious trust. 5.

The <hi>Praeses</hi> his right and power and Superioritie, do necessarilie attribute unto him a special eminency of dignity; whereas our Moderator, his naked ministerial exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, cannot pretend to any higher respect. And 7.

And 1. It is the Moderators part, to propose matters to be considered. 2. To direct consultations. 3. To mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate debates. 4. To interrogat opinions. 5. To ask the votes. 6.

wish that the true value of their influence, may be as gravely pondered in the present question for guarding against any exorbitant power, whereby in these spiritual Courts and matters, they have often, been and may be still very dangerously abused and depraved, as we see men in their worldly concerns seriouslie attent to the things not only of the like, but of a far inferior consequence.</p>

            <p>And in answer thereto, I distinctly affirme, that the place and office of a fixed <hi>Praeses,</hi> or constant Moderator, is unwarrantable, and positivelie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.

            <p>I say then, for a distinct answer. 1. That the paritie by us pleaded, is not indeed to be concluded from any of our Lords holy injunctions of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, humilitie and meekness; to insinuat the tontrarie to be our assertion, is not only a plain calumnie, seeing all men know, that the highest as vvell as the lovvest of men, constitute in lavvful degrees, are liable to these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that kind, and thereby surrender one of our main arguments; in as much, as it is rather from the intimation it contains of the Apostles their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then from any precept of humilitie that may be thence inferred, that it strongly concludeth my position.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although the command, <hi>It shall not be so among you,</hi> doth not prohibit the different orders and degrees of Church-officers, whether extraordinarie or ordinarie of our Lords appointment, which both manifest reason, and the genuine import of the antithesis do plainly evince; yet that all that superior eminencie and coactive authoritie, whereby the Princes, and great ones of the earth, are properlie from others distinguished, is here removed from Church administrations, and Lordlie Prelacie, with all its priviledges and dignities, thereby discharged, is obvious to the meanest capacity.</p>

I say, resulting meerly from a greater eminencie &amp;c. For that Apostles &amp; Evangelists, in respect of their extraordinarie qualities and employments, and Pastors and ruling Elders, in respect of their different charges, are stated in a kind of imparitie, is not at all controverted; but the question being plainly concerning the lawfulness of an imparitie not from any special power, trust or gift given by our Lord, but from an higher place and dignitie, having no other foundation, then a greater measure, and larger interest in the Government con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erred by man, upon the person therewith vested, I affirme, that not only among officers of the same kind and order, but among all Church-officers whatsoever, this is an imparitie of rule, in ecclesiastick persons, as litle countenanced by the superioritie of Pastors over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And really when I consider, that notwithstanding the different orders of offices, which Christ hath ordained in the Church, he hath nevertheless most expresly stated his Apostles, and in their persons all succeeding Pastors, in an exact equalitie, and clearly discharged all pretensions, to any sort of majoritie, or preference among them, and that even our adversaries themselves, do not maintai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus Praeses,</hi> by any claim of succession to these superior officers, at first by our Lord institute, I do not only wonder, to find my Author in this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so foolishly and rawly confounding the imparitie of place and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, in one and the same order, by us from Gods word rejected, with the imparitie of orders by the Lord established, but am fully of the opinion, that the more eminent degree of a fixed President is yet more unreasonable, then the distin &amp; order of superior prelats, although in the seeming acknowledgment of our very adversaries, destitute of all satisfying pretenses.</p>
            <p>For asmuch then as our Lord, had very clearly and positively comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the paritie of his Apostles, and in them, of all his Ministers, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to be <hi>Brethren,</hi> in direct opposition to that pharisaick pride, which might have tempted them to the like affectation, and further, doth adduce his own bles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That which doth next occurre, is two objections in the Authors second and seventh consideration. The one, <hi>That the fixed presidency of Bishops in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, hath as much warrand as the fixed moderating of a Presbyter, in a Kirk-session of ruling Elders</hi>; The other, <hi>That it can as little be quarreled, for want of an express command in Scripture, as Kirk-sessions, Presbyteries, Synods and National assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,

               </gap>t thing asserted by the Author, is, <hi>that if the thing it self be lawful, the appropriating of the name of Bishop, to the superior Presbyter, cannot make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, though these two names be indifferently used in the scripture,</hi> Thus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor loves to quible. We say, that not only these two names, are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie used in Scripture, but that they are used as signifying one and the same thing, without the least insinuation of a more proper application, either of the one or the other, to any thing distinct; &amp; thence do strongly inferre, that after-times did verie unwarrantably and contrarie to Scripture-grounds, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide both the things and names: And this our Author, doth very lightly turn over, as if all the question anent a divine warrant for the identity or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Bishops and Presbyter were only a plea of words; and whether the names of Bishop and Presbyter, in Scripture commonlie and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couslie used, might lawfully afterwards be severally appropriat, without the least notice taken, that in Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he adds for a reason, <hi>that the names are in the same manner used in some primitive writers, who in other passages do clearly owne the different degree of Bishops over Presbyters, and vvere themselves of that degree.</hi> What then? A man may indeed hence conclude, that in the times succeeding the purest, with the distinction introduced of a superior Bishop over a Presbyter, the names, beside th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this conservation, as if vve judged, that a grave and solemn admission, to a high and holy employment, were apt to unhallow it; no, this alledgeance doth too groslie and caloumniouslie beg the question. But seeing it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Author will as soon prove gain to be godliness, as he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally perswade that this high employment is holy, it is evident, that his grave and solemn admission, is as little apt to hallow it, or to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per instrument of making it better, as the consecration of the high places was of old, when they were commanded to be destroyed, in it self allovvable, or unto the Lord acceptable.</p>
            <p>The next thing we meet with is, <hi>That the degree or power of Bishops, beyond other Presbyters, is certainly, not to be so fitly measured by any other rule, as by the receaved practice of the primitive Church, and canons of the most ancient Councels.</hi> Very right; why should not their origen and warrant, and the measure and rule of their power go together? But seeing we have found this primitive practice, to be dislonant from, and contrarie to the truth and simplicitie of the Gospel, the first and chief rule, the Author must pardon us, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to disown both his rule and measures, and to hold us to this only uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring canon; yet seeing he hath been pleased in his deep ingenuity to acquaint us with that, wherein we account our selves but little concerned, it will not be amiss, that for our warning we take particular notice of the discoverie: He adds then, <hi>That by the forementioned practice and canons, it will undoubtedly be found that they had not only some such particular power</hi> (as what, I know not) but <hi>exortem &amp; eminen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ration, or rather the special ordination, which he hath just now asserted, he deals a great deal more plainly, and tels us, not only in general of such a measure of power, as may be gathered from primitive practice, and ancient canons, which certainlie may be as large, as the most favourable conjecture, from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable pretence of either of these within the first three or four centuries of the declination of the primeve puritie, pleaseth to form it; but that by these same rules, beside a certain particular povver, vvhich he doth not specifie, they should have <hi>potestatem exortem &amp; eminentem,</hi> and this no doubt, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous enough construction of the frequent hyperbolies used by the fathers on this subject, may arise as high as either ambition or interest shall please to to scrue it. This being then the ambiguous and laxe comprehension of the Author's measures, vvhat hath been the sinceritie of this Treatie, or vvhat might have been the issue of an assenting close to it, I suppose it may be obvious to everie mans reason.

            <p>But the Author addes for a <hi>salvo</hi> to these just feares, that the foregoing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage may suggest, <hi>that if the Spirit of our meek and lowly master, did more possess the minds both of Bishops and Presbyters, there would certainly be little or no dispute, but the sweet contest of striving who should yeeld most, and give most honor the one to the other.</hi> Thus we find him alwayes a high pretender to Gospel rules, when they seem to make for his advantage: If he once attain to the possession of what either his phansie or interest do recommend to him, then, according to the strain of the former letters, how full is he of the high elogies of peace, &amp; of earnest longings after it; how hateful &amp; odious is contention &amp; hatred, nay, it is the main antichristian character; and in the same manner now that he is for Episcopacie &amp; its eminencie, how sweetly would he seem to commend the spirit of our meek &amp; lowly Master. But seeing it is without all controversy, that if this spirit were indeed prevalent, not only our disputs &amp; contests about thir matters would cease, but the very subject o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 9 and last consideration, which the Author offers, is anent the great and known moderation of all the late Reformers, the present reformed Churches, and of the presbyterian breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he love to plead with such arguments, let him produce me any one of all these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Societies or Parties which he musters up, that after having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the evill and bitter fruits of episcopacy, and searched after its origen and warrant, unto a clear conviction of its want of divine institution, and full discovery of the delusion of its rise, and the wickedness of its tendencie, did in a manner unanimouslly, both by law, canon and oath abrogat and reforme from it: and when by the politick influence of Court designes and State projects, and the practices of the Devil and his instruments, the same episcopacy was restored seven times worse then of before, and so with a most plenary confirmation of all these grievances, formerly objected against it, did in the most pure and conspicuous zeal of God, that ever acted in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reject this corrupt plant, and bind themselves to maintain the true Ordinance of God, introduced in its place, and extirpat every thing thereto opposit, by a most solemn Covenant; and in consequence thereof, enjoy the Gospel in very observable povver and plenty, untill that by as gross perjury and violence, as ever the Sun beheld, this Covenant is again condemned, the Lords work and Ordinance sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subverted, and this old Episcopacy, not only with a sevenfold, but with a seventie and sevenfold encrease of all its corruptions and wickednesses re-es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished; and lastly the Supremacie, the complement of all Ecclesiastical usurpations, with an explication broader then all the pretensions of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, is superadded. For the better securing of all which abominations, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full proof made of all that abused authority and power could do against a faithful non-conforming remnant, policy at length doth instruct to propose an Accommodation, upon termes, seemingly indeed condescending, but really corroborative of the present establishment, and most visibly suppressive of any reliques of dissent, or opposition, which possibly might revive against it. Now let the Author, I say, produce us an instance of any Church or Society, thus circumstantiat, &amp; if not only, the faithful remnant therein, but the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all the serious fearers of God, and true lovers of our Lord Iesus, shall not give their suffrage on our side, nay the case being thus proposed, as in

truth it stands, if even these, to whom he appeals, do not clearly declare for us, then let us beare the scorn of singularitie, and what worse he shall please to cast upon us forever.</p>
            <p>But lest the Author imagine, that vvhat I have here represented, vvith an especial regard to the strengthening of the Lords People in this Land, to vvhom none of these things are hidden or unknovvn, doth rather proceed from an apprehension of a cross verdict upon the simple question of the fixed Presidencie, from the Persons and Churches to vvhom he referres, I grant, that amongst the Reformers, and in those Churches mentioned, there may be found good men, vvho, not being led by the concernment of their own condition unto a more near and strict examination of the thing, and rather comparing its appearing moderation with the exorbitancies of Prelacy, then reducing matters to their first institution, have written of it more indulgently and respectfully: But as it hath not been the experimented and trying ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of any Christian Church, as it hath been of ours, and as the Authors that seeme to favour it, do all of them agree, that it is not of divine institution, but do unanimously recomend it upon that account; so I am confident, that if the examples of the same Reformers and Churches, in occurrences of less importance, may found a probable conjecture, it may very fairly thence be concluded, that if they had been, or were now stated in the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances with us, they would as far exceed us in this faint and languishing zeal, whereof we are accused, as by the Author we are now construed to exceed them. With what truth, reason or civility then the Author is pleased, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dull affectations of his oraculous wit, to tell the World, that there is no reason can be given of this our zeal, unless that word of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Philosopher, <hi>Superstitio est error insanus,</hi> it is no hard matter to judge: But if he account it superstition for us, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In vvhich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, though the Author do judge us to be beside our selves, yet vve are ascertained, that not only all the faithful, that have any conscience in these things, but also all ingenuous men, will answer for us, that Sir, we are not mad, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</p>
            <p>It remains, that I consider the Author's additional reflection upon our two <hi>Covenants.</hi> And as to what he prefaces, of his having sufficiently cleared,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96182:68"/>
that the Article of the League touching prelacie, as it is there specified, doth not at all concern the Episcopacy in que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But here he insinuats, that of late he is informed, <hi>That we now flie to the other Article of the</hi> Covenant, <hi>ingaging us to maintain the Discipline and Government of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>as it was then in being, and hereupon he wishes, that we would impartially consider, wether the present Episcopacy be inconsistent with that Discipline &amp; Government, or if it will not rather be found to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is not here objected, that by swearing to maintain the then established Discipline and Government, we did not virtually renounce, and abjure the present controverted Episcopacie; no, both the Reformation that had then so recently preceeded, and the Reformation that hath since so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly overturned it, do make this point too evident to be denied by the Author, or any pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nding to common sense. But the summe of what is here proposed is, that we were not well advised in that our Oath, as having thereby excluded a special mean for the preservation of that which we mostly intended. In return whereunto, I need not say, that every inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not an just exception to make void an Oath; the Authors own incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration in this very allegeance is too manifest, to reduce us to that strait. He saith in effect, <hi>That the present Episcopacy is not inconsistent with Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And is it not a lamentable thing, that thir Churches and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should have been so long in so fatal a distraction, meerly for want of such a happie discoverie; nay that the very vexed Bishops, should not for their own peace, have been so wise, as still to bear with and maintain a thing nothing repugnant to their pretensions? But to be a little more serious, I say true Presbyterian-government doth not admit, amongst the Lords Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, of any stated imparity, either in power, prerogative or presidency, one, or all of which is the very form of the controver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Episcopacie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are (what all men hitherto constantly deemed them to be) utterly inconsistent. But the Author sayes, <hi>That Episcopacy by preserving union, is perfective of Presbyterie.</hi> And I grant that any lawful mean preserving Union, is indeed perfective of this, as of all other Government: But seeing that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie is not only not at all a mean subservient to Presbyterie or its Union, what ever it may be to Government, or its Union in general, but is also in it self unwarrantable and unlawful, and in effect as to Union, never found to be otherwise more conducible then Presbyterie, but either by the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or tyrannous suppressing of truth and the love thereof, by which the right
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96182:69"/>
side of all contentions are maintained, I can scarce refrain from censuring the Authors fore going observe, as pitifully groundless. It is true, our Presbyterie did not retain union as it was desired; but what then? If our corruptions and sins do either frustrat the efficacy, or avert the blessing of the best of meanes, is therefore the mean it self to be condemned? Or if where the Lord hath left no choise, a mean shall be devised by man more promising in appearance, as to that wherein the mean ordained hath not, through our fault, been so succesful, and withall, if this invention shall be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re pernicious consequences, ought we either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or prudence, to shufle out the former, to make place for the later? Certainlie as these things do exactly quadrat to the case of our accidental dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences here objected, so the changing of the Lords ordinance for a humane device, upon such a pretence, is liker to <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> policie, who for the establishment and quiet of his Kingdome, set up his Calves in liew of the Lords Sanctuarie, then that paritie and straightness of heavenlie wisdome, which the Lord requires. I might here adde, that the want of the Lords blessing, and the parties their greater power, and, for the most part, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pride, being duely cousidered, the <hi>Oligarchik</hi> model of the Author's Episcopoacie, seemes to be far more obnoxious to the objected divisions, then the lowly and equall Presbyterie, that our Lord hath institute: And that <hi>de facto,</hi> there is nothing in that state whereunto we can referre their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, except unto the over-awe either o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Authour ads, <hi>And again they would consider, that if the substance be salved in the present model, their obligation is abundantly preserved.</hi> 'Tis Ans. Seeing the thing to be principally attended, both in the interpretation and observation of an Oath, is that which was chiefly intended in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raming and taking of it, and which is indeed the substance of the Oath, although of its subject ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly considered it may be only a circumstance, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istinction as here applied appeares to be more captious then pertinent. Novv that the thing chieflie intended in that article, to preserve the Discipline and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as then in being, was to preserve Presbyterie from the reinvasion of all these corruptious, from which it had been before so latelie vindicat and reformed; and that of these corruptious, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted presidencie or constant Moderatorship was one, and that the very first, is so certain and notour, that I cannot but marvel at the Authors so perverse disputings in the contrarie. But he sayes, <hi>If no chip nor circumstance of the then Presbyterian government might be altered even to the better, then is the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96182:69"/>
next part of the Article anent uniformity, according to the word of God, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the best reformed Churches, illusorie, and a perfect cheat, in as much as though the same rule should in order to uniformity call for an alteration, yet there could be no receeding from the then frame of the Church of Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Author according to his accustomed deceit, when he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to an alteration, notwithstanding that he and his associats, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly intend and prosecut it with all the might and craft that they can adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, yet for to delude us to a compliance, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icketh not, by insinuating the things in controversie to be but chips and circumstances, flatly to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and condemne the violence of their own practices. But, seeing that I have alreadie proven from cleare Scripture &amp; undeniable reason, that this constant presidency, in steed of being a <hi>chip</hi> or <hi>circumstance,</hi> is in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to that paritie which our Lorth hath commanded, and wherein true Presbyterie is essentially founded, and therefore was by us ejected, and the discipline and Government, sworn to be preserved in the Covenant, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in its place, 'tis evident that all here excepted by the Author is but a meer cavillation. In answer whereunto, it may well be affirmed, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aires vvith the Covenant as with the Truth it self; no such redargution of all calumnies objected as by its own evidence.

               </gap>t in the confidence of the truth wherein it was bottomed, and that it might appeare to the world, how little we were either addicted to any thing as our own, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abuse and impose upon their distress, we agreed to Covenant to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96182:70"/>
endeavours of their reformation, not precisely according to our example, though vve vere fully persvvaded of its divine vvarrant, but according to the unerring rule of the word of God: (to which we vvere alwayes, and are still ready to submit all our ingagments and persvvasions) and the example of the best reformed Churches, the best arbiter of all exterior indifferences.</p>
            <p>Now after this cause, follows the obligation to Uniformity in these term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, <hi>And shall endeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes, to the nearest conjunction and uniformity, &amp;c.</hi> Which being the part of our Oath, whereon our Author doth at present trifle, I shall not trouble my Reader to rectifie his misrepresentation, as if it were the common work of uniformity, and not <hi>Englands</hi> particular Reformation, that were referred to the Word of God: But seeing by the obvious tenor of the whole Article, the preservation of the reformed Religion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Reformation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Word of God, are premised as midses conducing, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies certainly concentring in this conjunction wished for, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, every ingenuous man must acknowledge both the consistency of our Oath, and the vanitie of our adversaries sophistrie. And therefore it is answered.</p>
            <p>1. That suppose, the intended uniformity and conjunction did require an alteration; yet seeing the disconformity of either part, maketh place for it, &amp; even perfection it self &amp; imperfection, by reason of their disconformity, are capable of such a designe, the necessity of an alteration to be made on both parts cannot be thence inferred. So that the Author's conclusion, from the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terableness of <hi>Scotlands</hi> frame, <hi>that the Article of uniformity is illusorie, and in plain terms a perfect cheat,</hi> is pitifully claudicant, and unworthy of both his judgment and gravity.</p>
            <p>2. Although that the things Covenanted to be preserved in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as being very acuratly tried and convincingly found to be agreable to the word of God, are in effect both from their vvarrant, and our Oath unalterable; yet, seeing that by reason of our sublunary state, there are several exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumstances attending the worship, aswell as the discipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, neither positively determined by the vvord of God, nor comprehended in this our Oath for preservation; that in these, there is a latitude on all parts left to the improvement of providence, and gratification of charitie, for the more easie and happie obtaining of the uniformitie Covenanted, is in itself evident, and the very subject and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of this last clause, as to any thing which may be thereby impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over &amp; above what the preceeding parts of the article do contain. But,</p>
            <p>3. The palpabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fallacie of the Author's objection, is, that he falsely supposeth, not only that the word of God may in order to uniformitie call
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96182:70"/>
for an alteration in <hi>Scotlands</hi> frame covenanted to be preserved, but that even the swearers of this oath did thereto referre, as not being fully ascertained and ultimatly determined as to the congruitie of that very establishment which in the same article they sweare to mantain: whereas, it is manifest from the tenor of the article and all other circumstances, that as we in <hi>Scotland</hi> were assuredly perswaded, that the things whereunto we had attained, and which we sweare to preserve, were according to the word of God, and <hi>England</hi> also by concurring with us in the same ingagement did thereunto as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; so it was in the same common perswasion, that we engadged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>Englands</hi> reformation according to the same rule, and did, in the holding and not altering of these obligations with a just accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of undetermined circumstances, jointly vow and hope for the above mentioned uniformitie.</p>
            <p>4. As the certain conformitie of <hi>Scotlands</hi> then reformation to the word of God, doth directly contradict the Authors supposition, and the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the then constitution of Government in so far as we are sworn to preserve it, is very consistent with the vowed uniformitie whereby the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors argument is utterly ruined; so we do constantly acknowledge the same word of God to be the supreme and unerring rule, whereunto we heartily submit; and therefore, if the Author can shew that this rule, either upon the account of uniformity or any other, doth require an alteration of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whereunto we are bound, it is in vain to redargue us from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded inconsistencies in the words and contexture of our Oath, seeing this is a direct and plain method by vvhich vve are most vvilling to be tryed.</p>
            <p>The Author addes, <hi>that if no hoofe or hair of the Scottish modell can be altered, though both Scripture, the example of the best reformed Churches, and the vowed uniformity should require it, then ought it in stead of according to the vvord of God, &amp;c. to be rather according to the present forme of the Church of</hi> Scotland. But 1. Waving the fraud and scorn of the Author's <hi>hoofes</hi> and <hi>haires,</hi> vvhereof it is certain, that his fixed Presidency, unless so far as it is an excrementitious superfluity, can be called none, vvhy doth the Author cavil? If the Scripture and the example of the best Reformed Churches, do require an alteration of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, let him shevv it, and there is an end. 2. I have already given a cleare account, vvherefore the ingagment in the Covenant to Reformation in <hi>England</hi> did referre to the word of God &amp;c. rather then to any particular example. 3. If upon the matter, <hi>Englands</hi> covenanted Reformation in Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline &amp; Government according to the Word of God, &amp;c. do in effect resolve in an exact conformity to our then constitution, doth it therefore follow, that this part of our Oath is either a cheat or an abuse? God forbid; the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96182:71"/>
Rule is too sacred to give ground to such a consequence: And certainly the Author's second thoughts will correct his rashness.</p>
            <p>But the Author subjoines, that how this understanding of the Rule of <hi>Englands</hi> Reformation <hi>according to the VVord of God,</hi> as certainly introductive of the then <hi>Scottish</hi> model, <hi>would have past with our English Brethren, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with these present at the framing of that Covenant, may easily be imagined.</hi> It is answered 1. The question here mainly agitat, is, neither how the <hi>Englishes</hi> understood the ingagment of the Covenant in order to their own Reformation, nor yet what may be its real import, but plainly what we stand bound to by vertue of that article, obliging us to preserve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Doctrine, Worship, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government; and that thereby we are obliged to disown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Authors Episcopacy and fixed Presidency, from which our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at that time expresly reformed, is that which I am perswaded he himself dare not seriously deny. 2. Whatever meaning interest, passion or prejudice may possibly devise, yet that the words, <hi>according to the VVord of God, &amp;c.</hi> are in themselves most plain, safe and sound cannot be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. But 3. That under this very form of words both <hi>England</hi> did give, and <hi>Scotland</hi> did obtain a sufficient as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urance for the setting up of Presbyterian Government in <hi>England</hi> as it was at that time established in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is no hard matter to explain; in as much, as not only the Word of God, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Rule, doth thereto strictlie and antecedentlie tye, as hath been made out; but whoever herevvith considered the knovvledge the <hi>Englishes</hi> had of our then constitution, the affectionat sympathie they had testified, both in our labour and victorie vvhereby it vvas attained, their frequent and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant insinuations in publict, in privat, in print and in speeches to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, their express ingaging to the preservation of our frame, their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie covenanting and concurring vvith us for the cause of God, and many other circumstances, vvill vvithout hesitation conclude, that we had as pregnant grounds of persvvasion of there being like minded with us in this matter, as could be demanded or expected by ingenuous men, from a nation at that time so unsetled and discomposed. And therefore, seeing there was nothing for several years preceeding, more clearlie and distinctlie held forth by us, then that we judged the form of Government then in being among us, to be the only Church Government agreeable to the word of God, I think we may well take the Author's suggestion, as if the <hi>Englishes</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have passed this sense and meaning of the words, <hi>according to the word of God,</hi> to be only a cunning hint, to collour a confidence which can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot be avowed. It is true, that in process of time, the love of truth and zeal of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96182:71"/>
God did much abate, &amp; error abound in that Nation; whence to many who desired a sutable licence, the just severitie of Presbyterie became uneasie and odious: but as that doth nothing convel the former arguments by me adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so it is no less true, that the sounder and better part of <hi>England,</hi> not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the present defection, do still own Presbyterian Government as by us asserted, to be the only Government that our Lord has appointed in his Church.</p>
            <p>But our Author tells us, <hi>yea, it is not unknovvn hovv careful one of the English Commissioners vvas to have that clause inserted, according to the vvord of God, and hovv secure he thought himself and his Countrey by that expression from the inroade of Scottish Presbyterie upon them notvvithstanding that former Article premised in favours of it.</hi> Well, admit this to be a truth, what then?<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> If one of them was a decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp; deceaved &amp; yet manifestly taken in his own craftiness, what is either the work or the Covenant the worse? If confident errors or treacheries be sufficient to consute the truth the Author needed not have called this witness to his assistance; but seeing it is most certain that whoever that person was, and whatever might have been his peculiar opinion, and communication or correspondence with the author in it, neither was there any such thing openly declared or treated, nor hath it the least foundation in the words under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but on the contrary is by them as manifestly confured, as the Author now is, to what he formerly professed most repugnant: the thing is scarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy this my reflection; and yet behold the conclusion, that the Author dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus,</hi> saith he, <hi>were the Contrivers of that Covenant bussied in patching it up, to outwit one another by words and clauses, hovv inco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he had premised any thing to give so much as a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to this incoherence, discordance and confusion objected; somewhat in excuse of such conclusion might be indulged to his passion and interest: But when nothing hath been alledged, except a blind conjecture of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons their different apprehensions of the soundest and plainest form of words, contrarie to the undeniable evidence of the truth it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and apostatick malice. <hi>Lord bow downe thine eare and heare, open Lord thine eyes, and see, and hear the words of this man, who hath set himself to reproach thy truth and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k, which thou hast manifestly owned; and save I beseech thee thy People out of the hands of these evill men, that all the Churches may know, that thou art the holy Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d God of truth, vvho searcheth the reines and heart.</hi> And therefore in return to this contempt and scorn, I shall only here briefly adde to what I have in the former Discourse observed to this purpose. 1. That all the forged ambiguities and inconsistencies, that either the deceit of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or perversness of open adversaries, have hith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>to laboured to fix upon the words and frame of this Oath, are not only the fate of truth, but according to its proper vertue, by the serious consideration thereof in its own light, most readily and satisfyingly salved. 2. As the Covenant was attended by a most signal power, and presence from on high; so its sincere prosecution, was constantly blessed with a very beautiful concord; and whoever divided from its genuine meaning and purpose, did quickly also abandon the reverence and regard thereof, which he once professed. 3. That not only the forsakers of the Covenant do relinquish it without repentance, and for the most part, by the irritation of their own guilt and shame, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate to irrational railing and rage: but if the revilings and persecutions of the ungodly World, be the badge of truth, the Covenant hath from the beginning been thereby very notably confirmed; and all its true followers may herein rejoice and be exceeding glade, as being by the Lord pronounced blessed. 4. That as the beautie and glorie of the work of God, were very visibly promoted both by the Covenant and its contrivers, and confusion formerly, and calamity and wasting consumption now, the certain and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest effects of mens svverving and backsliding from it: and as in that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious storme that broke off and destroyed the branches, the root of the Kingdome was by this bond made sure, until the time of our restitution wherein it made the first and most airly appearance; so the remembrance of these things, may yet be ground of hope, that the Lord will arise aud have mercy upon Zion, and in place of the Babel-confusions wherewith these Masters of confusion and rebuilders of Babilon do upbraid us, cause his work appeare unto his Servants and his glory unto their Children.</p>
            <p>In the last place, the Author saith, <hi>He heareth that some take the Romish Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie in the National Covenant, for the same with our present Episcopacy; and that by vertue of the Gloss of</hi> Glasgow <hi>which yet,</hi> he saith, <hi>doth grosly corrupt the Text: For the</hi> Romish <hi>Hierarchie is the</hi> Romish <hi>Hierarchie, and no other; nor hath any man, or assembly of men, even such as have most of the spirit in them, power to bind a sense upon the words, so different from, and opposite to their clear and genuine sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:96182:72"/>
I cannot here in the close insist on all the impertinencies hudled up in these few lines, though by the Romish hierarchie abjured in the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, there is no doubt meaned, not only <hi>Romes</hi> proper hierarchie, usurping and pretending to a domination over us: but also, all such like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Ecclesiastick government, whether in its rise, growth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation, under which it is manifest, that the controverted Episcopacy as being the first workings of that mystery, must necessarily be comprehended. Yet it was not by this clause alone of this Covenant, that this Episcopacy was conceived to be abjured amongst us; in as much, as the argument that may be gathered from it for this abjuration, is both cumulative and concludent above exception, <hi>viz.</hi> that albeit, that it doth principally relate to heads of doctrine, and the maintainance of the truth therein contrary to the errors of poperie, yet it doth also extend itself against all manner of Superstition &amp; corruption: and therefore doth not only reject the <hi>Popes</hi> worldly monarchy and wicked Hierarchie, whereby, without question, all the degrees, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions &amp; tendencies, either of worldly domination, or undue Elation of Christs Ministers over his flock, or among themselves are disclaimed; but thereby we do expressly joine our selves to the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in doctrine, faith, religion and discipline, promising and swearing by the great name of the Lord our God, that we shall continue in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and shall defend the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our vocation and power all the dayes of our lives. Under vvhich heads, especially that of Discipline, according to the usual phrase of these times, as it is vvithout controversy, that the Government then in being vvas contained; so if vve consider, that the taking and subscribing of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the year 1581. and 1590. was designedly enjoined by the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly for the confirmation of Presbiterian Government then completly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and unanimously agreed to in the year 1581. and universally setled and established in the year 1590: it is not possible, that in this matter any shadovv of scruple should remain.</p>
            <p>I might here adde for a further evidence, that when within a few years thereafrer, King <hi>Iames</hi> and his Court-faction took upon them to innovat that forme, by the introduction of Kirk-commissioners, and constant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators or fixed presidents; the faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul who opposed these courses did, as it appeares by their writings and publick protestations yet extant, very free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testify against them, as perjurious defections and breaches of the oath of God: which is an undeniable proof of the sense wherein it was taken. But the plain and obvious account of this oath, which I have already exhibit, is more then sufficient, to vindicat the consonancy and soundness of that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96182:73"/>
made by the forementioned Assembly, against the author's identick and ridiculous reasoning, to wit, <hi>that therefore the Romish hierarchy in that Oath cannot contain the present episcopacy, because</hi> forsooth, <hi>the Romish hierarchy is the Romish hierarchy,</hi> And no less ignorant and lascivient confidence, whereby he goeth about, not only impudently to decry a most certain and cleare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as <hi>gross and shameful,</hi> but impertinently to defie or mock the Spirit of the Lord, and all thereby conducted. I might in this place moreover sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joine, that admitting, for the Author's more ful redargution, that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly had lap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in their exposition; yet seeing it was materially agreeable to truth, &amp; we are thereunto bound by our sacred oath, not so much assertorie of the justness of the explanation, as positivè, renouncing the thing therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; this error in the manner, could not by any rule dissolve the force of our oath, but the certainty and lawfulness of our abjuration by this oath, both of Prelacy and Episcopacy, and all their aspyring degrees, hath been already by me so largely and evidently declared, that any addition were altogether superfluous.</p>
            <p>As for what the Author tells us in the last place, <hi>that the Presbyterian brethren in former times did not think themselves by that Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I might here adde that if Presbyterian government were offered to be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored upon its own proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
