         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>With twice five hundred Songs, and twenty Plays:</l>
               <l>The dangling Dogrel hung like Pantaloons,</l>
               <l>Set by himself to other Peoples Tunes:</l>
               <l>Before him on an Ass, extreamly odd,</l>
               <l>His own, and not <hi>Cervante</hi>'s <hi>Sancho,</hi> rode;</l>
               <l>Who threaded home-spun Proverbs at the God.</l>
               <l>The Bard had made his Bows, and Sung his Name,</l>
               <l>When, as the Devil would ha't, in <hi>Coll—r</hi> came:</l>

               <l>This peevish Race will take a World of Pains,</l>
               <l>To shew that both the <hi>Arthurs</hi> had no Brains;</l>

Like Bedlam Curs, all that they meet they bite,</l>
               <l>Make War with Wit, and worry all that write:</l>
               <l>Thus while on <hi>Shakespear</hi> one with Fury flew,</l>
               <l>T'other his Pen on well-bred <hi>Waller</hi> drew;</l>
               <l>Writ on, and vainly ventur'd to expose</l>
               <l>The noblest Verse, and most exalted Prose:</l>
               <l>To both these Bards Heav'n gave so little Grace,</l>
               <l>As of <hi>Apollo</hi> to demand the Bays.</l>
               <l>After a Pause—Bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> Silence broke,</l>
               <l>And with a Frown to both by Turns thus spoke:</l>
               <l>How durst thou, Caitiff, <hi>Shakespear</hi> to asperse,</l>
               <l>Thou wretchedst Rhymer in the Universe!</l>
               <l>The Muses Streams on thee have lost their Force,</l>
               <l>Zounds! <hi>Helicon</hi>'s a River for an Horse.</l>
               <l>And you, audacious Mortal, tell me why</l>
               <l>You dare my Fav'rite <hi>Waller</hi>'s Faults descry,</l>
               <l>And yet expose your own vile Elegy?</l>
               <l>Why d'ye in Mood and Figure play the Fool,</l>
               <l>Whilst all the Plays you write, are wrote by Rule,</l>
               <l>Confoundedly correct, and just as dull?</l>
               <l>Who would not swear, that sees <hi>Rinaldo</hi> play'd,</l>

               <l>Revere the Dead, the Living let alone,</l>
               <l>But if, in spight of me, you must write on,</l>
               <l>Leave other's Works to Criticize your own.</l>
               <l>Criticks, cried He, are most of all unfit,</l>
               <l>To fill the Peaceful Throne of awful Wit:</l>

A Tyrant Critick would my State o'return;</l>
               <l>Poesy would weep, and all the Muses mourn.</l>
               <l>Who to the Bays would make a just Pretence,</l>
               <l>Must merit 'em by his own Excellence,</l>
               <l>Not be a Wit, by others want of Sence.</l>

               <l>While with the Rake, the more to raise his Fame,</l>
               <l>The Spanish Lass, and Senior <hi>Gaya</hi> came;</l>
               <l>With many a Bold, unlicenc'd Interloper,</l>
               <l>And in the Rear march't honest <hi>Abel Rop—r.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Pin'd to his Back were Rhymes without a Name,</l>
               <l>Which oft had purchas'd him both Blows, and Fame.</l>
               <l>For whatsoe're was scandalously writ,</l>
               <l>No Author known, <hi>Tom</hi>'s Carcass paid for it:</l>
               <l>Who pray'd <hi>Apollo</hi> to reward his Lays,</l>
               <l>And to much Birch to add a little Bays,</l>
               <l>Oh Heav'ns, cry'd out <hi>Apollo,</hi> grant me patience!</l>
               <l>Must I thus still be teiz'd with damn'd Translations?</l>
               <l>An Author can't in French, or Spanish prate,</l>
               <l>But you must make the Sot speak English straight!</l>
               <l>As if within this lewd licentious Town,</l>
               <l>We'd not enow vile Authors of our own!</l>
               <l>Then told him, that he did not now Translate,</l>
               <l>As heretofore, for Glory, but to Eat:</l>
               <l>That Bards should never offer at the Bays,</l>
               <l>That often Dine but once in twice two days.</l>

               <l>When lo! a busy Bard came pressing on,</l>
               <l>And cleft the Crowd, and elbow'd every one;</l>
               <l>And that the Judge his Name might understand,</l>
               <l>He brought a Brittish Hero in each Hand,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57072:5"/>
Who with him in a Coach, their Birth-place, rode,</l>
               <l>And, being alighted, thus address'd the God:</l>
               <l>I, bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> come, said he, to sue</l>
               <l>For what the World long since allow'd my due:</l>
               <l>Gods, who no Envy have like mortal Men,</l>
               <l>May Justice do the Labours of my Pen:</l>
               <l>Nor yet by Human Pow'rs have I been slighted,</l>
               <l>For if I am not Laureated, I'm Knighted.</l>
               <l>Then, putting hand beneath the Tufted Robe,</l>
               <l>Pull'd out a hopeful Paraphrase on <hi>Iob.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Enough, replied the Deity, enough:</l>
               <l>Long since I've seen thy sad Romantick Stuff:</l>
               <l>Thy Doughty <hi>Arthurs</hi> ev'ry where are known,</l>
               <l>And have like Fame with that of <hi>Bradely</hi> won:</l>
               <l>In which thy Rhymes a constant Cadence keep,</l>
               <l>At once they make us smile, and make us sleep:</l>
               <l>And he that can in <hi>Iob</hi> six Pages view,</l>
               <l>Ought to possess your Prophet's Patience too.</l>
               <l>'Twould much disturb the <hi>Manes</hi> of the Dead,</l>
               <l>Should I misplace the Wreath upon thy Head.</l>
               <l>The injur'd Shade himself would Justice do,</l>
               <l>And Epilogue, and Prologue thee anew:</l>
               <l>Put up thy Pen, and Noble Verse give o're,</l>
               <l>Quack, and kill on, but murder me no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Stiff, as his Works, th' elab'rate <hi>Cong—ve</hi> came,</l>
               <l>Who could so soon Preferment get, and Fame.</l>

And with him brought the Product of his Pen,</l>
               <l>Miss <hi>Prue</hi> before, behind his Back stood <hi>Ben:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who quickly found the <hi>Foible</hi> of the Town,</l>
               <l>When ev'ry thing that <hi>Dogget</hi> did went down.</l>
               <l>His <hi>Double Dealer</hi> at a distance stood,</l>
               <l>At once extreamly regular, and lew'd.</l>
               <l>While in Procession by their Parent's Side</l>
               <l>March't the <hi>Old Batchelour</hi> and <hi>Mourning Bride.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then, at <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Feet his Labours laid,</l>
               <l>Thus to his Sire with good assurance said:</l>
               <l>If, bright <hi>Apollo,</hi> Young to gain renown,</l>
               <l>And please each Palate in this Ticklish Town,</l>
               <l>Has been my Talent still, and mine alone;</l>
               <l>Your Godship must the Laurel needs allow</l>
               <l>Of all your Sons, the best to suit my Brow:</l>
               <l>This Truth the Under-Graduates all confess</l>
               <l>Of both the Famous Universities.</l>
               <l>And who so fit to be great <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Heir,</l>
               <l>As he, who living did his Empire share?</l>
               <l>This said, he bow'd, and bluffishly sate down;</l>
               <l>Whilst thus the God harangu'd his hopeful Son.</l>
               <l>How can you from those Bards expect the Bays,</l>
               <l>Who him that wore 'em, could so sadly praise?</l>
               <l>Those Princes Titles justly we suspect,</l>

                  <hi>Arthur</hi> to <hi>Absolom,</hi> will be preferr'd</l>

All-pleasing <hi>Garth,</hi> to <hi>Milbourn</hi> must give place,</l>
               <l>And Med'cine leave the Throne of Wit, for Grace.</l>
               <l>E're at the Wreath you reach, all else excell:</l>
               <l>You write correct, but <hi>Southern</hi> writes as well.</l>
               <l>Avoid Bombast, still the Sublime pursue,</l>

               <l>Take Nature for your Guide; and when I see</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Just at the Word, a Brawny Bard came in,</l>
               <l>Cheerful his Look, and manly was his Mien;</l>
               <l>The Jolly Muse, attended by the Nine,</l>
               <l>Came into Court, reading <hi>Boileau</hi>'s <hi>Lutrin;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>While to our wonder (how good Wits agree!)</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo,</hi> who with Joy the Work had read,</l>
               <l>Enclining to the Bard his Beamy Head,</l>
               <l>After a smile, to's Darling Son thus said:</l>
               <l>Others by many Works have sought that Crown,</l>
               <l>Which you much more have merited by one.</l>
               <l>How much the World does to thy Genius owe,</l>

And would you but some fulsome Couplets raze,</l>
               <l>Full of low Flatt'ry, and of partial Praise,</l>
               <l>Believe your God, you might demand the Bays.</l>

               <l>Not whine his Tender, nor too rough his Rage.</l>
               <l>The God soon told him he had gain'd the Bays,</l>
               <l>Had he contented been t'have wrote three Plays:</l>
               <l>But since he knew not when he he'd Glory won,</l>
               <l>'Twas just that <hi>Capua</hi>'s Fate should prove his own.</l>

               <l>Resolv'd to lay the dubious Title down,</l>
               <l>And from <hi>Apollo</hi> only hold his Crown.</l>
               <l>Some Annual Odes, Hymns, Elegies, and Psalms,</l>
               <l>Besides a Play, were all that fill'd his Palms:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apollo</hi> view'd him stript of all his State,</l>
               <l>And by his Modesty soon knew <hi>Nat T—te:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then smiling said, that whatsoe're he wrote</l>
               <l>Was always smooth, nor sometimes wanted Thought;</l>
               <l>But swore with Passion by the Lake call'd <hi>Stygian,</hi>

               <l>No Laureat e're should meddle with Religion:</l>
               <l>In this, said he, my <hi>Dryden</hi>'s self was out,</l>
               <l>Who still wrote worse, the more he grew Devout.</l>

The Spotted <hi>Panther</hi> thus brought <hi>Brindle</hi> Praise;</l>
