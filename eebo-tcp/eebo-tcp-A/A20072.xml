            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat wagers were layd in the world, that when the Supplication was sent, it would not be receyued; or if recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it would not be read ouer; or if read ouer, it would not be answered: for <hi>Mammon</hi> being the god of no beggers, but Burgomasters and rich Cormorants, was woorse thought of than he deserued: Euery man that did but passe through Pauls Church-yard, and had but a glaunce at the Title of the <hi>Petition,</hi> would haue betted ten to fiue, that the Deuill would hardly (like a Lawyer in a busy Terme) be spoken with, because his Clyent had not a penny to pay sees, but sued <hi>in Forma pauperis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had it bene a Challenge, it is cleare he would haue answered it: for hee was the first that kept a Fence-schoole, when <hi>Cayn</hi> was aliue, and taught him the <hi>Embrocado,</hi> by which he kild his brother: Since
<pb facs="tcp:5533:5"/>
which time hee hath made ten thousand Free schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as cunning as <hi>Cayn.</hi> At sword and buckler, little <hi>Dauy</hi> was no bodie to him, and as for Rapier and Dagger, the <hi>Germane</hi> may be his iourneyman. Mary the question is, in which of the <hi>Play-houses</hi> he would haue performed his Prize, if it had grown to blowes, and whether the money beeing gathered, he would haue cozende the Fencers, or the Fencers him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Hell</hi> being vnder euerie one of their <hi>Stages,</hi> the Players (if they had owed him a spight) might with a false Trappe doore haue slipt him downe, and there kept him, as a laughing stocke to al their yawning Spectators. Or had his <hi>Infernallship</hi> bene arrested to any action howe great so euer, all the Lawe in Westminster-hall could not haue kept him from appearing to it (for the <hi>Diuell</hi> scornes to be non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited) he would haue answered to that too: But the mischiefe would haue bene, where should he haue got any that would haue pleaded for him? who could haue endured to see such a damnable Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent euerie morning in his Chamber? what water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (for double his fare) would haue landed him at the Temple, but rather haue strucke in at White-Fryers, and left him there ashore with a Poxe to him? Tush: there was no such matter, the streame hee was to venter into, was not so daungerous, this <hi>Coyner of Light angels</hi> knew well enough how the <hi>Exchaunge</hi> went, he had but bare wordes lent vnto him, and to pay bare words againe (thogh with some Interest) it could be no losse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5533:5"/>
Hee resolued therefore to aunswere his humble <hi>Orater:</hi> But being himselfe not brought vp to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (for the <hi>Diuell</hi> ean neyther write not reade) yet he has bene at all the <hi>Vniuersities</hi> in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and throwne heresies (like bones for dogges to gnaw vpon) amongst the Doctors themselues: but hauing no skill but in his owne <hi>Horne-booke,</hi> it troubled his minde where he should get a pen-man fit for his tooth to scribble for him, all the Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ith towne he had at his becke, but they were so set a worke with making bondes betweene <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> and <hi>Vnthriftie</hi> heires, betweene Marchants and Tradesmen (that to coozen and vndoe others, turne Banke-rowtes themselues, and defeate Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) and with drawing close conueyances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Landlords</hi> and Bawdes, that now sit no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon the skirtes of the Cittie, but iett vp and downe, euen in the cloake of the Cittie, and giue more rent for a house, then the proudest <hi>London</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier of them all, that <hi>Don Lucifer</hi> was loth to take them from their <hi>Nouerints,</hi> because in the ende he knew they were but his Factors, and that he should be a part-owner in their lading himselfe; Lawyers clarkes were so durtied vp to the hammes with trud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp and downe to get pelfe, and with fishing for gudgeons, and so wrung poore ignorant clients purses, with exacting vnreasonable Fees, that the <hi>Paymaster</hi> of <hi>Perdition</hi> would by no meanes take them from their wide lines, and bursten-bellied straddling ffs, but stroking them vnder the chinnes,
<pb facs="tcp:5533:6"/>
cald them his white boyes, and told them he would empty the Inke-pot of some others.</p>
            <p>Whither then marches <hi>Monsieur Malesico?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the writing Schoolemasters of the town. He tooke them by the fists and lik'd their handes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly (for some of them had ten or twelue seuerall hands &amp; could counterfeit any thing) but perceiuing by the copies of their countenances, that for al their good letters, they writ abominable bad English, and that the world would thinke the Diuell a Dunce, if there came false <hi>Orthographie</hi> from him (though there be no truth in his budget) away hee gallops from those tell-tales (the Schoolemasters) damning himselfe to the pit of Hell, if <hi>Pierce Pennylesse</hi> should euer get a good word at his handes.</p>
            <p>I hearing this, and fearing that the poore Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant should lose his longing, and bee sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with <hi>Si nihil attuleris,</hi> resolued (euen out of my loue to <hi>Pierce Pennylesse,</hi> because he hath beene alwayes a companion to Schollers,) to doe that for nothing, which a number would not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny money.</p>
            <p>I fell to my tooles (pen, inke, and paper) round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the <hi>Head warden</hi> of the <hi>Horners (Signior Beco Diauolo)</hi> after hee had cast vp what lay in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, suspecting that I came rather as a spie to betray him, then as a spirit to runne of his errands, and that I was more likely to haue him to Barber Surgeons hall, there to Anatomize him, then to a Barbers shop to trimme him neately, would by no

meanes haue the answere goe forwarde: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, hauing examined him vpon Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, and thereby sifting him to the very bran. I swore by <hi>Hellicon,</hi> (which he could neuer abide) that because tis out a fashion to bring a Diuell vpon the Stage, he should (spite of his spitting fire and Brimstone) be a Diuell in print. Inraged at which, he flung away in a fury, and leapt into <hi>Barathrum,</hi> whilst I mustred all my wits about me, to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Captaine of the damned <hi>Crew,</hi> and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his <hi>Stratagems.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wonder is the daughter of ignorance, none but fooles therfore will maruell, how I and this <hi>Grand Sophy of the whore of Babylon</hi> came to bee so familiar together, or how wee met, or how I knew where to finde him, or what <hi>Charmes</hi> I carried about mee whil'st I talkt with him, or where (if one had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to vse his <hi>Diuellship)</hi> a Porter might fetch him with a wet finger.</p>
            <p>Tush, these are silly inquisitions; his acquaintance is more cheape, then a common Fidlers; his lodging is more known then an English Bawdes, a midwiues or a phisicions; and his walkes, more open to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then those vpon the <hi>Exchaunge,</hi> where at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very step a man is put in minde of Babell, there is such a confusion of languages.

you may eyther meete him at dicing <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> like a captayne; at cocke-pits, like a young countrey gentleman; or else, at a bowling ally in a flat cap, like a shop keeper: euerie market day you may take him in <hi>Cheape-side,</hi> poorely attirde like an <hi>Ingrosser,</hi> and in the afternoones, in the twopeny roomes of a Play-house, like a <hi>Puny,</hi> seated Cheeke by Iowle with a Punke: In the heate of Summer he common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turnes <hi>Intelligencer,</hi> and carries tales betweene the <hi>Archduke</hi> and the <hi>Graue:</hi> In the depth of <hi>Winter,</hi> he sits tippling with the <hi>Flemmings</hi> in their townes of <hi>Garison.</hi>

            <p>Hauing therefore (as Chamber-maides vse to do sor their Ladies faces ouernight) made readie my cullors, the pencell being in my hand, my carde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, my needle (that capers ouer two and thirtie pointes of the <hi>Compas)</hi> toucht to the quicke, <hi>East, West, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> the foure Trumpetters of the Worlde, that neuer blow themselues out of breath, like foure dropsie Dutch Captaynes standing Centinells in their quarters, I will ingeniously and boldely giue you the Map of a country, that Iyes lower then the 17. valleyes of <hi>Belgia,</hi> yea lower then the Cole-pits of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> is farre more darke, farre more dreadfull, and fuller of knauerie, then the Colliers of those fire-workes are.</p>
            <p>The name of this straunge Countrie is <hi>Hell;</hi> In discouery of which, the <hi>Qualitie</hi> of the Kingdome, the condition of the Prince, the estate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Traffique thither (marie no transportation

            <p>And such daungerous hot shottes are all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, that whosoeuer meddles with any of them is sure to be burnt: It stands farther off then the <hi>Indies:</hi> yet to see the wonderfull power of <hi>Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> if you haue but aside Winde, you may sayle sooner thither, than a maried man can vpon S. <hi>Lukes</hi> day to Cuckolds hauen, from S. <hi>Katherines,</hi> which vpon sound experience, and by the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Marriners, may be done in lesse than halfe an hower. If you trauell by land to it, the wayes are delicate, euen, spatious, and very faire, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end very fowle: the pathes are beaten more bare, than the liuings of Church-men.

            <p>The miles are not halfe so long as those betweene <hi>Colchester</hi> and <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> nor a quarter so durtie in the wrath of <hi>Winter,</hi> as your French miles are at the fall of the leafe.</p>
            <p>Some say, it is an <hi>Iland,</hi> embrac'de about with certaine <hi>Riuers,</hi> called the waters of Sorrow: Others proue by infallible Demonstration, that tis a <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> but so little beholden to Heauen, that the Sunne neuer comes amongst them.</p>

            <p>Assist me therefore, thou Genius of that ven. trous, but Iealous musicion of Thrace (Euridices hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) who being besotted on his wife (of which sin none but Cuckolds should bee guilty) went aliue (with his fiddle at's back,) to see if he could baile her out of that Adamantyne prison; the fees he was to pay for her, were Iigs and country daunces: he payd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the forfeits, if he put on yellow stockings &amp; lookt back vpon her, was her euerlasting lying there, without baile or Maynprize: the louing coxco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b could not choose but looke back, and so lost her, (perhaps hee did it, because hee would be rid of her.) The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of which is, that if a man leaue his owne busines, and haue an eye to his wiues dooings, sheele giue him the slip, though she runne to the Diuell for her labor, Such a iourney (sweet <hi>Orpheus)</hi> am I to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but <hi>Ioue</hi> forbid my occasion should be like thine; for if the Marshall himselfe should rake Hell for wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he could not find worse, (no nor so bad) there, as are here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth.

            <p>Since therfore, a Tale of the whole voyage would make any liquorish mouth'd Newes-monger lick his lips after it, no mans teeth shall water any longer, hee shal haue it; for a very briefe Cronicle shalbe gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of al the memorable occurrents, that presented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the view of our wandring Knight in his iourney, the second part of <hi>Erra paters Almanacke,</hi> whose shooes, Platoes Cap was not worthy to wipe,

            <p>The Post therfore hauing put vp his packet, blows his horne, and gallops all the way, like a Citizen, so soone as euer hee's on horseback, downe to Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins-gate, for he meant when the Tide seru'd to angle for Souls &amp; some other fresh fish in that goodly fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond the Thames, as he passed ouer it, in Graues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Barge: that was the water coach he would ride in, there he knew he should meete with some volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries that would venture along with him: In this passage through the Citty, what a number of Lord Mayors, Aldermens, and rich Commoners sonnes and heyres kept a hallowing out at Tauerne-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to our knight, and wafted him to their Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne shores with their hats only, (for they had mol ted away all their fethers) to haue him strike sayle &amp; come vp to them: he vaild, and did so: their phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick salutations being complemented, with much intreatie (because he stood vpon Thornes) hee was aduaunc'd (in regard of his Knighthood) to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the boord: you must take out your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tables, and note by the way, that euery roome of the house was a Cage full of such wild fowle, <hi>Et crimine ab vno disce omnes,</hi> cut vp one, cut vp all, they

were birds all of a beake, not a Woodcocks diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among twenty dozen of them; euery man had before him abale of dice, by his side a brace of Punks, and in his fist a nest of bowles. It was spring-tide sure, for all were full to the brimmes, with French beeing turn'd into English (for they swum vp and downe the Riuer of Burdeux) signified thus much, that dicing, drinking, and drabbing, (like the three seditious Iewes in Ierusalem) were the ciuil plagues, that very vnciuily destroyed the Sonnes (but not the sinnes) of the Cittie.</p>
            <p>The bloud of the grape comming vp into their cheeks, it was hard to iudge, whether they blushed to see themselues in such a pickle, or lookt red with anger one at another: but the troth is, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would take any dye but a blush-colour, and they were not made of the right mettle of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to bee angry, but their wits, (like wheeles in <hi>Brunswick</hi> clocks) being all wound vp, so far as they could stretch, were all going, but not one going truly.</p>
            <p>For some curst their birth, some their bringing vp, some rayled vpon their owne Nation, others vpon Strangers.

Who breeds this disease, in our bones? Whores? No, alack let's doe them right, 'tis not their fault, but our mothers, our cockering mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who for their labour make vs to be cald Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or to hit it home indeede, those golden Asses our fathers.</p>
            <p>It is the olde man, it is <hi>Adam,</hi> that layes a curse vpon his Posterity: As for my Dad, tis well knowne, hee had ships reeling at Sea, (the vnla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which giues mee my load now, and makes mee stagger on land) hee had ploughs to teare vp deare yeeres out of the guts of the earth i'th coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and Yeomens sonnes, North countrey-men, fellowes (that might haue beene Yeomen of the Guard for feeding,) great boyes with beards, whom hee tooke to bee Prentizes, (mary neuer any of them had the grace to be free,) and those
<pb facs="tcp:5533:12"/>
lads (like Sarieants) tore out mens throats for him to get money in the Citty: hee was richer then <hi>Midas,</hi> but more wretched then an Alchumist: so couetous that in gardning time, because he would not be at the cost-of a loade of Earth, he parde not his nayles for seauen yeeres together, to the intent the durt that hee filcht vnder them, should serue for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: So that they hung ouer his Fingers, like soe many shooing-hornes: doe but imagine how farre euer any man ventred into Hell for money, and my father went a foote farder by the standard, and why did he this, thinke you? he was so sparing, that hee would not spend so much time as went to the making vp of another childe, so that all was for mee, hee cozend yong gentlemen of their land, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for me, had acres morgadgde to him by wise-acres for three hundred poundes, payd in hobby horses, dogges, bells, and lutestrings, which if they had bine sold by the drum, or at an outrop, with the cry, of No man better? would neuer haue yelded 50. li. &amp; this he did only for me, he built a Pharos or rather a Block-house beyond the galows at Wapping, to which the black fleet of cole carriers that came from <hi>Newcastle,</hi> strook saile, were brought a bed, and discharg'd their great bellies there, like whores in hugger mugger, at the common price with twelue pence in a chaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouer and aboue, thereby to make the common wealth blow her nayles till they ak'de for cold, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse she gaue money to sit by his fire, onely for me: the poore curst him with bel, booke &amp; candle, till he
<pb facs="tcp:5533:12"/>
lookt blacker with their execration, then if hee had bene blasted, but hee carde not what doggs barkt at him, so long as they bit not mee: his houskeeping was worse then an <hi>Irish Kernes,</hi> a Rat could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a Rape vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paring of a moldy cheese, but he died for't, onely for my sake, the leane Iade <hi>Hungarian</hi> would not lay out a penny pot of sack for himself, though he had eaten stincking fresh Herring able to poyson a dogge, onely for mee, because his sonne and heire should drinke eggs and muskadine, when hee lay rotting.</p>
            <p>To conclude, he made no conscience, to runne quick to the Diuell of an errand, so I had sent him. Might not my father haue beene begg'd (thinke you) better then a number of scuruy things that are begd? I am perswaded, fooles would be a rich <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolie,</hi> if a wise man had em in hand: would they had begun with him, Ile be sworne, he was a fat one: for had he fild my pockets with siluer, and the least corner of my coxcomb with wit how to saue that sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I might haue bene cald vpon by this, whereas now I am ready to giue vp my cloake: Had he sett me to Grammer schoole, as I set my self to dauncing schoole, in stead of treading <hi>Carontoes,</hi> and making Fidlers fat with rumps of Capons, I had by this time read <hi>Homilyes,</hi> and fedde vpon Tithe-pigges of my owne vicaridge, whereas now, I am ready to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Prodigals</hi> seruice, and eate Iones nuts, that's to say, Acorns with swine: But men that are wisest for officers, are commonly arrand woodcoks, for
<pb facs="tcp:5533:13"/>
fathers: Hee that prouides liuing for his child, and robs him of learning, turnes him into a Beetle, that flyes from perfumes and sweet Odours, to feede on a cow-sheard; all such rich mens darlings are eyther christened by some left-handed Priest, or else borne vnder a threepenny Planet, and then thei'le neuer be worth a groat, though they were left Landlords of the <hi>Indies.</hi> I confesse, when all my golden veynes were shrunke vp, and the bottome of my Patrimony came within 200. pound of vnraueling, I could for al that haue bene dub'd: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I saw how mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle playd at chesse, I had no stomack to be Knighted. Why, sayes the Post? Mary quoth he, because when I prepar'd to fight a battayle on the Chesse-board, a Knight was alwayes better then a Pawne: But the Vsurer myne Vnckle made it playne, that a good pawne now was better then a Knight.</p>
            <p>At this the whole <hi>Chorus summos mouere Cachinnos,</hi> laught til they grind agen, and cal'd for a fresh gallon, all of them falling on their knees, and drawing out sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and guilt rapyers (the onely monuments that were left of hundreds and thousands in <hi>Pecuniis nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratis,</hi> swore they would drinke vp these in deepe Healthes, to their howling fathers, so they might be sure the pledging should choake them, because they brought them into the Inne of the World, but left them not enough to pay their ryotous reckonings, at their going out.</p>
            <p>The knight was glad he should carry such welcome newes with him, as these, to the clouen-footed Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
<pb facs="tcp:5533:13"/>
and tickled with immoderate ioy, to see the world run vpon such rotten wheeles. Wherevpon, pleading the necessity of his departure, he began first to run ouer his Alphabet of Congees, &amp; then with a French Basilez, slipt out of their company.</p>
            <p>But they knowing to what cape he was bound, hung vpon him, like so many beggers on an Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, importing, and coniuring him, by the loue he did owe to Knight-hood, and armes, and by his oath, to take vp downe-cast Ladies whom they had there in their companies, and whom they were bound in Nature and humanity, to relieue: that hee would signifie to their fathers, how course the thred of life fell out to be now towards the <hi>Fagge end:</hi> that therefore, if any of them had (inth' dayes of his abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and idolatry to money) bound the spirit of gold, by any charmes, in Caues or in iron fetters vnder the ground, they should for their own soules quiet (which questionlesse else would whyne vp and downe) if not for the good of their children, release it, to set vp their decay'd estates. Or if there had beene no such coniuring in their life times, that they would take vp mony of the <hi>Diuel,</hi> (though they forfeyted their bonds) &amp; lay by it for euer, or els get leaue with a Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to try how much they might be trusted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their olde customers vpon earth, though within two dayes after, they proued Banke-rupts by Proclamation. The Post-master of Hell plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, that if any so Seditious a fellow as gold, were cast into Prison: their fathers would neuer giue their consent to haue him ransom'd:
<pb facs="tcp:5533:14"/>

By this time is hee landed at <hi>Graues-end,</hi> (for they whom the Deuil driues, feele no lead at their heeles) what stuffe came along with him in the Bargc, was so base in the weauing, that 'tis too bad to bee set out for sale: It was onely Luggadge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore throw it ouer boord.

The boat is made of nothing but the wormeaten ribs of coffins, nayl'd together, with the splinters of fleshlesse shin-bones, dig'd out of graues, beeing broken in pieces. The sculls that hee rowes with, are made of Sextons spades, which had bene hung vp at the end of some great Plague, the bench he sits vpon, a ranke of dead mens sculls.

And were it not that the soule payes excessiue Rent for dwelling in the body, he sweares (by the <hi>Stygian Lake,)</hi> he would not let em passe thus for a trifle, but raize his price: why may not he do it as wel as Punks and tradesmen? Herevpon he brags what a nomber of gallant felows and goodly wenches went lately ouer with him, whose names he has in his book and could giuehim, but that they earnestly entreated not to haue their names spred any farder (for their heires sakes) because most of them were too great in some mens books already. The onely wonder (sayes <hi>Charon)</hi> that these passengers driue me into, is, to see how strangely the world is altred since <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proserpine</hi> were mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For whereas in the olde time, men had wont to come into his boate all slasht, (some with one arme, some with neuer a leg, and others with heads like calues cleft to their shoulders, and the mouths of their very wounds gaping so wide, as if they were crying A boat, a boat,) now contrariwise, his fares are none, but those that are poysoned by their wiues for lust, or by their heires for liuing, or burnt by whores, or reeling into hell out of tauerns: or if they happen to come bleeding, their greatest glory is a stab, vpon the giuing of a lye.</p>

            <p>By this tyme, <hi>Charon</hi> looking before him (as Watermen vse to doe) that's to say, behind him, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was hard at shoare: wherevpon seeing he had such dooings (that if it held still) hee must needs take a seruant (and so make a payre of oares for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)</hi> hee offered great wages to the <hi>Knight Passant,</hi> to bee his iourneyman: but he beeing only for the Diuels land seruice, told him hee could not giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his seruice, but assuring him, he would enforme his <hi>Mr.</hi> (the King of <hi>Erebus)</hi> of al that was spoken, he payd the boat hyre fitting his Knighthood, leapt ashore and so parted.</p>
            <p>The wayes are so playne, &amp; our trauayler on foot so familyar with them, that hee came sooner to the court gates of <hi>Auernus,</hi> then his fellow (the Wherry-man) could fasten his hooke on the other side of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheron:</hi> The porter (though he knew him wel inough and fawnd vpon him,) would not let him passe, till he had his due: for euery officer there is as greedy of his Fees, as they are heere.

            <p>The Post, to stop his throat, threw him a Sop, and whyl'st hee was deuouring of that, he passed through the gates. No sooner was he entred, but hee met with thousands of miserable soules,

            <p>His warrant being thus signde, the messenger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, but before he could get to the vttermost ferrie, he met with an old, leane, meagre fellow, whose eies was sunke so deepe into his head, as if they had bene set in backward, his haire was thinner than his cheekes, and his cheekes so much worne awav, that when he spake his tongue smoakt, &amp; that was burnt blacke, with his hot and valiant breath, was seene to moue too and fro so plainly, that a wise man might haue taken it for the Snuffe of a candle in a Muscouie Lanthorne, the Barbar Surgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had begde the body of a man at a Sessions to make an Anatomie, and that Anatomie this wretched creature begged of

them to make him a body, <hi>Charon</hi> had but newly landed him: yet it seemde he stood in pittifull feare, for his eyes were no bigger then pinnes heads, with blubbring and howling, and keeping a coile to haue some body shew him the nearest way to hell, which he doubted hee had lost, the other puts him into a path, that would directly bring him thither, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bid him farewell, our blacke knight inquired of him what he was: who answered, that he was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one that liued vpon the Lecherie of mettalls, for he could make one hundred pound be great with child, and be deliuered with another in a very short time, his mony (like pigions) laide euery month, he had bene in vpright tearmes, an Vsurer: And vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he fell into the hands of the hell post, he offered him after a pennie a mile, betweene that and the townes end he was going too, so he would be his guide.</p>
            <p>Which mony, when the watermen came to rifle him, he swallowed down, and rakte for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, because he knewe not what neede he should haue, the waies being damnable: But the goer of the diuels errands, told him, if he would allow him Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fees, he durst not earne them, he would do him any Knights seruice, but to play the good Angels part, &amp; guide him, he must pardon him. Doctor <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues</hi> requests him (in a whining accent) to tell him if ther were any rich men in hel, &amp; if by any base drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery which the diuel shal put him too, &amp; which heel willingly moile in, he should scrape any muck toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:5533:25"/>
whether he may set vp his trade in hell, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Brokers there, that with picking strawes out of poore thatcht houses to build neastes where his twelue pences should ingender, might get feathers to his backe, and their owne too. To all which questions, the vaut curier answers briefly, that hee shall meet a number there, who once went in black veluet coats, and welted gownes, but of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, theres a longer lane of them in hell, than there is in <hi>London.</hi> Marry for opening shop, &amp; to keepe a Bawdy house for Lady <hi>Pecunia, Hoc si fata negant,</hi> If the Bailiffe of <hi>Barathru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> deny that priuiledge to those that haue serued twice seuen yeeres in the Freedom, theres no reason a Forrainer should taste the fauour.</p>
            <p>This newes tho it went coldly down, yet as those that are troubled with the tooth-ache, enquire of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what the paine is, that haue had them drawne out, and think by that means they lessen their owne; So it is some ease to Sir <hi>Timothy,</hi> thirtie <hi>per centum,</hi> to harken out the worst that others haue endured, hee desires therfore to know how far it is from the earth to hell; and being told that hell is iust so many miles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, as earth is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he stands in a browne study, wondring (sithence the length of the iournies were both alike to him, how it should happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he tooke rather the one path then the other. But then cursing himself that euer he fell in loue with mony, and that (which is contrary to nature) he euer made a crackt French Crowne, beget an English Angell, he roarde out, &amp; swore, that his gold sure wold damb him. For saies he, my greedinesse to feede mine eye
<pb facs="tcp:5533:25"/>
with that, made me starue my belly, and vndo those for sixe pence, that were readie to starue. And into such an Apoplexy of soule, fell I into with the lust of mony, that I had no sense of any other happinesse: So that whilst in my Closet I sat numbring my bags, the last houre of my life was told out, before I could tell the first heap of gold. Birdlime is the sweat of the Oake tree, the dung of the Blackbird falling on that tree, turnes into that slimie snare, and in that snare, is the Bird her selfe taken. So fares it mee, mony is but the excrement of the earth, in which couetous wretches (like swine) rooting continually, eate tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the earth so long, till at length they eate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into hell. I see therefore, that as Harts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most cowardly and hartlesse creatures, haue also the largest hornes, So we that are drudges to heapes of drosse, haue base and leane consciences, but the largest damnation. There appeared to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi> an Athenian, <hi>Demorij vmbra,</hi> and that gaue him a net to catch Cities in, yet for all that he died a begger. Sure it was <hi>Vmbra daemonis</hi> that taught me the rule of Interest: for in getting that, I haue lost the principall, (my soule). But I pray you tell mee, Sayes my Setter vp of Scriueners, Must I be stript thus out of all? Shall my Fox furde gownes be lockt vp from me? Must I not haue so much as a shirt vpon me? Heers worse pilling &amp; polling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongst my countrymen the Vsurers, not a rag of linnen about me, to hide my nakednesse.</p>
            <p>No, sayes the Light Horse-man of <hi>Lymbo,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5533:26"/>
no linnen is worne here, because none can be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen strong enough to hold, neither doe any such good huswiues come hither as to make cloath; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Destinies are allowed to spin, but their yarne serues to make smocks for <hi>Proserpina.</hi> You are now as you must euer be, you shall neede no cloathes, the Aire is so extreame hot; besides, there be no Tailors suffred to liue here, because (they as well as Plaiers) haue a hell of their owne,) (vnder their shopboard) and there lye their tottered soules, patcht out with nothing but ragges.</p>
            <p>This Careere being ended, our Lansquenight of <hi>Lowe-Germanie,</hi> was readie to put spurres to his horse, and take leaue, because hee sawe what disease hung vpon him, and that his companion was hard at his heeles, and was loth to proceed in his Iourney.</p>
            <p>But he, <hi>Qui nummos admiratur,</hi> the pawn groper, clingde about his knees like a Horsleech, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurde him, as euer he pittied a wretch eaten to the bare bones, by the sacred hunger of gold, that he would either bestow vpon him, a short Table (such a one as is tide to the taile of most Almanacks) chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the hye-waies, be they neuer so durtie, and measuring the length of al the miles between town, and towne, to the breadth of a haire, or if this Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall request tooke vp too much conceald land to haue it granted, that yet (at last) hee would tell him, whether he were to passe ouer any more riuers, and what the name of this filthy puddle was, ouer which hee was lately brought by a dogged water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:5533:26"/>
because sithence he must runne into the diuels mouth, hee would runne the neerest way, least hee wearied himselfe.</p>
            <p>Of this last request, the Lacquy of this great Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan, promisde he should be maister, but he would not bring him to a miles end by land, (they were too many to meddle with). You shall vnderstand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saies our wild Irish footeman) that this first wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is now cast behind you) is <hi>Acheron,</hi> It is the water of trouble, &amp; works like a Sea in a tempest (for indeede this first is the worst) It hath a thousand creekes, a thousand windings, and turnings, It ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently boyles at the bottome (like a Caldron of molten leade,) when on the top it is smoother then a still streame: And vpon great reason is it calde the Riuer of molestation, for when the soule of man is vpon the point of departing from the Shores of life, and to be shipt away into another world, she is vext with a conscience, and an auxious remembrance of all the parts that euer she plaide on the vnruly stage of the world: She repeats not by roate, but by hart, the iniuries done to others, and indignities wrought against her selfe: She turnes ouer a large volume of accounts, and findes that shees runne out in pride, in lustes, in riots, in blasphemies, in irreligion, in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing through so many enormous and detestable crimes, that to looke back vpon them, (being so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite) and vpon her owne face (being so fowle) the very thought makes her desperate: She neuer spake, or delighted to heare spoken, any bawdy language,
<pb facs="tcp:5533:27"/>
but it now rings in her eare, neuer lusted after luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meats, but their taste is now vpon her tongue, neuer sed the sight with any licentious obiect, but now they come all into her eye, euerie wicked thought before, is now to her a dagger, euery wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked word a death, euery wicked act a damnation: If she scape falling into this Ocaean, she is miraculously saued from a ship wracke, hee must needs be a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish but a cunning Waterman, that steeres in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest so dangerous: This first Riuer is a bitter water in taste, and vnsauoury in sent, but whosoeuer drinks downe but halfe a draught of his remembred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer follies, Oh it cannot chuse but be <hi>Amarulentum poculum,</hi> Gall is hony to it, <hi>Acheron</hi> like is a thick wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how can it otherwise choose, being stirred with so many thousands fighting perturbations.</p>
            <p>Hauing passed ouer this first Riuer (as now you are) you shall presently haue your waie stopt with another, Its a little cut by land thither, but a tedious and dangerous voyage by water.</p>
            <p>Lies there a Boate readie (quoth my rich Iew of <hi>Malta)</hi> to take me in so soone as I call? No, saies the other, you must waite your Marriners leisure, the same wrangling fellow that was your first man, is your last man: Marrie you shall lie at euery Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens mouth for a winde, till <hi>Belzebubs</hi> hale you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Acheron,</hi> (after many circumgirations) falles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Stigian Lake (your second Riuer carries that name) It is the water of Loathsomnesse, and runnes with a swifter Current then the former: for when
<pb facs="tcp:5533:27"/>
the soule sees deathes Barge tarrying for her, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be sorrie for her ante-acted euils, and then shees sailing ouer <hi>Acheron,</hi> but when shee drawes the Curtaine, and lookes narrowly vpon the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which her owne hand drew, and findes them to be vglie, shee abhorres her owne workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and makes haste to hoiste vp more Sayles, and to be transported swiftly ouer the Stigian Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whose waters are so reuerend, that the gods haue no other oath to sweare by.</p>
            <p>The third Riuer is <hi>Cocitus,</hi> somewhat clearer then both the other, and is the water of Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Armie of Stix, Many haue here bene cast away, and frozen to death, when the Riuer hath waxen cold, (as oftentimes it doth) neither are all sorts of soules suffred to saile vpon it, for to some (as if the water had sense and could not brooke an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy burden) it swells vp into tempests &amp; drowns them, to others more loue cannot appeare in Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins to men, then in that does smoothnes.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there are <hi>Phlegeton</hi> and <hi>Pyriphlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that fall in with <hi>Cocytus</hi> (burning Riuers) In which (tho they be dreadfull to looke vpon) are no vtter danger: If the Ferryman wast you safely, ouer the waters of Repentance, otherwise these hot ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors will scalde you. But what a Traitor am I to the vndiscouered kingdomes, thus to bring to light their dearest treasury; Sworne am I to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all State Infernall, and what dishonour would it bee to my Knighthood, to be found forsworne?
<pb facs="tcp:5533:28"/>
Seale vp your lips therefore I charge you, and drinke downe a full bowle of Lethoean water, which shall wash out of you the remembrance of any thing I haue spoken: Be proude, thou Grandchild of Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that I haue spent these minutes vpon thee, for neuer shal any breathing mortall man, with tortures wring out of me so much againe. There lyes your way: Farewel. In such a strange language was this <hi>vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum vale</hi> sent forth, that Mounsieur Mony-monger stood onely staring and yawning vpon him, but could speak no more: yet at the last (coniuring vp his best spirits) he onely in a dumb shewe (with pittifull action, like a Plaier, when hees out of his part) made signes to haue a Letter deliuered by the Carrier of condemnation, to his sonne, (a yong Reueller, prickt down to stand in the Mercers books for next Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,) which in a dumbe shewe likewise being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they both turnde backe the Vsurer, looking as hungrily, as if he had kist the post. At the banck end, when <hi>Plutoes</hi> Pursiuant came to take water, <hi>Mercury</hi> (that runnes of all the errands betweene the Gods) hauing bene of a message from <hi>Ceres,</hi> to her daughter <hi>Proserpine,</hi> (the Queene of lower <hi>Affrica)</hi> finding <hi>Charon</hi> ydle in his boate, because (as if it had bene out of Terme time) no Fares was stirring, fell to cast vp old reckonings, betweene himselfe, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten Sculler, for certaine trifling money laid out about <hi>Charons</hi> businesse. So that the Knight slipping in like a Constable to parta Fraie, was
<pb facs="tcp:5533:28"/>
requested to be as Arbitrator. The first Item that stoode in his Bill, was,</p>
            <p>For nayles to mend your Wherrie, when twoo Dutch men comming druncke from the Rennish wine-house, splitte three of the boordes with their club fists, thinking they had called for a reckoning: iiij. pence.</p>
            <p>Those Butter Boxes (sayes <hi>Charon)</hi> owe me a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vpon the foot of that accompt: For I could distill out of them but onely three poore droppes of siluer for the voyage, and all my losse at sea. Whats next?</p>
            <p>Item, laid out for Pitch to trim your Boat about the middle of the last plague, because she might goe tight and yare, and do her labour cleanly, xj. pence.</p>

nay, <hi>Mercurie,</hi> you shall filch for vs both, for all the gods know you are a notable Pick-pocket, as the knight of the Post here can take his oath, but what is your <hi>Summa totalis,</hi> (quoth <hi>Charon,) Summa totalis,</hi> answers the other commes to three shillings and a pennie.

spirits (all mangled) looking like so manie olde Romans, that for ouercomming death in their manly resolutions, were sent away out of the field, crowned with the military honour of Armes. The formost of them was a personage of so composed a presence, that Nature and Fortune had done him wrong, if they had not made him a souldier. In his countenance, there was a kinde of indignation, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a kinde of exalted ioy, which by his very gesture were apparantly descipherable, for he was jo cond, that his soule went out of him in so glorious a triumph; but disdainfully angry, that she wrought her enlargement through no more daungers: yet were there bleeding witnesses inow on his breast, which testified, he did not yeelde till he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and was not conquered, till there was left nothing of a man in him to be ouercome. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those <hi>Mortui &amp; Muti testes,</hi> which spake most for him, when he himselfe was past speaking, (though their mouths were stopped with scarres) he made shift to lay downe an ouer-plus of life, (when the debt was discharged at one mortall payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) onely to shew in what abiect account he held deaths tyranny. <hi>Charon</hi> glowting vpon him, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded who he was, but hee skorning to be his owne Chronicle, and not suffering any of the rest to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office, they all leaped into the Ferry. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom, one that sate out of his hearing, but within the reach of the Waterman (to shorten the way) discoursed all, thus:</p>

               <hi>England</hi> (quoth he) gaue him breath, <hi>Kent</hi> educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was neuer ouer-maistered, but by his owne affections: against whom, whensoeuer he got the victorie, there was a whole man in him: he was of the sword, and knew better how to end quarrells, then to beginne them; yet was more apt to begin, then others (better bearded) were to answer, with which (some that were euer bound to the peace) vpbraided him as a blemish. His Country barring him (for want of action) of that which he was borne to inherit, (fame) hee went in quest of it into the Low Countries, where (by his deare earnings) hee bequeathed that to those of his name, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but his name seemed to deprive him of in <hi>England. Ost-end</hi> being besieged, he lost one of his eyes, whilst he looked ouer the walls, which first storme did rather driue him on to more dangerous aduentures, though to the hazard euen of a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, (than like a fearefull Merchant) to runne his fortunes and reputation on ground, for the boysterous threatnings of euery idle billow. So that his resolution set vpon this rest, to leaue all the remainer of his bodie to that Country, which had taken from him one of the best iewells of his life, since it had a peece of him, he would not so disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the place, as to carry away the rest broken. Into the field therefore comes he, the fates putting both his eyes into one, (of purpose) because hee should looke vpon none but his enemies: where, a battaile being to be fought, the desert aduanced him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance

the Colours; by which dignitie, he became one of the fairest markes, which was then to be shot at: and where a great part of that daies glorie was to be wonne; for the Regent that followed his Ensigne, (by being hardly set to) giuing ground, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ambition, thirsting after his Colours, threw at all, in hope to winne them. But the destinies (who fought on their side) mistooke themselues, and in stead of striking the Colours out of his hand, smote him: in so much, that hee was twice shot, and twice runne through the bodie, yet would not surrender his hold for all those breaches, but stripping the prize for which they stroue, off from the staffe that held it vp, and wrapping his dying bodie in it, drew out his weapon, with which before his Colours could be called his winding sheete, hee threw himselfe into the thickest of daunger, where after hee had slaine a horse-man, and two others most valiantly, hee came off (halfe dead, halfe aliue) brauely, deliuering vp his spirit in the armes of none but his friends and fellow soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>So that (as if Fortune had beene iealous of her owne wauering) death (at her intreatie) tooke him away, in the noone-tide of a happinesse, least any blacke euenings ouercasting, should spoile it with alteration. Hee was married to the honour of a fielde in the morning, and died in the Armes of it the same day, before it was spoyled of the mayden-head: so that it went away chaste and
<pb facs="tcp:5533:31"/>
vnbleamishable. To conclude, (father Sculler) because I see wee are vppon landing, here is as much as I can speake in his praise: he died auncient in the verie middest of his youth. <hi>Charon</hi> humde and cried well; and hauing rid his boat of them, directed them to those happie places which were allotted out to none but Martialists.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Interim</hi> Sir <hi>Digoneis</hi> worshippe (our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring knight,) is walking with the monilesse Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in one of the <hi>Elizian</hi> gardens, to whom hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <hi>(aeerbatim)</hi> his masters answer and resolution, which he receiues (considering he was now where he would be) with as few wordes as he was woont to carrie pence in his purse. The Post hath as little to say to him, &amp; there for casting a slight eie (because he durst do no other, for that place is not for him) vpon all the <hi>Elizian</hi> Courtiers, (like a disdainfull phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticke Frenchman, when he comes into a strange Countrie as though hee trauailed rather to bee seene than to obserue,) vp he gettes vppon one of the Diuels Hackneyes, and away hee rides about his other worldly businesse, about which, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest hee is sweating, let mee carrie you vppe into those <hi>Insulae fortunatae,</hi> which are imbraced about with waters sweete, redolent, and Cristoline, the Teares of the Vine are not so precious, the Nectar of the Gods nothing so sweete and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
