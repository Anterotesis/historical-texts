            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Information and Direction to ſuch Perſons as are inclined to <hi>America,</hi> &amp;c:</head>
            <p>THat the value and improvement of <hi>Eſtates</hi> in our Parts of <hi>America,</hi> may yet appear with further cleaneſs Aſſurance of Enquirers, I propoſe to ſpeak my own Knowledg, and the obſervation of others, as particularly as I can; which I ſhall compriſe under theſe Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The advance that is upon Money and Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Advance that is upon Labour, be it of Handicrafts or others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Advance that is upon Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Charge of Tranſporting a Family, and fitting a Plantation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>The Way the Poorer ſort may be Tranſported, and Seated, with Advantage to the Rich that help them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>The eaſier and better proviſion that is to be made there for poſterity, eſpecially by thoſe that are not of great Subſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>What <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſels and Goods are fitting to carry for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe or Profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, Such <hi>Money</hi> as may be carried, as pieces of eight, advances <hi>Thirty,</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi> at leaſt <hi>Fifty per cent.</hi> Say I have 100 <hi>l. ſterl.</hi> If I am but ſix in Family, I will pay my Paſſage with the advance upon my money, and find my hundred pounds good in the Country at laſt. Upon <hi>Goods,</hi> well bought and ſorted, there is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: but ſome money is very requiſit for Trade ſake; for we find it gives Goods a better Market; ſo that conſidering the great quantity of Goods already carried, it were not amiſs at preſent, if one half were in <hi>Money,</hi> and the other in <hi>Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in General. But it particularly encourages Merchants, becauſe the profit by <hi>advance,</hi> is ſeldom leſs then 50 <hi>l. ſterl. per cent,</hi> which is very conſiderable; and we have already got ſome things for returns, as <hi>Skins, Furs, Whale-Oyle, Tobacco,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">II. For <hi>Labour,</hi> be it of <hi>Handicrafts,</hi> or <hi>Others,</hi> there is a conſiderable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by advance of price, to what is here, becauſe the Goods manufactured there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance equal to thoſe the Merchant ſells, and where Proviſion is at leaſt as cheap, and there is ſuch additional gain, to the firſt gain of Handicrafts here (of whom the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant buys) the <hi>American Handicraft muſt have an extraordinary time of it.</hi> The like may be ſaid of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder Labourers</hi> for ſome time, untill the Country be better repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with people.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Advance</hi> upon <hi>Land</hi> is Encouraging, which will be beſt apprehended by an Engliſh underſtanding, in a compariſon with the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> that he is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted with.</p>
            <p>If 500 Acres of <hi>unclear'd</hi> Land there, indifferently choſen, will keep as many <hi>Milch Cowes,</hi> or <hi>fat as many Bullocks</hi> for the Market in Summer, as 50 Acres of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Land in <hi>England,</hi> as choſen aforeſaid, can do; then by computing the value of the Summers Graſs of ſuch fifty Acres of Land here, we ſhall the better find the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 500 Acres of Land in <hi>America</hi>; for within that compaſs, the ſame quantity of Cattle may be well kept. Admit this then, that the Summers Graſs of 50 Acres of middling Land in <hi>England,</hi> is worth 15 <hi>l.,</hi> I conceive that makes 20 <hi>l.,</hi> which is the price of the Inheritance of the 500 Acres, no dear Purchaſs. The coſt to go thither
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96944:2"/>
is no Objection, becauſe it is paid by the <hi>Advance</hi> that is upon the Money and Goods at the rate aforeſaid. If the hazard of the Seas be objected, we ſee that the <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth</hi> Ship uſing thoſe parts, does not miſcarry, and the Risk is run for themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. However, except in Winter, paſſages are pleaſant, as well as ſafe.</p>
            <p>But this Compariſon draws an Objection upon us that muſt be obviated. <hi>What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of your ſtock in the Winter</hi>? I ſay our <hi>Woods</hi> usually keep them for the Market till <hi>December,</hi> and unleſs it be a more then ordinary Winter (which is obſerved to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but once in four or five Years) or that they are young Stock, or Cattel big with Young, they moſtly ſhift for themſelves. But if Fodder be wanted, we have a ſupply by <hi>Hay,</hi> we mow in the <hi>Marſhes</hi> and <hi>Woods,</hi> or the <hi>Straw</hi> of the Engliſh Grain we uſe, or the <hi>Tops</hi> and <hi>Stalks</hi> of Indian Corn, and ſometimes that it ſelf; a Thing <hi>hearty, and eaſily ras'd,</hi> and is good to fat as well as keep, and anſwers to <hi>Oats, Peaſe, Beanes</hi> and and <hi>Fetches</hi> here, tho we have of them alſo.</p>
            <p>This Scheam of <hi>Grazing</hi> and keeping of Stock, may inform Inquirers what the Woods and unbroken Lands of thoſe Countrys in ſome ſort will do, in proportion to Lands here, allowing equally for Care and Fodder on both ſides.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, the produce of Wild Land there in this reſpect, is within leſs than ten to one, of what our cleared Land is here, and the purchaſe here, is an hundred to one Dearer, which muſt needs make <hi>American Lands</hi> no hard <hi>Bargain</hi> to the Purchaſers.</p>
            <p>Now for clearing our <hi>Wood-lands</hi> in order to corn; the difficulty is not ſo great as is imagined; our <hi>Trees,</hi> being not ſo thick, or not ſo burdenſome, but that four hands, in four months time, may eaſily clear five and twenty Acres for the Plow; which, at 15 d. Engliſh <hi>per</hi> Day, for each hand comes to <hi>twenty five ſhillings per Acre.</hi> The encreaſe of which, is with leſs then half the ſeed, at leaſt equal to the improv'd Land of <hi>England.</hi> Add to this, the <hi>ten pence</hi> which buys the fee of an Acre unclear'd and an Acre of Land, producing the like quantity with Engliſh Ground, ſhall coſt 1 l. 5 s. 10 d. which at eight years purchaſe, ought to yield three ſhillings two pence three farthings <hi>per Annum.</hi> Now, where it brings an increaſe equal to Land of ten ſhillings <hi>per Annum</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and what it produces, yields not, at preſent, a leſs value, the advantage is almoſt four to one, which I conceive is no inconſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
            <p>Having given this general <hi>account</hi> of Lands in thoſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> which for <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Fountains,</hi> falls not ſhort, in my Opinion, of any Country I have ſeen in <hi>Europe</hi>; I ſhall in the next place, for their help and Direction that intend thither.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Firſt, <hi>Set down the Charge of Tranſporting an ordinary Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Method and Charge of their ſetling a Plantation when there,</hi> vvhich vvill ſerve for all Ranks, proportion ſtill conſidered. I vvill ſuppoſe my ſelf vvorth but one hundred Pounds.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96944:4"/>With the overplus of the Grain I have, to what I want, I furniſh my ſelf the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Year with two Barrels of Moloſſes, two of meat, and two of Fiſh, to ſave my young ſtock; and proceed to clear more Land for <hi>Indian Corn</hi> and <hi>Oates,</hi> and Imploy the other Land to <hi>Engliſh Wheat</hi> and <hi>Barley</hi>: A <hi>Garden Plat,</hi> next the Houſe, and an Acre in an <hi>Orchard,</hi> follow of courſe. And thus I end with my ſettlement of a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, leaving the <hi>Planter</hi> to live by his induſtry and encreaſe, and make what he can of the reſt of his five hundred Acres, and that for the ſake of this very ſettlement, is in reputation worth, <hi>three times more then it was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thoſe that have greater abilities, and aim at better ſettlements, they have the means in their own Hands, and the People of the Country skill enough to anſwer their deſires, be it in fine <hi>Timber</hi> or very good <hi>Brick</hi> Buildings. But for the <hi>Poorer</hi> ſort, that either can but juſt tranſport themſelves, or that are not well able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do that, I ſhall for the encouragement of ſuch, as well as of thoſe that ſhall aſſiſt them, propoſe my former Methods ſomewhat better explain'd.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The way the Poorer ſort may be tranſported, with advantage to the Rich that help them, is thus;</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, there are ſuch as are able to tranſport, themſelves and Families, but are unable to build or ſtock themſelves when they are there; others that have not enough to tranſport themſelves and Families, and ſuch will come under a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe may be entertained in this manner, Say I have 5000 Acres I will ſettle <hi>Ten Families</hi> upon them, in way of Village, and build each an houſe, an out-houſe for Cattle, furniſh every Family with ſtock; as four <hi>Cows,</hi> two <hi>Sows,</hi> a couple of <hi>Mares,</hi> and a yoke of <hi>Oxen,</hi> with a Town <hi>Porſe, Bull and Boar</hi>; I find them with Tools, and give each their firſt Ground-ſeed. They ſhall continue Seven Years, or more, as we agree at <hi>half encreaſe,</hi> being bound to leave the Houſes in repair, and a <hi>Garden</hi> and <hi>Orchard,</hi> I paying for the Trees, and at leaſt <hi>twenty Acres</hi> of Land within <hi>Fence,</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> to Corn and Graſs: The charge will come to about <hi>ſixty</hi> pounds Engliſh for each Family: At the ſeven years end, the Improvement Will be worth, as things go now, 120 <hi>l.</hi> beſides the value of the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of the Stock, which may be near as much more, allowing for caſualities; eſpecially, if the People are honeſt and careful, or a man be upon the ſpot himſelf, or have an Overſeer ſometimes to inſpect them. The charge in the whole is 832 <hi>l.</hi> And the value of ſtock and improvements 24<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 <hi>l.</hi> I think I have been modeſt in my computation. Theſe <hi>Farms</hi> are aftewards fit for <hi>Leaſes</hi> at full Reat, or how elſe the Owner ſhall pleaſe to diſpoſe of them. Alſo the People will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well provided to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themſelves with ſtock upon their own Land, which ſhall be a thouſand Acres their <hi>Land-lord</hi> will give them, which is own hundred to each Family, in ſome part of his five thouſand Acres, they only paying for the ſame ten ſhillings yearly, which is a ſhilling for each Family.</p>
            <p>The advantage of this way; is chiefly to thoſe that go, for as the benefit ſeems greater, ſo is the hazard, by loſs or embezlement of ſtock, unleſs one were preſent, or a dilligent and honeſt Overſeer there: But thoſe that deſign going, and have money, and aim to live with moſt Eaſe, cannot do better; for the half encreaſe of the ſtock and labour of thoſe Families will ſupply them with Proviſions; ſo that they need not toyl, in a way, they are perhaps unacquainted with, for their accommodations of life. And if half encreaſe be thought a way too uncertain, it may be brought to a certain value, by paying a yearly Rent for ſuck ſtock as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The other ſort of <hi>poor people</hi> my be very beneficially tranſported upon theſe terms:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96944:4"/>
Say I have 5000 <hi>Acres</hi> I ſhould ſettle as before, I will give to each Family 100 <hi>Acres,</hi> which in the whole makes 1000; and to each Family <hi>thirty pounds</hi> Engliſh, half in hand, and half there, which in the whole comes to 300 <hi>l.</hi> After four years are expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which time they may be eaſie, &amp; in a good condition, they ſhall each of them pay five pounds, <hi>and ſo yearly for ever, as a Fee-Farm rent</hi>; vvhich in the vvhole comes to 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. Thus a man that, buys 5000 <hi>Acres</hi> may ſecure and ſettle his 40000 by gift of one, and in a vvay, that hazard and intereſt allovved for, amounts to at leaſt ten <hi>per cent.</hi> upon Land ſecurity; beſiſtes the value it puts upon the reſt of the 5000 <hi>Acres,</hi> vvhich vvill be, for that reaſon, really vvorth three times as much as before. In theſe Families I propoſe that there be at leaſt <hi>two working hands</hi> beſides the <hi>wife,</hi> vvhether ſon or ſervant; and that they oblige vvhat they carry; and for further ſecurity bind themſelves as ſervants for ſome time, that they vvill ſettle the ſaid Land accordingly, and vvhen they are once ſeated, their improvements are <hi>ſecurity</hi> enough for the Rent.</p>
            <p>There is yet another expedient, &amp; that is, give to <hi>ten Families</hi> 1000 <hi>Acres</hi> for ever, at a <hi>ſmall acknowledgment,</hi> and ſettle them in vvay of Village, as before; by their ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, the Land taken up is ſecured from others, becauſe the <hi>method</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is anſvvered, and the value ſuch a ſettlement gives to the reſt reſerved, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; I mean, the 4000 <hi>Acres</hi>; eſpecially that vvhich is <hi>Contiguous</hi>: For their <hi>Children</hi> vvhen grovvn up, and Handicrafts vvill ſoon covet to fix next them, and ſuch after ſettlements beginning at an <hi>Improved Rent in Fee, or for long Leaſes, on ſmall Acknowledgments, and good Improvements,</hi> muſt advance the vvhole conſiderably. I conceive any of theſe methods to iſſue in a ſufficient advantage to adventurers, and they all give good encouragement to feeble and poor Families. Novv I knovv ſome think this looks a little hard upon the People that are to pay the ſaid Rent, the thing that is moſt contrary to my inclinations, as vvell as deſign in making this propoſal. But I am of another mind; for in <hi>Ireland,</hi> money bears the Intereſt of <hi>ten per cent</hi>: Thirty pounds then, will deſerve three pounds a Year, three Years Intereſt makes 9 <hi>l.</hi> The 100 Acres ſurveyed ct Patented are worth 8 <hi>l.</hi> at leaſt, for that is one of the loweſt priſes Parchaſers ſell again at. The Intereſt of this 8 <hi>l.</hi> for three Years at <hi>ten per cent,</hi> is <hi>Eight and forty ſhillings</hi>; there is alſo three ſhillings for three years rent. Novv put the thirty, the nine, the eight, and the tvvo pounds eight ſhillings, and the three ſhillings together, and there vvill be <hi>forty nine pounds eleven ſhillings,</hi> vvhich vvants but nine ſhillings of <hi>fifty pounds,</hi> and you advance no more then money does in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that is neerer home, and an improv'd Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to vvhich add, the hazard that is Run, in this vvay, above a double Bond for the payment of the fifty pounds in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; for the ſhip periſh, my money is gone, if the man or vvorking hands Dye, I have a Charge inſtead of a Revenue that vvill follovv me; vvhich plainly evidences that the propoſition is not grievous, but reaſonable and charitable too, and eſpecially vvhen vve Conſider that Sixty five Days out of the Year, at eighteen pence by Day, vvill, vvithin half a Crovvn, pay the Rent, and as he has <hi>three Hundred</hi> to himſelf. Nor is this all, he is come to a Country vvhere Lands is cheap, and does Riſe, and vvhere thoſe that have hands cannot but live, and in a vvay too, not ſubject to the Contingiences &amp; decays of Trades; for as belovv the ground none can fall, ſo here eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one falls upon his ovvn; vvhich brings me to the Sixth Particular, about the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit theſe Countries bring to <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>There is an eaſier and better proviſion to be made there for poſterity, eſpecially of ſuch as are not of great ſubſtance.</hi> I never thought, but mere Trades vvould do as vvell here as there, but vvhen People have gain'd ſomething here by their ingenuity and Toyl ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96944:5"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>000 <hi>l.</hi> hovv much Land vvill that buy here, and hovv much income vvill that fetch; perhaps 50 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> on Bond, or 40 in Land, vvhich at ten ſhillings by the <hi>Acre,</hi> comes to fourſcore <hi>Acres.</hi> This, to bring up five Children, <hi>Feed, Cloath, School,</hi> and <hi>Portion them,</hi> vvill be very ſcanty; but then, vvhat vvill this do to Eſtate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo forvvard.</p>
            <p>Novv in <hi>America,</hi> a thouſand Pounds diſcreetly laid out, is an Exchequer to a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I vvill ſuppoſe I have one hundred Pounds in Land, vvhich contains 3000 Acres. This I ſtock, to half increaſe, for 360 <hi>l.</hi> upon this half increaſe I live vvell, till my Children are of age. By this time at leaſt, the Tennants Term is up, and I place my Children in thoſe Tenements, vvith a proportion of ſtock, vvithout Portions or Rents to pay: Each has 500 Acres, beſides my five hundred after my deceaſe. If each of them have five Children, there is an hundred Acres a piece for them, beſides the 500 Acres I leave them; and if any take to Trades, the reſt have the more Land. By this time, an hundred Acres may be reaſonably preſum'd to be vvorth as much as a 1000 vvas in their Fathers time, and it muſt advance yet: All improv'd Countries teach us this. Novv this is a vvay of putting people into the natural Channal of life to vvit, <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and of Adjourning care for poſterity to the Fourth Generation. Let it be remembred that there is but 360 <hi>l.</hi> expended of the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that to carry me and my Family, and ſettle us in ſome proportion to our degree, as alſo to Traffick and encreaſe portions, there reſts 640 <hi>l.</hi> Novv if a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> cannot have ſo natural an increaſe, free of thoſe Contingences that other means of life are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, I conceive <hi>America</hi> ſomevvhat a better place for the good of Poſterity, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of ſuch as are not vvealthy, or have many Children, that they vvould nor ſhould too unequally live and be provided for.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Novv as to vvhat Utenſels and Goods are fitteſt to carry for uſe and profit, I ſay, in general, all things relating to <hi>Apparrel, Building, Houſhouldſtuff, Huſbandry, fowling</hi> and <hi>Fiſhing:</hi> but for Particulars, <hi>Engliſh Woollen,</hi> and <hi>German Linnen,</hi> as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>broad-Clothes, Kereſeys, Searges, Norwich-Stuffs,</hi> ſome <hi>Duffels, Cottons</hi> &amp; <hi>Stroud-waters,</hi> for the Natives, and <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Blew</hi> Ozenburgs, <hi>Shoes,</hi> and <hi>Stockins, Buttons, Silk, Threed, Iron ware,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Felling Axes, Hows, Indian Hows, Saws, Frows, Drawing-Knives, Nailes,</hi> but of 6. <hi>d.</hi> and 8. <hi>d.</hi> a treble quantity, becauſe they uſe them for shingling, or covering of Houſes. <hi>Powder</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> are often vvanted for the <hi>Woods,</hi> in Winter, for Water Fovvl that are very numerous. There are leſſer things that vvill be convenient to carry; but being trivial in themſelves, and vvhat People <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> hardly miſs to think upon; I ſhall cloſe this Information and direction vvith my uſual Caution, and good Wiſhes. Let none be Haſty or Preſumptuous. The even humble Temper vvill beſt endure the difference of the Change either vvay. A Wilderneſs muſt vvant ſome things improv'd Countries do enjoy; but Time and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour vvill reprize, vvhere Induſtry ſooner makes an Inheritance. And tho vve have not the Ornaments of Life, vve vvant not the Conveniences; and if their Coſt vvere put in Ballance vvith their Benefit, the World vvould be greatly debtor on Account. If then vve have leſs of Art, vve have more of Nature; and the Works of God are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>I vvill ſay no more, but if <hi>Jacob</hi> dvvelt in Tents, and Herds and Flocks vvere his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, a Life like his ſhould be no ſtop vvith thoſe that love his Plainneſs and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
