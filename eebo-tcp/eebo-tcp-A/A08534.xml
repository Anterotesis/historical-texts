            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E read, that</hi> Socrates <hi>(hee that was by</hi> Apollos <hi>Oracle famoused for the wisest man in the world) was wont to say, That it had been fit mens hearts, should haue windowes, that so the thoghts might be discerned. This pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er if we now had, honourable Lords, beleeue it, you should discern my loue towards you and yours. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause speech is the mindes interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and you cannot know men, and their thoughts, but by their words or writing, I am to intreat that you would take in as good part these words, which in my absence I vtter, as if I had in presence deliuered them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not out of any humor of arrogancy or vain ostentation that I do this: but that vpright, gentle, and religious fashion of yours, wherin you excell more than any Easterlings that border these Baltick coasts, these make me assay the art of Harmony, which the Grecians call Musicke; Musicke the nurse of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and mother of good fashions, of honesty, of Common-wealths, if in any thing we may giue credite to the ancients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These made me commit my sayles to the furious windes; these made me giue</hi> Zoiles <hi>and</hi> Thersites <hi>power to rage ouer me; these made me trauell many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys not without endamaging my estate, to search out the Art; these made me many a time to sustaine wearinesse, when I might haue been at rest; greefe, when I might haue solaced my selfe; disgrace, when I might haue liued in good reputation; pouertie, when I might haue liued in plenty. But also these things (right Worthies) seemed to me not worthy the regarding, when I sought how I might whilest others slept, whom your state doth nourish (before all others) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite your youth, and so consequently the youth of all Germany, drawing them to good fashions, recalling them by the honest delights of Musicke from vnlawfull attempts, and so by little and little stirre them vp to vertuous actions. For</hi> Socrates, <hi>and</hi> Plato, <hi>and all the Pythagoreans did generally enact, that young men and maides should be trayned vp in Musicke, not to the end their mindes might be incited to wantonnesse by those bawbles, which make Art to be so vilely</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15618:4"/>
               <hi>reputed of: but that the motions of the minde might be ruled and gouerned by law and reason. For seeing the nature of young men is vnquiet, and in all things desiring delights, &amp; therfore refuseth seuerer arts, it is by the honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Musick brought to those recreations, which may also solace honest old age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Among those things wherwith the mind of man is wont to be delighted, I can finde nothing that is more great, more healthfull, more honest, than Musicke: The power whereof is so great, that it refuseth neither any sexe, nor any age, and (as</hi> Macrobius <hi>a man of most hidden &amp; profound learning saith) there is no brest so sauage and cruell, which is not moued with the touch of this delight. For it doth driue away cares, perswade men to gentlenesse, represseth and stirreth anger, nourisheth arts, encreaseth concord, inflameth heroicall minds to gallant attempts, curbeth vice, breedeth vertues, and nurseth them when they are borne, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men to good fashion. For among all those things which doe admit sence, that onely worketh vpon the manners of men, which toucheth his eares, as</hi> Aristotle <hi>in his musicall problemes doth more at large discourse. Hence was it that</hi> Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon <hi>being to goe Generall for the Troian warres, as</hi> Philelphus <hi>reports, left a Musitian at his house, who by singing the prayses of womens vertues might incite</hi> Clytemnestra <hi>to a chaste and honest life, wherein he did so farre preuaile, that they say she could not be ouercome by</hi> Egistus <hi>his vnchaste attempts, till the vngodly wretch had made away the Musitian, who onely hindred him from his wicked purpose. Besides</hi> Lycurgus, <hi>though otherwise he enacted most seuere lawes for the Lacedaemonians his countrey-men; yet did he very much embrace Musicke, as</hi> Quintilian <hi>writes. I omit those ancient Philosophers, (for so they rather chose to be called, than to be named wise men) who did repose the summe of their studies in this art as in a certaine Treasure-house. I omit those princes who for the admirable sweetnesse of this art spend many talents. Lastly, I omit the most religious of al men, who though they estrange themselues from al worldly pleasure, yet dwell vpon this delight, as if it were the onely heauenly one. Since therfore this Art is both holy, and sweet, and heauenly, participating of a diuine, faire, and blessed nature, I thought good to dedicate this booke, wherein all the knots of practicke Musicke are vntied, to the gentle youth of your Citie, after it had been first brought forth at Rostoch, that famous Vniuersity of the Baltick coast, and since amended by the censure of the Elders, and publikely read in three famous Vniuersities of</hi> Germanie, <hi>the Vniuersitie of</hi> Tubyng, Heydelberg, <hi>and</hi> Maguntium. <hi>That by their deserts the after ages being helped, might pay the tribute of thanks not to me, but to them, as to the first mouing causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore wise Fathers, I beseech your wisedomes to deigne this booke your gentle fauour and acceptance, not contemning the base stile or little volume of that, which is rather holy than pleasant, and set out not vpon any rash humour, but vpon a true deuotion. For it is written for them that fast, not for them that are filled with delicacies, though euen they may find here that which will fit their stomackes. And since great things fit great men, small things small men, I acknowledge my selfe small; and therefore giue small gifts, yet promise greater whensoeuer I shall grow greater. Farewell most happy, most worthy, most wise.</hi>

            <p>Hence it is, that we haue resolued to collect into certaine most short rules, the precepts of Actiue Musicke, if not all, yet the especiall, out of diuers Authours. For to know all things and faile in nothing, is a mark rather of diuine then of humane nature. Now those, whom I herein followed as my leaders, and acknowledge as my speciall Patrons, are these:

                  <p>VVHen God (whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> prooues to haue made all things to a certaine harmonie) had deuised to make this world moueable, it
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:15618:5"/>
was necessary, that he should gouerne it by some actiue and moouing power; for no bodies but those which haue a soule, can moue themselues, as <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinus</hi> in the first Chapter of his first booke of <hi>Theoric</hi> saith. Now that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (because it is the swiftest of all other, and most regular) is not without sound: for it must needs be that a sound be made of the very wheeling of the Orbes, as <hi>Macrobius in Somnium Scip. lib.</hi> 2. writeth. The like sayd <hi>Boêtius,</hi> how can this quick-mouing frame of the world whirle about with a dumb and silent motion? From this turning of the heauen, there cannot be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a certaine order of Harmonie. And nature will (saith that prince of Romane eloquence <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his sixt booke <hi>de Reipub.)</hi> that extremities must needs sound deepe on the one side, &amp; sharp on the other. So then, the worlds Musicke is an Harmonie, caused by the motion of the starres, and violence of the Spheares. <hi>Lodouicus Coelius Rodiginus; lectionum antiquarum lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. writeth, That this Harmony hath been obserued out of the consent of the heauens, the knitting together of the elements, and the varietie of times. Wherefore well sayd <hi>Dorilaus</hi> the Philosopher, That the World is Gods Organe. Now the cause wee cannot heare this sound according to <hi>Pliny</hi> is, because the greatnesse of the sound doth exceede the sence of our eares. But whether wee admit this Harmonicall sound of the Heauens, or no, it skils not much; sith certaine it is, that the grand Work-maister of this <hi>Mundane Fabricke,</hi> made all things in number, weight, and measure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in principally, <hi>Mundane Musicke</hi> doth consist.</p>

                     <hi>HVmane Musick,</hi> is the Concordance of diuers elements in one compound, by which the spirituall nature is ioyned with the body, and the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part is coupled in concord with the vnreasonable, which proceedes from the vniting of the body and the soule. For that amitie, by which the body is ioyned vnto the soule, is not tyed with bodily bands, but vertuall, caused by the proportion of humors. For what (saith <hi>Coelius)</hi> makes the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the soule so sundry and disagreeing to conspire oftentimes each with other? who reconciles the Elements of the body? what other power doth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and glue that spirituall strength, which is indued with an intellect to a mortall and earthly frame, than that Musicke which euery man that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends into himselfe finds in himselfe? For euery like is preserued by his like, and by his dislike is disturbed. Hence is it, that we loath and abhorre dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and are delighted when we heare harmonicall concords, because we know there is in our selues the like concord.</p>

                     <hi>PLaine Musicke,</hi> (as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> an excellent searcher into regular and true Concinence) doth write in the beginning of his Musicke, saying: It is a rule determining the nature and forme of regular Songs.

                  <p>THe <hi>Profit</hi> of this Art is so great, (as writeth Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. of that name, in the second Chapter of his Musick) that whosoeuer giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to it, shall iudge of the qualitie of any Song, whether it be <hi>triuiall,</hi> or <hi>curious,</hi> or <hi>false:</hi> He knowes both how to correct that which is faulty, and how to compose a new one. It is therefore (saith he) no small praise, no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit, no such labour as to be esteemed of slightly, which makes the Artist both a <hi>Iudge</hi> of those <hi>Songs</hi> which be composed, and a <hi>Corrector</hi> of those which be false, and an <hi>Inuentor</hi> of new.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the difference betwixt a Musitian, and a Singer.</head>
                  <p>OF them that professe the Art of <hi>Harmony,</hi> there be three kindes; (saith <hi>Franchinus</hi> in the first Book the 4. chap. of his <hi>Theoric)</hi> one is that which dealeth with Instruments; the other maketh Verses; the third doth iudge the workes both of the instruments, and of the verses. Now the first, which dealeth with Instruments, doth herein spend all his worke; as <hi>Harpers,</hi> and <hi>Organists,</hi> &amp; all others which approue their skil by Instruments. For they are remoued from the intellectuall part of Musicke, being but as seruants, and vsing no reason: voide of all speculation, and following their sence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Now though they seeme to doe many things learnedly and skilfully, yet is it plaine that they haue not knowledge, because they comprehend not the thing they professe, in the purenesse of their vnderstanding; and therefore doe we deny them to haue Musicke, which is the Science of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king melodie. Fot there is knowledge without practise, and most an end greater, than in them that are excellent Practitioners. For we attribute the nimblenesse of fingring not to Science, which is only residing in the soule, but to practise, for if it were otherwise, euery man the more skilfull he were in the Art, the more swift he would be in his fingring. Yet doe we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the knowledge of Musicke to all that play on Instruments; for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganist, and he that sings to the Harpe, may haue the knowledge of Musick,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15618:7"/>
which if it be, we account such the best Artists.</p>
                  <p>The second kind is of <hi>Poets,</hi> who are led to the making of a verse, rather by a naturall instinct, than by speculation. These <hi>Boêtius</hi> secludes from the speculation of Musicke, but <hi>Austin</hi> doth not.</p>
                  <p>The third kind of Musitians, be they which doe assume vnto them the cunning to iudge and discerne good <hi>Ayres</hi> from bad: which kind, (sith it is wholy placed in speculation and reason) it doth properly belong to the Art of <hi>Musicke.</hi>

                  <head>Who is truely to be called a Musitian.</head>
                  <p>THerefore he is truely to be called a <hi>Musitian,</hi> who hath the faculty of speculation and reason, not he that hath only a practick fashion of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for so saith <hi>Boêtius lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. He is called a Musitian, which taketh vpon him the knowledge of Singing by weighing it with reason, not with the seruile exercise of practise, but the commanding power of speculation, and wanteth neither speculation nor practise. Wherefore that practise is fit for a learned man: <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Musicke sets downe (being forced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by <hi>Homers</hi> authoritie) and proues it thus: <hi>Speculation breedeth onely knowledge, but practise bringeth the same to worke.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>Practitioner</hi> of this facultie is called a <hi>Cantor,</hi> who doth pronounce and sing those things, which the Musitian by a rule of reason doth set downe. So that the <hi>Harmony</hi> is nothing worth, if the <hi>Cantor</hi> seeke to vtter it without the Rules of reason, and vnlesse he comprehend that which he pronounceth in the puritie of his vnderstanding. Therefore well saith <hi>Ioan. Papa</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. To whom shall I compare a <hi>Cantor</hi> better than to a <hi>Drunkard</hi> (which indeed goeth home,) but by which path he cannot tell. A <hi>Musitian</hi> to a <hi>Cantor,</hi> is as a <hi>Praetor</hi> to a <hi>Cryer:</hi> which is proued by this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Guido:</hi>

                     <l>Verum si tonantis vocis laudent acumina,</l>

                     <l>Twixt <hi>Musitians,</hi> and <hi>Practitians,</hi> oddes is great:</l>
                     <l>They doe know, these but show, what Art doth treat.</l>
                     <l>Who doeth ought, yet knoweth nought, is brute by kind:</l>
                     <l>If voices shrill, voide of skill, may honour finde?</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Philomel,</hi> must beare the bell,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse, Musitian was.</l>

Therefore a <hi>Speculatiue Musitian,</hi> excels the <hi>Practick:</hi> for it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to know what a man doth, than to doe that which another man doth. Hence is it, that buildings and triumphs are attributed to them, who had the command and rule; not to them by whose worke and labour they were performed. Therefore there is great difference in calling one a Musitian, or a Cantor. For <hi>Quintilian</hi> saith, That Musitians were so honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men famous for wisedome, that the same men were accounted <hi>Musitians</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>wise men.</hi> But <hi>Guido</hi> compareth those <hi>Cantors,</hi> (which haue made curtesie a farre off to Musicke) to brute Beasts.</p>

                  <head>Of the Inuentors of Musicke.</head>
                  <p>THe best writers witnesse, That Musicke is most ancient: For <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Linus</hi> (both borne of Gods) were famous in it. The inuention of it is attributed to diuers men, both because the great antiquitie of it, makes the Author incertaine; and also because the dignitie of the thing is such, and maketh so many great men in loue with it, that euery one (if it were possible) would be accounted the Authors of it. Wherefore some thinke <hi>Linus</hi> the Thebane; some, that <hi>Orpheus</hi> the Thracian; some, that <hi>Amphion</hi> the Dircean; some, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Samian found out this Art. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> attributes it to <hi>Dionysius, Diodorus,</hi> to <hi>Mercury, Polybius,</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> with whom there was such estimation of Musicke, that it was the greatest disgrace that could be in that place to confesse the ignorance of Musicke.

Wherefore in seeking out the description of a <hi>Voyce,</hi> we thought fit to search out this point, what <hi>Sounds</hi> are properly called <hi>Voyces.</hi> Note therefore, that the sound
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15618:8"/>
of a sensible creature is properly called a <hi>Voyce,</hi> for things without sence haue no <hi>Voyce,</hi> as <hi>Coelius</hi> writes, <hi>antiquar. lect. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 53.

But because this description of a <hi>Voyce,</hi> doth agree onely to a liuely <hi>Voyce,</hi> and not to a deafe musicall <hi>Voyce,</hi> which especially, being a sole syllable is deafe, vnlesse it be actually expressed, we must find out another description more agreeable to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a musicall <hi>Voyce,</hi> is a certaine syllable expressing a tenor of the Notes. Now Notes is that by which the highnes, or lownes of a Song is expressed.</p>

But the <hi>Repercussion</hi> of a seuenth, appearing straight in the beginning, doth preserue it, and make it remaine <hi>Authenticall.</hi> See <hi>Pontifex cap.</hi> 12.</p>

                  <head>By how many wayes we may know the Tones.</head>
                  <p>WE may know the <hi>Tones</hi> by three meanes: by the beginning: the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: and the end. By the beginning; for a Song rising in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning straight wayes aboue the finall <hi>Key</hi> to a Fift, is <hi>Authenticall,</hi> as before was sayd in the second Rule. By the middle, and first, by the rising; For the Song which toucheth an Eight in the middle, is <hi>Authenticall:</hi> that Song which doth not, is <hi>Plagall:</hi> secondly by the <hi>Repercussion,</hi> which is proper to euery <hi>Tone,</hi> as before was sayd; by which at first hearing you may iudge of what kinde a Song is. By the end, as before we spake of the finall Notes.</p>
                  <p>Besides there be certain Songs, which do ascend as an <hi>Authentical,</hi> &amp; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend as a <hi>Plagall,</hi> and those are called <hi>Neutrall,</hi> or mixt Songs, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> doeth not allow of them: for he saith, what execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble licentiousnesse is this, to ioyne together those things, which are contrary one to the other, transgressing the bonds of Nature? surely as it doth make a discontinuance in conioyning, so doth it open wrong to Nature.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet are these Songs (in my iudgement) to be very diligently marked in the end, to which <hi>Tone</hi> they encline most. For whilest they discend from a Fift to the finall Note, they are <hi>Authentickes;</hi> but whilest they rise from a Third or a Fourth to a finall, they are <hi>Plagals:</hi> See <hi>Pontifex</hi> in his 12. and 16. <hi>chap.</hi>

                  <head>Rules of Solfaing.</head>
                  <p>THe First, He that will <hi>Solfa</hi> any Song, must aboue all things haue an eye to the <hi>Tone.</hi> For the knowledge of the <hi>Tone</hi> is the inuention of the Scale, vnder which it runnes.</p>
                  <p>The Second, All the <hi>Tones</hi> runne vnder the Scale of ♮ <hi>Dure,</hi> excepting the fift and the sixt.</p>
                  <p>The Third, To haue a Song runne vnder ♮ <hi>Dure,</hi> is nothing else, but to sing <hi>Mi</hi> in <hi>b fa</hi> ♮ <hi>mi,</hi> and <hi>fa</hi> in a <hi>flat</hi> Scale.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, When a Song runnes vnder a Scale ♮ <hi>Dure,</hi> the lowermost Notes of that kinde are to be sung; but vnder a Scale <hi>b Moll,</hi> the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Notes.</p>
                  <p>The Fift, Euery <hi>Solfaer</hi> must needs looke, whether the Song be regular, or no; for the transposition of a Song is oft times an occasion of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Scale.</p>
                  <p>The Sixt, Euery Song ending in the <hi>Finals,</hi> is regular, and not transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his Dialogue.</p>
                  <p>The Seuenth, Whensoeuer a Song ascends from <hi>D sol re</hi> to <hi>A la mi re</hi> by a fift, mediately or immediately, and further onely to a second, you must sing <hi>fa</hi> in <hi>b fa</hi> ♮ <hi>mi</hi> in euery <hi>Tone,</hi> till the song do againe touch <hi>D sol re,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be marked or no. But this Rule failes, when a song doth not straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fall to <hi>F faut,</hi> as in the Hymne, <hi>Aue maris stella,</hi> you may see.</p>
                  <p>The Eight, In <hi>b fa</hi> ♮ <hi>mi,</hi> and his eights, you may not sing <hi>mi</hi> for <hi>fa,</hi> nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15618:13"/>
contrariwise; because they are discording and repugnant voyces, saith <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinus lib. 1. pract. cap. 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ninth, <hi>b</hi> in places, where he is marked contrary to his nature, doth note Mutation.</p>
                  <p>The Tenth, The Scale being varied, the <hi>Mutations</hi> are also with it varied, both in the whole and in part. In the whole, as in transposed Songs; in part, as in conioyned Songs.</p>
                  <p>The eleuenth, As often as <hi>fa</hi> or <hi>mi</hi> is marked contrary to their nature, the <hi>Solfaer</hi> must follow the marke so long as it lasts.</p>
                  <p>The twelfe, Seeing there is one and the selfesame iudgement of eights, the same <hi>Solfaing</hi> of <hi>Voyces</hi> must be.</p>

Therefore I find no cause of this, but onely vse: neither haue I found it written by any Musitian. Neither doth Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> much like it.

Wherefore seeing our obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which we performe to God, must be reasonable, leauing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which are by no reason approued, let the Readers onely be carefull of the Capitall tenours of <hi>Tones,</hi> least they wind themselues in vnprofitable and superfluous precepts, put on the darkenesse of the night, and make an easie thing most hard and difficult. For God delights not in vnreasonable turnings, but in Songs well fashioned and regular, being he himselfe hath made all things in a most regular and orderly fashion. Wherefore the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist saith, <hi>Praise the Lord in well-sounding Cymbals:</hi> for he would not haue said well sounding, if he would haue had God praised with euery bellowing, screaming, or noyse.</p>

Whence to sing psalmes, is to sing the praises of almighty God with a certaine ioy. In which matter there is such diuersitie, (the more is the griefe) that euery one seems to haue a seuerall fashion of Singing. Neither doe they obserue the Statutes, and precepts of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, but euery one sings Psalmes, and other things euen as they list. Wherevpon there is such discention growne in the Church, such discord, such confusion, that scarce two sing after one manner. This doth <hi>Pontifex</hi> in the 22. chapter of his Musicke, very much reprehend, and surely with good reason, saying: Seeing that one God is delighted with one baptisme, one faith, and the vnity of manners, who may think but that he is grieuously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with this multiplicity of Songs? Wherfore I had deliuered certaine Rules of the true order of singing, vnlesse I had found them both copiously and learnedly written by maister <hi>Michael Galliculo de Muris,</hi> a most learned man.

                  <head>That diuers men are delighted with diuers Moodes.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very mans palate is not delighted with the same meate (as <hi>Pon.</hi> writes in the 16. ch. of his Musick.) but some delight in sharp, some in sweet meates: neither are all mens eares delighted with the same sounds: for some are delighted with the crabbed &amp; courtly wandring of the first <hi>Tone.</hi> Others do affect the hoarse grauitie of the second: others take pleasure in the seuere, &amp; as it were disdainful stalking of the third: others are drawn with the flatring sound of the fourth: others are moued with the modest wantonnes of the fift: others are led with the lamenting voyce of the sixt: others do willingly heare the warlike leapings of the seuenth: others do loue the decent, &amp; as it were, matronall carriage of the eight. Neither is it maruell (saith <hi>Guido</hi> in the 13. cha. of his <hi>Mic.)</hi> if the hearing be delighted with the variety of sounds, seeing that the sight, is pleased with the variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the smelling power, with the variety of odours; &amp; the taste, with diuersity of meats. Wherfore let a Musitian diligently obserue that he dispose his song in that <hi>Tone,</hi> wherein he knows his auditors are most delighted. As if he will compose a song at the request of yong men, let it be youthfull and frolicke; If at the request of old men, let it be testy, and full of seuerenes. For as a writer of Comedies, if he giue the part of a yong man vnto an old man, or the part of of a wanton fellow to a couetous person, is laughed to scorne: so is a singer if he bring in a dauncing merry moode, when occasion requires sadnes, or a sad one, when it requires mirth. Now by what means that may be performed, the property of the <hi>Moodes</hi> declareth. Because (as <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> writes in an Epistle to <hi>Boêtius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Coelius</hi> repeats it in <hi>antiq. lect. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.) The Darian <hi>Moode</hi> is the bestower of wisedome, and causer of chastity. The <hi>Phrygian</hi> causeth wars, and enflameth fury. The <hi>Eolian</hi> doth appease the tempests of the minde, and when it hath appeased them, luls them asleepe. The <hi>Lydian</hi> doth sharpen the wit of the dull, &amp; doth make them that are burdened with earthly desires, to desire heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things, an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worker of good things. Yet doth <hi>Plato lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rep.</hi> much reprehend the <hi>Lydian,</hi> both because it is mournful, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is womanish. But he alloweth of the <hi>Dorian,</hi> both because it is manly, &amp; also doth delight valiant men, &amp; is a discouerer of warlike matters. But our men of a more refined time do vse somtime the <hi>Dorian;</hi> somtime the <hi>Phrygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> sometime the <hi>Lydian;</hi> sometime other <hi>Moodes.</hi> because they iudge, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to diuers occasions they are to choose diuers <hi>Moodes.</hi> And that not without cause: for euery habit of the mind is gouerned by songs, (as <hi>Macrob.</hi> writeth) for songs make men sleepy, and wakefull, carefull, &amp; merrie, angry, &amp; merciful, songs do heale diseases, &amp; produce diuers wonderful effects (as saith <hi>Fran. Petrac.)</hi> mouing some to vain mirth, some to a deuout &amp; holy ioy, yea ofttimes to godly teares. Of al which I had rather be silent, than to determine any thing rashly: least I do burthen the wits of children with vnprofitable &amp; vnnecessary precepts. Because who so in expounding any thing doth poure on more than is needful, increaseth the darknesse, and maketh not the mist thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith in the second booke vpon the dreame of <hi>Scipio.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let learners study those few precepts, because they are necessary for the vnderstanding of that which followes.</p>

And as that first Monarch of the Romane Empire, when he first saw</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders <hi>statue at</hi> Gades, <hi>lamented for that he himselfe had done nothing worthy the remembrance: euen so I, because I haue done no such thing, did euen lament; considering that beauty, pleasures, age, health, and delicacies doe fade away,</hi> Sed famam extendere factis, hoc vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis opus. <hi>Wherefore after many harty sighes, taking heart againe (though I were tossed with many flouds of Cares, many gusts of aduersities, and many stormes of diuers perturbations) yet began I to thinke what I should leaue to posteritie for witnesse that I had liued. Now my mind being turned hether and thither, in the end I chose the learning of Harmony; both because it is fit for morall educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and also because it is the seruant of Gods praise. For amongst all Scholler-like Arts, (which they commonly call Liberall) none is more morall, more pleasant, more diuine, than Musicke. Whereof although there be many Professors, yet be there very few writers (I know not whether it grow out of hatred to the Art, or their owne slothfulnesse) that haue deliuered the Art in a good forme. Hence is it, that excepting those which are, or haue been in the Chappels of Princes, there are none, or very very few true Musitians. Wherupon the Art it self doth grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt, being hidden like a Candle vnder a bushel, the praising of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Creatòr of all things decreaseth, and the number of those which seeke the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of this Art, doth dayly increase throughout all Germany. By this occasion stirred vp, &amp; further relying vpon your kindnes, most worthy Sir, (a great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony wherof you gaue me, when I came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Vniuersity of</hi> Tubyng, <hi>&amp; turned in at your pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (indeed most pleasant house) which you haue of your Princes gift) I turned my pen to the writing of Mensural Musick, hauing before writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Plain-Song. And what flowers soeuer other mens volumes had in them, like a Bee I sucked them out, and mad: this second Book the hiue to lay them vp in. Now as I haue dedicated it in your name, so doe I subiect it to your censure, that you may both mend those faults you find in it, and detect it from the barking of those who doe commonly defame all good men. For hauing a fit iudge of these things which I write, I doe fitly submit my selfe to his Censure; euen his whom alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die both my owne experience hath found, and all</hi> Sueuia <hi>doth acknowledge, and all high</hi> Germanie <hi>doth honour, for a godly, vpright, and learned man.

For Musicke driueth away those cares which driue away sleepe, stilleth crying children, mitigateth the paine of those which labour, refresheth wearied bodies, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth appassionate minds. And euery liuing soule is so ouercome with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall sounds; that not onely they which are of the gallanter sort (as saith <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius)</hi> but euen all barbarous Nations doevse Songs, either such as stirre them vp to an ardent embracing of vertue; or doe melt them in vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pleasures: and so are they possessed with the sweetnesse of Harmony, that by Musicke the <hi>Alarum</hi> to warre is giuen, by Musicke the Retraite is sounded, as if the Note did both stirre vp, and after allay that vertue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Now of the two, that Musicke which we call Mensurall, doth specially performe these effects. For this (as <hi>Isidorus</hi> saith) stirreth vp not onely men, but also beasts, serpents, birds, and Dolphins with the sweetnesse of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. By this did <hi>Arion</hi> preserue himselfe in the middle of the sea; by this did <hi>Amphion</hi> the <hi>Dircaean</hi> gather together stones for building the <hi>Theban</hi> walles. By this did <hi>Timotheus</hi> the <hi>Phrygian</hi> so enflame <hi>Alexander Magnus,</hi> the Conquerour of the whole world, that he rise from the table where he sat, and called for his armes; and afterwards changing his <hi>Moode</hi> on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, did cause him to put off his armour, and sit downe againe to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. By this did <hi>Dauid</hi> the princely Singer, helpe <hi>Saul</hi> the King of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, when he was vexed with an vncleane Spirit; by this, not onely the great God, the maker of all things, but also the furies of the <hi>Stygian</hi> God are delighted, appeased, and mitigated. For this is the Lady and Mistresse of all other Arts; which can delight both those that be in <hi>Plutoes</hi> iurisdiction, and those that abode in <hi>Neptunes</hi> fields; and those that liue in <hi>Iupiters</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-lightsome Mansions.

the tribunall seat of the highest Iudge; where together with the Instruments of the Saints it soundeth, where the Angels and Archangels doe incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sing Hymnes to God, where the Cherubins, and Seraphins, cry with a continuall voyce, <hi>Holy, holy, holy.</hi> Besides, no Art without Musicke can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: wherefore <hi>Pythagoras</hi> appointed his Schollers they should both when they went to rest, and when they awaked vse Melodies. Besides, Musicke doth gouerne and sharpen the manners and fashions of men. For euen <hi>Nero</hi> whilst he gaue himselfe to Musicke, was most gentle, as <hi>Seneca</hi> witnesseth: but when hee leauing of Musicke, and set his minde on the Diabolicall Art of Nicromancie, then first began that fierce crueltie of his; then was he changed from a Lambe to a Wolfe, and out of a most milde prince trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a most sauage beast. But least I digresse too farre, and least we proceede from vnknowne beginnings, I will briefly set downe what this Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke is.

                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, a point in the Signe of time, found onely about one part of the Song: One I say, for if it be found about all, it is not a signe of <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> but of the greater <hi>Prolation.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore <hi>Diminution</hi> is the cutting off of the halfe part in the measure, nothing differing from <hi>semiditie,</hi> but that it is found in perfect Signes, and in figures which are to be measured by the number of 3. Wherefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but scorne certaine Componists (for so they will be called) though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they be the Monsters of Musicke) who though they know not so much as the first Elements of the Art, yet proclaime themselues, The <hi>Musitians</hi> or <hi>Musitians,</hi> being ignorant in all things, yet bragging of all things, and doe (by their foolish toyes which contrarie to the maiestie of the Art, they haue gotten an habite of, rather by vse, than wit) disgrace, corrupt, and debase this Art, which was in many ages before honoured, and vsed by many most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, (and to vse <hi>Quintitians</hi> words) most wise men: vsing any Signes at their pleasure, neither reckoning of value, nor measure, seeking rather to please the eares of the foolish with the sweetnesse of the Ditty, than to satisfie the iudgement of the learned with the maiestie of the Art. Such a one know I, that is now hired to be Organist in the Castle at <hi>Prage,</hi> who though he know not (that I may conceale his greater faults) how to distinguish a perfect time from an imperfect, yet giues out publikely, that he is writing the very depth of Musick: and is not ashamed to say, that <hi>Franchinus</hi> (a most famous writer, one whom he neuer so much as tasted of) is not worth the reading, but fit to bescoffed at, &amp; scorned by him. Foolish bragging, ridiculous rashnes, grosse madnes, which therfore only doth snarle at the learned, because it knows not the means how to emulate it. I pray God, the Wolfe may fal into the Toiles, and hereafter commit no more such outrage; nor like the Crow brag of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed feathers. For he must needs be counted a Dotard, that prescribes that to others, the Elements whereof himselfe neuer yet saw. As <hi>Phormio</hi> the Greeke Orator (in <hi>Tullies</hi> second Booke <hi>de Orat.)</hi> who hauing before <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the King of <hi>Asia,</hi> (in the presence of <hi>Haniball)</hi> made a long Oration of the dutie of a Generall, when as hee himselfe had neuer seene Campe, not armes, and had made all the rest to admire him, in the end <hi>Haniball</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, what his iudgement was of this Philosopher, his answere was, That hee had seene many doting old men, but neuer any man that doted more, than <hi>Phormio.</hi> Now come I to the matter, and leaue these vnlearned ridiculous <hi>Phormio's,</hi> many whereof (the more is the shame) haue violently inuaded the art of <hi>Musick,</hi> as those which are not compounders of Harmonies, but rather corruptors, children of the furies, rather than of the Muses, not worthy of the least grace I may doe them. For their Songs are ridiculous, not grounded on the Principles of the Art, though perhaps true inough. For the Artist doth not grace the Art, but the Art graceth the Artist. Therefore a Componist doth not grace Musicke, but contrarily: for there be that can make true Songs not by Art, but by Custome, as hauing happily liued amongst singers all their life-time: yet do they not vnderstand what they haue made, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such a thing is, but not what it is. To whom the word our Sauiour vsed on the Crosse, may be well vsed; <hi>Father pardon them, they know not what</hi>

                     <hi>they doe.</hi> Wherfore allow of no Componists, but those, who are by Art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be allowed of: now such are <hi>Ioan. Okeken, Ioan: Tinctoris, Loyset, Verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, Alex: Agricola, Iacobus Obrecht, Iosquin, Petrus de Larue, Hen: Isaack, Hen: Finck, Ant: Brummel, Mat: Pipilare, Geor: Brack, Erasmus Lapicida, Caspar Czeys, Conradus Reyn,</hi> and the like: whose Compositions one may see doe flow from the very fountaine of Art. But least by laughing at these fellowes we grow angry, and by being angry grow to hate them, let vs euen let them alone, and returne to <hi>Diminution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereof we will resolue with <hi>Franchinus</hi> and <hi>Tinctor,</hi> that it taketh not away a third part, as the Ancients thought, (for it is hard finding out that) but one part: for as this signe <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

Here the <hi>Pricke</hi> in perfect degrees, is ioyned not to perfect figures, but to their neere parts, neither is adioyned to the middle of the side, as that of Addition, but a little higher, or lower about the middle of the Notes, which it diuides, thus: <gap reason="music">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herefore <hi>Accent</hi> (as <hi>Isidorus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>eth. cap.</hi> 17. writeth) is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine law, or rule, for the raysing, or low carrying of sillables of each word Or, it is the Rule of speaking. For that speaking is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, which is not by <hi>Accent</hi> graced. And it is called <hi>accent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>ad Cantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, close by the song, according to <hi>Isidore:</hi> for as an aduerbe doth determine a Verbe, so doth <hi>accent</hi> determine <hi>Concent.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these descriptions doe rather agree with the Grammaticall <hi>accent,</hi> than with the Musicall, I hold it necessary to search out by what means the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall <hi>accent</hi> may rightly be described. Therefore <hi>accent</hi> (as it belongeth to Church-men) is a melody, pronouncing regularly the syllables of any words, according as the naturall <hi>accent</hi> of them requires.</p>

                  <head>Of the Diuision of accent.</head>
                  <p>NOw it is three-fold, as <hi>Priscian</hi> and <hi>Isidore</hi> witnesse, the <hi>Graue,</hi> the <hi>Acute,</hi> and the <hi>Circumflex.</hi> The <hi>Graue</hi> is that, by which a sillable is carried low:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15618:40"/>
but to speake musically, it is the regular falling with finall words, according to the custome of the Church. Of which there be two sorts. One which doth fall the finall word, or any syllable of it by a fift: and this is properly called <hi>Graue.</hi> Another which doth fall the finall word, or any syllable of it onely by a third, which by the Musitians is called the middle <hi>Accent.</hi> Neither haue the Grammarians cause to be angry, if they find any thing here contrary to their lawes. For we goe not about to handle the Grammaticall <hi>Accent,</hi> which <hi>Priscian,</hi> and others haue throughly taught, but the Ecclesiasticall, as here followeth: <gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap> Medius. Grauis. <hi>Parce mihi domi ne, ni hil enim sunt di es me i.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>acute Accent</hi> grammatically, is that, by which the syllable is raised. But musically, it is the regular eleuation of the finall words or syllables ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of the Church. Wherof there are likewise two kinds: one which reduceth the finall syllable or word to the place of his discent, keeping the name of <hi>Acute.</hi> The other, which doth raise the second sillable not to the former place of his discent, but into the next below. Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called <hi>Moderate,</hi> because it doth moderately carry a sillable on high, as appeareth in the example following: <gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap> Moderatus. Acutus. <hi>Il lu mi nare Hie ru sa lem qui a glo ri a do mi ni super te or ta est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Circumflex</hi> is that, by which a sillable first raised is carried low. For it is, as <hi>Isidore</hi> witnesseth, contrary to the <hi>acute,</hi> for it begins with the <hi>acute,</hi> and ends with the <hi>graue,</hi> vnknowne to Church-men. Yet the Monkes, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially those of the Cistertian order, haue the <hi>Circumflex accent,</hi> as at the old Cell a Monastery of the same order my selfe haue tried, and I my selfe haue seene many of their bookes in the same place.</p>
                  <p>Now farewell they that forbid Church-men to vse Musicke; what solace (setting singing aside) can they haue either more healthfull, or more honest? For whilst we recreate our selues with singing, all euill thoughts, and speech, all backe-biting, all gluttony and drunkennesse, are auoyded. Wherefore Song-Musicke both plaine and Mensurall, becommeth the most religious, that they may both singpraises to God, and make themselues merry at fit times of recreation. But leauing this discourse, let vs returne thether whence we digressed, and send those which would busily enquire the nature of the <hi>Circumflex accent,</hi> to <hi>Mich. Galliculus,</hi> who hath set out the matter so briefly, that it need no other explayning.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ere</hi> Arnold, <hi>whereas mans intellect in it beginning is naked and without forme, and hath nothing in it, but a possibility to receiue formes, many haue doubted why the high Creatour did not giue knowledge naturally to man as well as to other sensible creatures. For some haue naturally the art of spinning; some of making hony; some of weauing; some of doing other things: but man is borne naked, vnarmed, without any Art, crying the first day of his birth, and neuer laughing til he be 40. dayes old (as</hi> Pliny <hi>writeth in the Prologue of the 7 booke of his</hi> Nat. Hist.) <hi>Is man therfore inferiour to beasts? in no sort, for that nakednes of man doth not argue his vnworthinesse, but his noblenesse. For that which is within, hinders not that which would be without. Hence is it, (we see) that those animals, which haue arts naturally, can doe nothing but that naturall Art. But man wanteth all Arts, that he may be fit for all: which is proued by the natural desire hee hath to knowledge. For Arts are desired by all, though they be not bought by all; and are praised by all, though they be not searched after by all. The hindrance is sloath, pleasure, vnorderly teaching, and pouerty. And though we haue naturally the desire of all Arts, yet aboue all we doe desire and loue the Art of Singing. For that doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise all liuing things with the sweetnes; draw them with the profit; and ouercome them with the necessity of it: whose parts (thogh they be al both sacred &amp; diuine) yet that which we cal the Counter-point, is more sweet, worthy, &amp; noble, than al the rest. For this is the dwelling place of al the other, not that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains in it al the difficulties of</hi> Musicke; <hi>but because to make it, it requires a learned and perfect Musitian. Wherfore hauing discussed of the rest, least our Office be fayling in this last point, I thought good to handle the Counter-point, placing it in the last place (as it were a treasury) wherin al the secrets of</hi> Musick <hi>are laid vp: not that hereby all men, to whom nature is not seruiceable, should fall to composition, but that all men may iudge whether those things which be composed by others, be good or bad. Yet who so can, let them compose by our writings: they which cannot, let them proceed, as farre as they can.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But not to digresse too wide, (worthy Sir) I haue in this last booke, collected the Rules of the Counter-point, out of diuers places, for the common good of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; which I bring to you to be weighed, that after your censure, it may be subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the carps of the malicious. For from your sentence no man will euer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale; because there is no man either learneder, or subtiler in this Art, than your selfe, who besides the practise, hast wisdome, eloquence, gentlenesse, quicknesse of wit, &amp; in al kinds of</hi> Musick <hi>a diuine industry, and further the knowledge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other sciences.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Icomachus</hi> the Musitian saith, That the Art of <hi>Musicke</hi> was at first so simple, that it consisted of a <hi>Tetrachord.</hi> And was made with the voice <hi>Assa,</hi> that is, one Voyce alone (for <hi>Assa</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called alone, whereof it is called <hi>Vox assa,</hi> when it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the mouth, not adding to it other Musicall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi> wherein the praises of the Ancients was sung, as <hi>Phil. Beroaldus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Tenth booke of his Commentary vpon <hi>Apuleius.</hi> Yet by the meanes of diuers authors, the <hi>Tetrachord</hi> from foure Cords grew to fifteen. To which the after-ages haue added fiue and sixe Voyces, and more. So that a Song in our times hath not one voyce alone, but fiue, sixe, eight, and sometimes more. For it is euident, that <hi>Ioannes Okeken</hi> did compose a Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet of 36. Voyces. Now that part of Musick which effecteth this, is called of the Musitians, the <hi>Counterpoint.</hi> For a <hi>Counterpoint</hi> generally, is nothing else than the knowledge of finding out of a Song of many parts. Or it is the mother of <hi>Modulation,</hi> or (as <hi>Franchinus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. writes) it is the Art of bending founds that may be sung, by proportionable Dimension, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of time. For, as the clay is in the hands of the Potter; so is the making of a Song in the hands of the Musitian. Wherefore most men call this Art not the <hi>Counter-point,</hi> but <hi>Composition.</hi> Assigning this difference of names, and saying, that <hi>Composition</hi> is the collection of diuers parts of Harmony by diuers <hi>Concords.</hi> For to compose is to gather together the diuers parts of Harmony by diuers <hi>Concords.</hi> But the <hi>Counter-point</hi> is the sodaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ordering of a plaine Song by diuers Melodies by chance. Whence <hi>Sortisare</hi> signifies to order a plain Song by certain <hi>Concords</hi> on the sodaine. Now it is called <hi>Counterpoint</hi> (as <hi>Bacchus</hi> saith) as it were a concordant <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> of Voyces set one against another, examined by Art.</p>

As a sharpe Sword pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth quicker, whereas a blunt one doth not so, but enters slowly: euen so when we heare an high forced Voyce, it strikes into one: but a base voyce doth dully, as it were thrust at one, saith <hi>Coelius lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 53.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He placing of <hi>Rests</hi> in a <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> is for many causes tollerated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To auoide difficulty. For whilst two parts of a song or more are so fitted together that it is hard to fit the other parts, we set <hi>Rests</hi> for so long, till that difficultie cease.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To auoide <hi>Fict</hi> Voices, and the forbidden Interuals.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To distinguish two perfect <hi>Concords</hi> which cannot mutually follow one another, vnlesse a Note or pause come betwixt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 For the making of Signes. Now a signe is the successiue distribution of one and the same Close, in the beginning or any other place, by diuers parts of a Song. Or it is the repetition of the same Close in diuers parts of the song thus: <gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap> Discantus Tenor. Bassus.</p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:15618:49"/>
5 <hi>Rests</hi> are admitted for taking breath, least by the swiftnesse of the Song, either the Singer might be out of breath, or breed confusion by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his breath at vnfit times.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That the <hi>Intrinsecall</hi> signes and markes of Musicall degrees, consisting in their perfection, may be perceiued. For a perfect <hi>Mood</hi> is inwardly noted by a rest of 3. times. A perfect time by 2. <hi>Semibreefe</hi> Rests, placed with a <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breefe,</hi> as before is said in the fift Chapter of the second booke.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Because of the many parts of a song. For when a song goes with more parts than foure, it is necessary that some Rest, whilst others sing: least the sweetnesse be dulled either by the too much prolonging of the Voices, or by the vnelegant commixtion of <hi>Concords,</hi> and so the Consort seeme rather to make a noyse, then a Concordant sound.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the diuers fashions of singing, and of the Ten Precepts for Singing.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very man liues after his owne humour; neither are all men gouerned by the same lawes, and diuers Nations haue diuers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, and differ in habite, diet, studies, speech, and song. Hence is it, that the English doe carroll; the French sing; the Spaniards weepe; the Italians, which dwell about the Coasts of <hi>Ianua</hi> caper with their Voyces; the other barke: but the Germanes (which I am ashamed to vtter) doe howle like Wolues. Now because it is better to breake friendship, than to determine any thing against truth, I am forced by truth to say that which the loue of my Countrey forbids me to publish. <hi>Germany</hi> nourisheth many Cantors, but few Musitians. For very few, excepting those which are or haue been in the Chappels of Princes, doe truely know the Art of Singing. For those Magistrates to whom this charge is giuen, doe appoint for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Seruice youth Cantors, whom they choose by the shrilnesse of their Voyce, not for their cunning in the Art; thinking that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with bellowing and braying, of whom we read in the Scripture, that he reioyceth more in sweetnes than in noyse, more in the affection, than in the Voice. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> writeth, that the voice of the church doth sound in the eares of Christ, hee doth presently adioyne the cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is sweet. Therefore well did <hi>Baptista Mantuan</hi> (that moderne <hi>Virgil)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh euery puffed vp, ignorant, bellowing Cantor, saying;
<q>
                        <l>Cur tantis delubra Boum mugitibus imples,</l>
                        <l>Tu ne Deum tali credis placare tumultu.</l>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Ten Precepts necessary for euery Singer.</head>
                  <p>BEing that diuers men doe diuersly abuse themselues in Gods praise; some by mouing their body vndecently; some by gaping vnseemely; some by changing the vowels, I thought good to teach all Cantors certaine Precepts, by which they may erre lesse.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:15618:49"/>
1 When you desire to sing any thing, aboue all things marke the <hi>Tone,</hi> and his <hi>Repercussion.</hi> For he that sings a Song without knowing the <hi>Tone,</hi> doth like him that makes a syllogisme without <hi>Moode</hi> and Figure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Let him diligently marke the <hi>Scale,</hi> vnder which the Song runneth, least he make a <hi>Flat</hi> of a <hi>Sharpe</hi> or a <hi>Sharpe</hi> of a <hi>Flat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Let euery Singer conforme his voyce to the words, that as much as he can he make the <hi>Concent</hi> sad when the words are sad; &amp; merry, when they are merry Wherein I cannot but wonder at the Saxons (the most galiant people of all Germany, by whose furtherance I was both brought vp, and drawne to write of Musicke) in that they vse in their funerals, an high, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ioconde <hi>Concent,</hi> for no other cause (I thinke) than that either they hold death to be the greatest good that can befall a man (as <hi>Valerius</hi> in his fift Booke writes of <hi>Cleabis</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> two brothers) or in that they beleeue that the soules (as it is in <hi>Macrobius</hi> his second Booke <hi>De somnio Scip.)</hi> after this body doe returne to the original sweetnes of Musicke, that is to heauen. Which if it be the cause, we may iudge them to be valiant in contemning death, and worthy desirers of the glory to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Aboue all things keepe the equalitie of measure. For to sing without law and measure, is an offence to God himselfe, who hath made all things well, in number, weight, and measure. Wherefore I would haue the Fasterly <hi>Franci</hi> (my countrey-men) to follow the best manner, and not as before they haue done; sometime long; sometime to male short the Notes in Plain-song, but take example of the noble Church of <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> their head, wherin they sing excellently. Which would also much profit, and honour the Church of <hi>Prage,</hi> because in it also they make the Notes sometimes longer, sometime shorter, than they should Neither must this be omitted, which that loue which we owe to the dead, doth require. Whose <hi>Vigils</hi> (for so are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called) are performed with such confusion, hast, and mockery, (I know not what fury possesseth the mindes of those, to whom this charge is put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) that neither one Voyce can be distinguished from another, nor one sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable from another, nor one verse sometimes throughout a whole Psalme from another. An impious fashion to be punished with the seuerest correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Think you that God is pleased with such howling such noise, such mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in which is no deuotion, no expressing of words, no articulating of syllables?</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Songs of Authenticall <hi>Tones</hi> must be timed deepe, of the subiugall <hi>Tones</hi> high, of the neutrall, meanly. For these goe deep, those high, the other both high and low.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The changing of Vowels is a signe of an vnlearned Singer. Now, (though diuers people doe diuersly offend in this kinde) yet doth not the multitude of offenders take away the fault. Here I would haue the <hi>Francks</hi> to take heede they pronounce not <hi>u</hi> for <hi>o,</hi> as they are wont, saying <hi>nuster</hi> for <hi>noster.</hi> The countrey Church-men are also to be censured for pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, <hi>Aremus</hi> in stead of <hi>Oremus.</hi> In like sort, doe all the <hi>Renenses</hi> from <hi>Spyre</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:15618:50"/>
to <hi>Confluentia</hi> change the Vowel <hi>i</hi> into the dipthong <hi>ci,</hi> saying <hi>Mareia</hi> for <hi>Maria.</hi> The <hi>Westphalians</hi> for the vowel <hi>a</hi> pronounce <hi>a</hi> &amp; <hi>e</hi> together, to wit, <hi>Aebs te</hi> for <hi>Abste.</hi> The lower Saxons, &amp; al the <hi>Sueuians,</hi> for the Vowel <hi>e,</hi> read <hi>e</hi> &amp; <hi>i,</hi> saying, <hi>Deius</hi> for <hi>Deus.</hi> They of lower <hi>Germany</hi> doe all expresse <hi>u</hi> &amp; <hi>e,</hi> in stead of the Vowel <hi>u.</hi> Which errours, though the <hi>Germane</hi> speech doe often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, yet doth the Latine tongue, which hath the affinitie with ours, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly abhorre them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Let a Singer take heed, least he begin too loud braying like an Asse, or when he hath begun with an vneuen height, disgrace the Song. For God is not pleased with loude cryes, but with louely sounds: it is not (saith our <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus)</hi> the noyse of the lips, but the ardent desire of the Art, which like the lowdest voice doth pierce Gods eares. <hi>Moses</hi> spake not, yet heard these words, <hi>Why doest thou cry vnto me?</hi> But why the Saxons, and those that dwell vpon the Balticke coast, should so delight in such clamouring, there is no reason, but either because they haue a deafe God, or because they thinke he is gone to the South-side of heauen, and therefore cannot so easily heare both the Easterlings, and the Southerlings.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Let euery Singer discerne the difference of one holiday from another, least on a sleight Holiday, he either make too solemne seruice, or too sleight on a great.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The vncomely gaping of the mouth, and vngracefull motion of the body, is a signe of a mad Singer.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Aboue all things, let the Singer study to please God, and not men; (saith <hi>Guido)</hi> there are foolish Singers, who contemne the deuotion they should seeke after? and affect the wantonnesse which they should shun: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they intend their singing to men, not to God: seeking for a little world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fame, that so they may loose the eternall glory: pleasing men that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may displease God: imparting to other that deuotion, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues want: seeking the fauour of the creature, contemning the loue of the Creatour: to whom is due all honour, and reuerence, and seruice. To whom I doe deuote myselfe, and all that is mine, to him will I sing as long as I haue being: for he hath raised me (poore Wretch) from the earth, and from the meanest basenesse. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blessed be his Name world without end, Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am to intreat the curteous Reader fauourably to view this Worke of Musical</hi> Theorems, <hi>which I haue before this some yeres past searched out, &amp; now at last put into the forme of a booke and printed, not out of any arrogant humour, as some enuious persons wil report, but out of a desire to profit the Youth of Germany, whilst others are drousie. If the basenes of the stile, or simplenes of the words offend any man, I intreat him to attribute that to the matter which we handle, and the persons for whom it is written, namely, Children. I doubt not but there will be some, that will be soone ready to snarle at it, and to backbite it, contemning it before they read it, and disgracing it before they vnderstand it. Who had rather seeme than be Musitians, not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authors, or Precepts, or Reasons: but whatsoeuer comes into their haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braind Cockscombe, accounting that onely lawful, artificiall, and Musicall. To whom I intreat you (gentle Readers) to lend no eare. For it is a thing praise-worthy to displease the euill. Yea, (to vse the sentence of</hi> Antisthenes <hi>the Philosopher) to be backbited is a signe of greatnesse; to backebite, a token of meanesse. And because the praise of one wise man is better than the commendation of Ten fooles; I pray consider not the number, but the quality of those detractors: and thinke what an easie matter it is to silence those Pyes, and to crush such Fleas euen betwixt two nayles. Neither hearken ye to those that hate the Art: for they dissuade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from that which their dulnesse will not suffer them to attaine to, for in vaine it is to harpe before an Asse. But account that this I speake to you as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, because I haue passed the Ferrular. For the cunning men in each Art must be beleeued, as the Emperours Maiestie saith. Wherefore let those courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (that be delighted with</hi> Ornithoparchus <hi>his paines taken) be contented with these few things, for as soone as I can but take breath, they shall see matters of greater worth.</hi>
