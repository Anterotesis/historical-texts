            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SEduced &amp; diſvnited Brethren, there be two grand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, that ſeduce the ſoules of the ſimple, &amp; lead them to perdition: <hi>Lying wonders,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit zeale.</hi> The power of theſe two, the ſpirit of God hath most liuely expreſſed vnto vs, one in the perſon of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> the Sorcerer, who with his lying wonders had ſo bewitched the ſimple people, as they followed him with this acclamation: <hi>This man is the power of the great and mighty GOD.</hi> The other in the perſon of ſome of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who by the feigned zeale of the counterfeite Apostles, were bewitched, and carried from S. <hi>Paule,</hi> the true and bleſſed Apostle of our Sauiour Christ. Theſe two witching powers haue many yeeres ſince combined and vnited themſelues in the Pope of Rome, and his diſciples, who take vpon them the ſoueraigne power of our ſauiour Christ, with authority to commaund vncleane ſpirits, and to make them obey: and doe pretend ſuch a burning holy zeale vnto you, as that they regard neither the pleaſures, profits, nor prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world, nay not theyr owne liberty, and liues, but doe offer them vp both as a ſacrifice for your ſoules conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are mighty powers to ſway your iudgements, and affections from vs vnto them. Now if it ſhall appeare vnto you as cleere, as the light of the ſunne, that theſe powers be feigned, and counterfeite in them, and that they be in truth nothing els, ſaue the mists, and alluſions of Satan, to dimme
<pb facs="tcp:21637:3"/>
the ey of your vnderstanding, and bewitch your affections to doate vppon theyr impious ſuperſtition, what can you, or any ingenious ſpirits doe leſſe, then bewaile your ſeduced miſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto vs, and to account them as the grand Impoſtors, and enchaunters of your ſoules? And that this may be cleerly manifested vnto you, I beſeech you in the bowels of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour, to let open your eares &amp; eyes to this ſhort decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: to peruſe and read it with a ſingle ey, and impartiall affection, and if it ſhall not moſt perspicuouſly appeare vnto you, that the Pope, and his ſpirits he ſendeth in here amongst you, do play Almighty God, his ſonne, &amp; Saints vpon a ſtage, do make a pageant of the Church, the bleſſed Sacraments, the rites &amp; ceremonies of religion, do cog &amp; coine deuils, ſpirits, &amp; ſoules departed this life, to countenance and grace, or face out their desperate abhominations, then ſtand diſvnited, and diſaffected as you doe. It is not in any man (I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe) to feele thoſe diuine beames of burning zeale that were in S. <hi>Paule,</hi> who wiſhed himſelfe <hi>Anathema</hi> for his kinſmen according to the fleſh: yet a man of <hi>Ionas</hi> ſpirit I can eaſily name, that would most gladly be caſt into the ſea, to calme this tempeſt of oppoſition riſen here amongst vs, and of <hi>Ieremies</hi> deuotion, that doth pray for a fountaine of teares to bewaile the lamentable blindnes of his owne nation, that men as you are, borne free of an vnderstanding ſpirit, and ingenious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſhould ſo baſely degenerate, as to captiuate your wits, wils, &amp; ſpirits, to a forraine Idol Gull, compoſed of palpable fiction, and diabolicall faſcination, whoſe enchaunted chalice of heatheniſh drugs, &amp; Lamian ſuperstition, hath the power of <hi>Circes,</hi> and <hi>Medaeas</hi> cup, to metamorphoſe men into aſſes, bayards, &amp; ſwine. Is it not their owne brand they haue ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on your forheads, that England hath beene alwayes good aſſe to the Pope?</p>
                  <p>Who doth not bewaile the ſely doating Indian Nation, that falls downe and performes diuine adoration to a rag of red cloth: and the beſotted Aegyptians, that kiſſed with earnest deuotion the Aſſe vppon which the Idol <hi>Iſis</hi> ſate, and the
<pb facs="tcp:21637:3"/>
lymphaticall priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> that launced theyr owne fleſh before an Idol of wood? Would God your bewitched dotage were not as palpable, and more lamentable then theyrs, that fall downe &amp; adore a morſell of bread, that kiſſe &amp; clip with religious deuotion the Popes toe, for bearing the feigned coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of our Sauiour on earth: performed with the right Aegyptian gloſe, <hi>non Papae ſed Petro, non aſinae ſed deae,</hi> this honour is not to the Pope, but to <hi>S.

                  <p>What people, but you, were euer ſo bewitched, as to be borne in hand, that a houſe was carried in the ayre from <hi>Paleſtina</hi> to <hi>Loretto:</hi> that a painted Image in a wall, doth worke as high miracles, as euer were performed by the eternall ſonne of God: that the prints of S. <hi>Frauncis</hi> ſtripes, the tayle of our Sauiours Aſſe, the milke of our bleſſed Lady are this day to be ſeene: and theſe graceleſſe ſaltleſſe gulleries either to be belieued, or countenaunced, by men of wit, vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpirit, ſuch as are this day many in the Romiſh Church? If you aske me the cauſe, what can it be but this, that God hath giuen them ouer to the ſpirit of illuſion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue vnſauory lies, for refuſing in their pride to embrace the pure naked ſynceritie of the Gospell of Christ. He that ſits in the heauens, Almighty God, with his Angels, and Saints, do laugh theſe miſhapen monsters to ſcorne.</p>
                  <p>And who can but bleede in hart, to ſee you as farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched on our impoſturiſing renagadoes, that come freſh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Popes tyring houſe, masked with the vizard of holy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning zeale.

of great Potentates, vntill Gods reuengefull arme doth vncaſe them to the view of the world, &amp; then they ſuffer the mild ſtroke of iustice with a glorious ostentation, as you in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled ſimplicitie doe imagine for theyr conceited religion: but as the wiſer ſee, the ſtate did alwaies know, and is of late publiſhed in theyr own writings, for high &amp; odious treaſons: and profeſſed by their owne Maisters, that haue made them after their own images, to be of a ſpirit of contradiction to our Gouernours and Prince: and it is wondred at by themſelues, conſidering theyr treaſonable machinations that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſtate, haue carried ſo milde, and mercifull an hand ouer them, &amp; that any one of them is left aliue to libell against the admirable lenity of her Maiesties gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Wherein be ye well aſſured, that if the ſword of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were drawne, and inflicted according to the waight and meaſure of their detestable deſignes, that fewer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would come ouer, and that this couey of night-birds, would ſhrowde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues warme vnder the gentle wings of theyr holy father at Rome.

What did <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> vppon the hill <hi>Aetna</hi> to get himſelfe a name, but cast himſelfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the burning flames? What doe the Indian-priests at this day, but ſacrifice themſelues for the countenauncing of theyr diabolicall incantation. It is no new, nor ſtrange thing for the authors, and maintainers of ſects, and factions in all kindes, to die with ſeeming ſhew of glorious reſolution. Doe but ſeriouſly recount the quality of this fugitiue generation, &amp; ſee what pious reſolution can lodge in theyr breasts. What are they afore they goe ouer but diſcontended, ruinate, ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall refuſe people: of a factious, ambitious, exorbitant conuerſation abroade, exploded, or cunningly diſcarded their owne Societies where they liued: and how ghostly &amp; priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they demeane the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues here amongst you at theyr returne, I referre you for demonstation to this ſhort, and perſpicuous

declaration. Wherein you may plainly ſee, if you doe not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully hoodwinke your owne eyes, that the holy pretended hote zeale of the fiery ſpirits from Rome, is the meer Heatheniſh iugling of <hi>Bells</hi> priests, to deuour your goods, lands, &amp; patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the rights of your posterity, and auncient monuments of your name, to defraude your children of theyr bread, and cauſe you offer it to impure dogs, to enrich theyr owne Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Colledges, &amp; Churches, with the ſpoyles of your deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to defile your chast houſes, pollute your tender virgins, depraue, and inueigle your owne wiues lying in your boſoms, eſpecally by that poyſonable engine of hypocriticall Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finally to offer you vp as a pray to that Monster of Rome, the head of all vnnaturall and detestable rebellion.</p>
                  <p>And that this declaration might be free from the carpe, and cauill of ill-affected, or diſcompoſed ſpirits, I haue alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nothing for materiall, or authenticall heerein, but the expreſſe words, eyther of ſome part of the <hi>Miracle booke,</hi> penned by the priests, and filed vpon Record, where it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique to be ſeene, or els a clauſe of theyr confeſſion who were fellow actors in this impious diſſimulation. Whoſe ſeuerall confeſſions, and contestations (the parties beeing yet liuing) are heere publiſhed in print, that the world may be a witneſſe of our integrity herein. All which had beene long ere this offered to your equall conſideration, but that the <hi>Miracle-booke</hi> came but lately to hand, &amp; the getting of foure chiefe Daemoniacks together, beſides many more aſſistants, beeing perſons of that quality and condition, was a matter of ſome paines, and trauell to effect.</p>
                  <p>If the forme and phraſe be distasting to ſome clowdy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as too light, and ironicall for one of my profeſſion, let the matter be my Aduocat, that draweth me thereunto, and the manner my Apologie a little too: trusting I may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to iest at their iesting, that haue made a iest of God, and of his bleſſed Saints in heauen. If I haue wittingly falſified or feigned any thing out of that booke of wonders, God doe ſo to me, and more, for dooing them ſo much wrong: but if all
<pb facs="tcp:21637:5"/>
be truly, and authentically ſet downe, giue GOD his glorie, his Church her honor, your Soueraigne her allegeance, your Brethren theyr due affection, and the Pope, and his iugling companions, their deſerued detestation. And ſo I leaue you to the protector of all truth, and the reuenger of all falſhood, and hypocriticall diſſimulation.</p>

                     <p>ABout ſome three, or foure yeeres ſince, there was found in the hands of one Ma. <hi>Barnes</hi> a Popiſh Recuſant, an Engliſh Treatiſe in a written hand, fronted with this Latine ſentence, taken out of the Pſalmes, <hi>Venite, et narrabo, quanta fecit Dominus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae meae,</hi> come and I wil ſhew you, what great things the Lord hath done for my ſoule. Which treatiſe when we had peruſed vppon this holy inuitation, we found it a holie fardell of holy reliques, holy charmes, and holy conſecrated things, applied to the caſting out of many thouſands of deuils, out of ſix young perſons, 3. young men, and three proper young maides, accompliſhed by the meanes of Fa: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> alias <hi>Weston,</hi> a principall Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his order in thoſe times, &amp; twelue ſecular Prieſts, his reuerend aſſiſtants.</p>

                     <p>This play of ſacred miracles, was performed in ſundry houſes acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate for the feate, in the houſe of the <hi>L. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux</hi> at <hi>Hackney,</hi> of Ma: <hi>Barnes</hi> at <hi>Fulmer,</hi> of Ma: <hi>Hughes</hi> at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> of Sir <hi>George Peckham</hi> at <hi>Denham,</hi> and of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Lincolne</hi> in <hi>Chanon Row</hi> in London.

                     <p>IT hath been alwaies the ill fortune of this holy order of <hi>Exorcists,</hi> that the profeſſors of it haue been repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errand Iuglers and Impoſtors, yea ſometimes, by the greateſt protectors of theyr owne religion. A great man told <hi>Mengus,</hi> that if there were fiftie Exorciſts at once ſtanding before him, hee ſhould deeme nine and fortie of them for no better then Impoſtors, and <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> (as ſeemes) was afraid himſelfe ſhould haue made vp iuſt tale. Wherefore the Maiſters of the Art, haue ſo warily deuiſed theyr rules, and canons, as a man may ſee they labour to preoccupate mens minds for feare of ſuſpition, which giues the greater occaſion to ſuſpect them the more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mengus</hi> his caueat of declaring places not meete for exorciſme is this: <hi>Praecauere debet Exorcista quantum poteſt,</hi>

occaſion to ſuſpect the action of fraude. 2. <hi>Tum quia in domibus priuatis, vt in pluribus, ad ſunt mulieres, quarum conſortium debet ſummopere ab exorcistis vitari, ne inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in laqueum diaboli:</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe in priuate houſes, there are commonly ſome women, whoſe company the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists ought to decline, least happilie they fall into the ſnares of the deuill.</hi> 3. <hi>Tum quia ibifiunt multa turpia, tacenda po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, quam hîc inſerenda:</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe in ſuch houſes, turpitudes be committed, meeter to be ſilenced, then heere to be named.</hi> 4. <hi>Tum quia Eccleſia propriè eſt locus deputatus vbi Euergumeni debent exorcizari:</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe the Church is properly the place appointed to that action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the poſſeſſed ought to be exorciſed.</hi> And what need theſe cautious rules, to auoyde ſuſpition of <hi>iugling, turpitude,</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> if nothing were amiſſe? Auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is an holie action of more priuacie, ſolitude, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with women, yet becauſe no man (vvithout reaſon) may ſuſpect, but that all is wel between a ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, and his ghoſtly child, there be no rules made of <hi>iugling, turpitude,</hi> or <hi>women</hi> in that myſticall function. Sure all is not well in this exorciſing craft, that <hi>iugling, turpitude,</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> muſt be ſo preciſely auoided.</p>
                     <p>Indeed wheras in his 17. chapter fa: <hi>Mengus</hi> diſputes, that though exorciſing ought to be done in the church, yet the doores of the Church may be cloſe ſhut about them: his fatherhood giues vs iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that though he would ſeeme to haue it publique, touching the place, for a ſeeming ſhew of auoyding <hi>iugling, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude,</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> yet he can be content by ſhutting the doores, to haue it priuately done: or ſuch onely let in, as the Exorciſt beſt liketh.</p>
                     <p>See the practiſe heereof in the iugling Exorciſts at <hi>Paris,</hi> anno 1599, who to make a ſhew of auoyding of that, which they onely intended, iugling deceit,<note place="margin">Page. 6. of that booke.</note> they muſt haue theyr Minion <hi>Martha Broſſier</hi> exorciſed in a Chappell forſooth: but yet with ſuch a warie eye caſt

vpon the ſpectators, as there comming in amongſt the reſt one <hi>Mareſcot</hi> a Phyſician, a man they did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Seraphin</hi> the holy Exorciſt cries out with a loude voice, <hi>if there be any heere that is incredulous, &amp; will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Martha Broſſier, <hi>the deuill will carry him away in the ayre.</hi> Wherefore yee ſee it was very wiſely prouided of <hi>Mengus,</hi> to haue an eye to the doore: the like ill-fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accident fell out amongſt our holy crew, at theyr principall Theatre, Sir <hi>George Peckhams</hi> houſe at <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> where for want of hauing a watch at the doore, there comes in one Ma: <hi>Hambden</hi> of <hi>Hambden,</hi> who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the <hi>incredulous</hi> perſons, that <hi>F.

                        <hi>&amp; I maruaile that the houſe ſinketh not for ſuch wickednes committed in it:</hi> and ſo departing vtterly diſcontent: this <hi>incredulous</hi> ſpectator ſo skared our holy actors with feare, that they ſlunke out of the houſe euery man his way, as a dogge that had been bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the tayle, and leauing theyr patients alone, gaue the deuils an <hi>otium,</hi> or leaue to play for that night.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs looke in a little amongſt our twelue holy Exorciſtes, or rather twelue holy diſciples, and Fa: <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> theyr holy head: who though they be not a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet by this time they are whetting theyr tooles: and let vs ſee, how warily they haue put in vre theyr Maiſter <hi>Mengus</hi> his canon, of chooſing a Chappell, or holy publique place to exorciſe in, for feare of ſuſpition of <hi>iugling, turpitude,</hi> and <hi>women.</hi> Firſt, it doth not appeare that they acted any of theyr wonderous diſpoſſeſſions in any Church, Chappell, or conſecrated place, as <hi>F. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> had appointed them: except happily they ſlipped into ſome Noble mans voide houſe in London: which houſes, in regard of theyr owners callings, being aboue reach of authority, are commonly now adayes the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries for Popiſh treaſon, conſiſtories for plots of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21637:10"/>
and Chappels for all Romiſh loathſome abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: not that the Noble men themſelues are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie to ſuch meetings, but theyr corrupt houſe-keepers much in fault for entertayning ſuch gueſts: and yet the owners themſelues not altogether free from blame, for making no better choiſe of thoſe, to whom they commit that charge.</p>
                     <p>But it appeares not (as I ſaid) that they met in any chappel, or holy place at all: but the chief places of their ſolemne meetings, were the L. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux</hi> his houſe at <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> neere London, Maiſter <hi>Gardiners</hi> houſe at <hi>Fulmer,</hi> Ma: <hi>Hughes</hi> his houſe at <hi>

Next, for theyr ſecurity, the owners beeing truſtie tried ſure cardes, and commaunders of theyr neighbours adioyning, if any ſuſpition ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe: and then for their ſituation, beeing remote and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe from ordinary acceſſe.</p>
                     <p>At the L. <hi>Vaux</hi> his houſe at <hi>Hackney,</hi> was the prime grand miracle performed, by the grand Maiſter of the craft, Fa: <hi>Weston</hi> himſelfe, vppon one <hi>Marwood,</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to <hi>Babington</hi> the traytor: where a wonderful thing fell out. Fa: <hi>Weston,</hi> at the very firſt encounter with the deuill, ſtunted the deuils wits, and the deuill being once put out, could neuer hit in againe, but vntruſſes, and cries out, <hi>O me ſtultum, inſanum, et infaelicem: O fooliſh,</hi>

                        <hi>mad, and miſerable deuill that I am:</hi> which put all the whole company of ſpectators into ſuch aſtoniſhment, as there was a confuſed ſhout made of weeping, &amp; ioy, for this foyle of the deuill. And the Epilogue was this, <hi>O Catholicam fidem, ô inſenſatos haereticos: O the Catholick faith, ô ſenceleſſe haereticks,</hi> that could neuer learne the feate, to skare a deuill from his wits.</p>

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21637:11"/>At <hi>Fulmer</hi> houſe there were no great miracles done, onely the groundes of theyr Art layde ſure, and a little trying of their tooles, whether their tew would holde or no.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Vxbridge</hi> they lay but two or three nights at the moſt, and yet the place was graced with a punie mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or two. <hi>Dibdale</hi> the Prieſt had his wench ſet ſo cloſe vnto him in the way thether, (for auoyding <hi>turpitude</hi> &amp; <hi>women</hi>) as ſhe felt her ſelfe to burne, &amp; could hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the heate of the holy man. <hi>Trayford</hi> cryes out by the way <hi>water, water,</hi> as the Frier did that by <hi>Abſolon</hi> in <hi>Chawcer</hi> was ſcalded in the toote. And thus were theyr Journalls towards <hi>Denham,</hi> where the Court ſtayed: the hangings were tricked vp, the houſes made ready, and the greateſt part of the wonders of this comaedie was performed. Their harbinger, and hoſt both, in all theſe iournies (for the owners of houſes, and theyr families, ſtill left theyr owne houſes, and made all cleere for theſe holy comaedians, as is vſed to be done towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a Court) was one <hi>Edm: Peckham;</hi> an excellent purueior for ſuch a campe; one of a very ruinate eſtate, an intemperate diſpoſition, an vncleane conuerſation, &amp; a man ſo deeply engaged to this holy band, as that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his wife, his concubine, and his whole familie liued wholy at their charge. This is the man that ſtil furniſhed the camp with all kind of luggage, and pleaſing prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that ſcoures the coaſts, to ſee that all be cleere, that lookes to the truſſes, and fardels, that no iugling ſticks be left out: the ſacriſt of theſe holy myſteries, playing himſelfe fiue or ſix parts in this comaedie: the harbinger, the hoſt, the ſteward, the vaunt courrier, the ſacriſt, and the Pandar. And this ſhall ſuffice touching their places in generall: more ſpeciall conſiderations of the ſame, you ſhall heare in the chapter enſuing.</p>

                        <hi>VIno vendibili non opus est hedera. Weston,</hi> in regard of his owne fame, needed nothing more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, to commend him in this admirable ſcience: but his 12 diſciples being but punies, and newly entred by him into the ſchoole of legerdemaine, ſtoode in neede of ſome grace, and commendation, to bring themſelues into cuſtome: therefore, like wiſe retaylers, they choſe vnto themſelues places of aduantage, to aduaunce their profeſſion. Where it is to be obſerued, that whileſt the chiefe of the Popiſh holy body heere in England had their heads, harts, and hands full of practiſes of treaſon; ſome other Prieſts there were that beſtirred themſelues. as faſt in imploying all their wit, and skill, about getting into their hands huge mines, and maſſes of gold, ſiluer, and treaſure (called by the Artiſans in that myſterie <hi>Treaſure Trouvé</hi>) ſuppoſed to be hidden, in diuers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, woods, &amp; plots of ground heere in England: vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to furniſh the heads and leaders of the conſpirators for their holy ſeruice, they had in hand againſt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the ſtate, or to enrich their owne cofers, I leaue it to coniecture.</p>
                     <p>For compaſſing of this treaſure, there was a conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene 3 or 4 prieſts, <hi>deuill-coniurers,</hi> and 4 <hi>diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerers,</hi> or <hi>ſeers,</hi> reputed to carry about with them, their familiars in rings, and glaſſes, by whoſe ſuggeſtion they came to notice of thoſe golden hoards. The names of the <hi>diſcouerers,</hi> or <hi>ſeers,</hi> were theſe: <hi>Smith, Rickston, Goodgame,</hi> and <hi>Iames Phiſwick.</hi> The names of the <hi>deuill-coniuring</hi> prieſts, for ſome reaſons I forbeare: and two of the places (amongſt many) wherein they dealt were <hi>Denham,</hi> and <hi>Fulmer.</hi>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21637:12"/>Touching <hi>Denham</hi> the Gentleman, chiefe owner of the Manor, teſtifieth that the 4 <hi>ſeers,</hi> or impoſtors, had borne him in hand, that there was great ſtore of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Trouvè,</hi> hidden in his ſaid Manor, and appointed him a night certaine, when to digge for the ſame, which time they kept: and that himſelfe with diuers of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants being preſent, there was nothing found, but olde empty earthen pots. And concerning <hi>Fulmer,</hi> the ſame Gentleman tells vs alſo, that the impoſtors afore-ſaid, departed from his houſe to <hi>Fulmer.</hi> But the <hi>penner of theſe miracles,</hi> remembers more diſtinctly, both the yeere, moneth, and day, when they went thither. The 22 of <hi>October,</hi> anno 84. there came 3 coniurers to <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> vpon a Thurſday (ſaith he) and there remained wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their Arte, vntill the Tueſday following.</p>
                     <p>Vpon occaſion of the practitioning of theſe coſeners, and deuill coniuring prieſts for money, was phancied a conceite, and from phancie grew rumours, and tales, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the common ſort (as vpon any ſleight occaſion of ſuch matters, haue vſed to be) of ſpirits, deuils, and bug-beares, walking, and haunting thoſe places, and houſes where the coniuring had beene. <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> one of their patients, ſaith, <hi>That ſhee had not beene long at</hi> Fulmer, <hi>but ſhe heard ſay, that the houſe was troubled with ſpirits.</hi> The <hi>penner of the miracles,</hi> as if he meant to ſcare vs with the very noyſe, reports vs the manner of the Hobgoblins in a very tragicall ſtile. <hi>The whole houſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was haunted in very terrible manner, molesting all that were in the ſame,</hi>

                        <hi>by locking, and vnlocking of dores, tinckling amongst the fier-ſhouels, and the tonges, ratling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the boards, ſcraping vnder their beds, and blowing out the candels, except they were halowed.</hi> And further, that theſe ill mannered vrchins, did ſo ſvvarme about the prieſts, in ſuch troupes, and thronges, <hi>that they made them ſometimes to ſweat,</hi> as ſeemes, with the very heate of the fume, that came from the deuils noſes.

a pittifull poſſeſſed, doth affirme, that within a day, or two after his comming to <hi>Denham,</hi> the maid-cooke told him, that there was great walking of ſpirits about the houſe, and that diuers had beene greatly affrighted by them. And if you will not beleeue theſe, beleeue the deuill himſelfe in his Dialogue with <hi>Dibdale,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page, 25, of the book of miracles.</note> crying in his deuils roaring voyce, that <hi>he came thither for</hi> Money, Money.</p>
                     <p>And if you happen to wonder, why I called theſe houſes of <hi>Denham,</hi> and <hi>Fulmer,</hi> in the beginning of this chapter, aduantagious vnto our holy impoſtors, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Fa: <hi>Mengus</hi> his rule of places for exorciſing, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, that they muſt be conſecrated, halowed, or holy places at leaſt, you will wonder ſomewhat more, when you heare Fa: <hi>Thyraeus</hi> preſcribing, that at any hand before the holy workes of exorciſing, the ill affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted party be begun, firſt, and aboue all, to purifie, and exorciſe the place, that the houſe being cleanſed from thoſe troubleſome haunting companions, that doe <hi>make men ſweate,</hi> the holy worke may proceede the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and with better ſucceſſe.</p>
                     <p>Where by the way you are to obſerue out of learned <hi>Thyraeus</hi> his 70 Chapter <hi>De locis infestis:</hi> the whole courſe heereof, that is, of exorciſing the places. Which muſt be performed by theſe <hi>5</hi> holy works: <hi>Diuini aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilij imploratione: pſalmorum gradualium recitatione: lectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Euangelij: thurificatione: et concluſione. By calling vpon God, the bleſſed virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and the Saints: by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer the 15 graduall Pſalmes: by reading ouer the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of S.</hi> Iohn, <hi>concerning</hi> Zacchaeus <hi>climing vp into a tree: by holy fumigations: and the Epilogue of the whole worke.</hi> Theſe be the fiue holy ſcare-deuils, which our Exorciſts ſhould haue vſed, to haue driuen the deuils from the houſe. And heere I muſt needes ſhame my ſelfe, and lay open vnto you, the ſhallowneſſe of my wit, that is not able to diue into the bottom of this ſacred myſterie:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21637:13"/>
why aboue all other Goſpels, the Goſpell of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> touching <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> climbing into a tree, ſhould haue ſuch a potency to fright a deuill out of a houſe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any hidden antipathie between the nature of deuils, and a Sycamore tree, as was between <hi>Scaliger</hi> and a Rat: or that the deuill bare a ſpight to the tree, for helping low <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> to ſee our Sauiour paſſe by: or that the deuill had himſelfe ſome miſchance out of the tree: or that our Sauiours dinner at <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> houſe was dreſſed with the wood of that tree: or els his croſſe for haſt made of that tree, <hi>Oedipo opus est,</hi> I am at a full point. And if I ſend you to <hi>Thyraeus,</hi> to vnridle the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, I doubt you will laught at him, as you doe at me.</p>
                     <p>Howſoeuer it be, our holy Exorciſts vſed neyther that, nor any other of the fiue terrors, to flight the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils from <hi>Fulmer,</hi> nor <hi>Denham,</hi> but were content vvith theyr companie, and fell to theyr worke. And heerein they ſhewed a part of theyr greateſt skill of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Firſt, this fabulous rumor of the houſes haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with deuils, did blanch ouer, and blaze theyr Art the more of <hi>casting deuills out,</hi> and ſo brought them into credit. Secondly, if they had read the Goſpell touching <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> and skared them away, they had wanted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils to furniſh out the pageant. Thirdly, it bred a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend opinion, and an admiration in all that came to ſee wonders, at the vertue, and holineſſe of the Prieſts, that durſt walke vp and downe amongſt the thickeſt ſwarme of deuils, and neuer a deuill ſo hardy as to touch an haire of their beards. Fourthly, it ſerued their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes excellent well to couer their bungling, iugling, &amp; legerdemaine, in that the ſeruants of the houſes hauing their phancies oppreſſed with the conceit of ſpirits, and deuils haunting in euery corner of the houſe, they were ſo diſtracted with feare, as they had vſe of neither wit, nor will, to doubt, or looke into their packing.</p>
                     <p>And by this you ſee our punie Exorciſts, as young as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21637:13"/>
they be, ſhewed more wit, and skill, then either <hi>Mengus</hi> their Maiſter, or <hi>Thyraeus</hi> their prompter, in picking out theſe places of Hobgoblins, to make the ſtages for their Comaedy, and not offering firſt by holy fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſcare the vrchins away. One doubt I haue more, wherein I muſt craue your gentle aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Some curious head, more nice then needes, may pick at a moate, and aske mee two or three queſtions out of this narration. Firſt, whether a man may be a coniurer, ſorcerer, or Enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter; that is, enter into league, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and familiarity with the deuill, as the prieſtes that coniured for mony at <hi>Denham</hi> did, and yet be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ghoſtly Confeſſor, a reuerend father, and an holy prieſt ſtill? A ſimple doubt God wote. <hi>Syluester, Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius,</hi> and ſome other Popes, haue beene errand deuill-coniurers, and yet theyr holineſſe not an halfepeny the worſe. This ſimple queſtioniſt muſt vnderſtand, that God hath tied the ſpirit of holines with ſo ſure a chaine to S. <hi>Peters</hi> chayre, as that let the Pope, or any popeling, be an Ethnick, a Turke, a Saracen, or a deuill, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auoide it, but by ſitting in that chaire he muſt weare out his holineſſe, and be holy ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if he would know how it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the famous <hi>Thyraeus</hi> hauing laboured, and ſweat ſo much to ſet downe all the cauſes, waies, &amp; meanes, how wicked ſpirits doe come to haunt houſes, and hauing by the dexteritie of his wit found out twelue waies, this way of haunting houſes after coniuration, is none of his twelue: vve muſt tell him, that our Exorciſts are not of his old plodding faſhion, but of the new cut, &amp; ſuch, as you ſhall find, (by that time you haue them a little hote in theyr worke) will ſet <hi>Mengus, Thyraeus,</hi> and <hi>Sprenger</hi> to ſchoole.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if hee tell vs by the rules of that blacke Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke Art, concerning coniuring vp of ſpirits, that the Coniurers great art, and induſtrie, is not ſo much in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21637:14"/>
vp a ſpirit, as in commaunding him downe againe, and that if hee cannot lay him downe quiet, the Artiſt himſelfe, and all his companie, are in danger to be torne in peeces by him; and that hee is ſo violent, boyſtrous, and bigge, as that he will ruffle, rage, and hurle in the ayre, worſe then angry God <hi>Aeolus</hi> euer did, and blow downe ſteeples, trees, may-poles, and keepe a fell coyle in the world. And vppon this will be queſtioning, how it happened heere, that our haunting ſpirits at <hi>Denham,</hi> and <hi>Fulmer,</hi> rayſed by the blacke Art, did not ruffle and rage in the world, as thoſe coniured ſpirits vſe to do, but did put theyr heads in a bench-hole for a twelue month together, till theſe holy good men came to theyr work? I muſt tell him, that our haunting ſpirits were of a more mild, calme, and kinde diſpoſition, louing the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of wenches, and holy prieſtes; and for theyr ſtaying ſo long about the houſe, as Rats about a Barne, wee ſay they did that kindly, expecting the prieſts theyr holie Maiſters to come to ſet them a worke. And ſo theſe quiddities being ſatisfied, I hope I may proceed.</p>

that they had as good play their parts well, and haue good cheere, good ſtore of gold, much making of, and other gentle pleaſing curteſies for their paines, as by ſtepping aſide, to ſpoyle the play, &amp; to blot their owne reputations beſides.</p>
                     <p>We might now proceede towards the preſenting of ſome of our Actors vpon the ſtage, but that old doating <hi>Mengus,</hi> vppon pure ſpight to hinder our ſport, hath dropped out a dry thred-bare rule, forged in his own braine: A caueat of auoyding ſuſpition forſooth: telling vs, that we haue marred all in our holy play of deuils at firſt daſh, for taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to exorciſe young wenches, beeing flatly againſt the Canon of that ſacred Science, which is this in his booke, <hi>Si mulier ſit, quae exorcizatur, ſit valde ſenex: We must not exorciſe a woman, except ſhe be old.</hi> To this Canon wee aunſwer, that <hi>Mengus</hi> ſpeakes like an olde worne Exorciſt, whoſe marke is out of his mouth: his rule hath many faults and infirmities in it. Firſt, it is againſt the maxime of charitie, that biddes vs doe good vnto all: and what greater good can be to a young maide, then to eaſe her of a deuill? Secondlie, we finde by experience, and the confeſſion of our young demoniacks, as you heard, that our exorciſing prieſts, be of a very hote temper, and fierie complexion, ſo as but touching the young wenches, they cry out that they burne, this were verie dangerous for an olde dry wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, leaſt ſhee ſhould take fire. Thirdly, this would much abate the credit, and cuſtome of <hi>Mengus</hi> his own profeſſion, for we find not an old woman in an age to be poſſeſſed by the deuill: the deuils of our time in this <hi>Horizon</hi> louing more tender daintie fleſh. And indeed it would be a <hi>Quaere,</hi> handſomly interlarded with <hi>Obs,</hi> and <hi>ſols,</hi> why all both Popiſh, and other deuils which begin to ſwarme prety well in theſe dayes, beare ſuch a ſpite to young Lads, but eſpecially to young girles, and maides, that they ordinarily, or not at all vexe any, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21637:16"/>
ſuch. But I leaue that to the profound Maiſters, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this holy helliſh ſcience. Fourthly, <hi>Mengus</hi> ſhewed no wit in teaching this rule: for there be certain actions, motions, diſtorſions, diſlocations, writhings, tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, and turbulent paſſions fitting a deuils part, (to make it kindly expreſſed) not to be performed but by ſuppleneſſe of ſinewes, pliableneſſe of ioynts, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of all parts, which an old body is as vnapt, and vnweldie vnto, as an old dog to a daunce. It would (I feare mee) poſe all the cunning Exorciſts, that are this day to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to teach an old corkie woman to writhe, tumble, curuet, &amp; fetch her Morice gamboles, as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha Broſſier</hi> did.

The wicked ſpirit could not endure her, becauſe ſhe had waſhed amongſt her buck of cloathes a catholique prieſts ſhirt. <hi>Ieſu Maria.</hi> And a worſe thing in it then ſo: but I will giue the records leaue to ſpeake it for me. I truſt you will not looke for any other, after this dangerous fall on the hippe, but that this ſhould proue a reall poſſeſſion, as in deede it did.</p>
                     <p>Young <hi>Trayford</hi> the ſixth patient, being a boon-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, as ſeemes, and louing wine, and women well, (as appeares by the declaration) had enflamed his toe, and at ſome times felt a ſpice of the gowt: a plaine caſe (as the noſe on a mans face) the young man had a deuill, and muſt be coniured all ouer for his wicked toe. Now what a wofull taking are all thoſe poore creatures in, that haue about them by birth, caſualty, or miſhap any cloſe imper, ache, or other more ſecret infirmity? when a paine in a maides belly, a ſtitch in her ſide, an ache in her head, a crampe in her legge, a tinckling in her toe, (if the good Exorciſt pleaſe) muſt needes hatch a deuil, and bringforth ſuch chaire-worke, fier-worke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill-worke, as you ſhall heare heereafter? And what a deliration is this in our graue, learned, and famous Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of auncient renowmed Phyſicians, to vndertake a long, coſtly, and painfull courſe of ſtudy in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worthies of learned times <hi>Galen, Hippocrates,</hi> and the reſt, and to ſpend their money, ſtrength, and ſpirits, in ſearching the treaſurie of Nature: let them caſsier
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21637:19"/>
thoſe olde monuments of Ethnick prophane learning, and turne Wiſard, Seer, Exorciſt, Iugler, or Witch: let them turne ouer but one new leafe in <hi>Sprenger, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Mengus,</hi> or <hi>Thyraeus,</hi> and ſee how to diſcouer a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in the Epilepſie, Mother, Crampe, Convulſion, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atica, or Gowt, and then learne a ſpell, an amulet, a periapt of a prieſt, and they ſhall get them more fame, and money in one week, then they doe now by all their painfull trauaile in a yeere.</p>
                     <p>It is a very poore bayte, as you may ſee by <hi>Trayfords</hi> gowtie toe, where-out our hungry Exorciſts will not, rather then faile, nibble a deuill. And if I be not much deceaued, I haue heard it credibly reported by ſome, that haue cauſe to know, that the Popes Holines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may be deuill-caught by this trick. For it is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly auouched, that this ſweet natured <hi>Clement</hi> the 8, with vſing too much ſome ſweet ſawce, is moleſted with the gowt. Now what a <hi>Quaere</hi> would this proue, if a <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi> Exorciſt ſhould diſcouer a deuill in his <hi>Holines</hi> toe? How would the <hi>Scotists,</hi> and <hi>Thomiſts</hi> belabour, and trick the deuill with queſtions in the Popes toe? Firſt, whether his <hi>Hol:</hi> being neceſſarily inueſted with the holy ſpirit of God, can poſſibly admit of a deuill, no. Then graunting by way of admittance, that his <hi>Hol:</hi> may be poſſeſſed, whether his reſolutions be to be taken for the Canons of Gods holy ſpirit, or the maximes of the deuill: and laſtly, if the deuill may lurk in the Popes toe, whether his wiſe, holy, ſweet babes with beards, that haue kiſſed his toe, haue kiſſed the deuill, yea or no in his toe: but my wit is too ſhallow, to ſound theſe deepe profundities: I muſt goe on, and tell you, what farther newes from <hi>Denham.</hi>

If their patients be Catholiques, whom they ſet their hooke for, a lime-twigge of a ruſh wil ſerue the turne to catch them, hold them, and faſten them to their tackling: but if their Conies be Proteſtants, and ſuch as goe to Church, then ſome holy ceremonies for good faſhion ſake, muſt be ſolemnly vſed, to combine them the neerer vnto their holy Fathers, that the band and knot may be the ſurer betweene them for vntying againe, and to bring them to lye betweene the ſweete breaſts of their holy Mother, the Romiſh Church: that the mammaday, which ſhall be giuen them, may doe them the more good.</p>

But our 12 Apoſtolicall Exorciſts, and <hi>Weston</hi> their head, in their deeper in-ſight, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vs Proteſtants, haue long ſince ſet olde <hi>Thyraeus</hi> to ſchoole, and bidden him turne ouer his booke to an other leafe: for they plainly ſee, teach, and auouch, that the greateſt part of vs Proteſtants, are poſſeſſed in deed. <hi>Sara Williams</hi> ſaith in her depoſition, that <hi>it was an vſuall ſaying with the Priests, that many Protestants were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But <hi>Friſwood</hi> goes further, &amp; ſayes in plaine termes, That <hi>the Priests in talking of the Protestants, haue affirmed of them in her hearing, that the greatest ſhare of them were poſſeſſed with deuils.</hi> I could wiſh, that whilſt our Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts are in this good mood to ſay, and auouch, that you haue deuils: and you in your good moode, for hearing them ſo ſay, that you had ſome 12 of their holieſt Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts amongſt you, and <hi>Weston</hi> their champion, to trie whether they could coniure a deuill out of you, or you coniure them, for ſaying you haue the deuil.

                     <p>Well, howſoeuer you like them, or theyr <hi>holy chaire,</hi> this is theyr theoreme ſure, and ſound, that the greateſt part of Proteſtants be poſſeſſed: and ſo they proceeded with <hi>Anne, Fid,</hi> and <hi>Sara.</hi> Who before they becam en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in their holy ginnes, were proteſtant maydes, &amp; went orderly to Church.

                     <p>Suppoſe now (gentle Reader) that <hi>Friſwoods</hi> Mother had come ſodainly in, and ſeene the Prieſt with his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell in his hand, and his Cope vpon his backe, buſie in his enchaunting Latine charme, and with-all had eſpied her daughter <hi>Friſwood</hi> muſled in her chaire of eſtate, with a cloath, and a Croſſe, and her other ſacred geare, I wonder what ſhe would ſodainly haue thought: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>But ſtay, what haſt?

                     <p>Heare Ma. <hi>Maynie</hi> theyr chiefe ſcholler, relate how by degrees hee grew to his perfection in the iugling ſchoole. <hi>First</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beeing at my L.</hi> Vaux <hi>his houſe at</hi> Hackney <hi>at dinner, in the dinner time there was much communication of the late poſſeſſion, and diſpoſſeſſion of one</hi> Marwood <hi>by certaine Prieſts, and chiefely (if I do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my ſelfe) by Ma.</hi> Edmunds: <hi>the tales which were told of that matter ſeemed ſtrange vnto mee, as what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrength he had in his fits, how he roared like a Bull,</hi> &amp; many other ſuch things. <hi>After this beeing at</hi> Denham, <hi>the women of the houſe came vnto me, and reported vnto me the manner of the fits of the two poſſeſſed in the houſe, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them in ſuch ſort, as I was much amazed therewith.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21637:24"/>
Then they permitted me to haue acceſſe vnto</hi> Sara Wil: <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was in her fits, and enformed mee likewiſe of the manner how ſhe, and others had been troubled: and when I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theyr humour, and perceiued as well by the rest, as by mine owne experience, what would content them, I framed my ſelfe accordingly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Loe here the Captaine of this holy ſchoole of leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine tells you, what was the higheſt point to be learned in this ſchoole, and what was the perfection of a ſcholler, of the higheſt forme: to wit, to <hi>frame</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues iumpe and fit vnto the Prieſts humors, to mop, mow, ieſt, raile, raue, roare, commend, &amp; diſcommend, and as the prieſts would haue them, vpon fitting occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (according to the difference of times, places, and commers in) in all things to play the deuils according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as Ma: <hi>Maynie</hi> heere ſaith, and his other play-deuils afore. As euery ſcholler in this ſchoole had the wit, and good grace to <hi>frame himſelfe</hi> betimes, to the bent of his holy Maiſter, and to act his feates kindly, roundly, and artificially at a beck, ſo was theyr proceeding with him, or her more gentle, and mild. For if he could once read his leſſon in his Maiſters eyes and face, what needed any other hard horne-booke to beate about his head: but if he were dull, and ſlow, vnto this <hi>framing himſelfe,</hi> and muſt heere his leſſon many times ſaid ouer by hart by the Prieſt, and yet could not learne his cue, or elſe not perfectly remember his ſeuerall changes, and keyes, why then hee muſt taſt of the diſcipline of the ſchoole, to rouze vp his ſpirits better, &amp; cauſe him entend his geare well; &amp; that was the diſcipline of the <hi>holy chaire,</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye ſhall heare anon) ſuch a diſcipline, as by that time it had been taſted ſoundly but once, or twice, I ſuppoſe the deuill himſelfe (if he could haue had the ſence of it, that theſe poore ſchollers had) would rather haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, to haue roared, fomed, &amp; wallowed, and haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him into all ſhapes, as the prieſts would haue him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21637:24"/>
then euer to haue endured, the courſe of the ſame. But his chayre could not be ſpared, for many good offices, and therefore of that more at large heereafter.</p>

                        <hi>At the end of the first Maſſe,</hi> (ſaith Fidd: Willi:) <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe ſaw, which was ſaid by Ma:</hi> Dibdale: <hi>hee told her,</hi>

Then they began to binde her with towells, whereat ſhe greatly meruailed, and was there-with cast into a great feare, as not knowing, what they meant to doe with her: being in this caſe, Ma:</hi> Dibdale <hi>began to reade
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21637:25"/>
in his booke of Exorciſing: and after a good while, ſeeing no other alteration in her, then the tokens of feare, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by reaſon of his words, and dealings, then they vrged her to drinke aboue a pinte of Sacke, and Sallet-oyle, being hallowed, and mingled with ſome kinde of ſpices: when ſhee tasted this drinke, which they termed, an</hi> holy potion, <hi>it did ſo much diſlike her, that ſhee could drinke but a little of it at once, her ſtomacke greatly loathing it, and then the Priest ſaid: all that came from the deuil, who hated nothing worſe, then that holy drinke: ſo as ſhe was held, and by very force cauſed to drinke it vp at diuers draughts. Heere-vpon ſhee grew to be very ſicke, and giddy in her head, and began to fall into a cold ſweat: verily then beleeuing, that (as the Priest ſaid) it was a wicked ſpirit, that cauſed her to be in ſuch caſe: whereas afterwards, when ſhe better had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their dealing with her, ſhee eaſily perceaued, that the drinke they gaue her was ſuch, as might haue made a horſe ſicke.</hi> This was the firſt part of the chayre-worke, and the ſecond was ſweeter then this. When her ſtomacke, head, and veines, were full of the holy drinke, then to take brimſtone, and burne it in a chafingdiſh of coales, and by force to hold downe her face ouer the fume. Which broyling with brimſtone Ma: <hi>Maynie</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he ſaw ſo butcherly practiſed vpon <hi>Sara Will: as hee had ſeene her face after it, looke more blacker, and ſwart, with the fume, then any chimney-ſweepers did.</hi>

                     <p>Now I preſent vnto your imaginations, <hi>Sara Will:</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bound in a chayre (as poore wench ſhee often did) with a pinte of this <hi>holy potion</hi> in her ſtomacke, working vp into her head, and out at her mouth, and her eyes, noſe, mouth, and head, ſtuffed full with the ſmoake of holy perfume, her face being held down ouer the fume, till it was all ouer, as blacke as a ſtocke, and think if you ſee not in your minde, the liuely <hi>Idaea</hi> of a poore deuill-diſtreſſed woman in deede.</p>
                     <p>And heere, leaſt good Father <hi>Mengus</hi> ſhould take it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21637:25"/>
in ill part, that we leaue him out of this deuilliſh worke, who had his greateſt part in preſcribing the perfume for the chayre, you ſhall firſt heare his <hi>Dos</hi> touching the bill for the holy perfume: and then I ſhall be able to giue you a perfect receite, to make an horſe poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>After his holy benediction, <hi>Page,</hi> 173. <hi>Flag: Daemon:</hi> this is his perfume. <hi>Accipiatur Sulphur, Galbanum, &amp; caet. Take brimstone,</hi> Aſſa faetida, Galbanum, <hi>S.</hi> Iohns Wort, <hi>and</hi> Rue. <hi>All theſe things being hallowed, according to their owne proper, and peculiar benediction, must be cast vpon the fire, and the ſmoake thereof applied to the noſethrills of the poſſeſſed.</hi> Now you haue your full number of ſimples, take your whole bill, to poſſeſſe a horſe with a deuill. Take a luſty young ſtond horſe, and tye him with a big rope to a Smiths forge, take the <hi>holy potion</hi> compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Rue, Sacke, Drugges, and Sallet-oyle <hi>Ana</hi> more then a pinte, put it with an horne downe into the horſes throat, that done, take Brimſtone, <hi>Aſſa faetida, Galbanum, S.

There is neither Horſe, nor Aſſe, nor Dogge, nor Ape, if he had beene vſed, as theſe poore ſeely creatures were, but would haue beene much more deuilliſhly affected then they. Neither is any man liuing (as I ſuppoſe) of that mortified patience, who would not be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with indignation, to heare the ſeely maides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the vſage of that holy infernall crue.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Fidd: Williams</hi> complaines, as ye haue heard in her relation, That <hi>it made her giddy, and cast her into a cold ſweat. 2, That it cast her into a rage, and cauſed her
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21637:26"/>
to ſpeake, ſhee wist not what. 3, It did ſo intoxicate, and benum her ſences, as in one of her fits, where-into they had cast her by their</hi> holy potion, <hi>and brimstone, there were two needles thrust into her legge, by one of the Priests</hi> (whereof in an other place) <hi>and ſhe wist it not, till after ſhee had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her ſences.</hi> 4, For her complaining to them of their inciuill, &amp; inhumane vſage of her by their potion and perfume: <hi>They had her to the chayre,</hi> and ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued her with both, <hi>as being there-with wonderfully ſicke, ſhe fell into a ſwound. 5,</hi> It was ſo loathſome a thing to the beholders, to ſee the holy potion giuen vnto them, <hi>that diuers Gentlewomen preſent, did weepe for pitty,</hi> to ſee them goe to their geare. 6, She was ſo haunted heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and <hi>grew ſo weary of her life by this meanes: as ſhee cried aloude vnto her vncle, whom ſhee heard by chaunce on the other ſide of a garden wall: O good Vncle, helpe me from hence, for I am almost killed amongst them heere already, and ſhall not liue, if I continue heere long.</hi> 7, Being grown to great weakenes, and almoſt deſperate, ſhee told the prieſts plainly, at the end of one of her fits, where-into they had caſt her, by their drinks, ſlibber-ſawces, and brimſtone, that <hi>if ſhee had a deuill in her, they had best to cast him out: For</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>if euer you torment me ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, diſpatch me, if you list: otherwiſe I will certainly by one meanes, or other, get away from you, and will tell my friends of all your proceedings, and dealings heere, both with me, and others.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Fidd Williams:</hi> and was <hi>Sara</hi> her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, leſſe beholding to their <hi>holy potion,</hi> holy brimſtone, and the chayre? let her ſelfe tell you, who hath beſt cauſe to remember.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſhe ſaith, <hi>ſhee dooth not remember euery ſeuerall time, when they bound her in the chayre, but they troubled her very often,</hi> (praying God to forgiue them) and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that <hi>when ſhe came to the chayre, ſhe was ſo vſed, as that euery time, if ſhe might haue had her choyſe, ſhee would rather haue choſen to haue ended her life, then to haue gone
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21637:26"/>
into it.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>if at any time ſhee was past the vſe of her ſences, it was by reaſon of the</hi> holy potion, <hi>they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her to take.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>ſhee fell into the paſſion of the trembling of the hart, onely vpon griefe of their bad v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of her, &amp; that thorough that paſſion, ſhe did diuers times ſwound.</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>they vſed their holy brimstone ſo much, as the ſtinke of it neuer went out of the chamber.</hi> Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that foule <hi>holy potion,</hi> made ſuch an impreſſion in her phancie: and <hi>the loathſomnes of it did ſo ſticke in her mind, as yet to this day ſhe cannot endure the tast, nor ſauour of any thing that was in the ſame.</hi> In ſo much, as <hi>about three yeeres ſince, ſhe feeling a pangue of ſicknes in the Market at</hi> Oxford, <hi>ſome of her neighbours at vnawares, gaue her a little Sacke: which as ſoone as ſhe perceaued, ſhee fell to be very ſicke vpon it, and was constrained to lye there all night. The offence of the Sacke being the onely griefe that ſhe had, after ſhee was recouered of her ſaide pangue.</hi> Sixtly, <hi>they would holde her noſe, and face perforce, ſo neere ouer the ſmoake of brimstone, feathers, and ſuch other ſtinking geare, that the very paine ſhe felt, cauſed her to crie, and ſcritche very lowde, and to ſtruggle as much, as poſſibly ſhe could, till her ſtrength failed her. At one time ſhe was ſo extreamely afflicted with the ſaid drinke, that her ſences went from her, and ſhe remained in a ſwound: and after that, her head was ſo giddie with the potion, and her ſences ſo troubled with the brimstone ſmoake, as ſhe ſpake, and babled many idle fooliſh words.</hi> Seauenthly, their chaire, potion, and brimſtone perfume grew ſo hatefull to her ſiſter <hi>Fidd,</hi> and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to her ſelfe, as vpon her ſiſters ſuggeſtion, <hi>ſhe attempted to runne from the houſe, and to wade through a brooke, halfe a yard deepe of water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much <hi>Sara Williams.</hi> And did Ma: <hi>Maynie,</hi> their prime profeſſour eſcape, the chayre, the brimſtone, and the bleſſed potion? That had beene great pitty, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, alias <hi>Weston,</hi> loued him much better then ſo. Of whom Ma: <hi>Maynie</hi> complaineth, <hi>That he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21637:27"/>
by him to drinke most loathſome draughts of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as he had ready for him. And that ſometimes they burnt ſuch abhominable ſtinking, and violent things, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his noſe by force ouer the ſmoake, as I think</hi> (quoth he) <hi>would haue made an horſe mad.</hi> But in another place, he tells vs a ſhrewder tale of <hi>Weston,</hi> that holy deuill, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this deuilliſh potion. <hi>God knoweth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Weſton <hi>ſuppoſed I would haue taken ſome courſe, to haue ſhortned mine owne time, as constrained by ſome ſort there-vnto, by the great weakenes, and wearines of my life.</hi> Is this an effect of your bleſſed loathſome potion, to driue <hi>Fidd, Sara,</hi> and Ma: <hi>Maynie,</hi> into a loathing of their owne liues: and to enter into a deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, touching ſhortning the ſame? Then holy gentle deuils, the Maiſters of this deuil-tragedy, let me aske you a queſtion, but it ſhall be in your eare, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, who hold you for holy ghoſtly fathers, may not heare: How many drammes of this <hi>holy potion</hi> had you giuen to the wench, that you wote of, whom you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſed ſo long, till ſhee fell from off a paire of ſtayres, and brake her necke, whether for telling of tales, or that you feared after-claps; it is very probable, you had filled her head full of your holy perfume.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> was yet in a farre better caſe, then theſe: for ſhe confeſſeth, ſhe was ſo gently tyed, and hampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in the <hi>holy chaire,</hi> that ſhe was compelled, for three yeeres ſpace after ſhe was releaſed, to ſwadle her body, for the very ſorenes ſhe felt of their holy hands.</p>
                     <p>Gentle ſpectators, we haue held you ſom-what long, ere our play begin: but now you ſee the deuils are come vpon the ſtage in their proper colours, Belzebub, alias <hi>Weston,</hi> and his 12 gracious aſſiſtants: For if the deuils themſelues ſhould haue deuiſed a deuilliſh potion, to haue intoxicated poore creatures, &amp; cauſe them to play the deuils, they could not haue inuented a more potent potion then this. <hi>Lucian</hi> tells a tale, that the paſſengers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21637:27"/>
to hell are made to drinke a draught of a potion, that makes them to forget all they haue ſaid, or done in their life: our <hi>ſtygian</hi> Impoſtors goe farre beyond that <hi>ſtygian</hi> lake, for they haue compoſed a potion, that brings not only a priuation of wit, memory, and ſences, but makes their patients to ſcritch, tumble, and roare, like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in hell. And this (good man deuill-whipper <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>) as ſeemes, is the myſterie of your ſweet compoſe, to fume a deuill out at a mans noſe, like the ſmoake of Tobacco?</p>
                     <p>Whereas your preſcript is compounded of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate ſimples, Brimſtone, <hi>Aſſa faetida, Galbanum, S. Iohns Wort, and Rue; Porphyrie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iamblichus,</hi> men acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the nature, and diſpoſition of deuils, afore your whip had ere a ſtring to it, doe affirme, that thoſe forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble violent ſauours, and ſtinking odours, are the very delicacies for deuils, and allectiues to their noſes. And that the deuill would not vouchſafe to come giue his Oracle at the <hi>ſtatua</hi> at <hi>Dodona,</hi> vntill he were wooed by theſe delicious perfumes. Thoſe deuils of that clime, are belike of an other temper, then theſe vnder your laſh, or elſe let me tell your riddle: you neuer meant (good man) to ſcare out a deuill by theſe filthy fumes, but to ſcare poore ſoules into the faſhion of deuils, by theſe peſtilent fumigations.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21637:28"/>
Wherein, we may call vnto <hi>Porphyrius, Proclus, Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and <hi>Triſmegistus,</hi> the old Platonicall ſect, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed familiarly, and kept company with deuils, and deſire their help to expound vs theſe new deuils names: and to tell vs at what ſolemne feaſt, and meeting in hell, theſe deuils were dubbed, and halowed with theſe new ſtrange names. It cannot be but our holy deuill-crue had ſurely met with <hi>Menippus,</hi> proclaiming himſelfe new come out of hell: <hi>ad ſum profoundo Tartari emiſſus ſpecu:</hi> Elſe they could neuer haue beene ſo deeply ſighted, and acquainted with the Muſter-booke of hell. Or elſe it may ſeeme that our vagrant deuils heere did take theyr faſhion of new names from our wandring Ieſuits, who to diſſemble themſelues, haue alwaies three, or foure odde conceited names in their budget: or els they did ſo plague the poore deuils with theyr holy charmes, and enchaunted geare, and did ſo intoxicate them with their dreadful fumigations, as they made ſome ſo giddy-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they gaue themſelues giddy names, they wiſt not what.

It vvas not kindly done of the deuils, to leaue the poore ſoules behind, eſpecially going to make merry amongſt theyr friends. But what if the ſoules had fallen a madding, or maying as faſt, as the deuils, and had gone a roming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade amongſt their good friends, had not this (trow we,) made a pretie peece of worke in hell?</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. 11.</hi> ¶ The reaſons why ſometime one deuill alone, ſometimes an 100, ſometimes a thouſand are, cast out at a clap.</head>
                     <p>YOu haue formerly heard of the names of the Prieſts, graund rectors of this Comaedie, and lately of the names of the deuils, their Cue-fellowes in the play: good order ſeemes to require, that I ſhould marſhall them together, as birds of a feather: but I chooſe rather to violate good method, &amp; put my ſelfe vpon my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then to offend our <hi>deuill-mastix</hi> by ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing combination. Now becauſe ſome may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how it commeth to paſſe, that hell in this <hi>Iubile</hi> was broken vp, &amp; that ſuch millions of deuils, like Herrings in a barrell, were packed vp in <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> and the reſt, and ſometimes one alone, ſometimes ſixe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 900 were caſt out together, and yet <hi>Maho</hi> with a million of aſſiſtants left ſtill behind: this containes many myſteries, as fit to be learned, as the reſt. We will conſider theſe two heads a ſunder, for the worthines of the matter: firſt, why theſe deuils are ſaid to be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; next, why ſometimes one, ſometimes many are ſaid to be caſt out at a time.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt, our holy deuill-charmers haue the vantage of Tinkers, and Surgeons by much: For theſe, the one hath his certaine number of holes to mend, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his certaine number of ſores to ſalue, and when he hath done, except by ſome prety knack in his budget, he can multiply one hole in foure, and the other draw one ſore into ſixe, he is in danger to be out of worke: but our holy budgetters hauing to deale with deuils, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inuiſible, and in number innumerable, doe wiſely prouide ſo many to be packed vp in one patient toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as except hell it ſelfe be drawne dry, they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21637:31"/>
want worke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sara Williams</hi> was a patient, that pleaſed their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling well, and therefore ſhee was furniſhed with all the deuils in hell at a clap; ſo as if <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelfe had beene in this hell, there had beene worke enough, both for him, and his club. The caſting a deuill out of <hi>Sara,</hi> was like the drawing of a bucket of water out of a Well, it made the deuill ſpring the quicker, and like to cutting of one of <hi>Hydraes</hi> heads, which made ſeauen more to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in his place.</p>
                     <p>This ground muſt be well layd, and this principle wel conned by all the profeſſours of this black Art, that they be ſure of hell, and deuils cnow in the party at firſt: which being not well aduiſed of by ſome ſimple witted men of ours, late probationers in this ſcience, they were enforced for enlarging their worke, to bungle it out wofully, and to ſay that the deuils they had caſt, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound backe againe, and ſo made them new worke to begin againe; which by this prouiſion of thrumming in deuils at the firſt, might moſt eaſily haue been auoyded.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this deuice of an huge many of deuils to be in one party, ſerued them, as a ſhelter againſt what wind or weather ſo euer. If the parties they had in handling, grew weary of their occupation, as loathing their drugs, fearing their tortures, and hating their coſenage and ſo were like to breake from them, and to tell tales out of Schoole, they had (by this deuiſe) their euaſion at hand. There were yet many deuils in the party forſooth, and it was not he, or ſhe, that ſo ſaid, but the deuill: ſo as if he ſaith any thing in opening their legerdemaine, hee ſhall be poſſeſſed as long as he liues; and then may he ſay, and ſweare what he will, for hee ſhall be no more credited, then <hi>Pippin</hi> their deuill, and that which would anger any poore ſoule at the hart, what ſo euer he doth, or ſaith, it muſt not be he, that ſo doth, or ſaith, but the deuill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:21637:31"/>Let poore <hi>Sara Williams</hi> giue you inſtances of this.<note place="margin">Reade her examin:</note> She grew ſo farre diſcontented with their <hi>holy potion,</hi> and their chayre, as ſhe begins to ſpeake bugs words, and tell them, <hi>ſhe would complaine:</hi> the prieſts had their <hi>ward-word</hi> ready: <hi>it was not</hi> Sara, <hi>but the deuill,</hi> that ſo ſpake, becauſe he could abide no Catholique prieſts.</p>
                     <p>She attempts to take her heeles, and runne away from them, the common voyce was, <hi>it was not</hi> Sara, <hi>but the deuill:</hi> ſhe did not runne, but was caried by the deuill. She ſmiles, and it muſt not be ſhe that ſmiles, <hi>but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> She weepes, and ſhe was borne downe, that it was not her ſelfe, that wept, <hi>but the deuill:</hi> ſo as ſhe ſaid, <hi>ſhe was at her wits end,</hi> fearing (as ſeemes) ſo much as to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hum, or ſpit, for feare the prieſts ſhould make it not of her owne ſpitting, but the deuils. This deuiſe is in ſteede of all the Orators in the world, to free them from imputation, and to ſecure their iugling: for ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing diſtaſting to them, and to their holy crue, ye ſhall be ſure to haue the deuill put vpon you for your labour; &amp; they haue ſeueral ſpirits to command for their bayards, to beare their ſeuerall fardles of crimes. Tell them that they are Impoſtors, and deſerue to be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the foreheads with the Character noting their trade: Loe, ſay they, it is not you, but the ſpirit of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Put them in minde of their deuill daliance, with <hi>Fidd,</hi> and <hi>Sara Williams:</hi> it is not you, but the ſpirit of luſt. Note their factious ambition in ſeeking ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; commaund: it is not you that ſo ſpeake of them, but the ſpirit of pride: and not onely words, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſuch as they liked not well, but euen actions, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ieſtures, and cariage of the body, if it make any thing againſt their lewd iugling, ſhall be branded with no other ſtampe, then <hi>the deuill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſee a prety peece of this puppet-play, (and ſo iudge of the reſt) acted betweene Ma: <hi>Maynie,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21637:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ma: <hi>Maynie</hi> the Actor, comes mute vpon the ſtage, with his hands by his ſide, and his haire curled vp. <hi>Loe heere</hi> (cries <hi>Weston</hi> the Interpreter) <hi>comes vp the ſpirit of</hi> pride. Sodainly the mute Actor cries out, <hi>Ten pounds in the hundred, that voyce</hi> (cries <hi>Weston</hi>) <hi>is the voyce of the ſpirit of</hi> auarice. <hi>Maynie</hi> makes a ſcornfull face, and <hi>that is the ſpirit of</hi> Enuie. He bends, &amp; knits his browes, and <hi>that is the ſpirit of</hi> Wrath: he yawnes, &amp; gapes, and <hi>that is the ſpirit of</hi> Sloth. Thus <hi>Weston</hi> in Ma: <hi>Maynies</hi> face rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des you the deuils, that are the ſeauen Authors of the ſeauen deadly ſinnes: and as many deuils (if he liſt) can he ſhew in any Proteſtants face at any time he pleaſes; all, or moſt of vs in his opinion, being really poſſeſſed with deuils.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond point: why ſometimes, a deuill alone, ſometimes an 100, ſometimes a thouſand, are blowne out at a clap; there are two waighty reaſons attending that deuiſe. One is to aduaunce heereby the reputation of ſome man of eſpeciall note, and credite amongſt them, who muſt be their <hi>Hercules,</hi> to controle with his club the monſter maiſter-deuils of greateſt potencie, and commaund. Euery plodding prieſt could caſt out an vrchin, or boy deuill, the raſcall guard that attended Prince <hi>Hiaclito:</hi> but <hi>Modu</hi> the Generall of <hi>Styx,</hi> with his ſeauen Colonels vnder him, the ſeauen maiſters of the ſeauen deadly ſinnes, muſt be a monſter reſerued for <hi>Westons</hi> owne club, and none but his. And whereas euery fidling Exorciſt in his holy coniuration, did vſe the holy <hi>amice; Weston</hi> for the ſolemnity of the action, and his better grace, muſt come vpon the ſtage more ſolemnly adorned with the holy Albe, or an holy Cope, and other conſecrated geare. And the deuill many times of his owne good nature, or elſe vpon ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acquaintance betweene him, and the prieſt, expreſly tells by whom, and by no other he will be caſt out: and then he alone muſt be gotten to come, and (to make the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21637:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deuill no lyer) he muſt gippe the Gudgin, and hit the Woodcocke on the bill, and the other ſcuruie crue of Exorciſts muſt hold him the candell. Learned <hi>Thyraeus</hi> tells vs, <hi>page,</hi> 67, <hi>de Daemon:</hi> that the foule deuill that poſſeſſed one <hi>Malachia,</hi> had vowed he would not out, till Fa: <hi>Benardine</hi> were gotten to come, who no ſooner appeared, but the deuil ſhewed himſelfe a man of his word: for hee ſlinkes cloſely away, like a dogge at the ſight of a whip.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond vſe they haue of this huge difference of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out ſometime one alone, ſometime a whole milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deuils, farre more paſſing, and precious, then the former. And that is, to grace by this drift, and to blaze the vertue of ſome new Saint, and new greene reliques, as yet not growne into credite in the world: Marie it muſt be eſpecially of ſuch a Martyr, or Saint, of whoſe vertue and ſanctitie, there is greateſt cauſe of ſuſpition abroad, whether the good man were a ſlye Iugler, or a holy man in deede. And this ſuſpitious Saint, or his caſt relique, ſhall worke you a wonder beyond God his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid cleane.</p>
                     <p>It was ſufficient for the gracing of <hi>Campion</hi> amongſt the Catholiques in England, with whom he was in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reputation, that his girdle, which came from <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp; was worne at <hi>Tyburne,</hi> ſhould at the firſt touch of the party poſſeſſed, ſtunt the deuils wits. Where-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Westons</hi> acclamation to the Spectators, was this: <hi>Testes estote clariſſimi patris</hi> Campiani <hi>Martyrij, cuius hic vel minutiſſimus funiculus tantus illi faces miſerat: Beare witnes, I charge you, of the most worthy Martyrdome of good Fa:</hi> Campion, <hi>whoſe ſimple girdle hath cast the deuill into ſuch a heate.</hi> Marie for that <hi>Ignatius</hi> their founder hath many enemies in the world, and is lately called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for a graund cheater: to grace this <hi>Monſignior,</hi> and to bring him into credite, he muſt doe tranſcendent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſtrained vpon ſuch a key, as our bleſſed Sauiour,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21637:33"/>
and his holy Ap: neuer came neere. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to divulge this Founders deitie, there is compoſed a Diarie of all his diabolicall (I meane hyperbolicall) wonders, done by that worthy Mountebanke, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and dead?</p>
                     <p>Firſt for his better credit, the deuill himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes him to Fa: <hi>Baptista Peruſo</hi> for a Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and I truſt you will not doubt of it, ſince it comes from ſo holy an Oracle, as the deuils own mouth, and therefore I wonder the Pope doth ſo long ſtand out. At <hi>Mauriſca</hi> hee lay 8 dayes in a traunce, without all ſigne of life, ſaue the beating of his hart: in his prayer, he ſaw Almighty God, and his ſonne, ſtanding by him with his Croſſe vpon his ſhoulders, and hee heard Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God commend him, and his company, to the protection of his Sonne. Thus farre agree Fa: <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the deuil.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Sena</hi> the deuils durſt not looke vppon his picture, but hung theyr heads in theyr boſomes for very pure ſhame. His picture in <hi>Malacia</hi> ſcared away a deuill: his picture in paper at <hi>Madena,</hi> pinned cloſely vppon a wall, skared away a whole troupe of deuils out of foure women poſſeſſed: the bare pronouncing his name at <hi>Rome,</hi> skared out 2 legions of deuils. A peece of his coife that hee wore, heales a woman of the phrenſie: a peece of leather, that he vſed at his ſtomack, cures the plague: a peece of his hayre-cloth, purges an holy Nunne in the ſpace of a yeere, of 100. ſtones: a peece of a relique of his, cloſe ſhut in a boxe, burnes a deuill, and makes him to roare the bredth of a chamber of: a peece of a relique caſt into the ſea calmes the waues, and ſtills the windes. But the bare ſubſcription of his name in a morſel of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per paſſeth all the reſt. This written in a patch of paper, &amp; brought vnto the partie, heales the tooth-ache, the crampe, the gowte, the Sciatica, the Leproſie, the skur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies, and beeing layd vppon the belly of a woman, that

                        <hi>CHAP. 12.</hi> ¶ Of the ſecret of lodging, and couching the deuill in any part of the body that the Exorciſt pleaſeth.</head>
                     <p>THe great skar-buggs of old time, as <hi>Hercules</hi> and the reſt, had a great humour (as the Poets faigne) to goe downe to <hi>Styx,</hi> and to viſit hell, to ſee <hi>Pluto,</hi> and his vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghoſts, and to behold the holes, and dennes, where hee lodged his blacke guard. Our holy skar-deuils, if they had liued with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would haue eaſed them of that paines: for they would haue ſhewed them hell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils heere aboue, and haue carried them with a wet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their cabines and lodges: and you ſhall find very deepe, and waighty reaſons of this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mercurie</hi> prince of Fairies had a rodde giuen him by <hi>Iupiter</hi> his Father, whereby he had power, not onelie to raiſe vp, and driue afore him, what ghoſts hee pleaſed, but alſo to remaund, and ſtill with the ſame rod, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as hee liſt. The holy Romane Church hath as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently armed her twelue Worthies of hell, and <hi>Weston</hi> their <hi>Blacke prince,</hi> as euer <hi>Iupiter</hi> did arme his ſweet ſonne, giuing them a power not onely to call vp, driue, and puffe out with theyr breath, as many deuils as they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21637:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pleaſed, but alſo to controll, cap, lodge, &amp; couch them as ſtil as a curre at the ſound of his Maiſters whippe is couched vnder a table. By that time I haue opened you the cauſes and ſecrets of this, and haue ſhewed you their ſeuerall lodges and formes, I doubt not, but you wil be able to tel me more newes from hell.</p>
                     <p>It is a poynt in the blacke art of deepeſt skill, and power, not to raiſe a ſpirit, but to be able to rule, and couch him ſafely and well: and in this holy infernal ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of caſting out deuils <hi>Thyraeus</hi> tells vs, that <hi>deuils be not all of a nature, quality, &amp; ſiſe, ſome be watry, ſome ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſome fierie, and ſome ſauour of the earth: the watry and ayrie, doe tast of theyr element, and be eaſily mooued, the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, are more fierce, and the earthy, like melancholicke men, more ſullen, not eaſily controld.</hi> See this exemplified as cleerly in our patients, as the noſe on a mans chin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Soforce, Anne Smiths</hi> deuill, was a ſullen, and ſilent ſpirit (ſo ſhe herſelfe records him) and could hardly be gotten by all dreadful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurations ſo much as to ſpeake. Captaine <hi>Maho</hi> in <hi>Sara,</hi> was of a fel, &amp; furious moode, and many times, when he was hunted vp into her body, grew there ſo vnruly, and outragious, that the Exorciſts ſeemed to feare leaſt her bowels would burſt. Then was all haſt made to get him downe againe, which ſomtime was done with good ſeeming toile, difficultie, &amp; ſweat, that when it fel out pat, as the deuil, &amp; the prieſt would haue it, it bred in the poore ſillie ſpectators a wonderful admiration of the dignitie of the prieſthood, and power of the Catholique Romiſh Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sara</hi> their apt ſcholler, acted this ſcene commendably well: where after a ſore skirmiſh between the Exorciſt, and the deuill, or <hi>Sara,</hi> and the Prieſt: the deuill was with much a-doe commaunded downe into her foote: but in an another ſcene ſhee hit the needles eye, where after a hote, and ſore encounter, all the ſpirits with much adoe being commaunded to goe downe into her left
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21637:34"/>
foote, they did it with vehement trembling, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of her leg, to the great admiration of many of the ſtanders by, ſeeing the power of the Catho: Romiſh Church: the partie crying that <hi>her ſhooe would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold them all:</hi> heere this act of lodging the deuil had a <hi>plaudite</hi> in the midſt of the play.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, who can but mate his wit with wonder, hauing no more wits then one, and ſtare out his eyes with amazement, hauing but two, to ſee the poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil brought into ſuch a taking, and to ſauour ſo rankly, lying at vntruſſe, that he would faine be gone out; and ſhal ſee the tyrannical dreadful power of an enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prieſt, by his remaunding might, to keepe him in ſtil in ſpight of his noſe, and to commaund him, for his more diſgrace, to take vp his lodge in a homely place, of which you ſhal heare heereafter, if it be not too foule. Would not ſome tender-harted body, in pure pittie of the deuils cry, take of the prieſt, and let the poore deuil be gone: as I haue heard of a good natured gentleman at <hi>Pariſh-garden,</hi> that cryed, take off the dog for ſhame, and let the poore Beare alone. Pittiful <hi>Hiaclito,</hi> vvould rather then his life, for pure feare of the prieſt, haue ſlunke out of <hi>Trayford</hi> behinde, but it would not be, he muſt be ſtayed vntil hee had his payment. Yea <hi>Maho</hi> himſelfe was taken downe ſo low with the deuil-ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting potion, that he would haue giuen all the poynts at his hoſe to be gone: and <hi>Dibdale</hi> would none, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds him to his lodge, vntil the Brimſtone by ſome dreadful enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment were made hote enough, to ſcald his breech ſoundly: heere this lodging-power was more dreadful to the deuil, and aſtoniſhable to the people by ods then the diſpoſſeſſing was.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this commaund to lodge would at no hand be ſpared, for by this they made ſure to haue a deuil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at a trice at all aſſaies, to furniſh out the ſtage: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beeing ſafe lodged, they caried about with them from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21637:35"/>
place to place, as the Iuglers vſe to carry a Bee in a box, or an ape in a ſtring, or puppits in a pageant, to ſqueale, skip, and tumble, whereſoeuer they pitch downe theyr truſſe.</p>
                     <p>You ſhal heare an act of this puppet-play performed betweene a prieſt, and a wench, as it is depoſed vppon oath, for a taſt of the reſt. There was a prieſt not many yeeres ſince in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> in the habit of a gentleman, who carried about with him (as Tynkers doe their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) a wench, pretended by the prieſt to be poſſeſſed: this wench at euery ſafe ſtation (where there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſimple people, the founders of miracles) hee preſents to play her pranks, and his faſhion was this. When it was a full Court, out brings he his <hi>Mattachina,</hi> and places her in a chayre, and then approching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely to her, takes her by the toe, and then dialoguizes with the deuil according to his pleaſure. The end of the dialogue between the prieſt, and the deuil, is a remaund of the deuil to his lodge; which (to auoyde <hi>inquam,</hi> and <hi>inquit</hi>) I haue preſented you in both theyr perſons, ſpeaking ſweetly together.</p>

fiend as he was, otherwiſe his Iudge would damne him into the bottomleſſe pit of hell:</hi> and with that the woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that <hi>the deuill was in the place appointed.</hi> Then the prieſt charged him that he ſhould he there, <hi>till the next exorciſme to be holden by him, or ſome of his brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I doe verily ſuſpect this wonder was acted ſomewhat neere <hi>Gotham,</hi> and that the ſpectators were the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them, that drowned the Eele: that neuer an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fellow in the company ſhewed ſo much vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie wit, as to offer to take a knife, and pare away the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, lying in the dead of the nayle, and throw him into the fire, for acting his part ſo baldly: but I nothing doubt, but the deuil-maiſter prieſt would haue had an eye to this, leaſt he, or ſome of his brethren, at the next exorciſme holden, ſhould for want of a deuil, haue ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a good play. And would not this haue ſpighted any deuil, to be thus hardly handled by a prieſt, to be turned out of his warme neſt, where hee cabined in the wench, and to be lodged at little eaſe in the edge of her nayle, next to wind, and weather, where hee muſt lye for a skout, like the Sentinel in a watch, and ſuffer euery boy to play bo-peepe with his deuilſhip, and he not able to ſtirre eyther out or in. O that <hi>Will Sommer</hi> had come to this pleaſant bargaine betweene the Exorciſt and the deuil, how handſomly would he haue belaboured them both with his bable, for playing theyr parts ſo handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
                     <p>But this was but a pedling Exorciſt of the raſcal crue, who wandered like a chapman of ſmal wares, with a wench, and a truſſe, beeing neuer free of his companie. Our wardens of the ſcience had a little more art to lodge theyr deuils. Such an art of lodging they had, and ſome of theyr lodges ſo obſcure, and retrayte, as none but a prieſt, or a deuil could euer haue ſented it out. Some of theſe deuil-lodgers, in <hi>Sara,</hi> and <hi>Fid,</hi> without a praeface of deprecation to your modeſty I muſt not

once name, for feare of check from your chaſt eares, and a change of colour in mine inke and paper, at ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth termes. I will onely leape ouer this kennell of turpitude, with a note of vnſauorie ſmels, and remit you to that clauſe of <hi>Sara Williams</hi> relation, who as a woman hath touched it as modeſtly, as ſhe can, giuing vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by her timorous declaration, that our holy order haue a ticket from his <hi>Hol:</hi> of Rome, to harrow hell it ſelfe, and be neuer the worſe.</p>
                     <p>It was wiſely cauteled by the penner of theſe ſauory miracles, in the end of his booke, why <hi>Sara</hi> being a ſeely young innocent wench of 16 yeeres, ſhould be more deuil-haunted, then any of the poſſeſſed men: there was a pad in the ſtraw, the poore man would faine haue out. But a Sceptike will make an other <hi>Quaere</hi> to our holy order to ſoile: how it comes to paſſe, that wee reade in auncient poſſeſſions of old, of moore men to be poſſeſſed, then women, and now in theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vpſtart miracles from Rome, ſtill it is the ill hap of more women to be haunted, then men. This ſore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalued with a little bleſſed oyle from Rome; an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt wil ariſe, what the cauſe is, why our holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hauing vnder their holy hands, not onely <hi>Fid, Sara,</hi> and <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> women, but <hi>Trayford, Marwood,</hi> and Ma. <hi>Maynie,</hi> that were men, there is no mention at all of common lodging, and couching the deuil in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar part of the body, but onely in the wenches.</p>
                     <p>Let vs goe to old <hi>Lockwood, Mengus</hi> their maiſter, &amp; loke vpon his Canon, for couching, &amp; lodging of the deuil, and happily we may thence pick out ſome Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to this purpoſe.<note place="margin">Mengus, Flag. Daem:</note> In the ſeauenth formidable exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme of his deuil-whip: his Canon lyes thus. <hi>Si ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenus non fuerit liberatus, et tamen vrgente neceſſitate dimittenda ſit coniuratio, tunc praecipe omnibus ſpiritibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manentibus in corpore, eos cogendo vt recedant á capite, et corde, et ſtomacho, et deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant ad partes inferiores corporis.</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:21637:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heere you haue the Canon for lodging the deuil, that you be ſure to lodge him not in the head, nor ſtomack, but in the inferiour parts. An excellent prouiſo, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs, that the deuil is of the nature of a cup of new ſtrong Sack, that cannot hurt a man, if it be kept out of his ſtomack, and head. But old <hi>Lockwood</hi> knew, what he did, in aſſigning the inferiour parts for a peculiar lodge for the deuil. This was the traynd ſent, he knew his dogges were old ſuerſ-by at this, this was the haunt they would not be halowed of. Let <hi>Sara Williams</hi> be my Interpreter for the reſt: <hi>Sometime</hi> (ſhe ſaith) <hi>they lodged the deuill in her toe, ſometime in her legge, ſometime in her knee. Sometime, &amp;c.</hi> Let the deuil,<note place="margin">See her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examin:</note> and his holy charmers make vp the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Fie holy Fathers fie, is this the trailed ſent you ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily purſue with full crie, and open mouth? Is this the game you hunt, called gayning of ſoules? Is this the hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you queſt on in Italy, Spain, &amp; England? Is this the foile you ſent ſo hotely, that neither Sea, nor Land will make you at a fault, but that you call vpon it ſtill, ouer hill, &amp; dale, through thick, and thin, and make good the chaſe through Colledges, Cloyſters, Palaces, houſes: yea euen into hell it ſelfe, &amp; thence ſtart the deuil, and hunt him a freſh, and lodge him with <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> in ſuch muſes, conny-beries, and holes, as the poore deuil, but for your hote purſuite, would neuer haue come in? It is wel that you quit the deuil with gaining of ſome ſtore of ſoules for hell, elſe can I not eaſily ſee, how you could readily make him amends. It is high time to call of from this vnſauory trayle. A lack poore honeſt deuil, in this caſe farre more honeſt, then the prieſt, that would not downe into his lodge, without much adiuration, toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſweat: was it any meruaile, conſidering he was to be commaunded into ſo vnſeemely a lodge.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. 13.</hi> ¶ Of diſlodging, rouzing, and hunting the deuill, by the dreadfull power of the preſence, approach, and bodily touch of a Priest.</head>
                     <p>THey that delight in hunting, being men of quality, and ſort, when they would entertaine their friends with that pleaſing ſport, doe vſe to haue an Hare-finder, who ſetting the Hare before, doth bring them ſpeedily to their game. The company was many times great, and the ſtrangers of note, that reſorted to ſee, &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this courſing of the deuill, and it was accordingly prouided by the Hunt-maiſters of the game, that they had a deuil ready lodged againſt any ſolemne hunting day, that the ſpectators might not be delayed with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſnes, before they came to their paſtime. Thus all being ſeated, and ſtanding at gaze for the game, the next office was to ſtirre, and rouze the deuill, that the people might behold, how he would beſtirre himſelfe. Vnto this they haue many potent Engines, &amp; meanes, ſome whereof had the ability both to courſe, and expell the deuill: but of the fearefull act of expelling I meane not heere to ſpeake, but onely of their various power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vertues of rouzing, chaſing, and chafing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
                     <p>Theſe dreadfull ſuper-infernall powers doe flow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the prieſts owne perſon, or his adiuncts. In his perſon we conſider his bodily preſence, &amp; approach towards the poſſeſſed, his breath, his touch, his parts. His adiuncts are either belonging to his perſon, as his hoſe, his gloues, his girdle, his coyfe, his rags; or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to his office, as holy water, holy oyle, the holy candell, hallowed brimſtone, the holy potion, <hi>Auemaries,</hi> inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, the holy Croſſe, the ſtole, the amice, the bleſſed Sacrament, and the corporall preſence of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21637:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our bleſſed Lady. Of theſe infernall whips, according to their ſeuerall dignities, and worth.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, we are to vnderſtand, that it is otherwiſe betweene a Prieſt, and a deuill, then it is betweene an Hound, and an Hare: For an Hare, if ſhe be formed, will ſit ſure, though the Hound doe trayle neere her, and call hotly on the ſent: but the deuil ſtands in ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily feare of the preſence of a Cath: prieſt, that as ſoone as he comes in to the roome, where the poſſeſſed is, he begins ſometime to ſtartle, and if hee approach neere, he rages as he were mad. Nay, many times hee will not endure his preſence at all, (notwithſtanding we reade that the deuill is ſo bold, as he dares to come into the preſence of Almighty God) but he skuds out of the poſſeſſed, as ſoone as euer he heares but tydings of the prieſts comming.</p>

                        <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Emperour had a daughter poſſeſſed with a deuill, and hearing that they had ſent for <hi>Tryphon</hi> to come, and exorciſe the mayd,<note place="margin">Thyrae: 181.</note> the deuill did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure forſooth to looke him in the face, but truſſes vp, and away, ere the holy man could come. Some ſtay till the Exorciſt be come within view, fearing (as ſeemes) coſenage, leaſt for one an other ſhould come: and as ſoone as he ſees by his noſe, that it is his good Maiſter in deede, he ſlips cloſely away, without taking any leaue. Thus did a whole legion in a young man ſerue Biſhop <hi>Arnolphus: Quae mox viſo</hi> Arnolpho <hi>epiſcapo diſceſſit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid:</note> ſaith <hi>Thyraeus:</hi> no ſooner had the deuil deſcried his good face, but he was gone.</p>
                     <p>Some punie raſh deuil doth ſtay till the holy prieſt be come ſome-what neere, as into the chamber where the daemoniack doth abide, purpoſing, as ſeemes, to try a pluck with the prieſt, and then his hart ſodainly failing him (as <hi>Demas,</hi> when hee ſaw his enemie <hi>Clinias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach) cries out, he is tormented with the preſence of the prieſt, and ſo is fierd out of his hold, to his greater

diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>This is an huge vertue in a prieſt, that caſts ſo farre off: we doe not reade that the daemoniacks in the Goſpel, did euer thus skud from our Sauiour Chriſt; but that is to little purpoſe. God needed not ſo much to grace his ſonne, who by the power of his Diuinity, was able to manifeſt himſelfe, to be the power of God: but our Exorciſts being deemed in moſt places of the world, for no better then iugling mates, there is great reaſon pardy, they ſhould be graced with more gracefull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, then euer were accompliſhed by our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This frighting, and tormenting power in preſence of a prieſt, is not giuen equally to al a-like, as the deuils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not all of a pitch. If he be an old ſturdy deuill, &amp; ſtand out the prieſts preſence, then as the prieſt hath this tormenting power in more eſpeciall meaſure, and approaches in perſon neerer to the poſſeſſed, the more is the deuil in the party afflicted, and tormented. <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> deuil being a tough weather-beaten ſpirit, was not much moued at the preſence of <hi>Stamp</hi> the prieſt, who had this tormenting power as ſeemes but <hi>remiſſis gradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> But when <hi>Edmunds</hi> came, and had inueſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his holy roabes; heare how the deuil fared, in <hi>Edmunds</hi> owne termes: <hi>Iubet ſacerdos ita vbi erat ſacris indutus vestibus, ante ſe infirmum constitui. Edmunds</hi> commanding in his ſacred geare to bring in the daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and ſet him in his preſence. And marke what followed: <hi>Hic ille toto corpore contremiſcere, et horrere, et aestuare caepit.</hi> Inſtantly began the poſſeſſed to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to haue horrour, and rage thorough out his whole body. This the deuil ſuffered, at the meere preſence of <hi>Edmunds,</hi> not onely before any dreadfull Exorciſme were thundred againſt him, but before any word was ſpoken by the Ieſuit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dibdale</hi> the prieſt remoues from <hi>Hackney</hi> to <hi>Fulmer</hi>

in the night, and caries his trincket <hi>Sara</hi> behind him on a horſe: ſhee felt her ſelfe ſo tormented with heate, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting behind him, as ſhe had much adoe to be kept from falling from her ſeate.</p>
                     <p>Heere the obiect was neere, the power wrought the ſtronger, but you ſhall ſee this power extended it ſelfe much farther, then thus. <hi>Trayford</hi> comes behind plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon a Iade, and this tormenting heate from the perſon of the prieſt reaches vnto him: hee felt ſuch an exceeding burning in his head (ſaith the Authour of the miracles) as he cryed all the way as he rode <hi>water, water,</hi> and yet we find this remoue was the 8, or 9, of <hi>Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> when men doe not commonly ſurfet of heat. This ſprite-tormenting vertue, is ſo top ful in the body of a prieſt, and of ſo potent an actiuity, as many times it runnes ouer, and many times iſſues from his perſon, as beames doe from the ſunne, without his owne priuitie, or ſence. And it hath not the qualities of <hi>Stygian</hi> fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to ſcoreh, burne, torment, and fugate the deuil, but it hath a power Antiperiſtian beſides, to repel, and bandie backe the deuil into his kenel againe: and this without any action, motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or intendement of the prieſt: ſo as a prieſt may baffle a deuil ſtanding ſtone ſtil, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring hand, or moouing a foote. This befel to <hi>Hilcho, Trayfords</hi> ſneaking deuil: who finding his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner grew too hote by the bodily approch of the Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſt, would faine to refreſh himſelfe haue come out at <hi>Trayfords</hi> mouth, but peeping out, &amp; finding the prieſts mouth approching ſomewhat neere, ſuddainly bolted backe againe, as a cony from a net, and was faine to ſlip out cloſely at his right eare, in the faſhion of a Mouſe. This <hi>Dibdale</hi> the prieſt neither knew, nor dreamed, that he had reuerberated the deuil with the direful power of his holy helliſh mouth, but <hi>Sara, Trayfords</hi> deuil-felow, ſaw the attempt of the deuil to come forth, ſaw his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die backe againe, and ſaw his going out at <hi>Trayfords</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:21637:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eare in the ſhape of a Mouſe, and diſcouered the true cauſe, why hee came not foorth, for the <hi>neereneſſe of the priests mouth, to the mouth of the poſſeſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if any man wil aske me, how it comes to paſſe, that any deuil could ſtay in the body of any party poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, whom the prieſts did viſit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering this fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcorching heate, that iſſuing out of the bodie of the prieſt, did ſcald, and torment the deuil, when the prieſt drew neere, and did make him to tremble, quake, and rage, as you heard in <hi>Marwoods</hi> deuil: I aunſwer, that the deuils, as you haue heard out of <hi>Thyraeus,</hi> were not all of a temper, and conſtitution alike, but ſome could endure theſe ſcorching flames of the prieſts, better then ſome. Next, the prieſts had not this hel fire all in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but ſome burned the deuil neere at hand, ſome a farre off, according to the proportion of hell fire, that was in the prieſt: and thirdly the prieſts did many times by their ſoueraigne power of prieſthood, hold the deuil in by force, for his greater torment, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the power of the Romiſh Cath: Church, and firſt did toaſt, and broyle him wel with theyr owne hel fire within the body of the poſſeſſed, and then did lay cart-loades of fire, and Brimſtone vppon his backe, and ſent him to be broyled 1000. yeeres in the pit of hell.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> deuil in the wandering wench, of whom you heard afore, cries out, that hee was ſcalded, and tormented by the prieſt, and deſires hee might be gone: the prieſt tells him he ſhal not, but that he would torment him ſtil: and when he had ſo done, lodged him (as you haue heard) in a moſt dangerous deſperat place. Now it may be wondered by ſome plaine witted folkes, how the body of an holy prieſt doth catch ſuch a fire, that all the parties poſſeſſed did ſtil complaine they burned: and this burning was ſo ſore in <hi>Fid,</hi> and <hi>Sara,</hi> as the marks thereof are at this day to be ſeene.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:21637:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>Theſe queſtioniſts muſt be ſent to the Cath: Church to ſchoole, to learne to beleeue, and to make no curious ſpeculations: and ſure it is without doubt, that a fell-burning heate they had in theyr bodies indeede, and the neerer they did approch to <hi>Fid,</hi> and <hi>Sara,</hi> the more they felt theyr heate: yet not to let any reaſonable man goe away vnſatisfied, wee wil take a little paines to open the caſe. True it is, that this deuil-burning heat in the prieſts, could not be any elementary fire: for that no element can effectuate beyond his owne Sphaere, and a deuill hauing in his nature no elementarie combination, it is not poſſible hee ſhould receiue from any element any ſenſible impreſſion. Much leſſe can it be in the power of any naturall innate heate, to torment a deuil, for it fits not to <hi>calor natiuus,</hi> to ſcald, or broyle at all. A caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial heate leaſt of all can it be conceited, for that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is ſweet, and helpful, tending to generation. There is but a fourth fire left, and that is the fire of hel, which beeing diſputed, and reſolued by deepe Diuines, to be neither natural, nor mixt of elementary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the coales of Gods wrath, and feareful indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they cary in theyr bodies an heate, that doth vex, and torment a deuil, whereſoeuer they finde him, it can be no other, then the heat of hel: for what other fire can vexe, and torment the deuil? I would be ſorie they ſhould be concluded of ſo helliſh a diſpoſition: it is far better to take it, as <hi>Sara,</hi> and all the reſt of her fellow Comaedians doe conteſt: that all was a <hi>Stygian</hi> comedy to make ſilly people afraid. A fier indeede ſhe felt, from the ſpritly power of the Prieſt, but it was of a more gentle, &amp; pleaſing impreſſion. And for that other part, that ſhe played, feigning that ſhe was burned, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented at the preſence of a Catholique prieſt: that had ſhe learned from the wiſe prompting of her skilful mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the prieſts, who did ſtil harpe of that ſtring in their ordinary narrations of ſtrange poſſeſsions beyond ſeas,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21637:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>the poſſeſſed could not endure the preſence of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique priest,</hi> which ſhe as an apt ſcholler obſerued for her cue, and acted it as comly, and gracefully, as you haue heard. Thus much of the power of theyr bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>PLinie</hi> in his naturall ſtorie, tells vs of certaine people, that doe <hi>anhelitu oris enecare homines:</hi> Kill men with the breath that comes from their mouthes. <hi>Scaliger</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts a whole linage of men, that could <hi>oculis faſcinare:</hi> bewitch with their eyes, though they did not touch. The <hi>Leno</hi> in the Comaedy, is noted to be of ſo ſtrong a breath, that hee had almoſt blowne downe the young gallant, that ſtoode in his way: but the Poets tell vs, that hell hath a more deadly breathing then all; ſo as if a bird doe by chaunce flie ouer the Stygian flood, ſhe is quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſmell, and falls downe ſtark dead. We haue heere to acquaint you with a breathing company of prieſts, that for potency of breath, doe put downe <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Scaliger,</hi> the bawde, hell, the deuill and all: For the deuill, who can wel enough endure the loathſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and euaporations of hell, is not able to endure the vapour iſſuing from the mouth of a prieſt, but had rather goe to hell, then abide his ſmell.</p>
                     <p>Now what a monſtrous coyle would ſixe or ſeauen <hi>igniuomous</hi> prieſts keepe in hell, if they ſhould let looſe the full fury of their blaſts, as <hi>Aeolus</hi> did vpon the Sea, and diſtend their holy bellowes in conſort amongſt the poore ghoſts, were it not a plaine danger, that they were likely to puffe all the deuils out of hell? <hi>Mengus</hi> the Canoniſt for hel, giues vs a rule, that if the deuil be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21637:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; wil not obey the formidable exorciſme of the prieſt, then that the prieſt ſhal <hi>os ſuum quam-proximè ad energumenum admouere:</hi> bring his mouth as neer to the poſſeſſeds mouth, as he can, and by that time the deuil hath taſted on his breath, if there be any life in him, hee wil be glad to ſtirre.</p>
                     <p>Heere now you ſee the reaſon, why <hi>Trayfords</hi> deuil rebounded at the dint of the Prieſts breath, and was ſo glad to get him out at <hi>Trayfords</hi> right eare like a Mouſe, rather then he would come out iump againſt the prieſts mouth. The little children were neuer ſo afrayd of hell mouth in the old plaies painted with great gang teeth, ſtaring eyes, and a foule bottle noſe, as the poore deuils are skared with the hel mouth of a prieſt.</p>
                     <p>Take an example from <hi>Sara Williams</hi> of the vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their breath, <hi>ſhee lay</hi> (ſaith the penner of their miracles) <hi>past all ſence in a traunce, beeing vtterly berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all her ſences at once, the priest no ſooner came neere her, but ſhe diſcerned him by the ſmell.</hi> Was not this (trow you) a iolly ranke ſmel, that was able to awake a poore wench out of a traunce? Verily theſe doe out-ſmel the deuil by farre. For though the deuil hath (as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reputed) a fel ranke ſmel, yet I neuer heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that could diſcerne a deuil by his ſmel.</p>
                     <p>The like ſoueraigne ſmel is in the ſacrament of theyr Maſſe, for <hi>Sara could alwaies</hi> (ſaith our Authour) <hi>verie exactly reckon vp how many had communicated, by diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them by theyr ſmell.</hi> But for this they may haue an eaſie euaſion, happily they had beene ſo deepe in the Challice, as a quick ſented man might haue ſauoured them a far off without helpe of the deuil. Their breath which is nothing, but ayre exhaled from theyr lunges, beeing as you ſee of this affrighting power ouer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil: what may wee deeme of the power of theyr holie hands, if they come once to be applyed to the deuil?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, theyr holy fingers had in them the ſame diuine

                        <hi>Sara</hi> was content to play the ſhe-deuil, touching your preſence, and approach, and to grace you with an <hi>Oh I burne, oh I cannot abide the preſence of a Catholique:</hi> mary when you came neerer, then in manhood you ſhould offer, or ſhe in modeſty ſuffer, as to hunt her with your holy hote hands, ſhee could in her woman-hood haue beene content you would haue forborne: but that way lay your game, and therefore there was no remedy, but you would haue your hunting ſport. Your game being by hote chaſe emboſſed, did commonly take ſoyle, and there you let him lodge, and hunted him a freſh vpon the old foyle, and counter too, which none but Curres of an impure ſent wil doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sara</hi> ſaith, you began with your fiery hands at her foot, and ſo vp all along her leg; ſo her knee, her thigh, and ſo along all parts of her body: And that you followed the chaſe ſo cloſe, that it could neither double, nor ſquat, but you were ready to pinch.</p>
                     <p>VVas this a fayre chaſe for holy anointed prieſts to make, eſpecially with thoſe holy hands, that had inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie before celebrated the holy Maſſe, bleſſed the chalice, made (as they ſuppoſe) a new God, eleuated the Hoaſt, handled, and deuided the very body of Chriſt, to bring the ſame holy hands piping hote from the Altar to the chayre, where <hi>Sara</hi> ſate at Maſſe, to ſeize with the ſame hands vpon her toe, ſlip them vp along her legge, her knee, her thigh, and ſo along all parts of her body, till you came neere her neck, and by the way with the ſame holy hands, to handle, pinch, and gripe, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil in his blacke modeſty did forbeare, till you made her crie <hi>oh:</hi> and then you to crie, <hi>O, that</hi> oh <hi>is the deuill.</hi> Now

the great deuil pinch you all for me, and that I may ſay without malignity; for I wel know he dares not: you are ſo deuil holy all ouer, head, hart, and hands, that the deuil dares not come neere you: and therefore you neede not to care a ruſh for either deuil, or hell, for you wil either with your holines make holy both the deuil, and hell, or make him crie <hi>oh,</hi> when you come there with your holy pinch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fid Williams</hi> doth complaine (looke in their owne confeſſions) that with your holy hote burning hands, you did hunt the deuil counter in her too: and did toe-burne, ſhin-burne, knee-burne her, and ſo forth, till you made her crie <hi>oh:</hi> for they were the ſweet paire of your holy deuils, that were alwayes in chaſe.</p>
                     <p>And heere we ſee the cauſe, why <hi>Trayford</hi> was ſoone diſpatched of his deuil after a bout, or two, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deuil hunted from toe to top, with your holy hote hands: nor Ma: <hi>Maynie</hi> was neuer troubled with this pinching ſport: but <hi>Sara,</hi> and <hi>Fid</hi> ſtuck long in your fingers, or your fingers about them; and euer &amp; anone they were at the holy chayre, and this diſlodging, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and pinching, the deuil was ſtill in their Parkes.

                     <p>And heere I muſt remember you, that you were ſo fierie hote, and ſo ſharpe ſet vpon this game, that you forgat your Maiſters, <hi>Mengus, Thyraeus, Sprenger, Nider,</hi> and all; and did as ſchoole-boyes doe, when they haue an <hi>otium</hi> to play, giue a ſhowt, and for haſt of their ſport, caſt ſatchel, bookes, and paper, behind at their heeles.

&amp; hath this pinching holy quality in it, to cauſe a wench cry <hi>oh,</hi> and hee that wil laugh at this reaſon, may hap to catch a deuil. 2, If any curious merry head wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, what needs the Amice, the Albe, holy candle, holy croſſe, holy brimſtone, <hi>Brians</hi> bones, the ſacrament the croſſe, <hi>Salue Regina,</hi> S. <hi>Barbara, Mengus</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil-whip, his deuil-club, his fray-deuil, and the reſt of that infernal rable, ſince the onely holy hands of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> the Ieſuit alone, hath power alone to rouſe, hunt, chaſe, baffle, broyle, &amp; toſte the deuil, and to make him to roare, that hel it ſelfe did quake, and tremble, skudde, and flye from his holy hand alone, more fearefully, and ghaſtfully then euer poore Mouſe did tremble, and flie from the ſight of a glaring Cat.</p>
                     <p>To this I aunſwer, that as all ſtarres doe not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate alike the light of the ſunne, ſo all holy prieſts doe not receiue alike the influence of this hel-tormenting fire, but as they come neerer to that <hi>Fons caloris, Origo luminis, Oculus caeli Ignatius,</hi> the fountaine of this holie-deuil-driuing heate, as his name dooth import, (as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> his grand-child did) ſo are there more potent, and abundant beames of that miraculous fire communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them, able to fry, and broyle all the deuils in hell: and as they ſtand farther off from the pure raies of his hell-fiering face, ſo they are as the Moone, but ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſprinckled with this ſatanicall flame. 3, If this wil not content you, but you wil purſue me with queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtil, and know why <hi>Edmunds, Dibdale,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had the deuils plenty of this deuil-frying heat in theyr holy hands, did not diſpatch the deuil quite, and fire him out of his denne at once with theyr holy hands alone: but elongated their worke, &amp; tooke in the Albe, the amice, holy candle, holy hoſt, and all the louſie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wardrop to aſſiſt in the holy worke: I aunſwer, this was theyr good nature, to take in thoſe petty imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to doe them ſome grace, that theyr mother

                     <p>GEntle Reader, thou muſt not meruaile to heare thoſe ſupernaturall powers, ſpoken of before, to haue beene lodged in the bodies of holy prieſts: conſidering that as the plague doth infect, and hang in implements and garments, and the leproſie vpon walls, and beames of houſes; ſo wee finde thoſe powerful vertues, which ſhewed themſelues apparantly in the conſtitution of the Prieſts, to transfuſe themſelues, and inhaere as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, in the prieſts gloues, theyr hoſe, theyr girdle, their ſhirts, their ragges, their patches, yea in the water that ſome of their powerful hands had been waſhed withall. So as theſe holy companions, if they had beene meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into Fiſhes, as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> folowers were turned into ſwine, they would haue proued notable good Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Fiſhermen report there is no part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, nor without, that is bad.</p>
                     <p>A little I doubt mee old <hi>Thyraeus</hi> is to blame, vvho painting a whole chapter with the glorious parts, and qualities of an Exorciſt, intituling his diſcourſe <hi>De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionibus Exorcistarum,</hi> hee is ſilent in this Maiſter-qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21637:45"/>
infixed in the temper, and mould of a Prieſt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from his ſplendent vnction, that he ſhould haue this dreadful fire, to burne out a deuil, and ſo by conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie doth ſmother it in his garments, and implements too. <hi>Thyraeus</hi> was of ſome watry, and earthy conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and likely dooth cantle all Exorciſts by himſelfe. Sure I am, we finde them as liuely, quick, and mightie in operation in theyr exteriour ornaments, as in theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour complexion, &amp; therefore we muſt not do them that wrong, to bury them in obliuion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maho, Saras</hi> chiefe deuil, with much adoe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to tel his name: and the firſt word hee ſpake, was out of <hi>Saras</hi> hand; then was one of the prieſts gloues ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and put vppon her hand, <hi>Maho</hi> durſt not abide it,<note place="margin">Page, 12. of the booke of miracles.</note> but went his way ſtraight: and hee was ſo skared, as we do not finde, that euer he came there after. It ſeemes he had ſtepped thether only to grace the prieſts gloues: for you haue obſerued, that her hand was none of his ordinary haunt: or els, if he could not endure the gloue by reaſon of ſome ſenting quality, the prieſts hand had left behind him, wee may imagine the prieſt had beene vſing his hand holily, and well: when it ſauoured ſo ſtrongly that the deuil could not abide it. And now it is not without great cauſe as you may ſee, that our Catho: Gentlewomen heere in England doe hold in ſuch deere eſteeme our wandring Cath: prieſts, enriching them with guilt rapiers, hangings, girdles, Ierkins, and coyfes more beſeeming a noble man, then a iugling Impoſtor to weare, if they receiue no other poſſeſſiue kindneſſe (whereof wee all ſee they be no niggards of theyr ſtore) yet this recompence at their pleaſure they may enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to haue a precious payre of prieſted gloues, ſo ſprightly perfumed, with the pure odour-ſpicing from the hands of a hote ghoſtly father, as they may vſe for a ſure preſeruatiue againſt any ſparrow-blaſting, or ſprite-blaſting of the deuil. This precious odour againſt a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21637:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deuil, that dooth continually iſſue from their annointed complexion, dooth not onely aſcend, into theyr vpper, and extend it ſelfe into theyr vtter ornaments, as into their gloues; but it deſcends alſo, and diſtils into theyr inferiour habit, and for want of a fit receptacle, is readie many times to drop out at their heeles. <hi>Dibdale Saras</hi> ghoſtly Father, had of his fatherly kindneſſe lent his ghoſtly child a payre of his old ſtockins, that happilie had ſeene <hi>

                     <p>I cannot but wonder that in the heate of theyr zeale, loue, and admiration of the holineſſe of the prieſts, the ſpectators did not runne vppon them at once, as the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21637:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
daughters of <hi>Scaeua</hi> the Iew, did vpon the Exorciſts; and of pure holy zeale, rend, ſnatch, and teare off all their holy apparel from off their backs, euen vnto their bare, and catch, and carrie away ſome a peece of the Prieſts coate, ſome a ragge of the amice, ſome a patch of his breeches, ſome a corner of his ſhirt, and lay them vp in an holy casket for reliques, againſt a raynie day. The prieſts themſelues, doe full deuoutly casket vp as home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,<note place="margin">Page, 5, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidem.</note> and brayed wares, as theſe God wote. Heere make you no doubt, but all more then comely haſt was made, to pull off <hi>Dibdales</hi> hoſe, that the deuil might quickly cabin in his lodge; for there was the deuils couert, where they were ſaid to rouze him, when they came to the next hunt, with their fiery holy hands, which was not long intermitted (as the wenches doe wofully complaine) the prieſts hauing a ranke itch in their fingers, to be fidling at that ſport.</p>
                     <p>You are next to be informed, that this deuil-killing vertue did not lye in the prieſts head onely, as the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an Adder doth; nor yet in his taile alone, as the light of a Glow-worme: but was vniuerſally diffuſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all, and euery part of his body, and ſo transfuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, and euery part of the apparel, that came neere his body.<note place="margin">See Edm: practat.</note>

                     <p>And now the deuil was a Sainting, and that his hand was in, it was much ouer-ſeene of <hi>Edmunds</hi> the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he did not name him, <hi>Story, Felton, Sommeruile, Arden, Parrie,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lopez,</hi> &amp; the reſt of that Saint-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torly crue, whom <hi>Tiburne,</hi> and the deuil were as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with-all, as with S. <hi>Campian</hi> I wis; and knew as wel the cauſes, motiues, and end of their Saint-ſhips alike: the deuil himſelfe hauing beene the Author, &amp; inſpirer to them all, and therefore no doubt but he would haue beene as kinde to them, as to S. <hi>Campian;</hi> and the more the merier, &amp; the greater ſhout, &amp; applauſe would haue beene of the holy Traytorly rout, that were loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on, and the <hi>Echo</hi> the ſhriller when they cried: <hi>O Catholicam fidem!

already ſainted with the deuil, (as I truſt if they be dead, God gaue them better grace,) but if they be liuing, and ſtand as lewdly affected to theſe diabolical coſenages, as heere they did, when they held the deuil, alias <hi>Edmunds</hi> the candel: it is to be hartily wiſhed, they were ſent to the Creator of the Romiſh Saints, <hi>Tiburne</hi> their <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,</hi> by him to be conuayed, where Gods mercy ſhal deſigne.</p>
                     <p>But the cloſe of this Dialogue betweene <hi>Edmunds,</hi> &amp; the deuil, or the deuil <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and <hi>Edmunds</hi> the deuil, for he played both parts himſelfe, is the pretieſt of all. <hi>Campians</hi> dreadful girdle had ſo heat the deuil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated his braine, as it made the deuil to cry out, as you haue heard. <hi>O me ſtultum et infelicem, qui ista dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem!</hi> O foole, and wretch that I am, for ſaying thus much! Heere you ſee the deuil was cleane gone, and confeſſeth himſelfe to be out of his wits.

                     <p>Meane while <hi>Campians</hi> Saint-ſhip comes of a faire houſe, and hangs by a goodly three-fold threed. For the deuil heere now when he dubbed him, and proclaimed him a Saint, is in <hi>Edmunds</hi> cenſure a lier, in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion a foole, and by imputation a deuil: and ſo he was created by a deuil, a foole, and a liar: and theſe three in one was none, but <hi>Edmunds</hi> alone, the Author, Actor, and penner of this play, who deſerues as worthily to be crowned at <hi>Tiburne,</hi> for this fooliſh, fond, impious dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical faſcination, and to be proclaimed from hell for an infernal Saint, as euer <hi>Campian,</hi> &amp; his complices did.</p>

                     <p>The difference betweene a Pagan, &amp; a Popiſh prieſt, as I take it, is this, that the one doth ſeriouſly, and in good ſadneſſe perſwade himſelfe, that his halowed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, charmes, and conſecrate attire, as his ſcepter, his crowne, and Albe, doth awe, terrifie, and depel the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil indeed: the other doth not in earneſt ſo thinke, or dreame, but doth know the cleane contrary, that there is neither vertue, ability, nor proportion in any of theſe gewgawes, to moue or ſtil the deuil no more, then there is in a white ſheet to ſcare a ſober man; but dooth onely of impious policie act, faſhion, and play them, <hi>ad terro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem incutiendum, &amp; fucum faciendum populo,</hi> to gull, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, and amaze the ſimple ignorant people, and by bringing them into an admiration of the power of their prieſt-hood, the ſanctitie of theyr attire, and the diuine potencie of theyr Romiſh Cath: church, by this meanes to enchaunt, &amp; bewitch their innocent ſimple ſoules, &amp; ſo to offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp for a pray to their great Idole at <hi>Rome.</hi>

It was theyr good nature, or rather Gods good grace, they ſhould deale ſo plainly with vs: but we need not be beholden to them, for this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kindneſſe one iote: for by that time all the parts of this tragaedie haue been acted on the ſtage, you haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a child of tenne yeeres, that is a looker on, but will ſee, and diſcerne their groſſe packing, rude bungling,

and palpable iugling ſo apparantlie, as hee wil dare to take the deuil by the viſard, &amp; play with the fooles noſe, and cry: away with the prieſt, and the deuil, they haue marred a good play.</p>
                     <p>We are now come to their hunting, and chaſing the deuil with their holy attire. In a wel ſorted cry of hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, the dogs are not all of a qualitie, and ſiſe: ſome be great, ſome of a midle, ſome of a low pitch: ſome good at a hote chaſe, ſome at a cold ſent: ſome ſwift, and ſhalow, ſome ſlow and ſure: ſome deepe and hollow mouthed, ſome verie pleaſant, and merrie at traile. So is it in this conſorted kennel of hell, and in theſe direful engines, &amp; Machines of the Romiſh Church, to rouſe, chaſe, and torment the deuil. The bodie, &amp; hand of a ſacred prieſt, yee ſee are greater torments to the deuil, then hel. His girdle, gloues, and hoſe, they are the deuils ſcorpions, &amp; whyps (as neereſt vnto the origen, and fountaine it ſelfe) but his exterior ornaments (though ornaments of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as his Amice, his Albe, his ſtole: yet beeing more remote, and ſo participating the vertue of the prieſt, but in weake degrees) be in this deuil-hunting ſport, in ſtead of little beagles to fill vp the cry; and yet by your leaue, ſometime they giue the deuil a ſhrewd pinch, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be worth the whiſtling out, and not to be left in the Popes kennel at home.</p>
                     <p>It is not a light argument of the ſacred power of an <hi>Amice</hi> againſt a ſpirit, that the reporter of the Miracles tells vs; that a prieſt layd it vppon <hi>Saras</hi> face to preuent illuſions: and that a ſpirit puffed at it,<note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> and could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to let it alone. It had as ſeemes a choaking quality to ſuffocat a deuil: and indeede <hi>Lustie Dicke,</hi> that deuil, for all his luſtier parts, had endured a ſhrewd chaſe by a long exorciſme a little afore, and ſhewed himſelfe a luſtie ſtout deuil of a large winde, and laſting breath, that hee ſunke no ſooner, and nowe beeing cleane ſpent and lying at bay, it was but an hard part of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21637:50"/>
prieſt, when he found him panting, &amp; gaſping for ayre, after ſo hote, and ſore a chaſe, not to breathe the deuil a little, but to come vpon him with a ſuffocating <hi>Amice,</hi> to quel him out-right.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Sara</hi> tels vs, that it was ſhe her ſelfe, that puffed at the holy <hi>Amice,</hi> as beeing none of the ſweeteſt. But who was likeſt to know beſt, whether ſhee, or the deuil puffed? I hope the prieſt, who knew the deuil as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his puffe, as the deuil did him by his ſmel. The prieſt ſhewed a good wit in taking the deuil ſo ſoone. This holy relique lay pent for want of a grace from the deuil, and the deuil beeing brought ſo low, had nothing but a puffe, or a worſe ayre to vent vpon it.</p>
                     <p>The holy <hi>Stole</hi> was brought three or foure times vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſtage, and ſhewed it ſelfe an <hi>Antidaemoniack</hi> of ſpecial account, manifeſting it ſelfe to be a true imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">See Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds tract.</note> and hanging of the deuil-quelling church. Firſt it ſerued in the nature of a ſtop-deuil, in Fa: <hi>Edmunds</hi> own hand, who after he had belabored the deuil with his holy hands into <hi>Marwoods</hi> head, and finding his hands heauy with the maſſie waight of vertue, that was compacted in them: he took the ſacred <hi>Stole,</hi> &amp; wound it about <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> neck, and ſo begirt the deuil in <hi>Marwoods</hi> head, where the deuil lay ſo pent, by the vertue iſſuing out of the bleſſed <hi>Stole,</hi> as he ſtared, fumed, &amp; fomed, as he had beene ſtarke mad, and in the end was ſqueaſed out with pure violence, as water out of a ſquirt.</p>

                     <p>This bleſſed implement hath in it, as you ſee, a ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cord for a deuil, more then <hi>Mengus</hi> whip: and how was the poore deuil then rent, battered, and torne, may we deeme: when for not telling his name, he was enioyned vntruſſe, and to take quietly fiue laſhes with the <hi>Stole,</hi> &amp; (that which was worſt of al, &amp; I am ſure went moſt againſt his ſtomacke, being an haughty ſpirit) was commaunded to kiſſe the rod, and to ſay ouer, with a lamentable trembling voyce 15 <hi>Aue maries,</hi> fiue for our Ladies fiue ſorrowes, fiue for her fiue ioyes, &amp; fiue for her fiue glories. And all this the deuil moſt dutifully performed, like a dutiful obedient ſonne to his curſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Mother, the holy church of Rome.

                     <p>To this may be aunſwered, that we, and our children be out of their church, and ſo out of the ſphaere of the actiuitie of theſe holy Iewels: and then that this is not a ſeated fixed vertue in theſe nouels, but a mouing tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue grace, that goes out, and in, in them, like a ſhittle in a Weauers loome.

                     <p>It is a currant tale of <hi>Achilles,</hi> that his mother <hi>Thetis</hi> dipped him in the Sea, all but his heele, &amp; ſo made him impenetrable againſt the point of any weapon.

of him for hel: his body a piller of burning braſſe, his hands flames of fire, his gloues, his girdle, his hoſe, his ſhirt, lumps of ſea-coales of hell: his amice, his maniple, and his ſtole, ſtreamers of ſcorching ſmoke, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of gore-blood in one hand, the croſſe of tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting coales in the other: ſprouting out holy-water with his mouth, breathing out fire, and brimſtone at his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, euaporating frankinſence at his eyes, the picture of an aſſe burning brimly at his eares, his head crawling with dead-mens bones: the picture of our Lady flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his breaſt: nicknames of fire, and blood running vpon his backe, <hi>aue-maries,</hi> and <hi>ſalue Reginaes</hi> ſparkling downe to his heeles: what a little hel doe you imagine walking vppon the earth? And ere you ſtirre your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, doe but imagine him a little further, walking in our London ſtreets a little before day light, what time the Chimny-ſweepers vſe to make theyr walke, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his helliſh hollow voyce, <hi>hay ye ere a deuil to driue? hay yee ere a wench to fire? hay yee ere a boy to diſpoſſeſſe?</hi> What a feare trow yee would the ſpirit be in to heare young hell thus roare, and how would he labour to get out at the parties breech, a <hi>Hiaclito</hi> did at <hi>Trayfords,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would dare to looke this hell-mouth on the face?</p>
                     <p>Heere now comes in a bundle of <hi>Quaeres,</hi> that ſteppe ouer our way, and will needes haue parlie with vs ere we go any further: firſt, whence deriue theſe fierie weapons theyr vigor, and ſtrength of goring the deuil; which you call the publique armes, and enſignes of the Church? To this I aunſwer, that theſe publique weapons of holy Church, that you haue heard, ſome haue their ſtrength, and power of themſelues, as the ſacrament, and the Croſſe: ſome of the inſtitution of holy Church, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſmes, <hi>aue-maries, ſalue Reginaes, &amp; caet.</hi> ſome from the conſeruation, and halowing of the Church to theſe potent ends, and effects: as holy water, holy candle, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21637:53"/>
brimſtone, holy Frankenſence, and the holy potion, nick-names, and the Aſſes eares.</p>
                     <p>And if heereuppon a <hi>Quaeriſt</hi> wil demaund, <hi>ad quid perditio haec?</hi> vvhat needes the holy Church to open her Armorie for hel, and muſter out her fiery weapons in ſuch troupes, and throngs, conſidering, that euery one of theyr thumb-annointed prieſts (as yee haue heard) doth at his holy vnction, receiue this heate, and fire into his hand and his body, by the oyle of his thumbe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able with all his holy implements, that hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his backe, to fire out the ſtrongeſt deuil in hel, with his owne proper hands, &amp; his hote holy geare: as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> did <hi>Marwoods</hi> deuil, and <hi>Dibdale</hi> did fire <hi>Maho</hi> out of <hi>Sara</hi> with his fiery engines: this <hi>Quaeriſt</hi> I ſee doth not wel obſerue.</p>
                     <p>I haue touched before, that though euery prieſt be indeed annoynted with holy oyle on his thumbe, and by that oyle doth receiue in that deuil-burning heate, that doth dilate it ſelfe through his body, garments, and all: yet becauſe euery prieſt doth not bring his thumb pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and qualfied alike, but ſome haue a Millers, ſome a ſouters, ſome a Coliers thumb, that wil not take in oyle wel, and then ſome ſtand remote, and a ſquint, from the ſunne of light, and miraculous heate of Fa: <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Miracle-maiſter; it falls out, that theyr burning glaſſes doe not ſo readilie take fire, and their deuil-worke by their holy hands, &amp; holy geare, doth not alwaies fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly ſucceed. Yea, it falls out many times by your leaue, that the ſubiect where-vppon they ſhould worke being indiſpoſed, as not well managed, and prepared by the prieſt (as what fire can burne where the matter is not combuſtible, and of touch) the prieſts fire is ſtriken, &amp; no great combuſtion dooth enſue: and this ſeemes the cauſe there was ſo little fire-worke between <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> and them: and ſometime the prieſts powder it ſelfe, for want of good looking to, is danke, and then though the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21637:53"/>
ſtroke be good, no great ſparkles doe ariſe.</p>
                     <p>It was therefore wiſely foreſeene by the prouidence, and deepe inſight of theyr kinde Mother theyr holy Church, to prouide them <hi>copias ſuccedaneas,</hi> ſeconding and freſh ſupplies of fire-workes; that if their owne fire doe faile, they may light, and fire it againe at the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches holy candle. Yea ſometimes they light vppon ſuch a laxe, watry, and reumaticke deuil, that hee ſquirts out the prieſts fire, the holy brimſtone, holy candle, and all: and goes laughing away. This is when they are too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and imprudently apply theyr fire-worke to oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely, and directly againſt the deuils ſpouting place: &amp; then there is no way but to winde vp all their holy trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in a capcaſe, and to ayre them handſomly againe at the next pitch for a deuil.</p>
                     <p>If the Sceptick wil pry higher, &amp; demaund, whence the Pope, &amp; his conſiſtory doe borrow that diuine power, to conſecrate water, candle, brimſtone, Frankincenſe, potions, Exorciſmes, nick-names, and aſſes eares, and to ſublimate theyr nature, &amp; put into them ſuch a fiery ſcorching flame, as ſhal turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into ſerpents, and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, to bite and ſting the deuil, and to fire him out of his hold, as men ſmoke out a Foxe out of his burrow: theſe beeing of theyr owne nature, and in ſhew, ſilly poore ſtuffe to hold ſuch diuine facultie in them? This is a ſaucie queſtion, and deſerues to be aunſwered with ſcorne. But becauſe wee wil giue reaſon of all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from that ſacred head; wel may his <hi>holines,</hi> and his Chapter, doe as much as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did: for as for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and his holy Apoſtles, wee neuer read that they halowed candle, nor dealt with nick-names, and Aſſes eares, in caſting out deuils, but of <hi>Peter,</hi> by your leaue, there lies a tale, and that is this, as <hi>Thyraeus</hi> doth tel it out of one <hi>Martinus</hi> a Saint.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Sorcerer, ſent vnto <hi>Peter</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle certaine deuils in the likenes of dogges, to deuoure

the bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> being taken on a ſuddaine, not looking for ſuch curriſh gueſts, (as beeing belike at dinner) conſecrates on a ſuddaine certaine morſels of bread, and throwes them to the dogge-deuils, and by the power of that bread, they were all put to flight. And is not this a faire tale of <hi>Simon</hi> and his hel-dogges, that would haue ſnapt vp S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely for a ſoppe of bread? and is it not a faire ſtrong thred to hang a whole caſtle of fire-works vpon? <hi>Martin</hi> hath a black braine, conceiting bul-beares, and black band-dogges of Saint <hi>Peter, Ergo</hi> the Pope, and his Church haue authority, and power, to conſecrate and hallow water, oyle, ſalt, wax, brimſtone, frankenſence, potions, Exorciſmes, nicknames, and aſſes eares, and to put in them a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching fire to ſindge the deuils beard.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is a point of high ſapience in the Church of Rome, to chooſe, and ſelect out theſe poore baſe, and impotent Elements, as water, oyle, candel, and the reſt; for her champions, tormenters, and monſter-beaters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.

                     </p>
                     <p>The next grace we find of this holy element, is to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and mitigate the force of the deuil, and to bring the partie out of an extaſie to her ſelfe.

                     <p>And ſee the wonderous Antipathie betweene this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred element, and the deuil, if it come neere the deuils noſe, he findeth it ſtraight, firſt by the ſmel: for you muſt remember, that all this conſecrate holy geare haue one, and the ſelfe ſame ſmel; as the church, the prieſts body, his neather-ſtocks, and all: that is, ſuch a ranke ſenting ſauour,<note place="margin">Page. 5.</note> that as ſoone as they come neere, the deuil ſents them ſtraight, and cries out <hi>oh.</hi> So ſaith the miracle-blazer that there being ſo ſmal a drop of holy water put into <hi>Saras</hi> drinke, as no mortal man could diſcerne the taſt; as ſoone as it came neere <hi>Sara,</hi> ſhe writhed her face, and bad, <hi>Haue it away.</hi> And two glaſſes being brought her, one of conſecrate, the other common water, this ranke ſauour was ſo validous, and ſtrong, that it ſented through the glaſſe, and ſtroke her on the noſe, ſo as ſhe pointed directly to the halowed glaſſe. 2, Whereas water of it owne nature is refreſhing, and comfortable

to the eyes: your holy water, hath a piercing pernicious quality, ſo as the deuil complaines at firſt ſight, as you heare, that it makes his eyes ſore: and indeede you wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered him ſo much, that you made him ſtarke blind, ſo as hee could not finde the way out of <hi>Sara,</hi> but foyled himſelfe like a beetle, where he ſhould not haue come. And the noter of theſe gay miracles ſaith, that <hi>Sara,</hi> or her deuil, became a ſprinkler too, (ſhe had been ſo long amongſt prieſts, as ſhe was entered into their holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) and that ſhe, or her deuil, by the pure vertue of holy water, made a deuil let goe his hold vpon <hi>Trayfords</hi> lege, where he was faſt ſeaſed,<note place="margin">Page. 27.</note> in the likenes of a Toade and that ſhee, or her deuil likewiſe, with a few ſprinckles of the ſame, made the deuil that came to <hi>Trayford</hi> into his chamber, in the likenes of an Ehgliſh Miniſter, and was diſſwading him from the Catholique Romiſh church, to betake him to his heeles, and for haſt to leap out at the window, without taking his leaue. I ſee your church wil entertaine he-Exorciſts, and ſhe-Exorciſts both, &amp; <hi>Saras</hi> deuil for a neede, for an exorciſt too: and yet the poore wench, or the deuil, that by the vertue of holy water, could ſcare away two deuils from <hi>Trayford,</hi> (one in the likenes of a Miniſter, the other of a Toad:) had not the grace to beſprinckle herſelfe, but kept her deuils ſtil.

                     <p>And is it not great pitty, that all this faire water ſhould be ſpoild, &amp; tainted, with one crap of a word, dropt out <hi>Sara</hi> ſince: that all this holy water grace, was (as all the reſt) bare coggery, &amp; deuiſed <hi>ad ornandam ſcenam,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out the play, and to bring into requeſt againe theſe old water glaſſes of the church, that for want of ſale, had ſtoode ſo long on their ſhelues, as they grew fuſty, and naught.</p>

The miracle had beene ſtronger, if ſhe had been turned into a horſe.</p>
                     <p>And yet I truſt you wil not ſay, but that this holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſtrong enough thus: for <hi>Circes</hi> drench could doe little more, that turned <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> men into Swine: and yet that was faine to be taken downe, ere it could doe the feate; this onely beſprincked, did turne a Mare into a woman againe.</p>

                        <hi>Lucians</hi> oyntment I confeſſe (that he got a little of by peeping in at a creuiſe, and ſpying the Witch annoynt her body withall,) came neere the force of this forcible water of Rome. For <hi>Lucian</hi> tels vs himſelfe, that by that time hee had annointed himſelfe all ouer with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted oyle, he was turned into an Aſſe, and that hee ſo liued by the ſpace of ſix, or ſeauen yeeres in the ſhape of an Aſſe, vnder very cruell maiſters that whipped him ſore, as vnder a Gardiner, a tyle man, a Corier, and ſuch like: and that at laſt hee was metamorphoſed into the ſhape of a man by eating of Roſes. What would a little of that Aſſe-making oyle doe, if it had the good hap to be bleſſed, and ſuper-charmed by his Bleſſedneſſe at Rome?</p>
                     <p>Well, this holy water of Rome had as fayre a diſcent, as that <hi>Lucian</hi> oyle, for that did come from a Witch of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and this holy water doth come from the witch of <hi>Delphos,</hi> of whom the Roman Poet ſaith thus, <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git

And vvhat needs now any more wier-drawing, and prophaning of holy ſcripture, for the founding, &amp; crediting of your enchaunted water? it hath the ſame warrant of his ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, as <hi>Campian</hi> had of his martyrdome, hel, &amp; the deuil, <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> who you know doth not vſe to faile.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Sara Williams</hi> tels vs, that ſhe ſaid no ſuch thing, and that the prieſts themſelues, for the better gracing of thoſe foure holy ſcourges, were the deuils Heralds, and did proclaime them in her name, or the name of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, and ſo put it downe in theyr Miracle-booke as the deuils owne words. As they were faine at euery turne, in her fits, pageants, and traunces, to help out the deuil
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21637:57"/>
in her part beeing oft <hi>non plus,</hi> and many things falling in better <hi>extempore,</hi> to grace the play withall, then that which was meditated and ſet downe in her part. And therefore they would often ſay, and write downe, that <hi>Saras</hi> deuil ſaid thus, and ſo, where none but the prieſt-deuil himſelfe, who played three parts in one, ſomtime the prieſt, ſometimes the deuil, ſometimes the deuils prompter, or Interpeter (as the puppets haue alwaies a mimicall prolocutor to tel what they meane) ſaid one word.</p>
                     <p>And why might not they to keepe the ſtage ful, cog in a deuil when they liſted, as gameſters cogge in a Die: vvhen <hi>Agazarius</hi> the Ieſuit tels vs, that hee hauing brought from Rome certaine halowed, holy graines, &amp; hauing giuen them to his holy children for their ſeuerall neceſſities and wants, they by misfortune loſt the ſaid graines, and he comforts his holy ſhriuelings, his ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good children, telling them in honeſt termes, that a little prety peble ſtone taken vp out of a gutter, would ſerue the turne euen as well, ſo it were receiued &amp; kept, with humility, and deuotion. But our holy tragaedians were, as ſeemes, afraid, that theſe old brayed geare (holy water, halowed candle, and frankenſence) would not hold out, and play their parts wel, and therefore they thought good to cry them out of hand, as they vſe to cry Mackerels, when they are afraide of ſmelling. This feare was very needleſſe, for as you ſee holy water in this deuil-pageant hath acquit it ſelfe wel, eſpecially in the miracle of the Mare: ſo you ſhal ſee holy candle, fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, and the reſt, play theyr parts no worſe: for they were all deuil-whippes of the maker, of a ſtaight ſtocke, cleane corde, &amp; ſure twiſt, as true and wel-knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtuffe, as euer <hi>Wades myll</hi> did afford.</p>
                     <p>You ſhal haue holy candle play his part, in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour his owne phraſe and penning, for his better grace. The whole houſe at <hi>Denham,</hi> ſaith the Miracle-maker,

Yet the baudy Poet tells them, that ſomtime a little candle-light doth not amiſſe at that deuil-worke, and therfore not amiſſe inſerted by the Author, that an halowed candel ſhould ſometime burne before the deuil.</p>
                     <p>But in an other paſſage, the miracle-noter tels vs, that the deuil puffed at the holy candel, as hard as he could, and could not get it out: this <hi>Sara</hi> ſaith, was puffed in by the penner, to puffe vp a part for the holy candel to play: But I am verily of opinion, that the deuil puffed indeede, and that the prieſts had a iuſt ſcantling, &amp; ſize of the deuils breath, to know how ſtrong, and deepe the deuil was able to puffe, and when hee puffed his beſt: themſelues hauing often out-breathed, and out-puffed him, as you haue formerly heard: and therefore they knew, how to hallow a candle ſo high, and to ſuch a pitch, as the deuil with all the breath in his belly, ſhould not be able to puffe it out. And why not as eaſily, and with as good a grace, as to hallow a candel, to ſuch a ſublimitie, abſtract, &amp; quinteſſential nature, as doth this day burne before the bleſſed ſhrine of our Lady at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> without waſting or diminution, without receauing any adition of matter, to feede, and preſerue the light, except nutriment onely. It was no great diſgrace to the deuils puffe, that could not blow out the holy candel, being happily ſupported, by the holy candleſtick of the prieſt.</p>
                     <p>But you muſt be enformed, of a farre greater foyle, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the deuil, at the hands of a young child, by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21637:58"/>
the vertue of this holy candel, holden in his hand. Heare the Miracliſt report it, in his owne gracious Idiome. Sara <hi>being ſet in a chaire, ſhee raged more then ere ſhee did before, especially at the preſence of an infant, holding a holy candell, crying oft with terrible voyce, and countenance, I will eate thee, but the child nothing abaſhed thereat, was brought to hold the candell to her noſe, and to put him to ſilence. O Catholicam fidem! O fidem Cathoticam!</hi> that haſt ſuch a check, and ſoueraignty ouer all the power of hell, as that thy prieſts leade about deuils after them, as men leade Beares by the noſe, or Iack an Apes in a ſtring, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueſt thy young Infants, with ſuch heroical magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, as they dare play with the deuils noſe, and crie <hi>Iack deuill, ho deuill, blow out the candell deuill:</hi> and the poore deuil ſtands like a mute in a blacke ſanctus, with a bone in his mouth, and dares not ſpeake one word.</p>
                     <p>The two next deuil-ſcourges proclaimed from hel, were Frankincenſe, and the booke of Exorciſmes: the former whereof though it pleaſed you not to grace with any ſpecial miracle accompliſhed alone, hauing many new initiats to aduaunce, that ſtood you in more ſtead: yet to ſhew that your deere Mother-church did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow her bleſſing vppon ſuch a iewel for naught, you gaue him his due time, order, and place, and marſhalled him very honourably according to his diſcent, ſomtime with the powerful potion, ſometime with brimſtone, ſometime wirh holy water, ſometime with holy candle, ſhewing vs by the worthines of his companion, that hee was none of the raſcal crue.</p>
                     <p>Indeede you needed be the leſſe careful for this, by reaſon it is alwaies of worth very ſufficient to grace, and aduaunce it ſelfe, both in regard of the antiquity, as alſo of the honourable diſcent thereof, as ſpringing from no meaner ſtemme then the three Kings of <hi>Cullen,</hi> that brought it with gold, and Mirrhe, for a preſent vnto our Sauiour Chriſt. And therefore it hath beene worth the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21637:58"/>
keeping, &amp; eſteeme in your Mother-church euer ſince, and hath receiued her deere motherly bleſſing, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and benediction.</p>
                     <p>And ſo wee find that your holy Mother hath layd her holy hands vppon gold likewiſe, and conſecrated, and bleſſed that amiable mettall to, whereby it hath had, and ſhewed as much power, ouer deuils haunting houſes, walking in Churchyeards, and ſpeaking out of images, as Frankincenſe, holy candle, and holy water haue. But little did thoſe three good Kings of <hi>Cullen</hi> know, what a powerful rich preſent they had brought vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they preſented him with Frankincenſe, as little deeming of fuming any deuil in theyr way, or profuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a deuil from the body of our bleſſed Sauiour. But your eyes pierced farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe 3. Kings could, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is generally accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted they had eye-ſight enough, as comming from the head, and fountaine, of wiſedome, vnderſtanding, and wit,) and you cleerely ſaw, that the Egyptian prieſts, perfuming theyr two grand Idols, <hi>Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> with this holy ſmoake, and hearing <hi>Tully</hi> proclaime of theyr Images at Rome, <hi>in omnibus vicis ſtatuae factae, ad eas thus &amp; cerei,</hi> that they halowed them, and theyr Altars with frankinſence, and candle: you haue very wiſely, deuoutly, and heatheniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſmoaked your Altars, your images, your Churches, your veſtments, your reliques, your beades, your bookes, your breeches with this perfume, for feare of deuil-bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; and therefore you needed not vppon our deuil Theater to grace it with any new wonder.</p>
                     <p>The fourth feareful whip halowed out of hel, was the booke of Exorciſmes: which though <hi>Stemp</hi> the prieſt ſhewed <hi>Sara</hi> a little corner of out of his pocket, when he was new come from London to <hi>Denham,</hi> telling her he had brought her Maiſter a whip, and that <hi>Sara</hi> knew it as wel by the croſſes, &amp; figures, as a begger knew his diſh, or an old curre a kitchin whippe by a corner of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21637:59"/>
ſteale, it had beene ſo often thundred vpon: yet we find in our tragaedie, that this plaid not the moſt tragicall monſter-part, nor did not the greateſt wonders, and that vppon very wiſe, and important conſiderations. Firſt this booke was <hi>ſicut fortis equus, ſpatio qui ſaepe ſupremo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Olympia.</hi> It had playd ſo many worthy parts, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the garland ſo oft, in all the Liſts, Turnaments, and Iuſts, with the deuil, that it needed no new <hi>Io paean,</hi> to be honoured with-all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it hath hanging on it all the ſeales, and ſtamps of holy popes, for many hundred yeeres, with all their potent benedictions: and it hath had the deere, and louing mothers bleſſing, with priuiledge of birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and priority of honour beſides, and therefore it might wel ſtand, and breath a while without any new addition, or title of aduauncement. Thirdly, it ſerued wonderous aptly, <hi>ad terrorem, et ſtuporem incutiendum populo:</hi> in ſteede of thunder, and lightning to bring <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> vpon the ſtage, by theſe dreadful frightful Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, thundring, clapping, and flaſhing out the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Gods names, <hi>Iehouah, Tetragrammaton, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and the reſt: to amaze, and terrifie the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to poſſeſſe them with an expectation of ſome huge monſter-deuil to appeare. Who ſtanding at gaze, with trembling, and feare: hearing the huge thunder cracke of adiuration flie abroad, and no deuils to roare; and then ſeeing the Exorciſt, in a rage to throw away his thunder booke behind him, and hunt the deuil with his owne holy hands, and inſtantly hearing the deuil rouze out of his cabin, as a Lyon out of his denn; &amp; bellow out with his roaring voyce, <hi>Oh, oh, oh, I burne, I burne, I ſcald, I broyle, I am tormented:</hi> This muſt needes make the poore Madge Owlets cry out, in admiration of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the potent prieſthood. <hi>O Catholicam fidem!

For the force, vſe, and application of this Engine, I referre you to the tenth chapter: not that you muſt think, that the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome helliſh potion of Sacke, Sallet-oyle, and Rue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed together, and by force poured downe into her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke a full pint at a time; did of their owne natural qualities, fume vp, and intoxicate her braine, as <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> Giniper, and Henbane mingled together would doe: or that the owne vnkind fulſomnes of Sack, Oyle, and Rue, did diſtemper her ſtomacke, and enforced her to ſtraine, vomite, and crie: or the peſtilent, choaking, ſtuffing, pernicious fume of Brimſtone, filling her eyes, mouth, noſe, and ſcorching her with the coales, &amp; fire, til ſhe looked as blacke as hel mouth; did of their owne proper force, cauſe her to crie, ſcritch, and howle: for what helliſh Butchers would euer put a poore wench to ſuch paine: but you are to imagine, that theſe loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, intoxicating, piercing, broyling, choaking, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were ſuſpended in their proper ſubiects, by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne conſecrating power of the kinde mother church of Rome, that theſe conſecrate Engines made the poore deuil in <hi>Sara,</hi> to tremble, fume, vomit, ſtraine, ſcritch, and roare, by the pure vertue of the kind chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſweet benediction.

                        <hi>CHAP. 19.</hi> ¶ Of the aſtoniſhable power of Nicknames, Reliques, and Aſſes eares, in afflicting, and tormenting the deuill.</head>
                     <p>WHen a Lyon, a Fox, and an Aſſe were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pilgrimage, it was much wondered at by the common-wealth of beaſts, what that conſociation meant, conſidering the diſſimilitude and diſparitie of the beaſts. So when a man ſhal meete with theſe three in a ranke, Reliques, Nicknames, and Aſſes eares, hee may perhaps muſe at this vnequall combination, but when hee ſhall vnderſtand <hi>quò iter vna capiunt,</hi> whether they bend theyr courſe ſo louingly together, and ſhal be aduertiſed, that they march hand in hand in an aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page to ſet vpon a deuil, to afflict, torment, and caſt him out of his hold, he wil muſe much more. This gentle muſer muſt be put out of his dumpes, by taking out his firſt primer leſſon, <hi>Ignorantia cauſarum genuit admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem;</hi> It is nothing but ignorance of cauſes, that is the mother of admiration; and therefore when we haue inſtructed this admirator in the ſecret cauſes, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this vnſeemely connexion, we ſhal eaſe him of his labour, &amp; cauſe his wonderment to ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The maine ground pillar, and principle of all, is the bottomleſſe deitie of the holy Church of Rome, who as ſhe is able to make Gods of bread, Saints of deuils, and to place them in heauen, ſo is ſhe as able to change flies into Serpents, fleas into Scorpions, Nicknames into whips, Aſſes eares into ſcourges, to chaſtiſe, and chaſe away all the deuils in hel. So as that theſe two Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, and Aſſes eares, are indeede but two cryſtal loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſes, wherein you may behold liuely repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto you, the authority, and diuine prudence of the holy Romiſh Church: Authority in chooſing out ſuch

                        </gap>gs of the world, to confound all the wiſedome, and policy of the deuil.</p>
                     <p>I am therefore in gentle, and kind wiſe, to aduiſe, and entreate you, that you vſe theſe looking glaſſes careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and aright, thorough-out the whole courſe of this our admirable blacke Arte, and that you meaſure not our proceedings heerein, by the ſcale of ſence, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or wit, iudging of things according to their owne nature, qualities, and formes, for ſo wee may be thought to haue dealt, not onely childiſhly, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, but many times impiouſly, and blaſphemouſly to; but to eſteeme of things vſed, and imployed in this admirable ſcience, according as they are improued, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimate, and aduaunced by the authority of holy church of Rome, and according to the ſecrets, and myſteries of the Arte.</p>
                     <p>As for example, what man iudging according to wit, vnderſtanding, or ſence, can imagine that a Witch can transforme her ſelfe into the likenes of a Cat, a Mouſe, or an Hare: and that ſhee being hunted with Hounds, in the forme of an Hare, and pinched by the breech, or whipped with ſcourges, in the ſimilitude of a Cat, the ſame pinch or marke, ſhal be found in the breech of the Witch, that was before made by the Hounds in the breech of an Hare, and yet ſhal you ſee this ſenceleſſe, witleſſe, and brainleſſe conceite, verified, &amp; made ſooth in the practiſe of our holy coniuring crue, the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really acted, and performed indeed.</p>
                     <p>Looke in <hi>Fid Williams</hi> Depoſition, and there you ſhal finde, that the whole Quier of our twelue holy prieſts, had a ſolemne aſſembly at the whipping of a Cat, and did whip the Cat ſo long in a Parlor at <hi>Denham,</hi> til ſhee vaniſhed out of their ſight; and ſending next day to <hi>Buſhie,</hi> to ſee in what caſe the Witch was, whoſe ſpirit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21637:61"/>
they had Cat-hunted ouer night, the Witch was found in child-bed, and her childe newly dead. Whereby it plainly appeares, that the whipping of the Cat, ſo it be done by Catholique prieſts, is no ieſt, nor the hunting of the Witch heere, no fabulous apprehenſion; but a good Catholique ſooth, agreeable to the maieſtie, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, and wiſedome of that venerable holy Church.</p>
                     <p>And ſo wil you iudge likewiſe, of nicknames, &amp; Aſſes eares, by that time I haue ſhewed how grauely, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerendly, the holy Church hath ſet them vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils head: and how by her ſoueraigne authority, and commaund, ſhe hath made him to weare, &amp; beare them in ſpite of his fuming noſe. Firſt, you ſhal haue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and conſtitution, as I finde it ſet out in <hi>Mengus,</hi> the Licentiate, &amp; authorized Maiſter for Hel; and next the practiſe of the Canon, by our 12. holy legates, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtitution of their deere mother Church.</p>

Clap on heere the Canon, for the long Aſſes eares, and ſeare them to the deuils head, with a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fire, and brimſtone, and let vs ſee how the ſeely <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-bitten Sowe-deuill</hi> wil looke. <hi>Hic exorcista proijciat imaginem pictam in ignem: Heere take the picture of the deuill, that you haue drawne in paper, and cast it into the fire:</hi> and what turmoyle theſe wrought in hel, our holy Exorciſts by their practiſe, are preſt to tel you.</p>
                     <p>Heare the Miracliſt report it, who himſelfe was an Actor. <hi>The Priest hauing placed</hi> Sara <hi>in a chayre: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the deuill to tell his name: the deuill aunſwered</hi> Bon-iour <hi>and began to make a ſhew of ſpeaking French: the Exorcist then reuiling the deuil, and calling him Aſſe in the French tongue, he ſayd, I am no Aſſe, I will not be mocked.</hi> This was a ſober reply to the Aſſe, without much adoe. But when <hi>Maho</hi> trifled, &amp; mocked the prieſt in <hi>Sara,</hi> and would by no dint of adiuration, be brought to tel his name, heare the Miracle-teller againe. <hi>The Exorcist ſeeing the deuill thus to trifle, and that hee would not tell his name, for abating his pride; cauſed to be drawne vppon a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21637:62"/>
peece of paper, the picture of a vice in a play, and the ſame to be burned with halowed brimstone, whereat the deuil cryed out as beeing grieuouſly tormented.</hi> No meruaile, when hee had a paire of vices eares clapt red hote to his head, with the ſoader of holy brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>Heere haue you both rule and practiſe of this tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deuil with nicknames, and glowing eares: now we muſt a little for our benefit, obſerue the ſweet docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that doe flow out of this nicknaming vaine. Firſt we ſee by <hi>Mengus</hi> her proloquutor, that our holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church beeing in her laſt breath, hath not loſt her lungs, but hath both breath, and ſtomacke at will, and dares ſpeake more luſtily, and ſwaggering-like to the deuil, then euer <hi>Michaell</hi> the Archangel durſt. For hee hauing an oppoſition, and contention with the deuil, &amp; the deuil playing (as ſeemes) the part of our ſwaggering old Mother with rayling, and reuiling termes, durſt not reuile againe, but onely prayed GOD to rebuke the foule-mouthed fiend.</p>
                     <p>Secondly wee ſee, that our Catholique prieſts deuils, ſtood in more awe of Nicknames, and the paper-vice then they did of the dreadful names of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, or the high and aſtoniſhable titles of almightie God: whereby it is apparant, that the old, and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way of calling vppon the Name of Ieſus ouer the poſſeſſed, at whoſe bleſſed Name wee read the deuils in the poſſeſſed did tremble and quake, is an obſolete, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated way with our holy Mother-church, and not woorth the naming: and that her deuils be new vpſtart ſpirits, of the queynt cut, that ſtand vpon theyr reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for feare leaſt theyr fellow deuils in a quarrell ſhould take them by theyr long eares in hel.</p>
                     <p>It was a prety part in the old Church-playes, when the nimble Vice would skip vp nimbly like a Iacke an Apes into the deuils necke, and ride the deuil a courſe, and belabour him with his woodden dagger, til he made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21637:62"/>
him roare, wherat the people would laugh to ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſo vice-haunted. This action, &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ſom ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, by reaſon the deuil looked like a patible old <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with a payre of hornes on his head, &amp; a Cowes tayle at his breech; but for a deuil to be ſo vice-haunted, as that he ſhould roare, at the picture of a vice burnt in a pece of paper, eſpecially beeing without his hornes, &amp; tayle, is a paſſion exceeding al apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that our old deere mother the Romiſh church doth warrant it by Canon. Her deuils be ſurely ſome of thoſe old vice-haunted caſſiered woodden-beaten deuils, that were wont to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the ſtages, and haue had theyr hornes beaten of with <hi>Mengus</hi> his clubbe, and theyr tayles cut off with a ſmart laſh of his ſtinging whip, who are ſo skared with the <hi>Idaea</hi> of a vice, &amp; a dagger, as they durſt neuer ſince looke a paper-vice in the face.</p>
                     <p>Or if you wil needes hunt vs into a demonſtration to let you plainly ſee, how a morſel of paper burnt, with a vices long eares, ſhould enforce a deuil to roare: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I beſeech you <hi>Aeſops</hi> couragious Lyon, lying in the Hunters-nets, after his freſh wounds, how he roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the nipping of ſilly ants, biting him on the bare. Was there euer Lion in our deuils caſe, before he comes to be vice-bitten with a peece of burnt paper, ſcalded all ouer with holy water, burnt with the croſſe, ſeared with <hi>Aue maries,</hi> rent with reliques, torne with the ſtole, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the amice, ſtung with the maniple, whipped from top to toe with exorciſmes, and beeing thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriated, and all ouer raw, a burning vice, with the leaſt drop of brimſtone falling vpon his bare, would make a ſtout Lionly deuil, I weene, for to roare.</p>
                     <p>For his ill bearing of Nicknames, I muſt needs take the deuils part: for though that I could haue wiſhed, he had borne thoſe contumelies, and indignities with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aequanimity &amp; grace, for that none but children, and fooles, are diſtempered with nicknames, and taunts: yet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21637:63"/>
conſidering the deuil looked into <hi>Denham</hi> houſe, as <hi>Preſtons</hi> dogge looked into his neighbours doore, of no malicious intent to eate any <hi>Christmas-pie,</hi> but to ſee how <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> went: and ſeeing a play towards, &amp; that they wanted a deuil, was content to make one in the play, and to curuet, foame, &amp; tumble with a very good deuils grace. Now when he was ſurbatted, or weary, and could no more <hi>woe penny ho,</hi> to be come vppon vvith ſuch ſtrange nicknames for his good-wil, as <hi>Bedlam</hi> could neuer ſpit out worſe, and be called <hi>Ninny, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, ſcabby beast, beast of all beaſtes,</hi> &amp; <hi>hungerbitten ſow,</hi> eſpecially the Exoriſts beeing pleaſed for want of better recreation, to play all <hi>Christmas</hi> games with thoſe ſowes, as <hi>laugh, and lye downe,</hi> and <hi>my ſow hath pigd,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil beeing but a prompter, and candle-holder to that ſport; would haue mooued impatience in a right vvell-ſtayed deuil.</p>
                     <p>And withall to deale plainly with the deuils to, and to tell them of theyr ouer-ſight with their deuilſhips good leaue: it is a folly to be laughed at by ſome, and to be wondered at by many, that any deuils in hel ſhould be ſo ſtarke mad, as to come in the Exorciſts way, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare within his circuit, or to croſſe his walke; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Aeacus, Minos,</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> the three Iudges of hel, be nothing ſo inexorable, nor in any part ſo cruell, tyrannicall, and tormenting ouer the deuils, as our Exorciſts are, who carry about vpon theyr backs the whole Panoplie of hel, Styx, Phlegeton, Cocytus; clubs, bats, whips, ſcourges, ſerpents, ſcorpions, brimſtone, coales, flames, beſides the bottomleſſe power, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exorciſt hath, (euery one hauing (as ſeemes) a priuie key to the bottomleſſe burning pit, to let out, &amp; in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theyr liking) to multiply the torments of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire vpon any deuil, vnto immenſity of weight, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in perduration: take but a little ſay of this from the parlie betweene <hi>Dibdale</hi> and the deuil.</p>

And the order of our infernall battaile, is the old auncient order, obſerued by the Romans, who placed their <hi>Triarios</hi> laſt, vnto whoſe lot it neuer came to fight, till the day grew dangerous, and the victorie very doubtful.

                     <p>Theſe dreadful tormenters for hel, we haue heere in hand, are not the auncient, famous, renowmed, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reliques, iewelled vp in the Popes Propitiatorie at Rome (as the ſacred violl of our Ladies milke, a peece of S.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21637:65"/>
As who would ſay, that our Exorciſts euer meant to doe God, our Sauiour Chriſt, or the holy Ghoſt ſo much honour, as to cauſe any one deuil, amongſt all the deuils in hel, that they had in hammering, once to name eyther God, the Father, the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt. Theſe (I truſt) neede no grace, nor honour from the deuil: but theſe <hi>Tiburne</hi> ſemideuils, ſainted from hel <hi>(Brian, Cottam,</hi> and <hi>Campian)</hi> were the Gods, that ſtood in need of their holy helping hand.</p>
                     <p>And heerein I commend their wiſedome, in choyſe of their reliques very much. Firſt, in that they tooke freſh greene new reliques, that were not antiquated, and out of date. For reliques (for oft wee ſee) worke like an Apothecaries potion, or new Ale: they haue beſt ſtrength, and verd at the firſt; and therefore <hi>Campians</hi> girdle, now like old Rubarb, begins to allay. Secondly, for that if they had brought of the olde renowmed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, ſom vnſtayed body would haue made queſtion, whether they had beene Saints bones indeed, or rather the bones of dogges, Cats, or Rats, or elſe of an old Sow: eſpecially now we haue learned <hi>Agazarius</hi> holeſome rule. Thirdly, our deuils being home-deuils, and our Saints, ſainted heere from hel: it was no reaſon that forraine reliques, ſhould obtrude themſelues into others poſſeſſions, &amp; rob them of the honour, that they worthily deſerued. But the laſt, and beſt point of their wiſedom, is this: that we ſhould haue had ſome ſcruple of the Saintſhip of <hi>Brian, Cottam,</hi> and <hi>Campian,</hi> if wee had not heard them thus ſolemnly, lowdly, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly ſainted from <hi>Tiburne,</hi> hel, and the deuil.</p>
                     <p>Heere I had concluded this part of the Pageant, but that <hi>Sara</hi> nips me by the eare, and tells me, that I haue forgotten a ſpecial point of relique-ſeruice, and points me to her depoſition, which when I had turned my booke, and reade ouer, I pointed at her againe, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to pen that point her ſelfe; and therefore thus

It is able to poſſeſſe a man, with <hi>Marwoods</hi> fury, to crie out, <hi>terra dehiſce, infernum abſorbe. Earth gape, and hell ſwallow</hi> ſuch deuil-ſaints, ſuch deuil-reliques, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil-prieſts and all. Was it euer heard, that any heathen durſt euer abuſe, the vileſt thing conſecrated to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol deuils, in ſuch execrable manner? Holy Saints, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reliques, holy prieſts, holy deuil that made them, and moued them to this. It was no meruaile they made ſo much haſt with the deuil, to Saint their Champions, <hi>Campian,</hi> and his crue from hell, and to deifie, or hellifie their reliques; ſince they were to be applied to ſuch a diabolical ſeruice, as the deuil himſelfe without ſuch a relique, could neuer haue accompliſhed: nay, wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reade, that the deuil durſt abuſe any thing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated but in ſhew, to any ſo deſpicable imployment. <hi>Tiburne</hi> doth bluſh, that bare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the deuil doth ſhame, that made ſuch deuil-ſaints, and helliſh reliques; and yet the prieſts, the conſecrators, deuiſers, and appliers, doe ſhew their bare hel-burnt faces, without bluſhing at all. <hi>Diris deuoueo, &amp; actores, &amp; ſpectatores.</hi> So I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</p>

                     <p>AS farre as the holy Fathers doe deeme of the Croſſe, ſo farre doe we affectionatly embrace, and eſteeme of the ſame, as an honourable, and reuerend monument in our Chriſtian profeſſion. But the common enemy of mankind, not brooking any moderation, taking aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, of the procliuity of our nature vnto ſuperſtition, hath ſo farre bewitched the minds of ſome, as they haue brought into the Chriſtian Church, that which <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> dooth ſo much proteſt againſt, in the name of all Chriſtians <hi>ſtaurolatrian,</hi> a performing of diuine honor before a peece of wood: then which the Heathen neuer did performe more before the ſtatue of <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other branch likewiſe ſpringing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame roote, that is, <hi>ſtauropoïſan,</hi> a feigning, counterfeiting, &amp; ſtamping of ſignes, miracles, and wonders to be done, not onely by the Croſſe, but by the expreſſion, and ſignification of the ſame: after the very ſame faſhion, that the Heathen did fabulouſly imagine, and deuiſe, ſtrange fountaines of delicacies to flow from the horne of <hi>Iupiters</hi> Goat.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two ſuperſtitious delirations haue made vs partly odious, partly ridiculous to the prophane Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people. <hi>Lucian</hi> found this doting humor betimes, in ſome Chriſtians of his time, and makes himſelfe, and the world ſport with it, as he did at the fancies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies of all other religions: telling vs a tale of one <hi>Eucrates,</hi> who had a ring, made of a peece of old Iron, which had ſometime beene a peece of an Iron croſſe, &amp; that ring was an amulet againſt all malignant ſpirits. And blind <hi>Thyraeus</hi> the Ieſuit, repeats the ſame ruſtie tale of the ring, as if ſcoffing <hi>Lucian</hi> had meant nothing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21637:67"/>
but ſooth. But hee may as good cheape affoord vs the tale of <hi>Eucrates,</hi> as hee dooth the ſtory of S. <hi>Margaret:</hi> who with the bare ſigne of the Croſſe afrighted a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, that was comming vnto her in the forme of a great Dragon. Or that of <hi>Martian,</hi> and <hi>Iulian,</hi> who with the ſigne of the Croſſe, went vp and downe killing of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, as <hi>Hercules</hi> did Monſters: or that of the old man, who ſpying an Aſpe in the bottom of a fountaine, did front the entrance to the fountaine with ſo many ſignes of the Croſſe, as hee went downe to the bottom, filled his pot with water, and returned from the Aſpe without any harme: or that of Biſhop <hi>Sabin,</hi> who hauing poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon mingled in his cup by an Archdeacon, who meant to make him away, ſigned himſelfe with the Croſſe, drunk off the poyſond cup, &amp; felt not the leaſt grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſtemper after the ſame. I doubt the Pope his Maiſter would hardly belieue him in this, who would giue ſome good ſtore of crownes, to be ſecured by croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the danger of poyſon. I doe not ſee poyſoning any where ſo rife as in Italy, and eſpecially at Rome, where Croſſes are not dainty.</p>

                     <p>Our deuill-comaedians, whoſe ayme was (as you ſee) by playing ouer all the trinkets, toyes, &amp; pedlars ware of the Popes holy budget, and by gracing them vvith ſome ſeeming quality againſt the deuil, to aduaunce the credit, of the Catholique church, and to bring into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration theyr owne perſons, and prieſtly power, that ſo they might catch the poore Gudgins, they fiſhed ſo induſtriouſly for; left out no old ceremonie, nor Engine of the Romane Church, that had any name, or reputed faculty that way: and therefore they muſtered the Church ſtandard amongſt theyr fierie troupes, but they did aduaunce, and adorne with moe miracles, their new reliques, and theyr owne proper perſons, theyr hands theyr gloues, theyr ſtockings, theyr prieſtly ornaments, as theyr amice, ſtole, maniple, and albe, then they did the old approoued coate-armour of the Church: and that vpon a right wiſe ground; in regard, that theſe did more properly, neerely, and effectually worke for the magnifying of themſelues, and theyr prieſtly authority.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the holy Croſſe was often preſented on the ſtage, but neuer with that acclamation, and <hi>plaudite,</hi> that their other forenamed holy implements were. The firſt honour the Miracliſt doth beſtow vppon it, is this: that it ſerued to diſcouer <hi>Sara</hi> to haue a deuil, in that ſhee could hardly be brought to ſigne herſelfe with the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21637:68"/>
ſigne of the Croſſe. Next it, holy water at a pinch, when it would not goe downe, paſt <hi>Saras</hi> mouth into her throat, but ſtucke in the way, her throat was ſigned with the croſſe, &amp; then it ſlipped down, as eaſily as a draught of Ale. It ſeemes that holy water was old; for you ſee when it was freſh, the deuil himſelfe was not able to come within the ſmell, but leapt out at a window for haſt to be gone. Thirdly, it reſtored ſpeech to <hi>Sarah,</hi> when it was loſt. <hi>Sara could not ſpeake</hi> (ſaies the Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) <hi>till the prieſt had ſigned her throat with the croſſe. Sara</hi> was now a ſcholler of ſome ſtanding (as ſhee ſaith) and knew, when her cue came to ſay ouer her geare.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sara</hi> knew a peece of the croſſe by the ſmell, and that might ſhe doe right wel, for they kept it ſo ſweet in a boxe,<note place="margin">See her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amina.</note> (ſaith <hi>Sara</hi>) that ſhe muſt haue had a ſhrewd poſe, that ſhould not haue found it. Fiftly, it brought <hi>Sara</hi> to her ſelfe when ſhee was in a traunce, or opened her eyes when ſhee was broade awake. Yet old <hi>Edmunds</hi> beſtowes more grace vppon it alone then all theſe: for when he had hunted vp the deuil into <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> head with his holy hands, meaning to barricado him there, that the people might ſee him looke out at <hi>Marwoods</hi> eyes, eares, and noſe, as a priſoner doth vſe to looke out at an yron grate: hee ſignes <hi>Marwoods</hi> throat with the ſigne of the Croſſe, with this holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration, <hi>hîc Christi limen eſt, hos limites ne tranſcende: this is Chriſtes owne limit, ſee that yee ſtep not ouer this line:</hi> and yet as ſeemes, for feare the deuil ſhould haue aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, to put his foote ouer the line, hee claps on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred maniple to, &amp; winds it about his neck, that if there were neede, the Croſſe might call to his good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to helpe ſtop the thiefe. For theſe holy hunting Engines were better managed, then our ordinary cry of hounds, that wil flie out, euery one ſtriuing to leade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the chaſe, and leaue his fellowes behind: our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dogges had beene managed to ſtay for each other,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21637:68"/>
that the cry might be ful, and that one might help out another at a dead fault. And thus they diſmiſſed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſe the ſtage, without any great alarum, or ſound of the common drum: Enters the holy Sacrament vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their ſtage, deformed by theſe hell-monſters into a moſt deteſtable Idoll of the maſſe, with a farre more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne grace, (worthy of a far better place, if theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants had not playd ſo long with hel-ſmoake, that it had put out theyr eyes cleane) but they that haue playd with God, Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, the deuill muſt giue them leaue to play with Chriſtes bleſſed inſtitution to. I ſay they preſent it with great pompe, in regard of the thriſe glorious ſtate, impiouſly, blaſphemouſly, and chimerically conceited by them to be in royall perſon within. Such a monſtrous metamorphoſis, as <hi>Homer, Pindarus, Heſiode,</hi> nor all the fabulous Graecian wits put in a maſh durſt neuer faine, forge, or dreame of any their deſpicable gods, that any God ſhould be made of a morſell of bread.</p>
                     <p>This new molded maſſe-Idoll, laughed at by ſome, loathed by many, deteſted of all pious, and ingenious ſpirits, that haue not intoxicated their wits with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted Babylonian chalice; wanting witneſſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and beeing hiſſed at on earth, muſt be brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our deuil-ſtage, to be graced, honoured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from hell. And the ſame deuil, that ſainted <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,</hi> and <hi>Brian,</hi> muſt with the ſame blacke breath, and foule mouth, deïfie this bread-Idoll, and make it a God. And that it may be a perfect <hi>Chimaera,</hi> compounded all of fiction, and fantaſticall imagination; the ſmoake, the fire, the ſtench, the roare, hell, and the deuill muſt be cogged, feigned, and playd, to help out with this infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and diabolicall faſcination.</p>
                     <p>Would it not cauſe men, and Angels to wonder, at the deſperate boldnes of the Ethnick Romiſh Church, that ſhould dare ſo impiouſly, and blaſphemouſly to

                     <p>Heare our owne Miracle-monger, and his crue, how handſomly they act the maſſe-monſter from hel. Firſt, <hi>Saras</hi> deuil findes the Communicants that had beene at maſſe, by the ſmel. The Romaine Church, and her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are of one, and the ſame perfume, that doe out-ſmel the fuming lake, ſpoken of in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> nay hel, the deuil, &amp; all. Next the bleſſed Sacrament, was preſented in a Pix: heere <hi>Saras deuill roared like a Bull:</hi> It ſhould haue beene: <hi>bellowed like a Cow,</hi> for hers was a ſhe deuil. Heere the real preſence is roared out by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> deuil. Then <hi>Saras</hi> deuil was brought vnto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, at the time of eleuation, and could not behold the Sacrament, for the brightnes, that ſhined about it. Heere the glorious preſence of our Sauiour in the Sacrament is ſpied out by the deuil. At an other eleuation <hi>Saras</hi> deuil could not abide to looke vpon the Sacrament, and when ſhee looked vp, ſhee could ſee nothing, but the prieſts fingers. Heere is an euident daemonſtration, that our Sauiour was there preſent, in that he made the hoaſt to vaniſh out of <hi>Saras</hi> deuils ſight.</p>
                     <p>When nothing would doe, the preſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21637:70"/>
made <hi>Maho</hi> tel his name, controlled him, calmed him, couched him, as quiet, and gentle, as a dogge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a bench, <hi>Maho Saras</hi> deuil, being commaunded to kiſſe the bleſſed Sacrament, durſt not diſobey, but kiſſed it very reuerently, as children kiſſe the rod. The deuil being commaunded to take his oath, vppon the bleſſed Sacrament, he durſt not refuſe, but ſwore very deuoutly, that he would tel his name, and be gone: and yet like a falſe rake-hel, periured himſelfe, and ſtayed ſtil: and when hee ſhould be brought to his booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſwore he would breake his owne necke, ere he would ſweare the ſecond time, and for feare (as ſeemes) that the deuil ſhould make away himſelfe, &amp; ſo the play be mard afore the <hi>plaudite,</hi> they let him alone.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are demonſtrations, by deduction from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, of our Sauiour his real preſence: but wil you heare the deuil put you out of doubt, by his owne authentical aſſeueration, <hi>Dibdale</hi> the prieſt, put his finger into <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> mouth, and bid the deuil bite it, if he durſt: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil aunſwered, ſaith the Miracliſt, that <hi>it had touched the Lord.</hi>

Were it not great pitty, this deuil, hel, and oath, ſhould be cogged, and not a true deuil indeede?

ſpiritus, qui cerebrum pingunt turbulentis phantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus,</hi> becauſe from their blacke &amp; ſooty blood, gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie fuliginous ſpirits do fume into their braine, which bring blacke, gloomy, and frightful images, repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſimilitudes in them, wherwith the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is troubled, and oppreſt. Men of this duskie, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, and fantaſticall diſpoſition, as they are very ſtiffe in their conceit, abſolute in their owne apprehenſion, extreame violent, and peremptory in their reſolution, (which al grow from the earthy dry ſtiffeneſſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurſiue melancholicke ſpirits, that doe poſſeſſe theyr braine) ſo are they ſo full of ſpeculations, fanſies, and imaginations of ſpirits, and deuils, and thoſe ſo Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall and ſtrange, as the Philoſophers old <hi>aphoriſme</hi> is, <hi>cerebrum Melancholicum eſt ſedes daemonum,</hi> a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke braine is the chaire of eſtate for the deuil. And an other <hi>aphoriſme</hi> they haue founded on experience, <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum magnum ingenium ſine dementia,</hi> there is no great wit, without ſome mixture of madneſſe. <hi>Iohn Bodin</hi> the Frenchman, is a perfect <hi>Idaea</hi> of both theſe, who beeing in his younger yeeres of a moſt piercing, quicke, ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue wit, which grew of a light, ſtirring, and diſcurſiue melancholie in him, fell (as <hi>Hermogenes</hi> the mirror of wit did) in the midle of his age to be a pure ſot.

                     <p>This man, though during the prime of his wit he was of a moſt, pregnant, ripe, and ſubtile diſcourſe, yet his wit beeing deepe woaded with that melancholick blacke dye, had his braine <hi>veram ſedem daemonum,</hi> the theater, and ſporting houſe for deuils to daunce in: for he hath in his braine, ſuch ſtrange ſpeculations, fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and theoremes for deuils, as a man may ſee a great deale of madnes mixed with his great wit. For he holds
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:21637:71"/>
that deuils may transforme themſelues into any ſhape of beaſts, or ſimilitude of men, and may eate, drinke, and conuerſe familiarly with them, and may haue the act of generation with women, as they pleaſe. And not that onely, but that a Witch by oyntments, &amp; charmes, may transforme herſelfe into the ſhape of any beaſt, bird, or fiſh: that ſhe may flie in the ayre, that ſhe may depriue men of their generatiue power, that ſhe may transferre corne out of one field into another, and may cauſe haile, thunder, and winde at her pleaſure. And hee defends <hi>lycanthropia,</hi> and the change of <hi>

                     <p>This mans <hi>cerebrum melancholicum,</hi> is a notable forge for our popiſh Ethnicks, to hammer a motly deuil out of. But they haue more auncient, and authenticke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords for their Night-owles, then this: as namely, that canonicall ſtory in <hi>Virgill,</hi> of <hi>Creüſa, Aeneas</hi> his wife: how <hi>Aeneas,</hi> flying with <hi>Anchiſes</hi> his father, and <hi>Creüſa</hi> his wife, thorough the ſtreets on <hi>Troy,</hi> being all on a light flame, loſt his wife <hi>Creüſa</hi> in a crowde, as he poſted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Citty, and how that <hi>Creüſa</hi> appeared to him in her ghoſt, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> went out at the gate, &amp; told him that ſhe was dead, and was become one of the walking night-ghoſts, bidding him to take his father <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> and ſhift for himſelfe. This is a moſt redoubted record of the walking of womens ghoſts. And for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of bad, and hurtful ſpirits in vgly, and monſtrous formes, they haue their preſident, and originall in the hiſtory of <hi>Mar: Brutus,</hi> who hauing put all his Army in a readines, for the laſt fatall fielde to be fought betwixt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21637:72"/>
him and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and beeing alone at his booke in the deepe, and ſilent night, ſuddainly he heares a great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in the roome, where hee ſate, and caſting vp his head, ſees a foule, ougly, monſtrous ſhaped ghoſt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afore him: and asking it angerly, <hi>Quis tu? Deus aut daemon?</hi> what art thou? a God or a deuil? The ghoſt anſwers, <hi>ſum malus tuus genius,</hi> I am thine euil angel: the Capt: askes fiercely again, <hi>&amp; quid me vis?</hi> &amp; what dooſt thou heere? the ghoſt ſayes, <hi>cras Philippis me videbis,</hi> to morrow I wil meet thee at the fields of <hi>Philippi:</hi> the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine anſwers reſolutely, <hi>videbo,</hi> Ile meet thee: &amp; ſo falls conſtantly to his booke againe, not bidding it God night. <hi>Brutus</hi> recounts this <hi>ſpectrum</hi> to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Armes, and <hi>Caſſius</hi> perſwades him, that it was but a dreame. But out of this, and ſuch like Heatheniſh dreames, what a world of hel-worke, deuil-worke, and Elue-worke, had we walking amongſt vs heere in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, what time that popiſh miſt had befogged the eyes of our poore people? How were our children, old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and maides afraid to croſſe a Churchyeard, or a three-way leet, or to goe for ſpoones into the Kitchin without a candle? and no marueile. Firſt, becauſe the deuil comes from a ſmoakie blacke houſe, he, or a lewd frier was ſtill at hand, with ougly hornes on his head, fire in his mouth, a cowes tayle in his breech, eyes like a baſon, fangs like a dogge, clawes like a Beare, a skinne like a Neger, and a voyce roaring like a Lyon; then <hi>boh,</hi> or <hi>oh,</hi> in the dark was enough to make their haire ſtand vpright.

                     <p>IT is a rule in <hi>Mengus,</hi> the <hi>deuill-mastix,</hi> and <hi>Thyraeus</hi> the <hi>deuill-varniſher,</hi> that the deuill which is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed, muſt be commaunded to goe out in a viſible forme, &amp; for the euidence of his departing be enioynd, to cracke a quarrie in the glaſſe window, or to blow out a candle: which beeing two ſuch ſupernaturall actions, as by a conſorted conſpirator with the Exorciſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of a cherry-ſtone, or the ſuddaine puffe of a wenches breath, or the ſwinge of her ſleeue, cannot cleanly be conueied, it is no maruell though they be made a demonſtration, that the deuil is ſurely gone. The penner of our deuil-tragaedy hath not forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe good <hi>decorum</hi> in this, for hee hath fancied, and feigned diuers well ſeeming formes, and ſimilitudes, for his ſtage deuils to weare at their taking their leaue.</p>
                     <p>The firſt deuill that was diſſeiſed was <hi>Smolkin, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> ſpirit, whom <hi>Sara</hi> eſpied (ſaith the Miracliſt) to goe out at <hi>Trayfords</hi> right eare in the forme of a <hi>Mouſe,</hi> and it made the poore wench at the fight of the <hi>Mouſe</hi> almoſt out of her wits.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge,</hi> who appeared (ſaith our Authour) to the poſſeſſed parties at his going our, like <hi>a flame of fire,</hi> and lay glowing in the fire in <hi>Trayfords</hi> ſight, till he had a new charge. The third was <hi>Haberdidance, Saras</hi> dauncing deuil: who appeared to the patient, like a <hi>whirlwind,</hi> turning round like a flame of fire, &amp; his voyce was heard by a Cooke, as hee flew ouer the Larder. Captaine <hi>Filpot</hi> went his way in the likenes of a <hi>ſmoke,</hi> turning round, and ſo tooke his way vp into the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

                        <hi>Lusty Dicke</hi> (as ſeemes) did ſlippe a button in one of his turnes aboue ground: for he went out in a foule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauory <hi>ſtench.

Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretto</hi> in a <hi>ſmoke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Maiſter <hi>Maynie</hi> had in him (as you haue heard) the Maiſter-deuils of the ſeauen deadly ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his deuils went out in the forme of thoſe creatures, that haue neereſt reſemblance vnto thoſe ſinnes: as for example; the ſpirit of <hi>Pride</hi> went out in the forme of a <hi>Peacocke</hi> (forſooth) the ſpirit of <hi>Sloth</hi> in the likeneſſe of an <hi>Aſſe:</hi> the ſpirit of <hi>Enuy</hi> in the ſimilitude of a <hi>Dog:</hi> the ſpirit of <hi>Gluttony</hi> in the forme of a <hi>Woolfe.</hi> But it is to be wondered at, that Generall <hi>Maho,</hi> at the laſt, and moſt dreadfull exorciſme of all, when hee was expelled with 22000. yeeres torment layd vppon his backe, hee ſlunke out without any ſimilitude at all. And more, an ordinary Reader will wonder, that <hi>Maho,</hi> beeing <hi>Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> of hell, is ſaid in the Legend of Miracles, and ſo noted by <hi>Sara,</hi> to haue choſen ſuch a ſtrange part in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> for his paſſage out, as I dare not name: and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, comaedians, and their reporters may haue licence in all Courts to call all things by their name. And indeede heere lyes the wonders of all, conſidering that that name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe part, the deuils port-gate in <hi>Sara,</hi> was the prieſts queſt and haunt, which they had hunted ſore, had croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, recroſſed, and ſurcroſſed with their holy hands, had ſacred, or ſeared vvith application of their reuerend ſtrong reliques, and other their potent holy parts, (as you haue heard poore <hi>Sara</hi> herſelfe confeſſe:) the deuill ſhould once dare to come neere that part, that had been harowed, (I would ſay halowed) and enriched with ſo many precious Iewels from Rome: but you ſhall finde
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21637:76"/>
the Authour noted that part, and aſſigned it for <hi>Maho</hi> the deuils paſſage, vppon very ſage, and prudent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. For they had kept ſuch reuel rout thereabouts, as they themſelues gaue out to ſuch as were ſuters to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> (as you reade in her depoſition) that they, and the deuil, <hi>(O fidem Catholicam!)</hi> had taken ſuch order, <hi>as marry her who would, ſhe ſhould neuer haue child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to returne to our ſimilitudes, and deuil viſages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Miracle-minter deales heere with theſe formes, and faces of deuils, as <hi>Soſia</hi> in <hi>Amphitryo</hi> dealt with the battaile at <hi>Teliboüs,</hi> who ranges two maine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, deuides them into ſquadrons, wings, and flanks, and makes them meete, and encounter, and none but himſelfe alone is vpon the ſtage. And indeed it is good <hi>decorum</hi> in a Comaedie, to giue vs emptie names for things, and to tell vs of ſtrange Monſters within, where there be none. When a man heares of theſe frightful ſimilitudes, wherein the deuils are conceited to depart, as <hi>flames, whirlewinds, ſnakes, cats, fire,</hi> and <hi>ſmoake,</hi> hee would imagine the ſpectators ſhould be much gaſtred, and skared at the going out of the deuils in theſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful formes, and that the chambers and roomes, where the daemoniacks and the company are, ſhould be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the whirlewind, ſcorched with the flames, and ſoiled with brimſtone and ſmoake, and that the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould tremble, to ſee the deuill whirle about in the ſimilitude of a <hi>ſnake,</hi> as a fire-dragon ſpoutes, &amp; whirles in the ayre: but at our gentle deuils departure, there was neither ſhape ſeene, nor wind heard, nor motion felt, nor flames, nor ſmoake, nor whirling fire-ſnake perceiued at all, and therefore you muſt heedfullie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, the Authours clauſe alwaies annexed, (as <hi>Amen</hi> to a maſſe) vnto the end of the ſentence: <hi>As ſeemed, or appeared to the poſſeſſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So as the out-caſting of theſe vgly deuils viſards, lyes thus. The prieſts doe report often in their patients hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21637:76"/>
the dreadful formes, ſimilitudes, and ſhapes, that the deuils vſe to depart in, out of thoſe poſſeſſed bodies, which they haue dealt with-all beyond Seas: and this they tell with ſo graue a countenance, pathetical termes, and accommodate action, as it leaues a very deepe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the memory, and fancie of their actors: ſo as when it comes to their cue, to play the ſame part ouer, (as namely, when after dreadful adiuration the deuil is ſaid to goe out) then doth the Exorciſt very ſoberly aske the party, in what forme or ſimilitude, the deuil appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him at his departing: and he hauing conned his leſſon of formes, and ſhapes before from the prieſt, lights vpon ſome ſuch forme, and ſhape, as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued from the prieſt. And then the <hi>Echo</hi> is: <hi>Thanks to the bleſſed virgin, and the whole Quier of heauen.</hi> And if the Exorciſt doe ſuſpect the wit, or memory of his ſcholler, as being nothing perfect in his Kalender of formes, he wil not ſtick, to prompt him by his queſtion (being afore an Auditory of Romiſh guls, whoſe braines ſwarme with bul-beggers) as to aske him, if the deuil did not depart in ſuch, or ſuch a forme; and then the actor either for feare, or flatterie of his good maiſter dares not but ſay yea.</p>
                     <p>Another rule you muſt learne in a Comaedie wel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conuaied for the deuil: that the daemoniacks be ſo neerely placed (yet in ſeueral roomes) each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that one may heare without benefit of <hi>Midas</hi> long eares, what is ſaid vnto, or by the other; and ſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond may be yare and ready, to take his cue and turne of the former, and put to a little of his owne wit, for the better gracing the wonder. Or elſe if propinquitie, and fitnes of the roomes wil not ſerue, for one to be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Parrat, and <hi>Echo,</hi> touching the ſhape; let the ſhape be handſomly agreed of by the deuil-actors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or elſe prouide a miſtris <hi>Plater,</hi> for an intelligencer, or intercurſitor betweene them, that may in a trice relate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21637:77"/>
to one, what the other hath done, and ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lusty Iolly Ienkin</hi> was conceited, &amp; giuen out by the Exorciſt to goe out of <hi>Sara</hi> in the ſimilitude of a <hi>whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſnake: Marwood</hi> was in another roome, yet ſo neere as he caught the ſnake by the tayle, and cryes out, where he lay, at the dreadful ſight, adding that hee ſaw it come whirling by his window, with a wind in moſt terrible wiſe. Heare Maiſter <hi>Maynie</hi> for all report you this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, the daintieſt actor, that euer came vppon deuil-ſtage. <hi>And as I aunſwer to this poynt, ſo doe I vnto that other, as touching the deuils ſuppoſed ſimilitudes, in theyr pretended departing out of me. Eytber it is altogether falſe, and deuiſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or elſe they led me to ſay ſo by theyr queſtions, as if they asked mee whether</hi> Pride <hi>did not depart from me in the likenes of a</hi> Peacock, <hi>it is very probable that I ſayd, he did, and ſo of all the rest. Or otherwiſe they tolde ſome in my hearing, that ſuch deuils did vſe to depart from ſuch, as they poſſeſſed, in ſuch kinde of formes. I pray GOD forgiue them for all theyr bad dealing with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you haue theſe Romiſh deuil-vizards of formes, ſimilitudes, and ſhapes of the deuils departing, layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto you, by their owne ſchollers and actors, to be naught els, ſaue ſquibs, crackers, and fire-works forged out of the prieſts owne fancie: and that there was no deuil, but <hi>Edmunds,</hi> or <hi>Dibdale</hi> the Prieſt. Now let vs a little looke vpon the laſt, and moſt artificial act of this infernal Tragaedie (namely, the final diſpoſſeſſing, and extruding the deuils) by which of their ghaſtly dreadful Engines, this concluſion was beſt, and moſt cunningly performed.</p>
                     <p>The firſt honour of this great, and admirable act of finall diſpoſſeſſing the deuil, did by great prouidence fall vpon a little casket of reliques; wherein there falls out wonder vpon wonder. For <hi>Trayford,</hi> the poſſeſſed party, eſpying a casket of reliques in <hi>Saras</hi> hand, ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches them ſodainly from her, and applying the casket
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21637:77"/>
to his owne, did expel <hi>Smolkin</hi> his owne Mouſe-deuil. Where the ſuper wonder is, that a man ſhould without Exorciſt, Albe, <hi>Aue marie,</hi> or <hi>Salue Regina</hi> diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of a deuil, as wee finde <hi>Trayford</hi> did: or rather the deuil diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe. For <hi>Trayford,</hi> the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, was moued, ruled, and caried by the deuil, as a wheele is by a turnſpit curre, that is put into it: ſo as it was not <hi>Trayford,</hi> that ſnatched the casket, but the deuil, nor <hi>Trayford</hi> that applied them to his mouth, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the deuil at his right eare, in the likenes of a <hi>Mouſe,</hi> but the deuil.</p>
                     <p>This doth plainly inſtruct you in theſe two excellent points: firſt, the dreadful power of reliques, when they lie pent, and packed cloſe together in a little roome, that they worke like bottle-ale, that is cloſe kept from vent, ready as ſoone as they be ſtirred to ſpout deuils, dragons, and all in a mans face: next, it reades you a plaine Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bodily feare of the deuil at the approach of an holy prieſt, who chooſes rather to make his owne ſquib, fill it with Gunne-powder, and ſetting it on fire, to burne, and blowe vp himſelfe, as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> did, then to attend the comming of a ſcalding Catholique prieſt.</p>
                     <p>The next expulſion of the deuil was by holy water alone; wherein the power of the holy relique is the more aduaunced, in that it came not from the hand of any anointed prieſt, but was taken by <hi>Sara,</hi> and ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the deuil, in the likenes of a <hi>Toad,</hi> and towards the <hi>deuil-minister,</hi> that came into <hi>Trayfords</hi> chamber, and they both vaniſhed away. So as by theſe powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments a deuil may not onely diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe, (which a man muſt imagine he had neede of great help to doe) but alſo put to flight any other deuil that ſtands in his way, or wil preſume to come within his walke, without his good leaue. For elſe what reaſon had <hi>Saras</hi> deuil to be diſpleaſed at his fellow deuils comming into
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21637:78"/>
                        <hi>Trayfords</hi> chamber, and to ſprinckle him away, but that it ſeemes he came rudely in, without <hi>by your leaue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The holy Croſſe put to flight a whole Quier of <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> that appeare dauncing the Morrice at the end of a gallerie; and diſſolued them ſo cleane, as there appeared neither <hi>flame, ſmoake,</hi> nor <hi>ill odor</hi> from them: and this wonder was accompliſhed by <hi>Sara,</hi> for <hi>Sara</hi> (ſaith the Miracliſt) <hi>ſigning her ſelfe with many ſignes of the Croſſe, the deuils in the likenes of</hi> Puppets, <hi>vaniſhed out of ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere our wonder like <hi>Amphitryos</hi> goblet, begets an other wonder ſtil. <hi>Sara</hi> by Croſſes puts to flight a whole troupe of <hi>Puppet</hi>-deuils, and yet the deuil within <hi>Sara</hi> cared not for the Croſſes one iote. Theſe (as ſeemes) were but punie vrchin ſpirits, that for want of good cheere at <hi>Denham</hi> houſe were pined, and made feeble, before the Exorciſts came thither. But <hi>Purre</hi> was a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a tough mold, and in reaſonable good plight: hee held the Exorciſt good tacke, til at length (ſaith the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter) by often inuocation of our bleſſed Lady, and the whole company of heauen, with <hi>Aue maries,</hi> and other <hi>Anthemes,</hi> of our bleſſed Lady, eſpecially <hi>Salue Regina, Purre</hi> was caſt out. Here Church <hi>Anthemes,</hi> as you ſee, caried away the bucklers, in expelling the deuil. <hi>Sara,</hi> the deuils ſweet dauncing ſchoole, had choſen amongſt all the heauenly Quier S. <hi>Barbara,</hi> for her patroneſſe, and Saint: who pittying her poore Client, ſeeing all the deuils of hel in the poore wench, and <hi>Maho</hi> theyr commaunder, came downe her ſelfe from heauen, to ſhew her grace ſhe had there, and that Saints may come from heauen a deuil-hunting, if it ſtand with their good pleaſure, and aſſuming the office of an Exorciſt into her owne hands, caſts out <hi>Maho,</hi> the black Prince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maho</hi> takes this as no faire play: and therefore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe complaines of it in his Dialogue with <hi>Dibdale: that a woman had cast him out before,</hi>

After a long, and painfull combat</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Sara ſayd ſomewhat cheerefully: now our bleſſed Lady hath knowne my neede, and hath holpen me:</hi> for the deuil was gone out. And it ſhal, I truſt, be no diſparagement to our Lady in this caſe, to haue a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word in ſhew matched vnto her highneſſe, which with the very ſound, pronunciation, and name had the ſame vertue in expelling a deuil, that her owne graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence in proper perſon had: and that is in the Creede, neither the name of God the Father, God the Sonne, nor God the holy Ghoſt, nor the name of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> (which as you ſee, is notwithſtanding dreadful to the deuil) but the bare naming, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of this word <hi>Catholique</hi> alone: with the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which ſillables onely, <hi>Sara</hi> (ſayth our Author) <hi>did put to flight all her pernicious deuils.</hi> So as this word <hi>Catholique</hi> in the Creede is as deepe a deuil-coniurer, as euer <hi>Mengus</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſeueral Champions (as you ſee) doe ſeuerally triumph, and erect their ſeueral Trophies, with ſpoiles of ſeueral deuils. But it falls out ſometimes, that the graund Prince of darknes doth combine, and vnite his forces, calling to his ayde his Leaders, Colonels, and

Captaines for hel, as <hi>Hiaclito, Helcmodian,</hi> and the reſt, and pitches a maine field: ſo as his forces ſtand ſtrong againſt any one of theſe alone.

the bleſſed Sacrament, making it a Pandar to their foule and monſtrous luſt, but partly by flattery, partly by feare, partly by the bond of violated chaſtitie, partly by their lothſome potions, and vnnaturall fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, brought them into the ſame diſſimulation with themſelues, and to act the chiefe, and principall parts in their diabolicall legerdemaine: and when they had once masked them in theyr popiſh nets, and gotten them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr holy ginnes, they did ſo vnmanly, ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſtly, and ſo vnnaturally vſe them, as the deuil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if he had beene indeed in preſence, could not haue vſed them worſe.</p>

                     <p>THe end of a Comaedie is a <hi>plaudite</hi> to the Authour, and Actors; the one for his inuention, the other for his good action: of a Tragaedie, the end is mouing of affection, and paſſion in the ſpectators. Our <hi>Daemono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiïa,</hi> or deuil-fiction, is <hi>Tragico-comaedia,</hi> a mixture of both, as <hi>Amphitryo</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> is: and did by the good inuention, and cariage, obtaine both theſe ends. Firſt it had a <hi>plaudite</hi> often; <hi>O Catholicam fidem!</hi> and <hi>O that all the Protestans in England did ſee the power of the Catholick Church:</hi> and it mooued affection with expreſſion of teares. <hi>Marwood</hi> did tumble, foame, and rage ſo liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when hee was touched with <hi>Campians</hi> girdle, as the gulld ſpectators did weepe to ſee the iugling knaue, in ſuch a ſuppoſed plight. But our Romane Authors, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds,</hi> and his holy crue (his twelue holy diſciples) the plotters of this deuil-play, had a farther and deeper end: which by this impious deuiſe they had atchieued pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie well, and that was (after the Popes dialect) <hi>the gaining of ſoules</hi> for his Holines, and for Hell, the bewitching of the poore people, with an admiration of the power of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21637:80"/>
theyr Romiſh Church, and prieſthood, by theſe cogd miracles, and wonders; and thereby robbing them of theyr fayth towards God, and theyr loyaltie to theyr Prince, and reconciling them to the Pope, the Monſter of Chriſtianitie. And for the obtayning of this maine marke and end, they vſed two chiefe ſubordinate ends. The one was to bring in the deuill on the ſtage (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the whole courſe of theyr tragaedie) as the father of vs all, and as the founder, protector, and fauourer of vs, and of our moſt Chriſtian profeſſion. The other, by cauſing theyr deuils to ſpeake, act, and behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as an hoſtile and ſworne enemy to them, and to theyr Romiſh ſuperſtition. Which the beſotted people conceiuing as the very true voyce of the deuill indeede, were brought to phancie and imagine of vs all, as of the grand children, and heires of Satan, and of hell, and to eſteeme of them, as of the children of light, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted heires apparant to the celeſtiall kingdome of heauen. In this theyr bewitched conceit, they vvere brought to renounce theyr duty, loue, and allegeance to theyr naturall Soueraigne, and to ſweare theyr fealty and obedience, to the vnnaturall monſter of hell.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the atchieuing of this impious, and trecherous deſigne (namely, the reuolt of the beſotted people from their Prince, and the moſt Chriſtian Religion, by the pure profeſſion, and ſwearing theyr obedience vnto the Pope of Rome) they ſpared no perſon, no condition, no calling, no profeſſion in either our Church, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, but abandond them all in theyr deuil-comae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the bottomleſſe pit of hell.<note place="margin">Page, 42.</note> And that the 7. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Babylonian</hi> beaſt might appeare in his liuely orient colours, to be he that durſt ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his blaſphemous mouth againſt the Almightie, &amp; his Saints, his accurſed brood heere doe that in the aſſumed feigned perſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, which the deuil himſelfe (though a ſpirit of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) neuer dared to doe: that is, to curſe, &amp; blaſpheme,

                     <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt I ſuppoſe would haue had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what adoe, to haue inſtructed his twelue holy diſciples, at the firſt celebration of the ſupper, in this Lecture of flying formes, and vagrant ſubſtances: and if our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had told S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that the bread which he brake &amp; gaue him, was no true bread indeed, but the accidents of bread, (who could not conceiue of leuen, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour mentioned, but he thought of houſhold bread) it would haue cauſed him to mooue many odde queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and haue troubled his braines, and hindered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion much in that reuerend, and ſacred action.

                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sara</hi> was tempted by the deuill to thinke that <hi>our Engliſh Ministers were as good, as the priests.</hi> If the deuil had not tempted <hi>Sara</hi> to this, hee had beene much too blame: for he beeing one of their <hi>chorus,</hi> and a principal actor in their play, &amp; ſo familiar with all their legerdemaine, did well ſee, that if hell it ſelfe had beene raked (as they ſay) and 13 of the deuils moſt deuiliſh Miniſters fetched from thence, they could not haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Weston,</hi> and his twelue deuiliſh tragaedians, in any degree.

                        <hi>Sara</hi> was tempted by the deuil <hi>not to ſay her prayers in Latine, becauſe God had not ſo commaunded, but in Engliſh, as ſhe had learned of the Minister, in her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: Deerely beloued brethren, the Scripture mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs in ſundry places, humbly to acknowledge, and confeſſe our manifold ſinnes, and wickednes: God ſaue the Queene, and her Ministers.</hi>

Was it euer heard of before, from eyther Heatheniſt, or diuine, that the deuil did tempt any, <hi>humbly to acknowledge, and confeſſe his ſinnes, before almighty God.</hi> Which are the expreſſe words of our ſeruice booke, derided by theſe helliſh Impoſtors, and fathered vppon the deuil? What are our faith, our hope, our charity, our zeale, our worſhip of almightie God, but Phariſaical cloudes, and wandring ſtarres, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of God, without true, and vnfaigned humiliation going afore? And what ſhal become of their much-commended mortification, penance, affliction, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the body, to bring it into due obedience, vnder the gouernment of Gods holy ſpirit, or in what order, and ranke, ſhal wee place theſe, if deiection of minde,

and humiliation of ſpirit, the acceptable ſacrifices vnto God, be the cogniſances of the deuil? Blinde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate malice cares not, what it ſpeakes, ſo it may ſpeak. For that addition, in ſcorne and ſuperbious contempt annexed by you, vnto our publique prayer, <hi>God ſaue the Queene,</hi> wee doe glory in it, and pray vnto God, from the bottome of our harts, that wee long ſo pray. It demonſtrateth plainly to the world, with what ſpirit you are led, namely by the ſpirit of Satanical pride, and deſperate diſobedience, that dare referre that pious loyal prayer to the deuil.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus farre the worthie dialogue betweene <hi>Dibdale</hi> and the deuill, wherein are many points of high &amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſideration. If we may be ſo bold with his deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips good leaue, wee would gladly aske a queſtion or two: firſt, why cutting ſhould make the ſacrament to bleed, and not breaking doe the ſame, if the body of our Sauiour be really there? For veines beeing the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of blood, there is fluxe of blood cauſed as well by rupture of a veine cauſed by violence, (and for the moſt part in greater abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance) as by diſſection of the ſame.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21637:87"/>
And againe I imagine, that (according to theyr moſt monſtrous opinion) our Sauiour had been in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the ſoule is ſaid to be in the body: that is, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Ch: in toto ſacramento, et totus in qualibet parte ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</hi> So as whether you cut, or breake the ſacrament after conſecration, the part that you diſtribute, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whole Chriſt, and euery part of him; then can no inciſion deuide our Sauiours body, and cauſe it to bleed, no more then cutting of an arme can deuide the ſoule. I feare his deuilſhip was too ſuddaine in this reſolution of bleeding, or els that his wits were troubled with ſmoake.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I wonder (conſidering the deepe wit, and policy of the deuil) how it ſtandeth with his wiſedome, to reſolue ſo cleare &amp; eaſily on the Romiſh Catholicks ſide, all the deepeſt matters depending betweene vs and them: conſidering (as <hi>Edmunds,</hi> the deuils <hi>priuado,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) that Proteſtants be all friend to the deuil, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks his ſworne enemies. This is to weaken himſelfe and his forces, and to cauſe his friends to forſake his colours, and flie vnto his enemies; as wee find, by theſe his temerarious reſolutions, hee loſt 4 or 5000. long-bild birds at a clap. Either all is not well with the deuill in his wits, or els the prieſts had ſo ſcalded him in the breech, as hee durſt doe no other. And what a ſtrange aduantage haue the Romiſts of vs Proteſtants, that haue gotten them two heads, whereof neither can erre, a Pope, and a deuill?</p>
                     <p>The deuils aunſwers &amp; reſolutions here to caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the prieſts, are diuine Oracles, farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the old Oracles hee was wont to make in <hi>Apollos</hi> Temple at <hi>Delphos,</hi> or the <hi>Trophonian</hi> denne: for they were mixed with aequiuocation (the new Ieſuitical, and old diabolicall tricke) but theſe are cleere, direct, and plaine. Dibd: <hi>What ſayeſt thou to the Sacrament of the Altar?</hi> Deuil. <hi>It is the very body of Christ, cut it and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21637:87"/>
thou ſhalt ſee it bleede.</hi> And heerein the deuils headſhip ſurpaſſeth the Popes headſhip by farre: for the Popes head-peece may ake with ſtrong wine, ſtirring choller, or ſtrong poyſon; and his Holines muſt haue a counſel called, and he muſt be placed in his Conſiſtorian chaire (as <hi>Caiphas</hi> in the ſeate of the High prieſt) ere hee can prophecie certaine and right; and it muſt be <hi>in cauſis fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalibus fidei</hi> to: and then he ſhal ſpeake truth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wil or no, like <hi>Balams</hi> Aſſe: but the deuils head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip needes none of theſe moleſtations, ſolemnities, nor exceptions. His cenſure is <hi>in actu vltimo,</hi> ready, quick, certaine, ſound, infallible, cleere, admitting no interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.

for a preface, and the reſt is an Oracle: and ſo all the grand caſes for either Church, or Common-wealth are diſpatched.</p>
                     <p>And if they want deuils in Italy, to exorciſe, and aske Oracles of: let them come but ouer into London in England: and wee haue ready for them, <hi>Darrells wife, Moores Minion, Sharpe, Skelton, Euans, Swan,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lewis;</hi> the deuil-finders, and deuil-puffers, or deuil-prayers: and they ſhal ſtart them a deuil in a lane, as ſoone as an Hare in <hi>Waltham</hi> forreſt, that ſhal nick it with aunſwers, as dead as <hi>Westons,</hi> and <hi>Dibdales</hi> deuils did. And wee ſhal as eaſily finde them a route, rable, and ſwarme of giddy, adle, lunaticke, illuminate holy ſpectators of both ſexes, but eſpecially a Siſternity of mimpes, mops, and idle holy women, that ſhal grace <hi>Modu</hi> the deuil, with their idle holy preſence, and be as ready to cry out, at the mowing of an apiſh wench, and the lowing, or bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a brainleſſe empty fellow: <hi>O the glory of God: O the power of prayer:</hi> as the Romiſh guls did troupe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Sara, Fid,</hi> and <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> and cry out at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration of the Exorciſt: <hi>O the Catholique fayth!

Haec tempora, hi mores.</hi> Theſe are the times, wherein we are ſicke, and mad of <hi>Robin good fellow,</hi> and the deuil, to walke againe amongſt vs: and (I feare) the latter times, wherein lying ſignes, faigned wonders, cogged miracles, the companions of Antichriſt, ſhal preuaile with the children of pride, gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, and misbeleefe.</p>
                     <p>We doe not aſſeuer, that the deuil cannot ſay a troth, or that he hath not ſome-time proclaimed the truth: we know he cried, and ſaid to our Sauiour Chriſt, <hi>We know thee, who thou art, the holy one of God:</hi> wherein he ſayd, and cried truly: but this was vpon coaction, from the mighty hand of God, and not vppon queſtioning, and dialoguizing with the deuil, which we neuer read, that eyther our Sauiour, or his holy diſciples did. Nay, wee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21637:88"/>
ſee that our Sauiour checked the deuil, ſo ſaying truly of him, and commaunded him to hold his peace, as not accepting of any witnes, or teſtimony from the deuils. If <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and his twelue deuiliſh tragaedians could in deede haue coniured a deuil: (as the deuil of deuil there was, but the cogging, coniuring knaues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) that would haue giuen teſtimonie to the prayers, Sacraments, and ſeruice of God, eſtabliſhed in our Church, (as they faigned <hi>Modu</hi> their deuil to doe:) we would haue diſdained, and reiected his teſtimonie, as our Sauiour Chriſt did.</p>
                     <p>But ſee <hi>Westons</hi> great wit, the Author and contriuer of this deuill-ſport. When the cogge-deuill ſpeakes of vs: O that is our diſgrace, &amp; confuſion: when he ſpeakes of the Romiſh church, and the bleeding of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: O that is Gods oracle, and their triumphant exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. O deſpicable heatheniſh beggerie, to goe a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging good wordes and credit from the deuil. And loe heere (good Chriſtian Reader) plaine Gentiliſme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out welt or couer. The Gentiles beeing forſaken of God, and giuen vp into a reprobate minde, did reſort vnto theyr Oracles, to aske other counſels, and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the deuil; and what doe our Romiſh Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors leſſe, or in other ſort, then <hi>Croeſus, Alexander, Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> and the reſt of the heathen Captaines did? Let ſome ſubtile Sorboniſt giue mee an eſſentiall difference betweene them. They asked the deuil queſtions; ſo doe our prieſts: they asked about matters of their common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale; our prieſts doe more: they aske about matters of God, and the Church, they tooke the deuils word for a graceful diuine fauour vnto them; ſo doe our prieſts: they accounted the deuils anſwer as the oracles of God; ſo doe our prieſts: <hi>It is the body of Christ,</hi> (cries the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill) <hi>cut it, and thou ſhalt ſee it bleede.</hi> Why now tis cock, or deuil-ſure, againſt all the Proteſtants in the world: except the difference be this: the deuill neuer aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21637:89"/>
the heathen Captaines in any matter of import, but in <hi>amphibologies</hi> and clowdes, for feare of beeing taken tripping in a lye: our Romiſh deuils, doe giue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers bare-faced, without any circuition, or aequiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all: and therefore our Romiſh deuils are ſure the ſonnes of theyr ſweet Sire the Pope, and the darlings of theyr deere mother the holy Church of Rome. But ô lamentable deſperation of the church of Rome! When King <hi>Saule</hi> for his diſobedience, was depriued of the good ſpirit of God, and had a bad ſpirit ſent from God, to haunt and afflict him, and that Almighty God in his heauy diſpleaſure, would neither aunſwer him by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim, Thummim,</hi> nor reuelation from heauen: he then in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate mood goes to the Witch at <hi>Endor,</hi> to aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of her. <hi>Quid dicis? What ſayest thou to my ſtate?</hi> The loathſome abhominations, and Ethnike Impoſtures of the Church of Rome, where-with they haue gulled, and made drunken the Kings of the Nations, being by the piercing glorious light of the Goſpel diſplayed, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to the open view of the world; and that church for her whoredome being depriued of the holy ſpirit of Almighty God, and giuen ouer to the ſpirit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, giddines, and iugling deceite; hauing now ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonie from Gods diuine Oracles, nor brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things from that heauenly cleare fountaine, nor preſence of holy Fathers, to countenance their monſtrous defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; doe in a deſperate fury, and helliſh reſolution, reſort vnto the Oracles of the deuil, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure vp from hel the Prince, and power of darknes, to be their proloquutor, and to grace them with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Heare their lamentable voyce, fraught with deſpaire, <hi>quid dicis?</hi> Prince of darknes, what ſayeſt thou for our Maſſe? What ſayeſt thou for our Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar? And now (good Reader) obſerue the top of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh reſolution, and the gulfe of diſpaire: wherein the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:21637:89"/>
Romiſh church is plunged: when neither God, Angel, nor deuil, can be gotten to ſpeake for them (for heere was neither Angel, S. <hi>Mary,</hi> S. <hi>Barbara,</hi> nor deuil, nor ſpirit, in all this faigned tragaedie, as we haue let you to ſee, thorough the whole courſe of the ſame) O lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deſolation! <hi>Weston,</hi> and his twelue Prieſts, doe play the deuils themſelues, &amp; all to grace from hel, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now forſaken of heauen) their pope, their Maſſe, their Sacraments, their Medalls, their <hi>agnus Dei,</hi> their charmes, their enchauntments, their coniurations, their reliques, their helliſh ſorceries: <hi>et praeualuit hec potestas tenebrarum:</hi> This power of darknes, played by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darknes preuailed, to the gayning vnto his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and to hel, foure or fiue thouſand ſoules, and that in a very little, and ſhort time. VVhoſe heart wil not bleede for pitty, and his eyes guſh out with teares, for compaſſion, of our blinded, beſotted, bewitched poore Nation? The rather, when he ſhal caſt his eye vpon the maine worke, ſhape, and end, of all this deuilliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, which was this. One of the chiefe impediments, that haue hindered from time to time, the deſignments of the Pope, the King of Spaine, and their agents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maieſtie, and this Kingdome, hath beene the want of a ſufficient number of Catholiques heere in England, to aſſiſt them: for the ſupplying whereof, his <hi>Holines</hi> hath from time to time ſet on worke all his inſtruments of hell.</p>
                     <p>When the Lords in the <hi>North,</hi> were to take vp armes againſt her Maieſtie, and the ſtate, the Pope denounced his Excommunication againſt her, and againſt all that ſhould take her part: and ſent his Prieſts hither, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to intimate vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what the Pope had done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but likewiſe to ſollicite as many Catholiques, as they could, to vnite themſelues in ſtrengthening that rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; aſſuring them, that they were abſolued from their duty, and allegeance, and that they were bound, vnder
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21637:90"/>
paine of the Popes diſpleaſure, and of incurring the like cenſure, if they ſhould refuſe ſo to doe. And <hi>Saunders</hi> is confident, that if there had beene ſufficient notice in time of the ſaid excommunication, the number of the Catholiques, that would haue taken part with the ſaid Earle, would haue beene ſo great, as that her Maieſtie, with all the forces ſhe could make, could not haue been able to haue withſtoode them.</p>
                     <p>At what time the ſecond attempt (as I haue touched in the beginning) by force, was in plotting betwixt the Pope, and the King of Spaine, for the ſending ouer into England of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> (<hi>Saunders</hi> being gone about that time into Ireland, to animate, and aſſiſt the Traytor <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and likewiſe to incite, and allure her Maieſties ſubiects there, to take his part) the feare of want of ſufficient aſſiſtance heere at home, did greatly perplex them: where-vpon, about the yeere 1580, and a little after, many more prieſts (and ſome Ieſuits alſo) were ſent into this Realme, then at any time before, to labour by all meanes poſſible, for the with-drawing of her Maieſties ſubiects from their duty, and allegeance, by reconciling, &amp; vniting their harts to her mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the Pope. To which purpoſe, it were hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their falſe, and alluring enticements, by exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without all ciuil modeſty, and truth, againſt the doctrine of the Church of England, now eſtabliſhed: by deprauing her Maieſties gouernment, and the whole eſtate of the Realme, in moſt barbarous, and outragious inuectiues, and libels, and by terrifying of ſome, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting of others, with ſtrange reports of the ſtrength, and preparation of the King of Spaine, and the Pope, ready to inuade this Land. About this time alſo their traffique, &amp; merchandizing, by pardons, medals, graines, Croſſes, <hi>Agnus deies,</hi> was exceeding all meaſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they deluded, and inueigled many of the ſimpler ſort. But all theſe deuiſes notwithſtanding, either for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21637:90"/>
that the number they laboured for, did not ſo encreaſe, as they deſired, or that the Ieſuits had an ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to carie away the garland from the reſt of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and companions in this ſeruice. Fa: <hi>Weston,</hi> then the <hi>Prouinciall</hi> of all the Ieſuits in England, deuiſed this helliſh trick of caſting out deuils: by the which they ſo preuailed, as they gayned in a very ſhort ſpace, foure or 5000 to be reconciled to the Pope. And ſuch was at that time the zeale, or rather fury of theſe new gayned Proſelytes, and the elder ſort of Phariſaical hypocrites, ſo kindled, and enflamed with the admiration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power, which they ſuppoſed to be in theſe prieſts, as (beſides the large contributions, which they gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) no meruaile if they would haue followed them through thick, and thin, fire, and water, purgatorie, and hel, to aſſiſt any forraine, or domeſtical power againſt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and her Kingdome. I wiſh, and earneſtly pray for theſe, gulled, deluded, bewitched poore ſoules, that they may now at laſt lay their hand on their harts, or that God would open their harts, to loath thoſe deſpicable Impoſtures, and returne vnto the truth: aſſuring them ſelues, that neuer any true religion, did aſſiſt, and credite it ſelfe by ſuch diabolical diſſimulation.</p>

                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that the tale read vnto her out of the ſaid booke, concerning her leauing of her ſupper, beeing greatly afraid, the 12 of October, Anno 1585, is moſt falſe:<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> as that <hi>ſhe perceiued beeing at ſupper a puffe of wind comming in at the doore, that ſhee ſaw a dog of two cullours, blacke and greene: that therewith a ſpaniell of the houſe bayed once: that ſhee this examinate, was then pulled by the eyes, that the thing that pulled her by the eyes, went into her mouth, and resting at her hart, burnt her intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: and that therevppon ſhe cast away her knife, and would
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21637:92"/>
eat no more meate for that time.</hi> At the hearing of theſe things read vnto her, ſhe vſed theſe words; <hi>O Ieſus that any body ſhould report ſo of me.</hi> That which happened at that time, was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>She ſaith, that beeing at ſupper, here was great thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, &amp; that there hapning one great flaſh of lightning, and a great clap of thunder, the dogges therewith ran out of the hall barking. And herewith ſhe confeſſeth that ſhe was greatly afraid, left of her ſupper, and grew to be ſickly after it. And more then this ſhee denyeth to be true, and maruaileth that any ſhould be ſo wicked, as to write in that ſort of her.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that after her comming to Miſtris <hi>Peckham,</hi> (GOD hauing done his part for her) diuerſe men did attempt, to offer her ſome iniury; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, ſhe was very loth to goe into any place, where Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> the prieſt was, not knowing him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be a prieſt. Inſomuch as when her Miſtris would ſend her with water to his chamber, or vppon any other buſines, and ſhe ſhewing herſelfe vnwilling there-vnto, they told her afterward, that out of doubt it did proceed from a wicked ſpirit, that was then in her, that ſhe could not at ſuch former times well indure to be in Ma: <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> company, or to goe into his chamber, he beeing a prieſt, as afterwards ſhe perceiued.</p>
                  <p>Concerning her Miſtris mouing of her,<note place="margin">Page. 21.</note> to bleſſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe, shee ſaith, that when she came to dwell with her, she taught her to bleſſe her ſelfe in Latine, and at ſome words to make a croſſe on her forhead, at others on her belly, at others, firſt on one ſhoulder, and then on the other ſhoulder, and with the laſt words vpon her breaſt. This prayer, and manner of bleſſing herſelfe she ſaith, that beeing dull to learne, it was a good time before ſhee could doe it rightly. So as when her Miſtris, and Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> willed her to bleſſe herſelfe, and to vſe the ſignes of the croſſe, shee beeing
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21637:93"/>
very euil at eaſe that night after the lightning, she could not eaſily hit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the words. Alſo ſhe wel remembreth, that in ſaying the Creede, ſhe ſtumbled at the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church.</hi> Otherwiſe she ſaith, that all theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers are moſt falſe, as that <hi>ſhe could not abide M.</hi> Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales <hi>preſence for burning, eſpecially when he laid his hand vpon her diſeaſed place:</hi> that she should ſay, <hi>her Master had commaunded her, that ſhe ſhould not bleſſe herſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe,</hi> or that <hi>ſhe could not indure a casket of reliques,</hi> or that shee euer ſo much as dreamed at that time that <hi>ſhe was poſſeſſed,</hi> or that <hi>the deuill was her Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> or that shee euer ſaid, <hi>our Lady did not loue her,</hi> or that <hi>our Lady was with her, and chid her, and ſaid ſhee loued her not.</hi> Theſe things she ſaith she verily belieueth to be falſe, &amp; that it was very euil done of them, whoſoeuer they vvere that writ them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Further ſhe ſaith, that within about a fortnight (as she reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth) they preuailed with her to make her a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholick, and then notwithſtanding the deuil was in her, as they ſaid, yet they cauſed her to receiue the bleſſed ſacrament, as farre as ſhee remembreth.</p>

                  <p>And concerning her dumbnes, and coldnes,<note place="margin">Page 23.</note> that <hi>ſhee could not ſpeake till they had ſigned her throat with the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp; applyed holy reliques vnto it.</hi> She ſaith that she doth not remember any ſuch thing, but thinketh it is altogether vntrue. At the leaſt, if at any time she were paſt the vſe of her ſences, it was by reaſon of ſuch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and drinks, as they compelled her to take: and that if she were at any time ſilent, and did afterwards ſpeake, it was not becauſe they had ſigned her throat with the ſigne of the croſſe, or applyed holy reliques vnto it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit she confeſſeth, that whatſoeuer shee did or ſpake, they would euer expound it, as they liſt themſelues, &amp; ſay it was done or ſpoken by vertue of holy water, and other conſecrated things.</p>

The ſalt they put into her mouth, and with their fingers, wet eyther with ſpittle or oyle, did touch her lips, her noſe, her eyes, and her eares, as she thinketh, and in the meane time she had a Chriſome caſt ouer her head, being of halfe an ell of holland, with a croſſe in the midſt of it.

At which times vpon her recouerie, they would vſually ſay, that she receaued her ſight, and hearing, and other ſences againe, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their reliques, and touching of her.

times. The manner whereof, was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>When the prieſts were purpoſed to make the wicked ſpirit to ſhew himſelfe in this exam: and to expel him (as they ſaid) they would cauſe her to be bound faſt in a chayre, and then giue vnto her a certaine drinke, which as ſhe remembreth, was a hallowed drinke, conſiſting of Oyle, Sack, Rue, and ſome other things, which are now out of her minde. But this ſhe wel remembreth, that looke what ſhe moſt diſliked, and hated, they would ſtil compel her to take, pretending that it was not ſhe, but the deuil, that diſliked it. And although ſhe knew that therein they did abuſe her, and that few women there are, that would not indeede abhorre ſuch a drinke, yet ſhe durſt not but ſeemed to yeeld vnto them, but indeed they did compel her ſtil, alledging that whatſoeuer ſhe ſaid, or did againſt it, it was the deuil that did it, and not ſhe, whereas in very deede, ſhe tooke ſuch a diſlike at that time of thoſe thing, as yet to this day she cannot endure them. In ſo much, as about three yeeres ſince, this exam: hauing a pangue of ſicknes in the Market at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſome of her neighbours gaue her Sack at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares vnto her, which as ſoone as she perceaued, she fel to be very ſore ſicke vpon it, and was conſtrayned to lye there all night: the offence of the Sacke being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie griefe she had, after shee was recouered of her ſayd pangue.</p>
                  <p>At ſome times alſo they would burne brimſtone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her noſe, at another time feathers, and diuers ſuch loathſome ſmels, which they ſaid were hallowed, &amp; then they would with very maine ſtrength, though she ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very much, bend her face iuſt ouer the ſmoke, which was by the burning of the ſaid brimſtone, and other things in a chafing-dish, which they would hold ſo neer her noſe, as ſometimes beſides the ſmell, the very heate would trouble her. When she was thus holden, she ſaith, that the very paine she felt, cauſed her to cry, and ſcrich
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:21637:97"/>

At one time shee was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely afflicted with the ſaid drinks and ſmoke, as that her ſences went from her, and she remained in a ſwoune as afterward it was told her: vpon her recouery, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth that the prieſt ſaid, that the deuil did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe downe into the lower part of her body, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when her ſtrength failed her ſo, that shee could ſtruggle no longer, they would ſay, that then the deuill grew quiet. At ſuch times when she cried, they vvould ſay, <hi>it was the deuill, and not ſhee, that ſo cryed.</hi> When she was in this taking, and ſo bound in the chayre, her head beeing giddy with the ſaid drinke, and her ſences trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſmoake, she doubteth not, but she ſpake many idle and fooliſh words, which the prieſts vvould expound as they thought good, which shee doth now perceiue eſpecially by hearing thoſe things, which are written of her in the ſame booke.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Page, 34.</note>As touching the fit, that it is ſaid shee had vpon the 15. <hi>Nouember,</hi> she ſaith that it may well be, that shee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hard ſpeeches againſt the prieſts in the heate of her griefe. And she wel reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth that diuers times, though she was loath to diſpleaſe them, yet when they handled her ſo extreamely, shee did ſometimes vſe ſome hard words toward them, and threatned to complaine of them.

Her ſiſter <hi>Frauncis</hi> beeing then in the houſe, and ſeeing how badly shee was vſed, did diuers times perſwade this exam: to ſteale away, and goe home, and complaine hbw she had beene handled by the ſaid prieſts.</p>
                  <p>At one time shee was ſo vexed, as indeede shee ranne away towards a little brooke, that was not paſt halfe a yard deepe, meaning to haue runne through it, and ſo to haue eſcaped from them, thinking that they would

And their pretence was for ſo dooing, leaſt she ſhould haue made away her ſelfe: which she ſaith (she thanketh God) shee neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but onely to haue beene deliuered out of theyr hands: vvhereas she ſaith, it is very likely, that they had ſuch a watchful eye ouer her, leaſt she should eſcape, as fearing she would complaine of them.

And it is not vnlikely this exam: ſaith, but that shee herſelfe to pleaſe them, did confeſſe aſmuch. Her pretended carying in the ayre, was made amongſt them a kinde of miracle, whereas this exam: doth know it to be a lye, and dooth perfectly remember, that she ranne indeede, as faſt as she could, but for any flying, it is a meer fable: although at that time she was content to ſooth them in it.</p>

But how they would greatly commend ſuch as were hereticks, &amp; many ſuch things beſides ſhe hath heard them report, as how the

deuils would complaine that when the prieſts touched the parties, that they burnt them, and put them into an extreame heate, and how ſomtimes they could ſmel the prieſt. Theſe things (she ſaith) she now remembreth by hearing thoſe things which are written in the booke of her ſelfe, and confeſſeth that by the ſaid tales ſhee well perceiued how shee might pleaſe them, and did frame herſelfe accordingly at ſuch times, as ſhe well perceiued it was their intent, she should ſo doe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo shee well remembreth, that at one time they thruſt into her mouth a relique, being a peece of one of <hi>Campions</hi> bones, which they did by force, ſhee herſelfe loathing the ſame, it beeing as she thinketh againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to haue a bone of a man put into ones mouth.</p>
                  <p>As touching the pretended trouble, that shee ſhould haue vpon the 25 of Nouember,<note place="margin">Page 36.</note> shee ſaith, that there were ſo many ſuch ſpeeches amongſt them, as she doth not herſelfe remember, whether any ſuch things were at that time, otherwiſe then as before shee hath confeſſed.

Shee alſo further ſaith, that ſhe well remembreth how one time walking in the garden with one of the prieſts, who led her by the arme, becauſe ſhe was weake, ſhe beganne to complaine vnto him of her hard vſage, and told him, that ſhee verilie thought they did her iniury, and that ſhe was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any wicked ſpirits in her more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were.

                  <p>Furthermore, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the pretended <hi>viſion of things like puppets at the end of a gallery,</hi> she ſaith, that she verily belieueth it is all fained by the writer of the booke, or by ſome that gaue him directions ſo to write.

                  <p>She remembreth,<note place="margin">Page, 43.</note> that she did feare the corne-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (that the booke ſpeaketh of) in <hi>Sir George Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> houſe; becauſe the report amongſt them was, that there had beene coniuring there for money.

she might vtter much tittle-tattle, that now ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call to minde.

                  <p>She further ſaith, that whilſt she was at <hi>Denham,</hi> one <hi>Richard Maynie</hi> being there alſo, pretended himſelfe to be poſſeſſed, and the Prieſts had dealings with him. This <hi>Maynie</hi> did behaue himſelfe in the preſence of the prieſts, as though he had beene a Saint. It was meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to conſider, what deuotion he did pretend. One time being at Maſſe, this exam: doth wel remember, that at the eleuation time, he fel downe ſecretly backwards, and lay a while, as though he had beene in a traunce. And when he came vnto himſelfe againe, he ſaid, that the glory, which he ſaw about the Altar, did ſtrike him into that traunce. But for all his pretences, this exam: ſaith, that he was but a diſſembler, and a man but of a lewd diſpoſition. He would needes haue perſwaded this examinates ſiſter, to haue gone thence with him, in the apparel of a youth, to haue beene his boy, and to haue wayted vppon him. Hee dealt with this exam: to haue confeſſed her ſelfe vnto him, ſaying, that he had as good authority, to heare confeſſions, as any of the prieſts had. Alſo he vrged her this exam: diuers times, to haue yeelded to his carnal deſires, vſing very vnfit tricks with her. There was alſo a very proper woman, one Miſtres <hi>Plater,</hi> with whom this exam: perceaued, he had many allurements, ſhewing great tokens of extraordinarie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards her. By which his courſes she percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he was very wickedly bent. Of all theſe things concerning the ſaid <hi>Maynie,</hi> this exam: enformed Ma:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21637:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Dibdale,</hi> &amp; told him, that out of doubt he did but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet all his holines, and that except he, and the reſt of the prieſts tooke heede to themſelues, he would in the end bring them to ſome trouble: where-vpon Ma: <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was very ſorrie, that euer he had had any dealing with him.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that at ſuch times, as they pretended, that she had fits, which was eyther, when she had any fit of the mother (where-with she was then troubled) or when she had beene conſtrained, to drinke their <hi>holy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> or when she was otherwiſe euil at eaſe, by reaſon of their bad vſage of her, they would in the end (when they were weary with dealing with her) ſay, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits were gone downe into her legge, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into her foote, and that they ſhould reſt there for that time. And againe, when they tooke her in hand the next time, they would begin ſo hunt the deuil from the foote, to bring him vpwards of purpoſe, as they ſaid, to cauſe him, when they had him in her head, to goe out of her mouth, eares, eyes, or noſe. And the manner of their hunting of him, was to folow him with their hands (as they did pretend) along all the parts of her body. At one time, when it began to be with this exam: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of women, (as ſince she hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued) whereby she was much troubled, the prieſts did pretend, that the deuil did reſt in the moſt ſecret part of her hody. Where-vpon they deuiſed to apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques vnto it, and gaue her ſuch ſliber-ſawces, as made her (as she was perſwaded) much worſe then otherwiſe she thinketh, she should haue beene. At ſome times they would cauſe a maid, that ſerued the Lord <hi>Vaux,</hi> to apply the reliques vnto the place: the which their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with her (she ſaith) she doth now loath the memory of it.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this exam: ſaith, that after she was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the prieſts hands, and that they had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21637:101"/>
dealing with her, vpon pretence, that she was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, she hath diuers times, being in ſpeech with Ma: <hi>Yaxly</hi> a prieſt, but her eſpecial friend, ſaid vnto him to this effect: Ieſus Ma: <hi>Yaxly</hi> I meruaile, what Ma: <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> &amp; the other prieſts meant to deale with me, as they did: I am fully perſwaded, that I was neuer at any time more poſſeſſed, then they themſelues were, and yet you haue heard, how they haue vſed me. And he ſhaking his head, would wil me to be contented, ſeeing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was paſt, and that I ſhould trouble my head no more about it, and ſaying, that he was very ſorrie for it, and that he hoped, they had repented themſelues for dealing ſo with her. Why but would this exam: ſay, tel me I pray you Sir, what you thinke of if, whether was I poſſeſſed, or no, in your opinion. And ſtil he would giue her no other aunſwer, but ſhaking his head, wil her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, ſeeing all was now paſt.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that the firſt time that the prieſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to haue dealing with her, one day they had giuen her certaine things to drinke, that had made her verie ſick, and being in that reſpect troubled, Ma: <hi>Stamp</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> London, viewed with a flearing countenance this exam: in the face, and ſaid vnto her, as though he had ſpoken vnto a ſpirit within her: <hi>Ah Sirra, I haue brought a thing for you: I haue a whip in my pocket that will bridle thee.</hi> At that preſent she vnderſtoode him not, what he meant, but within a while after, hee pulled a book out of his pocket, which was of Exorciſmes, which was the whip he meant. She alſo wel remembreth, that the reſt in the houſe told Ma: <hi>Stamp,</hi> how greatly shee had beene vexed all that day, and that they ſaid, it was becauſe the ſpirit was afraid of that booke, which hee brought with him, and the deuil knew that it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt ſhe was in the prieſts hands at <hi>Denham,</hi> one <hi>Haines</hi> was a ſuter vnto her, and although Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:21637:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commaunded her in no ſort to entertaine him, yet her ſiſter bringing vnto her a blacke Iet ring from him, as a token, she put the ſame vpon her little finger, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome-what too little, cauſed her finger to ſwel, as now ſhe beleeeueth: And there-vpon this exam: in her confeſſion acknowledging that shee had receiued that ring from <hi>Haines</hi> contrary to Ma: <hi>Dibdales</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, they ſaid it was the deuill vnder the ring, that cauſed her finger to ſwell: and wetting her finger, and making croſſes vpon it, they pulled of the ring by little and little, and ſaid, that it came of by vertue of thoſe croſſes, the deuill hauing no longer power to keepe it on.</p>
                  <p>This examinate alſo further remembreth, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards London from <hi>Hackney</hi> in a Coach with Ma: <hi>Dibdale,</hi> shee eſpied in the way a ragged Colt, and beeing the firſt, that shee had euer ſeene ſo ragged, shee asked Ma: <hi>Dibdale,</hi> what it was? And he ſaid it was the deuill: which put this exam: into a great feare, whereas ſince she hath ſeene twenty ſuch ragged Colts, and is therefore fully perſwaded, that Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> did abuſe her, in ſaying the Colt she then ſaw was the deuill.</p>
                  <p>She alſo ſaith, that one <hi>Sherwood</hi> a prieſt, while ſhee was at <hi>Denham,</hi> and tyed in her chaire, would vſuallie pinch her by the armes, and necke, and hands, and the places thereupon remaining blew, he and the reſt would ſay, that it was the deuil that had ſo pinched her. At ſuch times as this exam: when he ſo pinched her did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of it, and reproued him for it, they would ſay it was the deuill, and not this examinate, that ſo reprooued him. Of this iniury she hath complayned to Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, and hee would ſay vnto her, that hee was ſure Ma: <hi>Sherwood</hi> would not vſe her ſo, and that ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, in that ſhe thought ſo of him.</p>
                  <p>She alſo further ſaith, that shee well remembreth that ſhe could neither doe nor ſay any thing, but when they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21637:102"/>
liſt, they would ſay, <hi>it was the deuill.</hi> At ſome times when ſhe was well, if companie came in, to whom they meant to ſhew any thing, they would take occaſion, to peepe in her face, &amp; vſe ſuch fooliſh words vnto her, as might make her to laugh. And if ſhe did but ſo much as laugh vppon that occaſion, or looke away, turning her head from them, they had then enough, <hi>it was the deuil</hi> (they would ſay) <hi>that laughed in her,</hi> and then ſometimes shee muſt to the chayre, and at ſome other times, they would coniure the ſpirit, as they did pretend, commaunding him to goe downe into her body, and be quiet. And when this exam: held her peace, which was when they ſpake no more to her, then they would ſay, the ſpirit was gone downe. At theſe, and ſuch like times, when they gaue her nothing to make her ſicke, ſhe found her ſelfe no worſe, then ſhee was before, but was content to ſooth all what they ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſayth, that a maide, that came from the Lord <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux,</hi> was appointed at <hi>Denham</hi> to keepe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate, who did alwaies tell the prieſts, what ſhee this exam: either did or ſpake, and of herſelfe would alwaies tell this exam: that it was the deuill that ſo did, or ſpake: when this exam: did very well know, that shee did, and ſpake at ſuch times, according as she was wont to doe, before she came to the prieſts hands. By reaſon of ſuch her bad dealing with this exam: ſhee this exam: did not loue her, and talking of her hard dealing with her, shee this exam: ſaid, she had thought one day to haue thruſt her downe the ſtayres. And heereof the prieſts made a great matter, but did not blame this exam: for it, becauſe (as they ſaid) <hi>it was not ſhe, but the deuil,</hi> that meant to haue thruſt her downe the ſtayres.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſhe ſaith, that if at any time she did belch, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes she did by reaſon that shee was troubled with a wind in her ſtomacke, the prieſts would ſay at ſuch times, that then the ſpirit began to riſe in her. Whereas

diuers times ſince ſhe hath beene likewiſe troubled with ſuch wind in her ſtomack and rifting, and thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth that they ſaid vntruly, when they ſaid that that wind was the deuil. But as ſhee ſaith, if they heard any croaking in her belly, (a thing whereunto many women are ſubiect, eſpecially when they are faſting) then they would make a wonderful matter of that. One time shee remembreth, that ſhee hauing the ſaid croaking in her belly, or making of herſelfe ſome ſuch noyſe in her bed, they ſaid it was the deuill that was about the bedde, that ſpake with the voyce of a Toade, and there-with they ſeemed, as though they were greatly afraid. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate, though shee knew, there was no ſuch cauſe of theyr feare, if they were indeed at all afraid, as they did pretend, yet did ſhee let them alone, and ſaid nothing vnto them.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that one night whilſt this examinate was in bedde, there was a ſcraping in the corner of the chamber about the feeling, as if it had been the ſcraping of a rat, whereupon ſome that were in the chamber ran forth, ſaying, it was an euill ſpirit, that made that noyſe. And Ma: <hi>Cornelius</hi> a prieſt beeing in the next chamber, came preſently foorth in his gowne, with his booke of Exorciſmes in his hand, &amp; went into the corner, where the noiſe was. There he began to charge the deuil vpon paine of many torments, that he ſhould depart. Hee flung holy water vpon the walls, and vſed ſuch earneſt ſpeeches, as this exam: was very much afraid. Howbeit ſhe ſaith, ſhe well obſerued, that for all his ſpeakings, and ſprinckling of holy water, the noiſe did not ceaſe, till he had knockt with ſome thing vppon the feeling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe ſince hath verily thought, and ſtill dooth, that it was either a rat, or ſome ſuch thing that made the noiſe, and not the deuil.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that ſhe neuer dreamed in the night, but ſhe did tel the prieſts of it in the morning, for it was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21637:103"/>
their commandement, that ſhe ſhould ſo doe. And ſuch her dreames ſhe hath learned by their ſpeeches, to call them viſions. Of theſe viſions they would make of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what they thought good. Whereas this exam: confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that diuers of them were ſuch toyes, as came into her head being woken, and that ſhe meruailed, how they could make ſuch matters of them.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that oftentimes when ſhe was wel, &amp; that the prieſts vpon her laughing or words, would ſay: <hi>It was not ſhe, but the deuill,</hi> ſhe did verily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that they did not ſay truly therein, &amp; that ſhe was not at all poſſeſſed: marrie ſhe confeſſeth, that being young, and vnexperienced, when they came vnto her in ſo deuoute a manner, with their holy veſtures vppon them, with holy water, holy candels, and with the <hi>Pix,</hi> hauing the ſacrament in it, and prayed, as it ſeemed ſo earneſtly; ſhe did then alwayes ſuſpect, that there was ſomething amiſſe in her, as ſuppoſing, that otherwiſe they would neuer haue dealt in that ſort. But afterwards when ſhe was wel againe, ſhe had euer a great deſire to be gone from them, being verily perſwaded, that then ſhe ſhould be wel.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that except it were at ſuch times, as by giuing her the holy potion, and burning brimſtone vnder her noſe, ſhe knew not oftentimes what either ſhe did, or ſpake. The greateſt feare, which ſhe had at other times, when they vſed their Exorciſme, was leaſt they meant thereby to coniure vp ſome ſpirit, they kept ſuch a ſtirre, and made mention of ſo many names, which they ſaid, were names of ſo many ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Whereas in the afore-ſaid booke, there are a number of things reported of this exam: what ſhe ſhould doe, ſee, and ſpeake in her fits, ſhe verily thinketh, that (ſome fooliſh things of her owne deuiſe excepted) ſhe neither did ſpeake, nor pretended to ſee any thing, but in ſuch ſort, as ſhe had heard the prieſts report, that other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21637:103"/>

And further shee ſaith, that after shee once came to be vnder their hands, they vſed the matter ſo with her, as that she neuer durſt doe any thing, but what ſhe thought did pleaſe them: ſo as the longer she continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, the more they wrought vpon her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she had learned, what words did beſt like them, as her rayling againſt prieſts, and commending of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and ſpeaking of many vaine, and fooliſh words, whereof they would make what they liſt.

                  <p>Beſides, in Chriſtmas time there was gaming, and mumming at the L. <hi>

                  <p>Againe, as before she ſaith, that whilſt she was at <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> she told Ma: <hi>Dibdale,</hi> that she verily thought, she was no more poſſeſſed, then any of them were (meaning the reſt of the prieſts.)

                  <p>Whilſt this exam: was in the prieſts hands at <hi>Denham,</hi>

she wel remembreth (as she ſaith) that one Ma: <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and diuers other Gentlemen were there. Alſo Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> the Ieſuit was there, or at the leaſt, ſuch a man as they called fa: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> who was a chiefe man amongſt them, and ouer the reſt (as she hath heard.) Likewiſe, she ſaith, that there were many, both men, and women, that came thither to ſee miracles (as it was giuen out,) who were daily reconciled. She alſo remembreth, that the prieſts would ſay, that thoſe who came thither, and would not be reconciled, were in great danger, whereas if they would ſubmit themſelues, and reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, then the deuil ſhould haue no power of them. The number, she ſaith, that vpon theſe occaſions were reconciled, was very great. It was an vſual ſaying with the prieſts, that many Proteſtants were poſſeſſed, and that if they were once reconciled, the deuil would shew himſelfe in them, and they brought her this exam: for an inſtance, ſaying, that til she was reconciled, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil was quiet in her. Whereas, she ſaith, she wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that she was (she thanketh God) as free from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil poſſeſſing of her, til she fel into their hands, as any of the prieſts were.</p>
                  <p>After the prieſts gaue ouer the exorciſing of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am: she was at their direction conuayed from place to place, for almoſt foure yeeres, and maintained for the moſt part at their charges, ſauing ſo much as she had for her paines in thoſe places, where she remained.</p>
                  <p>When this exam: should be married, Ma: <hi>Yaxly</hi> the prieſt told her a ſtory of <hi>Tobias</hi> ſonne, and wiſhed her, that in any wiſe, she should refraine from the company of her husband, for the firſt three nights, which counſel (she ſaith) she followed, being wholy at that time ruled by him.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that if Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> had liued but a moneth longer, she this exam: had not beene heere, to haue beene now examined of this matter. For he was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:21637:107"/>
purpoſed (as he ſaid) to haue ſent her beyond the Seas, that she might haue beene a Nun. And to that end he had prouided fourty pound, part whereof was in Ma: <hi>Yaxlyes</hi> hands, and part in her owne. But after Ma: <hi>Dibdales</hi> death, that which this exam: had, Ma: <hi>Yaxley</hi> tooke from her, and promiſed her husband, when she was to be married fourty pound, whereof notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he neuer receaued aboue fiue pounds, as she thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p>Againe, she ſaith, that whilſt she was in their hands, she had ſiluer, and gold giuen her of thoſe, that came to ſee her, which she ſtil gaue to Ma: <hi>Dibdale,</hi> becauſe he perſwaded her, that she might not haue it her ſelfe, for that the deuil thereby would tempt her, &amp; doe her hurt. When he the ſaid <hi>Dibdale</hi> was afterwards executed, this exam: had of his a purſe full of gold, which he left with her, where with Ma: <hi>Alexander</hi> a prieſt being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, she this exam: by his commaundement, deliuered it vnto him.</p>
                  <p>She alſo ſaith, that by one <hi>Hodgskins</hi> meanes, a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiuant, she was a little after Ma: <hi>Dibdales</hi> death, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon at <hi>Oxford</hi> for recuſancie, where she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained about xiiij. weekes. At what time Ma: <hi>Yaxley</hi> cauſed diuers to make earneſt ſute for her: much veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as she hath heard) was beſtowed vpon the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and at the laſt ſhe was called before a Doctor, and after ſome fewe ſpeeches deliuered.</p>
                  <p>About nine or tenne yeares ſince, this exam: was ſent for, by two Iuſtices of the peace, Sir <hi>Anthony Cope,</hi> and Ma: <hi>Doily</hi> to be examined, partly about theſe matters of poſſeſſion. But ſhe neuer did confeſſe a word vnto them of it. At other times alſo ſhe hath beene exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but diſcloſed nothing. When vpon theſe occaſions she was at any time in trouble, she was ſtil maintayned, and her coſts borne by the prieſts meanes. She alſo ſaith, that becauſe she would confeſſe nothing, she was very
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21637:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much made of. It was ordinarie with the prieſts, to charge her in any wiſe, that if she happened at any time to be examined, she should neuer take any oath, for that was verie dangerous, and told her, that then she might ſay any thing, though it were vntrue, to excuſe her ſelfe. They alſo warned her, to be very careful, what she ſaid, and in no wiſe to confeſſe any thing, that might touch any prieſt, and doe them any harme, ſaying, that if she did, the deuil would ſurely poſſeſſe her againe: becauſe thereby she should diſhonour God, and his Prieſts, and be a ſlander to the Catholique Church. And they told her an example of a woman, that after a prieſt had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed her, she dealt amiſſe, and there-vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil came into her againe, and continued in her ſo long, as she liued. And ſo they ſaid, he would deale with her this exam: if she did, or confeſſed any thing againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But notwithſtanding she now ſaith, that shee is very glad she hath diſcharged her conſcience, and vnburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her minde of theſe things, by telling the truth. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting, but that Almighty God wil pardon her, in that she yeelded ſo farre, to be in ſuch ſort abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, and that heereafter the deuil shal neuer haue power, by the perſwaſion of any prieſts, or other perſons what ſo euer, to draw her to ſuch wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes heereafter.</p>

By meanes of theſe troubles there, this examinats father, being Sir <hi>George Peckhams</hi> man, father to the ſaid Ma. <hi>Edmund,</hi> ſhee this examinate, as now ſhee verilie belieueth, was thought a meet perſon, to be entertained in the houſe, as one, who they thought, would keepe all theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, howſoeuer they ſhould deale, and practiſe with her, or any other in that place.</p>

bringing with her the ſaid two poſſeſſed parties, as it was then pretended. Vpon this examinats firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, many prieſts reſorted to <hi>Denham,</hi> vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to caſt the deuils out of thoſe perſons. Amongſt them all one Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> a Ieſuit was the chiefe, that bare the ſway, and gaue directions in thoſe matters, and Ma. <hi>Dibdale</hi> was the next, who tooke eſpeciall paines in their exorciſings. The names of other prieſt, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thether, as farre as ſhee remembreth, were theſe: Ma. <hi>Driland</hi> Ma. <hi>Midleton,</hi> Ma. <hi>Yaxley,</hi> Ma. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Ma. <hi>Stampe,</hi> Ma. <hi>Tirréll,</hi> Ma. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> Ma. <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> Ma. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Ma. <hi>Browne,</hi> Ma. <hi>Ballard,</hi> Ma. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Ma. <hi>Greene,</hi> Ma. <hi>Bruerton.</hi> There vvere beſides theſe a great number, whoſe names ſhe hath forgotten, that reſorted thether. And many, eſpecially of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger prieſts that were lately come ouer, did not tell theyr names, at the leaſt this exam: did not know them.</p>
                  <p>Vppon her firſt comming to <hi>Denham,</hi> and ſo for fiue or ſixe weekes, this exam: heard much in the houſe of her ſiſter, and Ma. <hi>Trayfords</hi> fits: and it was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Miſtris co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from <hi>Fulmer,</hi> before one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> was brought to <hi>Denham,</hi> and then ſhortly one Ma: <hi>Richard Mainy,</hi> who both of them did pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be likewiſe poſſeſſed. Ma. <hi>Ballard</hi> the Prieſt brought the ſaid <hi>Marwood</hi> thether, and in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, there came twelue or thirteene as ſhee remembreth, viz.

                  <p>When this exam: firſt came to Miſtris <hi>Peckham,</hi> ſhee had before euer vſed to goe to the Church, but then the prieſts laboured to perſwade her to the contrary. The parties that dealt with her, to that purpoſe, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, were Ma. <hi>Edmund Peckham,</hi> and one <hi>Alexander</hi> an Apothecarie, but ſince a prieſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:21637:110"/>About the end of the ſaid <hi>5</hi> or 6 weekes, the prieſts begannne to practiſe with this exam: to make her belieue alſo that ſhe was poſſeſſed. The manner whereof was in this ſort. Shee beeing waſhing of clothes in the Kitchen at <hi>Denham,</hi> maiſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> the prieſt came in, &amp; clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her vpon the ſhoulder, told her that her miſtriſſe looked for her. To whom this examinate anſwered, that ſhe had almoſt done, &amp; then ſhe would come vnto her. Preſently after this exanimate, and one of her fellowes hauing filled a tub of water, to rince theyr clothes, this exam: lifting vp the tub, her feete ſlipped from vnder her, the kitchen beeing paued, and hauing a ſhrewd fall, did hurt her hip, with the griefe whereof she was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to keepe her bed, for two or three dayes.</p>
                  <p>Heereupon maiſters <hi>Dibdale</hi> comming to this exam: told her, that it was a wicked ſpirit, that gaue her that fal, and ſaid, that the cauſe that moued the ſpirit ſo to doe, was for that shee had washed his the ſaid maiſter <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> ſhirt, which the wicked ſpirit tooke in euill part, becauſe he was a Catholique prieſt, to whom the deuill could not endure, that any kindnes should be ſhewed. And for that alſo the ſame his ſhirt was fouled with the ſweat, which came from him, in taking paines to exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the parties, ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed. He did alſo at the ſame time, and afterwards, likewiſe deale earneſtlie with this examinate, to perſwade her to be a Catholick, and from the time of her ſaid fall, ceaſed not to tell her, that she was poſſeſſed; and ſo did the reſt of the prieſts, that then were there. The ſaid maiſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> did vrge her to be aduiſed by him, promiſing that if ſo she would, she ſhould receiue great eaſe, and comfort therein.</p>
                  <p>She alſo ſaith, that vpon occaſion of ſpeech with mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dibdale,</hi> of the ache of her hip, he entred into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination of her, if she had not before that time, felt ſome paine in her body. And shee confeſſing, that ſomtimes, she had a paine in one of her ſides; Ah quoth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21637:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he, I thought euen ſo; out of queſtion, you are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo haue beene for a good while, the paine you ſpeake of, proceeding from the ſaid ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus labouring with this exam: to make her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that shee was poſſeſſed, they told her, that before they could doe her any good, she muſt needs become a Catholique; and at the length, by telling her that shee was in ſtate of damnation, and out of the Church; and that ſhe muſt belieue the articles of the Creede, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was, that shee ought to belieue the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which was (as they ſaid) the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhee did yeeld vnto them to be reconciled, as she think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they terme it.</p>
                  <p>At the time that this exam: was thus become a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, the prieſts told her, that her baptiſme receiued in the proteſtants Church muſt be amended, becauſe it wanted many ceremonies of the Catholique Church. And thereuppon they vſed ſuch things as they thought good, to make her baptiſme perfect. They caſt a white cloth ouer her head, with a croſſe vpon it, &amp; vſing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, they put ſalt into her mouth, and did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint her lippes, her noſe, her eyes, and her eares. At that time alſo, they cauſed her to change her name, ſo as she being, when she was chriſtned, called <hi>Friſwood,</hi> from that time forward, shee hath been called <hi>Frauncis.</hi> They told her diuers tales of S. <hi>Frauncis,</hi> that he was ſo holy a man, that he might commaund the birds of the ayre to come vnto him, and that therefore his name was made common both for men, and women.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that after shee had kept her bedde two or three daies, (as before is mentioned) ſhe did (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her ſaid hurt) follow her buſines, as wel as shee could, though she halted. This her ſo halting, the prieſts ſtill ſaid, that the deuil cauſed it, and after omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no occaſion, to tell her of the paine in her ſide, and annointing her hip, did alwaies ſay, that it was the deuill
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21637:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that lay there; till at laſt this exam: began (eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she was a Catholique) to thinke they ſaid truly, and that she was indeed poſſeſſed. Although (as now shee ſaith) shee afterwards perceiued, that shee had neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other trouble, after her hip was well, but now &amp; then a paine, as she was wont to haue in her ſide, which paine doth ſtill continue, beeng a griefe of the ſpleene, as the Phyſicians tell her; for eaſe whereof, ſhee is commonlie let blood once a yeere. And for any other vexation, or griefe whilſt she was vnder the prieſts hands, shee ſayth shee had none, but ſuch as they procured, by theyr drinks, and perfumes, and other bad vſage of her.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore shee ſaith, that within a while after that she was a Catholique, the prieſts told her, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their promiſe, they would now try, to make her well, and to rid her from the wicked ſpirit. The manner whereof was as followeth. At the end of the firſt Maſſe that euer she ſaw, which was ſaid by maiſter <hi>Dibdale,</hi> he told her, that now they would make triall what was in her; and thereupon shee beeing perfectly well, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling maiſter <hi>Dibdale,</hi> &amp; the reſt as much, yet they would needs haue her to ſit downe in a chayre, which shee did. Then they began to binde her with towels, whereat she greatly meruailed, and was there-with caſt into a great feare, as not knowing what they meant to doe with her. Beeing in this caſe, maiſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> began to read vpon his booke of Exorciſmes, and after a good while, ſeeing no other alteration in her, then the tokens of feare, (for she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth the ſame increaſed by reaſon of his words, and other his dealings with her) then they vrged her to drinke aboue a pint of Sack, and Sallet-oyle, being hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and mingled with ſome kind of ſpices. When she taſted this drinke, which they termed a <hi>holy potion,</hi> it did ſo much diſlike her, that shee could drinke but a little of it at once, (her ſtomacke greatly loathing of it.) And then the preſts ſaid, all that came from the deuill,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:21637:112"/>
who hated nothing worſe, then that holy drinke. So as ſhe was held, and by very force, cauſed to drinke it vp, at diuers draughts. Heere-vpon (as ſhe ſaith) ſhe grew to be very ſicke, and giddie, in her head, and began to fal into a cold ſweate, verily then beleeuing, that as the prieſts ſaid, it was a wicked ſpirit, that cauſed her to be in ſuch caſe: Whereas afterwards, when ſhee better had conſidered of their dealings with her, ſhe eaſily percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the drinke they gaue her, was ſuch, as might haue made a horſe ſicke.</p>
                  <p>Againe, ſhe ſaith, that being thus in the prieſts hands, from a little before Chriſtmas, til two or three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Whitſonday following, ſhe was often abuſed in this manner: and at ſome times when ſhe was bound, (as is before ſaid) and had drunk the holy potion ful ſore againſt her wil, they would burne brimſtone in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-diſh, and hold her noſe by force ouer it: by which meanes, ſhe nothing doubteth, but that ſhe did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grow into ſome great outrages, &amp; ſpake the can not tel now what.</p>
                  <p>There was, (as ſhe thinketh) a diſcourſe made of her fits, by ſome of the prieſts, the which, if she could heare, she ſuppoſeth, she should remember many more things then now she doth: But shee cannot forget (she ſaith) that many times, she did complaine of hard dealing, vſed towards her in her pretended fits, and how iniuriouſly they dealt with her, by giuing her that loathſome drink, and burning brimſtone vnder her noſe. Where-vnto the prieſts would commonly giue this aunſwer, eyther <hi>it was not ſhe, that ſpake, but the deuill;</hi> or otherwiſe when she was ſo wel, that they could haue no pretence, ſo to ſay, then they would bid her be contented, and tel her, that she should, by that meanes, merit heauen, &amp; gaine a crowne of glory. And they would ſtand much vpon this laſt reaſon, in ſhewing how much this exam: had merited at Gods hands, when any by ſeeing of her in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:21637:112"/>
her fits, and the Prieſts dealings with her, were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that the prieſts would be often tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in this exam: hearing, of certaine women, that were poſſeſſed beyond the Seas: how the deuils in them could not abide the <hi>holy potion,</hi> nor the burning of hallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed brimſtone, nor the applying vnto them of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, nor the preſence, or touching of Catholique prieſts, nor holy water, nor the holy candel, nor the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſacrament, but would ſtart, ſay they burned, rage, &amp; raile againſt the prieſts, &amp; commend vpon euery occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, that were the ſoundeſt Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, this exam: ſaith, for her ſelfe, (and she thinketh, she may ſafely ſo ſay for her ſiſter, and the reſt,) that she learned what to ſay, and doe, when the prieſts had her in hand: that is, to ſtart ſome times, when they brought reliques vnto her: to pretend that shee could not endure the preſence of the Sacrament, and many things beſides: as if the treatiſe of her may be gotten, wil appeare. Howbeit, she ſaith, that after ſome ſixe or ſeauen weekes, although at the firſt, she did not marke the prieſts doings, nor greatly obſerue her own, yet then she began to finde their iuglings, and how she her ſelfe, in ſaying this, or that, ſpake nothing, but what she had learned of the prieſts.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe reaſon that (she thinketh) moued her, not to mark them at the firſt, was the good opinion she had conceaued of them, being newly reconciled: and yet as shee ſaith, when shee ſaw before that time, into what caſe they had brought her ſiſter, she thought that they vſed her not wel, &amp; perſwaded her to runne away from them.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that shee wel remembreth, how one time Ma: <hi>Sherwood</hi> told her, that one Ma: <hi>Bridges</hi> had gotten one of his mothers mayds with child, and bad her tel him of it, when he should come next thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21637:113"/>
and, that this exam: was troubled. Where-vpon she ſaith, that accordingly, as ſoone as she ſaw the ſaid Ma: <hi>Bridges,</hi> being her ſelfe in health, and no way trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, &amp; in the preſence of Ma: <hi>Sherwood,</hi> Goe to, quoth she, Ma: <hi>Bridges,</hi> you haue gotten your Mothers cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-mayde with child, and make no conſcience of it. Which words were no ſooner vttered by her, but Ma: <hi>Sherwood,</hi> tooke hold of them, ſaying; Yea ſirra, canſt thou tel that, thou shalt be conſtrained to tel more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none? And thus he ſaid, pretending, it was not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am: but the deuil, that vttered thoſe words. Heere-with Ma. <hi>Bridges</hi> was greatly amazed, and afraid, and much ſpeech was of it, as if it had been ſome great miracle.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Ma. <hi>Sherwood,</hi> as this exam: ſaith, at one time, as she was tyed in the chayre, did thruſt a pinne into her ſhoulder, and ſhe there-with crying, and ſaying, what doe you? O ſaith he, heare you not the deuil, what hee ſaith? No, quoth this exam: it is not the deuil, but my ſelfe, that ſpake vnto you. But he ſtil affirming, that it was the deuil, this exam: could not be beleeued, and ſo it was reckoned amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Againe shee ſaith, that in one of the fits, where-into they caſt her, by their holy potion, and brimſtone, there were two needles thruſt into her legge, by ſome of the prieſts, (as she is now perſwaded in her conſcience,) and vppon her comming to her ſences, finding a paine in the place, where the needles were, ſhe complained of it, and would haue put down her hoſe, to haue ſeene, what her legge ayled; but the prieſts would in no wiſe ſuffer that, but preſently they got holy reliques, and tyed them about her legge, affirming that the paine was procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by the wicked ſpirit, and could not be eaſed, but by thoſe reliques. When they had ſo tyed them about her legge, they charged her in any wiſe, not to touch them; but yet notwitſtanding this exam: ſaith, that being greatly troubled with paine, &amp; deſirous to caſe her ſelfe,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21637:113"/>
ſhe did now and then attempt to ſlacken the reliques, being tyed too hard, (as ſhe thought.) At what time the prieſts ſtil watching of her, as that ſhe could do nothing, but they would ſee her, they did blame her for tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the reliques, bad her let them alone, and ſaid, it was the deuil that tempted her, to touch them.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtome of the prieſts was, as this exam: ſaith, to appoint a ſet time, when they meant to haue any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Exorciſmes, and then this exam: was one, when ſhe was in their hands, that for the moſt part, muſt goe to the chayre. After that the ſaid needles had beene in this exam: legge, from the fore-noone the one day, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til eleuen of the clocke the next day, ſhe was brought vp into a gallerie, the Sermon being finiſhed, and a great number there preſent. At her comming in, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the ſorenes of her legge, the prieſts bad her be of good cheere, and ſaid, they would ſee if they could helpe her: Where-vpon Ma. <hi>Dibdale,</hi> (as ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth) ſaid vnto her, Goe <hi>Frauncis,</hi> ſit downe, and put downe thy hoſe: which ſhe did, and then Ma. <hi>Stamp,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother prieſt, when her hoſe was put downe, came vnto her very reuerently, and with diuers ceremonies vntyed the reliques, which were about her legge, which being taken away, he looked vpon the ſore place, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it gently, and in the end thruſting downe with his fingers the skin, and fleſh, where one needle ſtuck ſo, as the ſame appeared, he called vnto him thoſe that were preſent, and ſaid vnto them: See what the deuil had done, and ſo pulled it out. Then feeling her legge a little while longer, and vſing his fingers, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he alſo diſcloſed the ſecond needle; which the people that were preſent beholding, were in a great maze, eſpecially to heare what Ma. <hi>Dibdale,</hi> and Ma. <hi>Stamp</hi> made of the matter: how they ſaid, it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils doing, and much other ſpeech to that effect. As ſoone as the needles were taken forth, this exam: was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

downe againe out of the gallerie, and feeling her leg very wel eaſed, it began to amend euery day more, and more, which they ſaid, was by reaſon of the holy water, where-with they waſhed her legge, when they pulled out the needles.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that the prieſts had a cuſtome, to thruſt certaine things into the mouthes of ſuch, as they ſaid were poſſeſſed, vnder pretence of reliques. And ſhe wel remembreth, that at one time, when ſhe began to be troubled with her drink, and brimſtone, they thruſt into her mouth, ſome of the ſaid reliques: Whereof this exam: complained, and ſaid, why doe you put theſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie things in my mouth? Ah, quoth they: hark how the deuil cannot endure theſe holy things. Afterwards when this exam: put them out of her mouth, then they asked her what reliques they were? and ſhe told them, This is a peece of ſuch a man, and this of another. And at one time, they put into her mouth, a peece of <hi>Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> thumbe, or his finger, ſhe remembreth not whether. When this exam: at this time, and ſo likewiſe, both ſhe, and others, at other times, did name theſe reliques, and ſhewed their diſlike, to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put into their mouthes, the prieſts would bidde the people that were preſent marke, how the deuil knew all holy reliques, of vvhat Martyrs they were, and how hee could not abide them: whereas this deponent ſaith, that both ſhe, and the reſt that were dealt with as ſhee was, did know all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, that the prieſts had there, hauing the ſight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoſt euerie day, and hearing the prieſts tell of whom they were. So that as ſoone as this exanimate ſaw any of them, ſhe could name them very readily, and ſay; This is ſuch a peece of Father <hi>Campian;</hi> this of Ma. <hi>Sherwin;</hi> this of maiſter <hi>Brian;</hi> this of maiſter <hi>Cottam;</hi> this of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris <hi>Clithero;</hi> and ſo of a great number more, which ſhe hath now forgotten.</p>
                  <p>At another time alſo, this examinate wel remembreth,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21637:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the prieſts filling her mouth with reliques, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed in with them a big ruſtie naile, as ſhe is verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in her conſcience, ſo as when they pulled out the reliques, ſhe was almoſt choked with the nayle, and much ado they had to get it out. They made her mouth there-with to bleed, and affirmed to the people, that it came out of her ſtomacke, by vertue of the ſaid reliques.</p>
                  <p>Againe ſhe ſaith, that beeing in ſpeech once with mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> concerning maiſter <hi>Richard Mainy,</hi> he told her diuers things of him, what wonderful ſights he ſaw about the Altar, and the ſacrament at Maſſe time. And further ſaid vnto her, that if ſhee would ſay, when ſhee was to be exorciſed in the chaire, at the bringing of the <hi>Pix</hi> vnto her, (as the manner was) that ſhee ſaw the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt there in a great brightneſſe, ſhee ſhould by that meanes greatly glorifie God. And therevppon, as ſhe confeſſeth, ſhe ſaid as he aduiſed her, at her next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſing, and a great wonder was made of it.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that beeing brought vp with her mother, ſhee had learned to ſing by hart certaine <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> Pſalmes, &amp; that being vnder the prieſts hands, when now and then forgetting her ſelfe, ſhe ſung any of them, as ſhe ſate at work, the prieſts, &amp; ſo others in the houſe, when they heard her, would earneſtly blame her for it, and ſay one to another, Doe you not heare, how ſweetly the deuil ſingeth theſe <hi>Geneua</hi> pſalmes.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſhe ſaith, that when the prieſts had drawne her to be of their Church, as is before mentioned, and that ſhee ſhould come to receaue the Sacrament, they told her, ſhe muſt firſt vow, and promiſe, by the vertue of that holy Sacrament, that ſhee would euer afterwards hold the Religion of the Church of Rome, and neuer goe againe to any of the Proteſtants Churches, nor euer reade the Engliſh Seruice, or the Engliſh Byble, or any other Engliſh books, written by the Proteſtants in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. And this vow, ſhe ſaith, is ordinarily
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21637:115"/>
made, by all that are reconciled.</p>
                  <p>She alſo ſaith, that ſhe hath often times heard ſome of the prieſts affirme, that it was an ordinary thing with the deuil, which was in Ma: <hi>Maynie,</hi> that when they the ſaid prieſts, haue demaunded of the deuil, (preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be in him) why he troubled the Catholiques with impriſonment, and many daungers, whileſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants liued in pleaſure: his aunſwer was, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were his already, and that he troubled the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, becauſe he would draw them to himſelfe, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Proteſtants if he could: adding that he would neuer haue troubled <hi>Iob</hi> as he did, if he had thought he could not haue made him to curſe God. This exam: alſo ſaith, that ſhe her ſelfe hath heard ſom of the prieſts, and (as ſhe thinketh Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi>) aske <hi>Mainy</hi> that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and he the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> ſo to haue aunſwered them. Alſo ſhe ſaith, that the prieſts in talking of Proteſtants, haue affirmed of them in her hearing, that the greateſt ſhare of them were poſſeſſed, and that when England ſhould be againe, as it had beene, the deuils would then ſhew themſelues in them, and they ſhould haue theyr hands ful of chaire-worke, meaning their exorciſings, to caſt them out.</p>
                  <p>At one time, ſhe ſaith ſhe wel remembreth, that Ma: <hi>Greene</hi> comming from beyond the Seas, brought with him certaine graines, medals, and <hi>Agnus dei;</hi> and that ſeeing the prieſts, and others make ſo great account of them, ſhee ſaid to Ma: <hi>Greene,</hi> Good Lord, what meane you to make ſo great a-doe about theſe things? What is that waxe better then other waxe? or that bugle better then another, whereof you may buy a great number for a penny? Where-vpon Ma: <hi>Greene</hi> ſaid, <hi>it was the deuill, and not ſhe,</hi> that ſpake thoſe words. But this exam: told him againe, that ſhee ſpake thoſe words her ſelfe, and that ſhe meruailed, why they laboured ſo earneſtly, to make both her, and all others beleeue, that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21637:115"/>
whatſoeuer ſhe or they did, or ſpake, it was not ſhe, nor they, but the deuil: but he perſiſted, and ſaid, it was the deuil indeede, and not ſhe, whatſoeuer ſhee thought to the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that one <hi>Alexander</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie, hauing brought with him from London to <hi>Denham</hi> on a time a new halter, and two blades of kniues, did leaue the ſame, vpon the gallerie floare in her Maiſters houſe. That next morning he tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to goe with this exam: into the ſaid gallerie, where ſhe eſpying the ſaid halter, and blades, asked Ma: <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> what they did there: Hee making the matter ſtrange, aunſwered, that he ſaw them not, though hee looked fully vpon them; ſhe her ſelfe pointing to them with her finger, where they lay within a yard of them, where they ſtoode both together. No (quoth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:) doe you not ſee them? and ſo taking them vp, ſaid, looke you heere: Ah (quoth he) now I ſee them indeed, but before I could not ſee them: And therefore ſaith he, I perceaue that the deuil hath layd them heere, to worke ſome miſchiefe vpon you, that are poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>Heereuppon maiſter <hi>Alexander</hi> told the prieſts what a ſtrange thing had happened, and a great ſearch vvas made in the houſe, to know how the ſaid halter &amp; knife blades came thether: but it could not in any wiſe be found out, as it was pretended, till Ma. <hi>Mainy</hi> in his next fit ſaid, as it was reported, that the deuil layd them in the Gallery, that ſome of thoſe that were poſſeſſed, might either hang the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues which the halter, or kil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the blades.</p>
                  <p>Now this exam: further ſaith, that ſhee herſelfe did eſpy the end of the halter, in maiſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, the night before ſhee ſaw it, and the blades in the Gallery, at ſuch time as he drew out of his pocket a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine boxe of Wafer-cakes for Maſſes. Whereby ſhee is fully perſwaded, as ſhe ſaith, that he the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:21637:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was himſelfe the deuil, that layde the halter, and knife-blades in the ſaid Gallerie, and as ſhe ſaith, ſhe told mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> as much, when the ſearch was, how they ſhould come thether. Whereat maiſter <hi>Dibdale</hi> beeing much mooued, ſaid, <hi>it was not ſhe but the deuill,</hi> that ſpake ſo vnto him, of maiſter <hi>Alexander.</hi> And for this her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſpeeches, ſhe felt, as ſhee ſaith, ſome ſmart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. For within a day or two after they had her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the chayre, and did vſe theyr exorciſmes vvith her, the manner whereof was ſomething ſtrange vnto her.</p>
                  <p>They had in a readines the picture of an Aſſe, and of the deuil, and of Ma. <hi>Fox,</hi> as if hee were writing the booke of Martyrs. The Aſſe (they ſaid) reſembled this examinate; and the deuill within her (being a malicious lying ſpirit, that ſought to ſlaunder the dooings of the Catholique prieſts) betokened Ma. <hi>Fox,</hi> who (as they ſaid) had beene a malicious lyer. They had there alſo a long girdle, made of whipcord (as ſhee remembreth) it was full of knots, &amp; termed S. <hi>Peters girdle:</hi> this gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle was hallowed, and being lapped into foure doubles, was like a whip.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things beeing thus readily prepared, this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate was bound full ſore againſt her will in a chayre: They compelled her to drinke the <hi>holy potion,</hi> whereof ſhee made fiue or ſixe draughts; they burnt brimſtone vnder her noſe, and withall the ſaid three pictures one after another. They pulled off her gowne, and whipped her vppon the armes with the holy girdle, pretending that they meant thereby to hunt the deuill out of her. They gaue her fiue blowes, in remembrance of the fiue wounds of Chriſt: and ſeauen in honour of the ſeauen Sacraments, and three in memory of the bleſſed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſhe knoweth not now how many more. With theſe blowes ſhee beeing conſtrained to cry out, they ſaid, <hi>it was not ſhee but the deuill</hi> within her that ſo cryed,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:21637:116"/>
becauſe he was not able to endure the vertue of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly girdle. But this examinate ſaith, that howſoeuer the deuill fared, ſhe well knoweth, that ſhee bare away the ſmart, and that her armes were blacke almoſt a moneth after with the blowes.</p>
                  <p>The prieſts alſo (ſhee ſaith) had another cuſtome: At the end of euery exorciſme, they would ſay that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was gone downe, ſometimes into the foote, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the great toe of the partie exorciſed. And when ſtrangers came, before whom they intended to worke ſome great matters, they would bring the partie againe to the chayre, and beeing bound therein, they would begin (as they ſaid) to make the deuil ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which they did with this exam: in this ſort. The Exorciſt hauing a relique in his hand, as a bone, or ſome ſuch hard thing, would graſpe her by the legge, &amp; aske her if ſhe felt any paine that ſeemed to prick her, &amp; this exam: confeſſing (as the truth was) that ſhe felt a paine, (the ſaid bone, or hard thing in his hand hurting her ſhrewdly:) Ah (would the Exorciſt ſay) now he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ſtirre. Thus would the Exorciſt goe pinching of her legge twice, or thrice, before they came to her knee, and then they would wring her indeed ſo hard, as that ſhe ſhould ſometimes ſcreech, and ſometimes ſtart. And then the Exorciſt, and the reſt of the prieſts that were preſent would ſay, now the ſpirit will vp into her body, you ſhal heare more of him anon. And haſt was commonly made at ſuch times to giue vs the holy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which beeing ſo lothſome a drinke, diuers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women ſeeing it giuen vnto vs, haue wept for pitty to ſee vs compelled to take it. But the prieſts would tell them that there was no remedy; for otherwiſe, except the ſtrength, and force of the wicked ſpirit were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abated, there was great danger, that hee would teare theyr guts, and inward parts in peeces, as hee was aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpwards to goe out of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:21637:117"/>This exam: ſaith, that when ſhee had wel conſidered of the prieſts-dealing with her, and how all the troubles ſhe had, was by reaſon of their intollerable drinks, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumings, and practiſes with her, where-with her body was brought to great weakenes; ſhe grew to ſome more boldnes, and did now and then ſpeake her minde ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what plainly, though it booted not: for they would ſay, it was the deuil that vttered it, whatſoeuer it was, that this exam: ſpake, if they diſliked it. She wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth, that ſitting at her worke one time, and Ma: <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> ſitting alſo by her looking on a booke, she this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am: being very angry in her minde, to conſider how ſhe was vſed, and with him in particuler, for thruſting a pin into her shoulder, and for diuers other his hard vſages towards her, ſaid vnto him; that shee very greatly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, how he, and the reſt durſt deale with her, &amp; the reſt, as they did: adding, that if she this exam: or any other should complaine of them, they would certainly all of them be hanged. For (quoth she) how many of the Queenes ſubiects, haue you drawne from her, by theſe your practiſes heere? Heere-with Ma: <hi>Sherwood</hi> was much moued, and went to the prieſts, to acquaint them with her words. Some of them (as she hath heard) were of opinion, that it were beſt to put her away from her Miſtres: but Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> liked not that counſel, fearing (as she beleeueth) that shee should haue diſcloſed theyr dealings. For theſe her ſaid ſpeeches, shee was within three or foure houres very hardly entreated; Ma: <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and the other prieſts, returning vnto her, put her in minde, what she had ſaid, and told her, <hi>That it was not ſhe, but the deuill,</hi> that vttered thoſe words, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon had her to the chayre, and with their holy potion, and brimſtone ſo plagued her, as being there-with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſick, ſhee fel (as she thinketh) into a ſwound.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that whileſt theſe matters were in hand at <hi>Denham,</hi> there came very many thither, from
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21637:117"/>
time to time. The Catholiques would bring with them ſuch of their friends, as they durſt truſt, being Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, of purpoſe, to draw them to the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And she certainly knoweth, that there was a very great number vpon thoſe occaſions reconciled; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an hundred a weeke, at the leaſt. Marrie at one time, she remembreth, that one Ma: <hi>Hampden</hi> of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> (as she thinketh) being brought thither, by Ma: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Aſhefield,</hi> now in priſon, as shee hath heard, did greatly deceaue the prieſts expectations, and put them into a great feare. The manner was, she ſaith, of thoſe who were pretended to be poſſeſſed, when any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants came in, to commend them greatly, and to raile vpon the prieſts: in ſo much as Ma: <hi>Mainy,</hi> when he ſaw Ma: <hi>Hampden,</hi> did preſently ſalute him, by the name of his fellow Iuſtice, and vſe ſuch other words vnto him, as when he heard, how they were expounded, hee was greatly diſcontented with them: and there-vpon ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aloude, ſaid thus in effect vnto him, that brought him thither (as farre as she remembreth) being her ſelfe then preſent. <hi>Cooſen</hi> Ned, <hi>I had thought you would haue brought me, where I ſhould haue ſeene ſome godlines, and not to haue heard the deuill; but this dealing I ſee is abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I meruaile, that the houſe ſinketh not, for ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes committed in it:</hi> and ſo he departed. With theſe his ſpeeches, the prieſts were greatly amazed, &amp; fearing the worſt, got them away for that night.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, she ſaith, that perceauing many things were falſe, that the prieſts told to thoſe, that came vnto them, for the better confirming of her iudgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, she deuiſed (of her ſelfe) this tale. She told them, that being in bed, there came a morrice-daunce into her chamber, hauing theſe perſons in it, a man with Taber, and a Pipe, the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> that was dead before, (but one that the prieſts did greatly hate) and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble men alſo she named, who are now out of her
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21637:118"/>
memory: all theſe she told them, after they had daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about the table in the chamber, went out againe as they came in. When the prieſts had this by the end, they made great matters of it, termed it a viſion, and told it the Catholiques for a very truth; whereat this exam: laughed in her minde, but durſt not gaine-ſay it, and ſo it went amongſt them for a currant viſion. And ſhee thinketh in her conſcience, it was euen as true, as the reſt of their reports, both of this exam: &amp; of the others there, that were pretended to be poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſhe ſaith, that there was a notable deuiſe amongſt the Prieſts, to haue it thought, that the wicked ſpirits came into this exam: and her ſiſter, by witcherie. Ma: <hi>Richard Mainy</hi> before mentioned, being the notableſt counterfeit (as she thinketh) that euer the prieſts had in their fingers, ſaid in one of his fits, or rather the deuil in him (as it was pretended) that one good-wife <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Buſhie,</hi> had bewitched this exam: and her ſaide ſiſter: This good-wife <hi>White,</hi> was commonly talked of in the Country to be a Witch: the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> alſo told the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, how they were bewitched. There were (as it was pretended, that the deuil ſaid in <hi>Mainy</hi>) certaine cattel bewitched in <hi>Denham,</hi> ſome two or three yeeres before, which could not be eaſed, except the two ſpirits which troubled them, were ſent into two Chriſtian bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and there-vpon, quoth hee, to deliuer the cattel, ſhe ſent thoſe two ſpirits into this exam: ſiſter, and her ſelfe. When the prieſts heard theſe words, they ſeemed to coniure the deuil in Ma: <hi>Mainy,</hi> to bring the witches ſpirit (whereby she wrought) thither to <hi>Denham.</hi> And the night folowing this prank was played by the prieſts. They had gotten in the night a Cat amongſt them in the Parlor, which they ſaid was the witches ſpirit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the whipping of this Cat they pretended great paines, and that they whipped her ſo long, til at the laſt ſhe vaniſhed away out of their ſight. Afterwards they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21637:118"/>
gaue it out, that out of all queſtion, the Witch, whileſt they were whipping of the Cat, was greatly vexed, and there-vppon they ſent a meſſenger to <hi>Buſhie,</hi> to ſee in what eſtate the Witch was, who at his returne reported, that when hee came to <hi>Buſhie,</hi> hee found the Witch in child-bed, and that her child was dead. When the prieſts heard this report, ſee (quoth the prieſts) to thoſe that were preſent, how it falleth out to be true that we told you, the whipping of her ſpirit in the likenes of a Cat, was the cauſe that her child died: yea (quoth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am:) is that true? Why then you are murderers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the prieſts were moued, but they knew how to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that, as they did, in ſaying, that <hi>it was not ſhe, but the deuill</hi> in her, that vttered thoſe words. Of this whipping of the Cat there was great ſpeeches, and many that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued them, wondred at it. The meſſenger that was ſent to <hi>Buſhie,</hi> hearing what a meruaile they made heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, became a recuſant, being at that time a Proteſtant.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo another ſtrange thing, that happened at <hi>Denham,</hi> about a bird. Miſtris <hi>Peckham</hi> had a Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale which she kept in a Cage, wherein Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> tooke great delight, and would often be playing with it. This Nightingale was one night conuayed out of the Cage, &amp; being the next morning diligently ſought for, could not be heard of, til Ma: <hi>Mainies</hi> deuil in one of his fits (as it was pretended) affirmed, that the wicked ſpirit, which was in this exam: ſiſter, had taken the bird out of the Cage, and killed it in deſpite of Ma: <hi>Dibdale.</hi> And further he told them, that the birds necke was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and did lie vnder a Roſemarie buſh in the Garden: where-vpon three or foure going downe, and finding the bird there, they made a great wonderment of it, whereat this exam: doth verily beleeue, that eyther <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> had killed the bird, and laid it there himſelfe, or elſe that this exam: ſiſter did it, and had told <hi>Mainy</hi> of it; for she ſaith, that her ſiſter, &amp; <hi>Mainy</hi> were very great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:21637:119"/>Alſo this exam: ſaith, that if the ſtory, she had heard hath beene written of <hi>Mainyes</hi> fits, could be got, there would appeare very many notable practiſes. Ma: <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi> the Ieſuit was the chiefe man, that dealt with <hi>Mainy,</hi> &amp; hath written (as she hath heard) a great booke of them. This <hi>Edmunds,</hi> as hath beene ſaid before, was a chiefe man, and therfore whereas the reſt had but their Albes on when they exorciſed any, he commonly had vpon him either a veſtment, or a cope. She wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth, that the ſaid <hi>Mainy,</hi> ſitting vpon a time by one of the prieſts, affirmed, that vnto his ſight the prieſts fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thumbe did ſhine with brightnes, eſpecially on the inner ſides: where-vnto the Prieſt aunſwered, that it might wel ſo be, becauſe (quoth he) they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with holy oyle, when I was made Prieſt. At which words, this exam: laughing, &amp; calling Ma. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> a diſſembling hypocrite, the prieſt ſaid, that <hi>it was not ſhe, but the deuill,</hi> that did ſo laugh, and raile.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this examinate well remembreth, that Ma. <hi>Richard Mainy</hi> being exorciſed in the preſence of a hundred people at the leaſt, on S. <hi>Georges</hi> day in the morning, the prieſts affirmed, that ſeauen deuils did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew themſelues in him, by ſuch geſtures, and ſignes, as declared them to be the Authors of the ſeauen deadlie ſinnes. This examinate ſaith, that ſhe hath almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the geſtures, but ſhe will ſet them down as neere as her memory will ſerue her. The ſaid maiſter <hi>Mainy</hi> beeing bound in the chayre, did lift vp his head, looking highly, and made geſtures with his hand, as though hee were tricking vp himſelfe; whereupon the prieſts ſaid, that the ſpirit that was comming vp then, was <hi>Pride,</hi> as it appeared by the ſaid geſtures. Afterwards the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> beginning to gape, and ſnort, the prieſts ſaid, that the ſpirit that then roſe vp in him, was <hi>Sloth.</hi> Then hee fell to vomiting, and the prieſts ſaid, that the ſpirit that then roſe was <hi>Gluttony,</hi> and drunkennes. Againe,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21637:119"/>
he the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> talking df purſes, and thus much in the hundred, and of the forfeyting of this, or that leaſe, the deuil that then was riſen, the prieſts called <hi>Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> And thus the prieſts and hee went through all the deadly ſinnes. The ſaid <hi>Mainy,</hi> or the deuill in him, (as was pretended) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the Proteſtants for his good friends, becauſe they had all the ſaid ſeuen deadly ſinnes in them, but railing at Catholiques, for that they could not endure them, but did euer and anon cut them of by confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day alſo ſhee well remembreth two things, that Ma. <hi>Mainy</hi> ſpake of, betwixt his deſcriptions of the ſaid ſeauen deadly ſinnes. <hi>Oh</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>this is a great day of pompe at the Court, I will ſtay no longer amongst you raskall prieſts, but will go thether amongst my fellowes: they all loue me there, I am theirs, and they are all mine,</hi> or to this effect. Alſo one <hi>Robert Bedell</hi> of <hi>Denham,</hi> beeing a very zealous Proteſtant, was buried the ſame day: in that forenoone there happened a ſtorme, whereuppon <hi>Mainy</hi> pretended that the deuil ſpake to this purpoſe in him, viz. <hi>Now they are about to bury</hi> Bedell, <hi>and becauſe he ſerued mee all his life time, I am ſending of him into hell.</hi> At which words many that were preſent wept, and prayed, that if it were poſſible, he might be ſaued. This matter was ſo vrged, and talked of, as afterwards they drew his wife to become a Romiſh Catholique, and ſo she died.</p>
                  <p>This examinate further ſaith, that one <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chriſtmas the ſame yeere, came to <hi>Denham,</hi> where ſhee had remained but a little while before the prieſts had got her into their hands, and ſaid ſhee vvas poſſeſſed. Touching this woman, a number of things hath beene written of her, as this examinate hath heard, all which this exam: ſaith, ſhe verily belieueth in her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (as alſo of all the practiſes, &amp; tales of the prieſts, touching both this examinate, and all the reſt with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:21637:120"/>
they dealt) that they were altogether knaueries, &amp; meer inuentions, to deceiue the people, by procuring an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of theyr prieſthood, and thereby to withdraw her Maieſties ſubiects to their religion.</p>
                  <p>Shee well remembreth (as she ſaith) that at one time, Ma. <hi>Dibdale</hi> charged the deuill in <hi>Anne Smith</hi> (as it was pretended) to ſpeake vnto him, and aunſwer him to that which he demaunded: but notwithſtanding she held her peace. Then he commaunded her to ſpeak, in the name of the Father, the ſonne, and the holy Ghoſt, &amp; by the vertue of the holy Sacrament; but yet ſhe was ſilent. Heerewith Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> growing to be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, charged her, (or the deuil that was pretended to be in her) to ſpeake to him, by the power, and vertue of his holy prieſthood, and then ſhe aunſwered him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon this exam: being preſent ſaid to maiſter <hi>Dibdale, Why Ma.</hi> Dibdale, <hi>is there more vertue in your priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, then in the bleſſed Trinity, and the holy Sacrament?</hi> And hee aunſwered, that though hee were but a ſimple man, yet it pleaſed God, for the honour of his Church, to ſhew by this meanes the power of the prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>Againe this exam: ſaith, that after ſhe perceiued the deceit which the prieſts vſed, ſhe would rather then her life, haue gotten from them: but ſhe was ſo watched, &amp; ſo were the reſt, (ſhe meaneth the other women) as they could by no meanes eſcape out of their fingers. Theyr pretence was, leaſt the deuil ſhould cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to drowne or kill themſelues. But this exam: is perſwaded in her conſcience, that the truth was why they kept them ſo ſtraightly, leaſt going home to their friends, they ſhould haue diſcloſed theyr diſſimulation, and falſe pretenſes, of caſting deuils out of thoſe, who were as free from them, as themſelues. This exam: and her ſiſter, did not ſee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father, or mother, beeing in the ſame towne, all the while that they were in theyr hands; neither would they ſuffer either their father or mother to ſpeake with them,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21637:120"/>
though they deſired it many times.</p>
                  <p>At one time this examinate remembreth, that beeing in the Kitchen garden at <hi>Denham,</hi> ſhee heard a noyſe in her vnckles garden on the other ſide of the wall, &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that her vnckle might be there, ſhe cryed out as loude as ſhee could, <hi>vnckle, vnckle,</hi> who beeing there by chaunce, and hearing of her, knew her voyce, &amp; asked her what ſhee would haue, <hi>oh</hi> (quoth ſhee) <hi>good vnckle helpe me from hence, for I am almoſt killed already amongst them heere, and ſhall not liue if I continue heere long.</hi> Vpon this occaſion, this examinats mother came to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with her, but ſhe could not be ſuffered. The prieſts told her that her daughters were bewitched, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with wicked ſpirits, and that they were thereby caſt away, if they did not helpe them by their authority, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that therfore ſhe theyr mother might by no meanes ſpeake with them, vntill they had deliuered them from the ſaid wicked ſpirits. With this, &amp; ſuch like aunſwers, they ſent away theyr mother diuers times weeping: howbeit ſhe ſaith, that at ſometimes her mother, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thoſe aunſwers, would grow to ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, and hard ſpeech, becauſe ſhee could not be permitted to ſee her daughters. And then the Prieſts would ſhake her of with angry words, and tell her, that ſhee herſelfe had aſmuch neede to be exorciſed as her daughters. And at one time Miſtris <hi>Katherine</hi> that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Miſtris <hi>Peckham</hi> beeing preſent, when the prieſts and her mother had ſuch ſpeeches, told her, that if the prieſts did well, they ſhould deale with her, as they did with her daughters.</p>
                  <p>After this exam: had beene in the prieſts hands for a fortnight or three weekes before Chriſtmas(as shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth) vntill after the Aſcenſion day next enſuing, and had long perceiued their cooſening practiſes with her, and thereupon being growne to great weakeneſſe, and almoſt deſperate, shee told the prieſts plainly at the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21637:121"/>
end of one of her fits, whereinto they had caſt her by their drinks, ſlibber-ſawces, and brimſtone, that if shee had a deuill in her, they were beſt caſt him out, <hi>for</hi> (<expan>

                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that the maner of the prieſts, was to ſay often-times, that they had caſt out this, or that deuil out of the parties: but ſtil when they liſt, they would take a ſmal occaſion to ſay, that yet there were ſome other deuils remaining within them. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate ſaith, that ſhe doubteth, they would haue dealt ſo with her at that time too, but that there began to be great ſpeeches in the Country, about the prieſts doings at <hi>Denham:</hi> in ſo much, as diuers auncient Catholiques themſelues did vtterly diſlike them, and the prieſts them ſelues grew to be afraid. Howbeit, when this exam: was thus at ſome quiet, yet they would not ſuffer her to goe home to her father, and mother, but carried her vp to London, &amp; placed her there with a ſure friend of theirs, one Miſtres <hi>White:</hi> and ſo they dealt with this exam: ſiſter, not ſuffering her to ſee her parents, almoſt for foure yeeres after, as this exam: remembreth.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſhe ſaith, that when the prieſts thought good to meddle no more with her, they caried her to London, and placed her with one Miſtres <hi>Dorothie White,</hi> as hath beene ſaid, a recuſant, who then, and ſince hath beene ſo beneficiall vnto them, as that ſhee hath cleane ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21637:121"/>
her ſtate, and vndone her children. The cauſe why they placed her there was, (as ſhe verily thinketh) leaſt beeing amongſt her owne friends, ſhee might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe theyr bad dealings with her.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after this examinate came to miſtriſſe <hi>White,</hi> but that one <hi>Harrington</hi> growing into acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with her, did afterwards marry her, as ſhee belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. The marriage was in the Marſhalſea, where after a Maſſe, one <hi>Lister</hi> a prieſt (as ſhee remembreth) then priſoner there, vſed certaine Latine words, whereby they ſaid she, and the ſame <hi>Harrington</hi> were married to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. There were preſent there fiue or ſixe. After which time the ſaid <hi>Harrington</hi> liued with this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at times for the ſpace of about 4 or 5 yeeres, ſhee notwithſtanding continuing her ſeruice with Miſtriſſe <hi>White.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this examinate had kept company with the ſaid <hi>Harrington</hi> for about 4 yeres, she grew to be with child, and therevppon went firſt to her ſiſters in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> and then to her parents at <hi>Denham.</hi> Beeing at <hi>Denham,</hi> she was preſented for a recuſant, and thereuppon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the gayle at <hi>Aleſbury.</hi> At her beeing there in priſon, Ma. <hi>Harrington</hi> wrote a Letter vnto her within three or foure daies (as she remembreth) after her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment, the effect whereof was, that if shee were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined who was the father of her child, she should lay it vpon ſome that was gone beyond the ſeas for a ſouldier, but in no wiſe to ſay it was his: and the rather to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her, he ſignified vnto her, that it was not onelie his aduiſe, but likewiſe the counſaile of Miſtris <hi>White</hi> her Miſtris, and Maiſter <hi>Blackman</hi> a prieſt.</p>
                  <p>With this Letter this examinate was greatly mooued, and then calling to mind how shee had beene vſed at <hi>Denham,</hi> and afterwards kept at Miſtris <hi>Whites</hi> from her friends: and remembring alſo, how the prieſts were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wont to perſwade her, that she should neuer ſpeake

any thing as touching her poſſeſſing, or diſpoſſeſſing, that might turne to theyr diſcredite, and to the diſhonor of the Church of Rome, ſhe this examinate beganne to ſuſpect, that the religion that the prieſts profeſſed, was like vnto themſelues. But the moſt principall thing with the reſt that made her ſo to thinke, was another poynt in Ma. <hi>Harringtons</hi> Letter, wherein hee perſwaded her, that <hi>if ſhee were examined vpon her oath, it forced not, the Church did diſpence with her, ſo as ſhee might aunſwer what ſhee thought good notwithſtanding: becauſe an oath did not bind her to confeſſe any thing that might tend to the diſhonor of theyr prieſthood, or of the Catholique Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this exam: was firſt brought before the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at <hi>Aleſbury,</hi> ſhe confeſſed that ſhe was reconciled; and ſhee is verily perſwaded, that if the ſaid Letter had not come vnto her afterwards, and mooued her, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, notwithſtanding all the abuſes offred her at <hi>Denham,</hi> ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued ſtill a wilfull recuſant, though it had coſt her her life. Marry vpon the occaſions before mentioned, this examinate hauing bethought herſelfe better, deſired to ſpeake with old Ma. <hi>Pigot</hi> of <hi>Doder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,</hi> a Iuſtice of peace in <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> vnto whom ſhe ſignified who was the father of her child, and that ſhe could be contented to alter her courſe of life, &amp; goe to the Church againe, as before ſhe had done. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Ma. <hi>Pigot</hi> tooke this exam: in his Coach with him to Sir <hi>Iohn Goodwins,</hi> where ſhe found the L. <hi>Grey,</hi> and diuers others, before whom, after ſhee had ſubmitted herſelfe, as ſhe had done to Ma. <hi>Pigot,</hi> ſhee was ſent to the Court by the L. <hi>Grey,</hi> with two of his ſeruaunts to the Lord <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> At her comming to the Court ſhe ſaith ſhee was examined of diuers matters before the Lords of the Counſell, concerning her knowledge of ſundry prieſts, and Ieſuits, and as touching one <hi>Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who was a notable ſpy, that carried ouer young maids and boyes, to be Nunnes, and prieſts, &amp; brought
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:21637:122"/>
ouer Letters as occaſion ſerued, and continueth (as ſhee thinketh) the ſame trade ſtill.</p>
                  <p>After that this exam. had beene at the Court aboue a weeke, and examined in that ſpace three or foure times, the ſeruaunts of the ſaid L. <hi>Grey</hi> remaining there ſtill, it pleaſed the Lords of her Maieſties Counſell, to ſend her backe with them to the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> &amp; to writ theyr letter to his Lordſhip, that he ſhould ſend for this exam: father, and not onely to deale with him, to ſee that this exam: went to the Church, according as ſhe had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo, that there might be no further proceeding in law againſt her, in reſpect that ſhe had beene recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: the which direction the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, ſo as this exam. continued at her fathers vntill the yeere 1594.</p>
                  <p>After this examinate had remained thus with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about three or foure moneths, the ſaid Ma. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> came vnto her, and told her, he had beene all that while beyond the ſeas; and keeping company with her againe, as a man ought to doe with his wife, ſometimes at <hi>Denham,</hi> and ſometimes this exam: comming to him to London, hee allowed her after the rate of about 20 marks by the yeere. She likewiſe ſaith, that when mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Harrington</hi> ſuſpected this exam: to be with child, he put an hundred pounds into one Ma. <hi>Fits</hi> his hand to the vſe of her, and her child if ſhe had any.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that within about a yeere after that the ſaid maiſter <hi>Harrington</hi> had come from beyond the ſeas (as hee pretended) and kept companie with her as his lawfull wife, hee was apprehended for a prieſt, and firſt committed to the Towre, and then to the Marſhalſea. Beeing in priſon, this examinate had a warrant from Ma. <hi>Young</hi> to goe vnto him; and at her comming vnto him he wept, and ſaid, that if hee might for ſhame, hee would take another courſe then hee did. He cryed her mercy for the abuſe offred vnto her, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21637:123"/>
promiſed, that if ſhe would be content, ſhe ſhould neuer want. Howbeit (as she was enformed) he told ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques as came vnto him, (who had vnderſtanding that this examinate did challenge him for her husband) that shee this examinate did greatly ſlaunder him, &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied that euer hee was married vnto her, or euer kept company with her as men doe with theyr wiues. Whereupon all ſuch Catholiques as heard thereof, did greatly rate this examinate for challenging of him to be her husband, and ſaid shee did belie him, and that <hi>it was the deuill</hi> that cauſed her to raiſe that ſlaunder of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Catholique prieſt.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Harrington</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and executed the 18 of February 1593 (as ſhe remembreth) she married againe with <hi>Ralfe Dallidowne</hi> a Smith in Holborne, the 20 of Ianuary 1594 as shee thinketh. And hauing receiued herſelfe the ſaid hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound from Ma. <hi>Fits,</hi> her husband <hi>Dallidowne</hi> had it all, except it were ſome 6 or 7 pound, which she had ſpent before.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that many times ſince shee hath conformed her ſelfe, many prieſts haue greatly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her, vſing words to this effect vnto her, viz. They haue tolde her, that they wondred how shee could be brought to goe to the Engliſh church, conſidering the great power of the prieſthood, and of the holy reliques of the Church of Rome. To whom this exam: hath ſometimes aunſwered, that she was well before she came into theyr hands, and ſtill ſo continueth shee thanked God, and thereupon hath deſired them, that they would deale no more with her, but let her alone.</p>
                  <p>When shee hath thus aunſwered them, they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid to her, that it was the deuill for a certaintie, that ſtill hunting of her, did perſwade her to goe to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques Church; &amp; that if they had thought she would haue taken this courſe, they would neuer haue diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21637:123"/>
her. To whom this examinate by way of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hath replied; A murren take you, I was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before you dealt with mee, and ſo haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince you left me.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that ſince shee was firſt examined before the Lord Biſhop of London in March 1598, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers prieſts haue vrged her greatly that shee should ſay nothing againſt the poſſeſſing, or diſpoſſeſſing vſed at <hi>Denham,</hi> either concerning her ſelfe, or any other, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her aunſwer, that beeing then young, ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten all thoſe things: and threatning of her, that if she confeſſed any thing againſt the holy prieſthood, or power of the Church in caſting out deuils, she should be burnt for an Heretique, if euer the world changed. The names of the prieſts that haue thus dealt with her, both before ſhee was called for to be examined before the Lord Biſhop of London, and ſince (at the leaſt ſome of them) are Ma. <hi>Sherwood,</hi> Ma. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> Ma. <hi>Blackman,</hi> Ma. <hi>Iohn Greene,</hi> and Ma. <hi>William Bruerton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This exam: alſo ſaith, that about foure yeeres ſince, it happened that her husband in a fray killed a man, whereupon ſhe was compelled to borrow ten pound of miſtris <hi>White,</hi> to be vſed in her husbands buſineſſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prieſts thought then, that they might peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue drawne this examinate vnto them againe, and ſo reſorting vnto her, namely (as she remembreth) mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Blackman,</hi> maiſter <hi>Greene,</hi> maiſter <hi>Wells,</hi> with two or three other prieſts, whom she knew not, they told her, that her falling from the Catholique Church was the cauſe, that the deuill had made her husband to kill the ſaid man.</p>
                  <p>Of late alſo ſhe ſaith, that one <hi>Perry</hi> ſeruaunt to mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Roper</hi> that lieth in Southampton-houſe, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her for that she had reuealed where her ſiſter <hi>Sara</hi> dwelt, ſaid that she played the Ferret, and ſought many mens liues, that it was pittie she liued, and that it were a

good deede to ſhoote her through with a piſtoll as ſhe goeth in the ſtreets. Howbeit this exam: ſaith, that ſhee neuer meant any Catholique in England hurt, (ſome prieſts excepted) who haue dealt hardly with her. But beeing now vpon her oath to ſpeake the truth, ſhee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that no honeſt man or woman will be angry with her for diſcharging her conſcience: adding, that if it had not been ſo long ago ſince she was in the prieſts hands, ſhe could haue deliuered many moe things as touching their bad proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Shee further ſaith, that the prieſts at theyr departure from <hi>Denham,</hi> tooke euery one thence his woman with him; Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> the Ieſuit had for his darling miſtris <hi>Creſſy</hi> then a widdow, who was a daily gueſt there, and one that did contribute very much both to him, and the reſt of the prieſts: <hi>Anne Smith</hi> was at the diſpoſition of Ma. <hi>Driland: Sara Williams</hi> of maiſter <hi>Dibdale:</hi> miſtris <hi>Altham</hi> of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and this examinate of Ma. <hi>Leigh</hi> a prieſt likewiſe.</p>

Towne; where ſhe ſaith her fore-ſaid diſeaſe did trouble her, and likewiſe being then recouered, it tooke her againe, as ſhe was going homewards, where-vpon one <hi>White</hi> a prieſt that vſed much that houſe, was ſent to London for <hi>Cornelius</hi> another prieſt, (who kept at Sir <hi>Iohn Arundells</hi> in <hi>Clarkenwell</hi>) by the meanes of her ſaid ſiſter, who told this exam: that ſhe was ſurely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>When her ſiſter ſaid ſhe was poſſeſſed, ſhe this exam: denied it, and ſo ſhe did, when the ſaid <hi>Cornelius</hi> came vnto her. She ſaith that the ſaid <hi>Cornelius</hi> comming to <hi>Denham</hi> the ſame day at night, that hee was ſent for, brought in his company one <hi>Stamp</hi> a prieſt, <hi>Thomſon</hi> a prieſt (as she thinketh) &amp; one <hi>Christopher Tulice</hi> a prieſt, with Miſtres <hi>Creſſey,</hi> Ma: <hi>Gardner,</hi> and his wife.</p>
                  <p>The day after the prieſts came vnto her, they tooke vpon them to exorciſe her from morning, till towards night, and then left her.</p>
                  <p>She ſaith, that beſides the diſeaſe of the Mother, ſhee grew to be ſicke, and receaued Phyſick by Doctor <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fithes</hi> preſcription at <hi>Alexander</hi> the Apothecaries hands; but not recouering her health thereby, after about two moneths, her ſaid ſiſter procured her to be ſent to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris <hi>Mainy</hi> in <hi>Channon Row,</hi> with whom ſhee was to dwell about the beginning of Lent.</p>
                  <p>She continued with Ma: <hi>Mainy</hi> in the Earle of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnes</hi> houſe in <hi>Channon Row,</hi> til after Eaſter weeke.

                  <p>She further ſaith, she was preſent, when <hi>Mainy</hi> did counterfeit himſelfe, that he should die vpon the <hi>Good Friday;</hi> he the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lying at the Earle of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnes</hi>

                  <p>The ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> came to her Miſtres houſe (ſhe being his ſiſter) about a moneth, or fiue weekes before Eaſter; and euery <hi>Friday</hi> the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> did pretend himſelfe to be wonderfully tormented, and when he was recouered out of his traunce, he would vſe to ſay, he had beene in Purgatorie: and there-vpon gaue it out, that he should die on <hi>Good Friday,</hi> and goe immediatly to heauen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene already in Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>Shee ſaith, that all the ſaid Lent she continued with Miſt: <hi>Mainy,</hi> she was ſtil euill at eaſe, &amp; that the prieſts that came thither, did ſtil endeuour to perſwade her that she was poſſeſſed: ſaying, that she muſt beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein, that she was poſſeſſed, and that they could help her, and not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The prieſts names, as she remembreth, were Ma: <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> Ma: <hi>Dryland,</hi> Ma: <hi>Tirrell,</hi> Ma: <hi>Stamp,</hi> Ma: <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> Ma: <hi>Ballard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that about three weekes after Eaſter, the ſaid prieſts ſtil continuing to perſwade her, that she was poſſeſſed, and that if shee beleeued ſo, then they would helpe her: she this exam: continuing to be euill at eaſe, and hoping by their meanes to be helped, yeelded to ſay, that she thought she was poſſeſſed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſee, if ſhe might be helped; although all the while ſhe had a conceite in her ſelfe, that she was not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

                  <p>When shee had thus yeelded vnto them, Ma. <hi>Stamp</hi> caried her to <hi>Denham,</hi> accompanied with one <hi>Harris</hi> Ma. <hi>Mainyes</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>She ſaith, that about ſixteene dayes after the ſaid Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

this exam: and <hi>Eliza: Calthrope,</hi> being both ſicke, and ſuppoſed by the prieſts to be poſſeſſed, her Ma: left them both in the Earle of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> houſe, and went to <hi>Babingtons</hi> houſe the traytor in <hi>Barbican:</hi> and the third or fourth day after this exam: was caried to <hi>Denham</hi> (as afore-ſaid) where ſhee, and all the houſe were maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the common charge of the prieſts, that reſorted thither.</p>
                  <p>At her comming to <hi>Denham,</hi> they tooke in hand to exorciſe her, &amp; continued that courſe with her til Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide: about a fortnight after Whitſontide (as she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth) certaine Purſuiuants came, and ſearched the houſe, &amp; finding there Ma: <hi>Dryland</hi> the prieſt, and other men, viz: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Apothecarie, <hi>Swythen Wells</hi> (after executed in <hi>Holborne</hi>) and <hi>Iames Stanborow,</hi> Ma: <hi>Peckhams</hi> man, they caried them to priſon, leauing this exam: and two other women in the houſe.</p>
                  <p>She ſaith, that the reſt of the prieſts when the Purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants came, were gone with <hi>Fid,</hi> and <hi>Sara Owen,</hi> alias <hi>Frauncis,</hi> and <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> as this exam: hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>It was Sonday when the Purſuiuants caried the ſaid parties to priſon; and vpon the Monday after the ſaid <hi>Drylands</hi> man caried this exam: to London, where ſhee was placed that night by Ma: <hi>Maryne,</hi> at one <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> houſe in a little Lane, going out of <hi>Thames ſtreete,</hi> and is (as now she is enformed) betwixt <hi>Lyons key,</hi> and <hi>Billingſgate?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Shee continued at the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> houſe about ſeauen weekes, her charges being firſt defrayed by the ſaid Ma: <hi>Maryne,</hi> and afterwards by Ma. <hi>Pownd,</hi> late priſoner at <hi>Wiſbitch,</hi> her acquaintance with Ma. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne</hi> grew at <hi>Denham,</hi> and with Ma. <hi>Pownd,</hi> at the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> houſe.</p>

boord, remoued her thence to miſtris <hi>Lowes</hi> to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> in <hi>Surrey:</hi> where remayning not paſt three or foure dayes, the ſaid <hi>Pownd</hi> carried her to his Mothers houſe, one miſtris <hi>Pownd,</hi> dwelling in the ſame Towne, where ſhe remained til Ma: <hi>Pownd</hi> was taken, which was vpon the day when bon fires were made for <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> apprehenſion, viz: the 15 of Iuly.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid miſtris <hi>Pownd</hi> was of her ſonnes Religion, where-vpon after he was apprehended, ſhe had no ioy to ſtay there, but was caried thence by one Ma: <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> direction vnto miſtris <hi>Leicester,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreete,</hi> at the figne of the dogges head in the pot: where ſhee had not remained aboue two dayes, but vppon a ſearch was taken, &amp; committed to priſon for reeuſancie, where ſhe remained about a moneth, and then eſcaped thence.</p>
                  <p>In this meane while, viz: from Whitſontide before ſpecified, <hi>Dibdale, Lowe,</hi> and <hi>Adams,</hi> were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and being arraigned, this exam: was brought by maiſter <hi>Youngs</hi> meanes, whileſt ſhe was priſoner, to giue in euidence againſt them at their arraignment. The cauſe why she was brought to giue in euidence againſt them was, for that maiſter <hi>Young</hi> hearing her name, did examine her, whether she was not one that did pretend her ſelfe to be poſſeſſed at <hi>Denham,</hi> with whom <hi>Dib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> and the reſt of the prieſts had dealt, and there-vpon examined her touching her poſſeſſion, and the deuils dealing with her: and particulerly of a peece of a knife, which the prieſts ſaid came out of her body.</p>
                  <p>This exam: was priſoner in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> where the ſaid <hi>Fid</hi> was likewiſe priſoner with her: where this exam: found ſuch fauour, as hauing the liberty of the priſon by maiſter <hi>Youngs</hi> appointment, and thereby being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with ſome keyes, ſhe, and <hi>Fid</hi> by her meanes eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thence, taking with them the <hi>Matrones</hi> girle, which girle by the ſaid maiſter <hi>Pownds</hi> direction, was ſent into
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21637:127"/>
                     <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and placed with his Mother, who had a houſe in the ſaid County, and did then lie there.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe was eſcaped, ſhee was placed by Ma. <hi>Pownds</hi> direction firſt in <hi>Cow-lane,</hi> then by her mothers meanes with the French Embaſſadors wife, where diſliking, ſhe was by maiſters <hi>Pownds</hi> meanes placed in a poore vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe by the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> and then againe with his mother, and then going to the <hi>White-Lyon</hi> to ſee mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Pownd,</hi> with her miſtris, ſhe this exam: (whilſt they two were talking together) going to maiſter <hi>Simpſons</hi> chamber a prieſt, was againe there apprehended, and committed by maiſter <hi>Young</hi> againe to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> where ſhee remained about 21 weekes, in which time the Queene of Scots was beheaded.</p>
                  <p>Shee was diſcharged out of <hi>Bridewell</hi> by maiſter <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary Walſinghams</hi> meanes, at the ſute of maiſter <hi>Dale</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Gracious-ſtreet,</hi> and then remaining with her mother a while, was placed with the ſaid La. <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> with whom ſhee dwelt about two yeeres, viz. till ſhe was married.</p>
                  <p>She ſaith, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt she fell into the prieſts hands, ſhee was about 18 yeeres of age, and that shee is verily perſwaded ſhe neuer was poſſeſſed with a wieked ſpirit, (for the which ſhee thanketh Almighty God from the bottom of her hart) but verily thinketh, that she was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much abuſed by the ſaid prieſts, in that they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her, (as is before expreſſed) that ſhee was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, ſhee ſaith, that where it was giuen out by the prieſts, that a peece of a knife came out of her mouth when she was in one of her fits, she then was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that they ſaid vntruly therein, although at that time, being wholely addicted to Poperie, she did reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them very much, &amp; durſt not contradict them.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that when <hi>Cornelius</hi> did firſt begin to exorciſe her, the manner thereof was this: She being
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21637:127"/>
wel, and in perfect memory, and at that time not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with her former diſeaſe called the mother, <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and the reſt ſet her in a chayre, and bound her faſt with towells: then <hi>Colnelius</hi> hauing ended a short ſpeech, or Sermon (the effect whereof she doth not now remember) which was made before ſhee was bound in the chayre, and being in his Albe, and hauing a ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, began to reade his Exorciſmes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at this exam: doth now remember, that ſhee began greatlie to ſhiuer and quake, being then ſtrooke with a great feare, as though the deuill would greatlie torment, and teare her, becauſe they had ſo bound her.</p>
                  <p>Beſides ſhee ſaith (which did encreaſe her feare) ſhe had beene told by diuers, how others had beene troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, viz: how in their fits they were greatly tormented, how they could not endure the Prieſts to come neere them: how when a prieſt did lay his hand vppon any part of them, the ſaid part would be ſo hote, as though it would burne them to the bone, how the deuil in them would raile vpon the Catholiques, &amp; greatly commend the Proteſtants, and many other ſuch things they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which this exam: hath forgotten.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that ſhe was then ſo zealous in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and had ſuch an opinion of the ſaid prieſts, that if ſhee could haue gotten vnder the Altar-cloath, with a croſſe in her mouth, &amp; a candel in her hand, ſhe thought her ſelfe ſafe from the deuil. When ſhee was exorciſed the firſt time, and ſo afterwards being bound in the chayre, where ſhee ſeemed ſtill to be wel, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Exorciſmes, then they would pretend to giue her ſomewhat, either to comfort her ſtomacke, (ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to faint through feare) or to diſcloſe the deuil, which was hallowed, and was very loathſome to her to take. This hallowed medicine, as ſhe remembreth, had Rue, and oyle in it, and was vgly to behold, ſuch as ſhe thinketh they could not haue taken themſelues. Alſo
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21637:128"/>
ſhe ſaith, they would burne brimſtone vnder her noſe, which shee ſaith, would greatly trouble her, and as shee ſuppoſeth, did take away her ſences from her. Thus she ſaith, they dealt with her, as ſhe ſuppoſeth, ſome fiue or ſixe times.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that they did bind her ſo faſt at thoſe times in a chayre, as they almoſt lamed her armes, and ſo bruſed all the parts of her body, with holding, tying, and turmoyling of her, that ſhe was ſo ſore, ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled afterwards, by the ſpace of three yeeres to ſwathe her body.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that now ſhe prayeth God for the prieſts that be aliue, that God would forgiue them for dealing ſo with her, and is very hartily ſorie, that euer ſhe came into their company.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that vpon Wedneſday in Whitſon-weeke, whilſt ſhee was at <hi>Denham,</hi> there came thether maiſter <hi>Saliſbury</hi> that was executed, Ma: <hi>Iohn Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> and Ma: <hi>George Peckham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She alſo ſaith, that ſhe thanketh God ſhee neuer ſaw any thing that might terrifie her, but onely the prieſts when they were exorciſing, that ſhe neuer ſaw any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and whatſoeuer they write or affirme of her tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any ſuch matter, shee affirmeth that they are all fained, and vntrue. And she addeth, that ſhe meruaileth that they should ſet downe any thing of her, that shee ſhould ſpeake in her fits, conſidering that it was giuen out, the ſpirit that was in her was a ſullen, and dumbe ſpirit, and would not therefore be brought to aunſwer the prieſts: and that the ſaid ſpirit, that was ſuppoſed to be in her, was ſuch a one, the deuil that was in <hi>Mainy</hi> (who was named <hi>Modion</hi>) did affirme, as many repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>This exam: further ſaith, that ſhee being preſent by <hi>Mainy,</hi> when he was in exorciſing, after that shee the firſt time had been exorciſed by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:21637:128"/>
the Ieſuit did aske the deuil in <hi>Mainy,</hi> whether she this exam: was poſſeſſed or not; and the deuil aunſwered that she was. Then quoth Ma: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> how chaunce he could not be brought to ſpeake this other day, when she was exorciſed? He the ſaid deuil, as she then ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, aunſwered, that the reaſon was, becauſe the ſpirit that was in her was ſullen, and dumbe. Then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of his deuil, what was the name of the ſpirit that was in this exam: he aunſwered <hi>Soforce.</hi> And this was betwixt Chriſtmas, and Shrouetide.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that it was a common thing amongſt them, to giue out words, as though Proteſtants were all poſſeſſed; and there-vpon the prieſts would aske ſome that were pretended to be poſſeſſed, or the deuil in them (as it was ſuppoſed) whileſt they were exorciſing them, why they did not trouble them before, whilſt they were Proteſtants. And the deuil would aunſwer, that there was no reaſon for them ſo to doe, becauſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were theirs already.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that after the time she was out of the prieſts hands, her former diſeaſe of the Mother did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times take her, and continued with her as before it had done, vntill being married ſhe had children. Since which time, she hath beene rid of that diſeaſe, she than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God.</p>
                  <p>She further ſaith, that shee wel remembreth the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Apothecarie was to goe to London to fetch more prieſts, the day before this exam: was firſt exorciſed, his horſe prauncing, and flinging of him downe, he returned backe againe, and conſtantly affirmed, that the wicked ſpirit that was in this exam: had cauſed his horſe to fling him: whereat when this exam: laughed, he the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> affirmed, that <hi>it was the deuill,</hi> that laughed at him.</p>

                  <p>I will firſt anſwer to the circumſtance of time, which is heere propounded vnto me. In the yeere 1584 I, &amp; <hi>Iohn Ballard</hi> prieſt, (ſince executed with Ma. <hi>Babington,</hi> and the reſt) comming together from Rome through <hi>Burgundy,</hi> found there a great preſſe of ſouldiours, and were aduertiſed, that they were to ſerue vnder the <hi>Duke of Guiſe.</hi> When wee came to <hi>Roane,</hi> wee heard then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, that the ſaid preparations were againſt England. The ſame yeere (as I remember) Ma. <hi>Crighton</hi> a Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Ieſuit was taken at the ſea, and after brought into England, who by occaſion of certaine writings which he had, was driuen to confeſſe at large (as I haue beene informed) what the whole plot was: and how far both the Pope, and the King of Spaine had ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in it. Hereof I doubt not, but that ſundry Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21637:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in England had ſufficient notice from beyond the ſeas, and eſpecially Ma. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> alias <hi>Weston</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, who was then the chiefe, as maiſter <hi>Garnet</hi> (as I take it) is at this preſent, and therefore could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of ſuch important matters, wherein principall men of his owne ſocietie were engaged.</p>
                  <p>Not long after my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into England in the yeere 1585, maiſter <hi>Martin Aray</hi> a prieſt, meeting with me at the end of <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> as I was turning to enter into <hi>Paules</hi> Churchyard, tooke mee by the hand, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering me in the eare, bad me <hi>be of good cheere, for that all things went now very well forward.

And this was the ſtate of that time, nouriſhed (I well perceiued) with great hope of ſome great alteration, by the meanes before expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>About the time of maiſter <hi>Arayes</hi> aforeſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with me, maiſter <hi>Edmunds,</hi> alias <hi>Weston,</hi> had lately (as it was reported) caſt a deuill out of one <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood:</hi> whereupon he the ſaid maiſter <hi>Aray,</hi> at the time before mentioned, did highly commend vnto mee the exorciſmes of Fa. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> ſaying that <hi>hee</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds</hi>) <hi>would make the deuils themſelues now confeſſe, that theyr kingdome was neere at an end.</hi> Vpon the pretended diſpoſſeſſion of the ſaid <hi>Marwood,</hi> ſundry other prieſts mooued thereunto (I am perſwaded) by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of maiſter <hi>Edmunds,</hi> or for that they meant to ſhew theyr zeale in imitating of him, did take vpon them to exorciſe, and caſt deuils out of diuers perſons. viz. <hi>Sara</hi> and <hi>Friſwood Williams, William Trayford, Anne Smith, Richard Mainy,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Calthrop,</hi> whoſe necke was found broken at the bottome of a payre of ſtayres (as the brute went then amongſt vs.) VVhen I ſaw this

As touching the ſeuerall manners of diſpoſſeſſing the ſaid parties, and of theyr fits, traunces, and viſions, diuers diſcourſes were pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, amongſt the which I my ſelfe did penne one. Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> likewiſe writ (I am perſwaded) a quire of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Ma. <hi>Mainyes</hi> pretended viſions. For he thought, as it ſeemed, to haue wrought ſome great matter by him, but was diſappointed very ridiculouſly, ſo as I thinke the ſaid viſion will hardly come to light. There was alſo a Treatiſe framed to proue firſt, <hi>that in former times diuers had been poſſeſſed.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that Christ hath left to his Church certaine remedies for the diſpoſſeſſing of ſuch parties.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that in the casting out of deuils, there hath beene great vſe of application to the Daemoniacks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliques.</hi> In proſecution of the firſt part, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points the Author ſheweth, that <hi>GOD permitteth ſome to be poſſeſſed, that thereby the faithleſſe Atheists may learne, that there is both a God and a deuill: and that the faith of the Catholique Church, may alſo be confirmed by the power left vnto her in casting out of deuils.</hi> In the handling of the ſecond point, <hi>hee tryumpheth against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſaying that for all theyr reformation which they talke of, to be ſo neere the order of the Primitiue Church, yet they are not able either to diſcerne, who are poſſeſſed amongst them, nor how to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remedy.</hi> The third part is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more largely, to the great aduauncement &amp; power of Reliques. As <hi>for holy water: that S.</hi> Macarius <hi>thereby
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21637:130"/>
cured a woman, who by Magicall enchauntment ſeemed to be turned into a Mare.</hi> Likewiſe, how S. <hi>Peter hallowed bread, against the aſſault of certaine deuils which were ſent by</hi> Simon Magus <hi>in the likenes of dogges, to deuoure him.</hi> For the power of prieſthood, there is an example alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of S. <hi>Martin, how he putting his fingers into the mouth of a Daemoniacke, the deuill durst not bite him, though he bad him to bite him, if he had any power ſo to doe.</hi> There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mention made of the vertue of the bleſſed ſacrament, of holy oyle, and of the bones of Saints. The vſe of all thoſe things, was very frequent in the exorciſing of the parties poſſeſſed. Inſomuch as wee omitted not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and bones of Ma. <hi>Campian,</hi> Ma. <hi>Sherwin,</hi> Ma. <hi>Brian,</hi> and Ma. <hi>Cottam,</hi> to haue ſome little teſtimonie by implication from the deuill, to prooue them holy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</p>
                  <p>If I be not deceiued, Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> alias <hi>Weston,</hi> was the Author of this booke, and the examples by him alledged, were brought of purpoſe, to giue the more credit to his, and our proceedings with the ſaid parties before mentioned. And indeed he was not therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for wee that were prieſts, were thereby greatlie magnified by Catholiques, ſchiſmaticks, and weak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; the two former beeing confirmed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicke faith, and the third ſort therevnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as hath beene before mentioned. And that cannot be denied, but that in the courſe which wee held with the ſaid pretended Daemoniacks, many occaſions were giuen, and aptly taken, to ſcorne and deride the orders, &amp; ſeruice now eſtabliſhed by her Maieſties lawes in the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe I muſt confeſſe, that the courſe we held, was ſo pleaſing to ſuch as ſaw it, or were informed of it by thoſe that they truſted, as it prooued very gainfull vnto vs all that were prieſts: wee had out of queſtion procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto our ſelues very great fauour, credit, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21637:131"/>
ſo as it was no meruaile, if ſome young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as Ma. <hi>Babington,</hi> &amp; the reſt, were allured to thoſe ſtrange attempts which they tooke in hand, by maiſter <hi>Ballard,</hi> who was an Agent amongſt vs. They ſaw, as they ſuppoſed, (for both maiſter <hi>Babington,</hi> and diuers of his company were oftentimes at the exorciſings) that we had a great commandement ouer deuils, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed greatly with them, as I think. It would haue been a very ſtrange thing (I am perſwaded) that wee could not haue wrought men at that time to attempt: which was prudently foreſeene by Fa. <hi>Edmunds</hi> of purpoſe (as I am reſolued in my conſcience) to prepare the harts, &amp; minds of Catholiques by thoſe practiſes, that when ſuch forces as were intended, ſhould haue come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they might haue been more readily drawn by him, and vs, to haue ioyned theyr forces with them. And this is that I can ſay concerning the occaſions, or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſuch matters were taken in hand at the time articulated.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the ſubſtance of the generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory it ſelfe, I haue peruſed the ſeuerall examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confeſſions of <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> and <hi>Friſwood</hi> her ſiſter, of <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> and of <hi>Richard Mainy</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and am fully perſwaded, that they haue depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the truth in ſuch poynts whereof they were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, belonging to theyr pretended poſſeſſion, &amp; diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The effect wherof is, that they were drawn by our cunning carriage of matters, to ſeeme as though they had beene poſſeſſed, when as in truth they were not, neither were there any of the prieſts ignorant in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their diſſimulation, nor the parties themſelues (as now it appeareth) of our diſſembled proceeding with them.</p>
                  <p>After I had beene my ſelfe firſt at one of theyr exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſings, it was my chaunce to he that night with maiſter <hi>Thomſon</hi> a prieſt, and a great Actor in thoſe matters, at
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21637:131"/>
his chamber by the <hi>Spittle:</hi> and falling into ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about it, I vſed ſome ſuch words, as though I doubted, whether the party were actually, and really poſſeſſed. For I my ſelfe being not acquainted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie plot deuiſed by Fa: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> or any other, ſpake my minde ſome-what more plainely, then I perceaued Ma: <hi>Thomſon</hi> wel liked of. His aunſwer vnto me was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that <hi>he being my friend, did earnestly wiſh me to cast forth no ſuch ſpeeches, whatſoeuer I did thinke. For</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the matter is iudged to be ſo by Fa:</hi> Edmunds, <hi>and ſome others that are Priests. Beſides ſuch Catholiques, as haue beene preſent at ſuch fits, haue receaued it for a truth, that the parties are poſſeſſed. And although I for my part will not make it an article of my Creede, yet I thinke that godlie credulitie doth much good, for the furthering of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, cauſe, and for the defacing of our common enemies, and their proceedings:</hi> or to this effect. Not long after, alſo talking with Ma: <hi>Stamp,</hi> at the Lo. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux</hi> his houſe in <hi>Hackney,</hi> concerning theſe matters, and demaunding of him ſeriouſly his opinion, what he thought of them: his aunſwer was, that <hi>they were things of ſuch importance, as would further the Catholique cauſe, more then all the bookes that had beene written of late yeeres, about the controuerſies in Religion with the Protestants:</hi> with which aunſwer, I ſeemed to reſt contented, becauſe I ſaw thereby he was not willing to enter into any playner courſe with me.</p>
                  <p>I would not haue this my confeſſion further exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then my meaning is, I doe not take vpon me either directly or indirecty, to oppoſe my ſelfe to the three poynts of the Treatiſe before mentioned, which are ſtrengthened with ſome authorities, both of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of the auncient Fathers, and Writers. How be it, as I account it preſumption to denie all thoſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, as touching the caſting out of deuils in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church ſince the Apoſtles times; ſo to beleeue all that is written thereof, I hold it a point of great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21637:132"/>
and I doubt not but the ſoundeſt Catholiques in <hi>Europe</hi> are of my opinion. For be it true that is alledged in the ſaid treatiſe of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that he neuer heard of any, that could counterfeit himſelfe to be a Daemoniack, yet later experience hath taught vs the contrary. And indeede, the artificiall skil conſidered where-vnto prieſts haue attained, it is a very eaſie matter to bring a young girle, or a youth, to doe, and ſpeake thoſe things, which the Exorciſts can readily colour, and interpret; as if it were both done, and ſpoken by deuils, that did poſſeſſe them. But yet this I wil ſay, and giue it for a rule to all Catholiques heereafter, that wil not purpoſely ſuffer themſelues to be deluded: let them but mark diligently when they are preſent at any ſuch actions, what the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pretended to be poſſeſſed, doe eyther act, or ſpeak, and then they shal perceaue nothing, but may very well be diſſembled, or otherwiſe vttered in great diſtemper, procured by loathſome potions, and violent fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And they shal be very wel armed againſt all ſuch deceites, if euer it be their haps to heare, or read the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and examinations of the parties before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Marrie they muſt keepe their owne counſel: For I am perſwaded, that if any shall ſeeme to be a curious beholder at ſuch times, and a mouer of queſtions, he shal not be any welcome gueſt vnto them. Heereof any may be further aduertiſed, that wil take the paines to reade a little French Treatiſe, of a <note n="*" place="margin">Martha Broſlier.</note> counterfeit Daemoniack at <hi>Paris,</hi> and how the Exorciſts could in no ſort endure the queſtions, &amp; doubts, that were propounded vnto them, when they were at their work, but pretended that ſuch curioſity, and want of faith did greatly hinder them in their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>There will be many exceptions taken to that, which heere I haue deliuered vpon my conſcience, to proue that the ſaid parties pretended to be poſſeſſed, were not counterfeits, as that ſome things fell out, which were not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21637:132"/>
poſſible to be diſſembled. The chiefe obiection wil be as touching a peece of a knife, in length about two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and a halfe, which was ſaid to come out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of <hi>Anne Smith,</hi> hauing beene conuaied into her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it was pretended by the deuil. And to cleare the matter, the deuil was made (forſooth) to ſhew by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, that he was able to doe ſuch a thing: for to this effect it was giuen out, that the deuil should reade vs (as I may terme it) a Lecture: <hi>I am as you know by creation a ſpirit, and haue lost no part of my knowledge, and cunning in the ſecrets of nature, and that I can diſſolue any Iron or hard matter at my pleaſure into a liquid ſubstance, and ſo I did, and poured it into her porredge, which ſhe eating, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp the knife in that liquid ſubstance, and the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo in her body, I reduced it into the artificiall forme which before it had. And thus much you may beleeue</hi> (quoth the deuil) <hi>if you be but Philoſophers,</hi> or to this effect. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto for aunſwer as the truth is, ſo farre forth, as I know or beleeue. Firſt as the peece of the knife came out of her mouth, without hurting of her (if it came out of her mouth at all, and that there were not a ſhift of legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vſed to make it ſeeme indeede to thoſe that were preſent, that it came out of her mouth) ſo might it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth againe, hauing beene put into her mouth by the Exorciſt himſelfe, for ought I know, as ſome of the ſaid parties haue acknowledged, that the Exorciſts ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would thruſt bigge<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ones, and peeces of reliques into their mouthes. Amongſt the which <hi>Friſwood Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> depoſeth, that as ſhe verily beleeueth, they thruſt a ruſtie, naile into her mouth, and afterwards pretended, that it came out of her body. 2. <hi>Anne Smith</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that she is fully perſwaded, that they haue repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vntruly of the taking of a peece of a knife out of her mouth. Howbeit, ſhee ſaith, ſhee durſt not at that time contradict them: but it is needeleſſe for mee to aunſwer this, or any ſuch like obiection. For the things
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21637:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are in themſelues ſo ridiculous, as I thinke no man will be ſo mad, as to take vppon him to defend them. And when wee our ſelues that were actors in thoſe matters, thought wee had wonne our ſpurres, yet diuers aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent prieſts, as Maiſter <hi>Heywood,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Dolman,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Redman,</hi> and ſome others hearing of the courſe we held, did ſhake their heads at it, and ſhewed their great diſlike of it. Likewiſe the grauer ſort, that were then impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Wiſbich,</hi> were greatly offended there-with (as I haue beene credibly informed) and ſaid, that howſoeuer for a time wee might be admired, yet in the end wee would thereby marre all, and vtterly diſcredit both our ſelues, and our calling. Where-vpon wee the younger ſort of the Seminarie prieſts, that were then dealers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thought our ſelues hardly dealt with by them, and that they did but enuie at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, which they ſaw wee daily gayned, themſelues being no actors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs. But now I ſee, that the ſaid auncient Fathers had beene acquainted of likelihood with ſuch deuiſes beyond the Seas, and were greatly greeued to haue them brought into England: notwithſtanding Ma: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and the reſt, would needes proceede (as is before in part expreſſed,) and haue thereby to their perpetual ſhame, made them true Prophets.</p>
                  <p>I haue my ſelfe before confeſſed, that my pen is in the booke, that was taken with Ma: <hi>Barnes,</hi> wherein I layd together thoſe things, that <hi>Sara Williams</hi> was pretended to haue done, and ſaid in one of her fits at <hi>Hackney,</hi> the 10 of Ianuarie, ſome things whereof I ſaw, and heard my ſelfe, others I receaued by peece-meale of Maiſter <hi>Thomſon,</hi> Ma: <hi>Thulice,</hi> and others, and layd them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the beſt skill I had, to make them ſeeme ſtrange, and wonderfull. For although both my ſelfe (as I ſaid before) and ſo I thinke of the reſt, did know that all was but counterfeite, yet for as much as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, that thereby great credit did grow to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21637:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe, and great diſcredit to the Proteſtants, wee held it lawfull to doe, as we did.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after I had firſt conformed my ſelfe to the ſtate of the Church, eſtabliſhed heere in England, and there-vpon diſcloſed many things to the late Lo. <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,</hi> concerning ſundry very pernicious deſignments againſt her Maiſtie, and this ſtate; I fell againe to my old courſe, by the perſwaſion of ſome of my auncient acquaintance that were prieſts, hauing had ſmall time to ground my ſelfe by ſtudy, thereby to defend my ſaid conformitie. I was no ſooner come to my old byace, but they ſoone drew mee, for the good of the Catholique cauſe, to ſay that all in effect was falſe that I had before confeſſed. Although not long after, the treaſons did ſo breake forth, and were ſo fully confeſſed by <hi>Babington</hi> himſelfe, that not onely that, which I had reported was iuſtified by them to be true, but a great deale more then euer I knew, or dreamed of. Likewiſe I hauing detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome part the folly of the ſaid exorciſings, it is ſcarce credible how earneſt the ſaid prieſts were with me, to avow them againe for matters of veritie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto for the reaſon before mentioned, I did vvillingly yeeld, nothing doubting but that, if God ſhould once againe ſo draw his grace from mee, as that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be as then I was (that is, wholy addicted to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as I truſt in his mercy hee will neuer doe) I ſhould be as ready againe to deny all that now I haue affirmed vpon my oath, as I was before. For the generall conceit amongſt all the prieſts of that order is, that they may deny any thing, which beeing confeſſed doth turne to the diſhonour of the Catholique Church of Rome. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they haue other obiections that ſerue theyr turnes, as that the Magiſtrates in England are no competent Iudges, the Queene herſelfe ſtanding excommunicate, and that therefore the examinations taken before them, are of no validitie to bind the examinats, but that all that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:21637:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they doe confeſſe, is <hi>tanquam coram non Iudice.</hi> A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other ſhifts they haue, which I doe not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtolicall rule is, that <hi>euill ſhall not be doone that good may come of it,</hi> but they doe not account it euill (as I verily thinke) to calumniate the Proteſtants by any deuiſe whatſoeuer, that may carry any probabilitie with it, nor make any conſcience to tell, and publiſh any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, which they thinke, beeing belieued, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce and promote ſuch poynts and matters, as they take vpon them to defend, for the honour of the church of Rome, and dignitie of their prieſthood.</p>

                  <p>THe ſaid <hi>Richard Mainy</hi> had read vnto him ſome parts of a diſcourſe, or two, written by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Seminary prieſts of a pretended poſſeſſion, and diſpoſſeſſion both of himſelfe, and of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others, viz. one <hi>Marwood, Trayford, Sara,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Williams</hi> two ſiſters, and <hi>Anne Smith.</hi> Theſe parties were ſaid to be poſſeſſed, and diſpoſſeſſed of many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits. The prieſts that dealt with them, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but the eſpeciall men that had <hi>Richard Mainy</hi> in hand, were Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> the Ieſuit, alias <hi>Weston, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and one <hi>Dibdale,</hi> men wholy at the deuotion and direction of the ſaid <hi>Edmunds.</hi> It was in the yeeres 1585 and 1586, when theſe ſtratagems were executed. Such dealings as they had with the ſaid <hi>Mainy,</hi> were at <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> at one Ma. <hi>Fittons,</hi> two miles from <hi>Windſore,</hi> and at the Earle of <hi>Loncolnes</hi> houſe in <hi>Channon-row,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Mainy</hi> his brother did then remaine.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe matters the ſaid <hi>Mainy</hi> beeing demaunded diuers queſtions, deſired that hee might haue leaue to aunſwer them after his owne faſhion, and not to be tied to the order of the ſaid demaunds, for that hee thought he could ſet downe thoſe things which hee remembred, more plainly to his owne vnderſtanding, then otherwiſe he ſhould be able, if he were bound to follow the order propounded vnto him by the ſaid demaunds. And that which he hath ſet downe is the diſcourſe following, not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21637:135"/>
much diſagreeing from the order of the interrogatories miniſtred vnto him.</p>
                  <p>And hath Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> &amp; the reſt of the prieſts thus dealt with mee? I am very ſorry for it. It might haue beene ſufficient for them, to haue practiſed theyr pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes vpon me and the reſt, youthes and almoſt girles, although they had not publiſhed the ſame to the world. But of likelihood theyr glory, and our diſcredit were ſo ioyned together, as the one could not ſtand without the other. This courſe whereunto they haue therby drawne me, wil procure me great diſpleaſure (I know) amongſt my friends, and worke me much hinderance in my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate eſtate: but what remedie? Beeing called by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique authoritie, and enforced by vertue of mine oath to deliuer the truth, I cannot ſee how with any conſcience I can deny thoſe things, which I find to be truly layd to my charge, and could neuer haue beene thought of, if their writings had neuer come to the Magiſtrats hands. The particulers which now of neceſſity I muſt deliuer, I was purpoſed to haue concealed from all men liuing, although heeretofore in generall termes I haue beene driuen to ſay ſomewhat of theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>About 14 yeeres ſince, the Lords of her Maieſties moſt honourable priuie Counſell, (<hi>Henry Earle</hi> of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> being one) hauing gotten ſome notice of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded poſſeſſions, and diſpoſſeſſions at the places before mentioned, and that I was one of the parties that had beene dealt with, did write their letter vnto <hi>Ferdinando</hi> then Lord <hi>Strange</hi> to examine me. It ſeemeth they had beene informed that I ſhould publiſh, how I was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with certaine wicked ſpirits, and of them diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by ſome prieſts of the Catholique Romane Church, and that I ſhould take vpon mee in companie where I came, to iuſtifie the ſame. So as being called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> he demaunded of me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had giuen out ſuch ſpeeches. Hee examined mee
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:21637:135"/>
vpon my oath, and my aunſwer was according to the truth, as I was perſwaded in mine owne conſcience, and as farre as my memory did ſerue me: viz. that I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer poſſeſſed with any wicked ſpirit, nor had reported any ſuch thing; and that I was ſo farre from iuſtifying of it, that I was fully perſwaded, that in all the courſes which the prieſts tooke with me, when they pretended that I was poſſeſſed, there was nothing but deceit, falf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, illuſions, and iuglings. This was the effect of my aunſwer at that time, if my memory doe not much faile me, and thereupon I was by his Lordſhip diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>VVith this aunſwer (I ſuppoſe) the Ieſuits were long ſince acquainted, which hath greatly already hindered me, &amp; alienated the harts of ſome of my deereſt friends from mee. And the ſame aunſwer that I made then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lordſhip, I muſt now make againe to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all thoſe queſtions which haue been demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of mee, viz. that I was neuer poſſeſſed with any wicked ſpirit, otherwiſe then all other ſinners are, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as free (I thanke GOD) from hauing any deuils in me, as either Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> himſelfe, or any other of the Prieſts that had to deale with me, for ought I know.</p>
                  <p>This aunſwer I thought would haue beene ſufficient to haue ſatisfied all thoſe things which are obiected againſt me, but I am vrged with ſundry particulers, and therefore I muſt of neceſſity yeeld to the cleering of my ſelfe in them, and yet no otherwiſe then the truth requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. When I was about 13 yeeres old, I was ſent by my mothers direction to <hi>Rhemes</hi> in Fraunce, where there was then an Engliſh Seminary: the intent of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other of my friends was (as I thinke) to haue had mee to haue been a prieſt. I remained in <hi>Rhemes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yeres, and was there maintained with my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers exhibition &amp; allowance. Towards the end of the ſaid two yeeres, of a childiſh curioſitie I entred into the obſeruances of certaine religious men, termed in that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21637:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
country <hi>Bonhommes,</hi> or <hi>fratres minimi,</hi> and became a young probationer amongſt them. This order was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed by <hi>Fraunces de Paula,</hi> who is canonized for a ſaint, of whom there is mention made in the <hi>Romane breuiary,</hi> as hauing his place appointed in the Kalender on the ſecond of Aprill. There his office &amp; courſe of life is ſet downe, and briefly deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>After I had remained about a quarter of a yeere, or ſomewhat more in this probation, I was ſent by the <hi>Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the houſe with ſome other of my fellowes, to the houſe of the <hi>Bonhommes</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had ſcarcely remained a quarter of a yeere but I grew weary of that profeſſion. Their rules ſeemed vnto me to be too ſtrict for me, and their diet beeing nothing but fiſh, I began to diſlike it. Beſides, I had a diſeaſe, wherewith I had been troubled before I went out of England, that tooke me there againe; and thereupon I gaue ouer that order altogether.</p>
                  <p>About that time, there was a proclamation publiſhed heere in England (as I was told) that <hi>all Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, ſhould repaire home into theyr Country within a certaine time, vpon danger of her Maiesties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and loſſe of theyr goods and lands,</hi> or to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Whereuppon I was perſwaded by ſome of my friends, that ſaw my courſe of life there, hauing giuen ouer my ſtudie, to returne home againe; and the rather, for that I had ſome land left vnto mee by my father. Leauing therefore <hi>Paris,</hi> I tooke my iourny homeward by <hi>Roane</hi> towards <hi>Diepe</hi> where I tooke ſhipping, and landed at <hi>Rie.</hi> At my arriuall, the Maior offering vnto mee the oath of her Maieſties ſupremacy, I willinglie tooke it, and afterwards repayred of mine owne accord diligently to the Church, and ſeruice of God eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in England by her Maieſties lawes. I continued in Suſſex, Kent, and other places, from <hi>Good friday</hi> (the time of my arriuall) vntill it was towards <hi>Alhallontide</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:21637:136"/>
following, which time I ſpent as other young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did, with whom I fell acquainted, vntill through meere neceſſity, hauing then no part of my liuing in my hands, I was conſtrained through want to repaire to my brother <hi>Iohn Mainy</hi> at London, vpon whom I did for a while eſpecially relye.</p>
                  <p>I had not beene long in London, before it was my hap to dine at the L. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aux</hi> his houſe with my ſaid brother, eyther at <hi>Hackney,</hi> or <hi>Hogſdon,</hi> (I doe not wel remember whether) his Lordſhip was not then at home, but the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was kept, and entertainment giuen by his ſonne, and daughter. In that dinner while there was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the late poſſeſſion, and diſpoſſeſſion of one <hi>Marwood,</hi> by certaine prieſts, and chiefely (if I doe not forget my ſelfe) by Ma: <hi>Edmunds.</hi> The tales which were told of that matter, ſeemed ſtrange vnto me, as what extraordinarie ſtrength he had in his fits: how he roared like a Bull, and many other things were then mentioned, which now I haue forgotten? While my chiefe continuance was in London, I rode ſometimes with my brother to <hi>Denham,</hi> the houſe of Sir <hi>George Peckham,</hi> and in the pariſh of <hi>Denham,</hi> (he hauing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Sir <hi>George Peckhams</hi> daughters, and the whole fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the houſe appertayning vnto him, as part of his dowrie with his wife.) At that time alſo he kept ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants there, I went likewiſe ſometimes to <hi>Denham</hi> of mine owne accord, and remained there ſome two or three dayes at a time. It fell out hardly with me (as now I perceaue) that I came to London about Alhallontide before mentioned: for then there was nothing in effect in the mouthes of Catholiques, but of the caſting out of deuils. A little before there was much to doe with the ſaid <hi>Marwood,</hi> as I finde by the ſtory that is written of him, <note place="margin">By Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds in Latine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant vpon record.</note> beginning <hi>Erat quida<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuenis,</hi> &amp;c. Immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as alſo it is plaine by an other ſtory, which I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was taken with one Ma: <hi>Barnes</hi>) there was at
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21637:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hollantide great buſines at <hi>Fulmer</hi> with <hi>Trayford,</hi> and <hi>Sara Williams.</hi> And ſuch were then thoſe times, as now I vnderſtand, and did then partly finde by experience, that a ſmall occaſion was matter ſufficient for the prieſts to worke vppon, to charge any one that they liked to deale with, that he was poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth alſo by that which is written in the ſayd booke taken with Ma: <hi>Barnes,</hi> and by ſome other tales which I haue heard, that the prieſts, or ſome for them, vnderſtanding that I tooke no courſe to be a prieſt, and how I had left the <hi>Bonhommes,</hi> &amp; how I had been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with my former diſeaſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> and how after my returne, I had behaued my ſelfe youthfully amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen; gaue it out that I was ſurely poſſeſſed, and afterwards to make the ſame good, haue publiſhed in the ſame booke, the teſtimonie of the deuil himſelfe, as it is pretended; whereof anon.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this report I could doe nothing (as I am enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) but it was ſaid, that the deuil did direct me in it. In ſo much as when I rode to <hi>Denham</hi> my ſelfe (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed) it was giuen forth, as I perceaue, that the horſe I rid vpon was a deuil, and that I had deuils at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon me in liuerie coates, by that which I find written, and reported of me: there was neuer young Gentleman (I think) more abuſed then I haue been.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time ſpent at <hi>Fulmer</hi> by the prieſts with the ſaid <hi>Trayford,</hi> and <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> they came all of them with Ma: <hi>Edmond Peckham,</hi> and his wife to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (as it is mentioned in the ſaid booke) &amp; I not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing at that time, what reports were bruted abroad of me, reſorting thither (as I was wont) fell into their ſnares, which I would ſurely haue auoyded, if poſſibly I could haue ſuſpected, that they would euer haue dealt with me, as afterwards they did.</p>
                  <p>At my comming thither amongſt them, I was kindly vſed, and lodged in the furtheſt part of the houſe: the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21637:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other chambers were then ſupplied with other gueſts that I knew not of, vntill a mayde in the houſe, who had beene my brothers Cooke, did tell me of them. Vpon the comming of Ma: <hi>Edmond Peckham</hi> to <hi>Denham,</hi> my brothers ſeruants departed, and left the houſe to him (as I thinke) except it were this mayd, to whom I was much beholding for her kindnes towards me. Within a day or two after this my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>Denham,</hi> the ſaid maid-Cooke ſignified vnto me, that there was great walking of ſpirits about the houſe, &amp; that diuers had been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie affrighted by them. The firſt night that I came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I remember) I was ſome-what euill at eaſe, and whether this report, that did ſome-thing aſtoniſh me, did make me worſe or no, I cannot tell: but I grew worſe, and worſe, in ſo much as my old diſeaſe at a very wicked time, did there take hold of me.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe I ſpake of, was a ſpice of the <hi>Mother,</hi> where-with I had beene troubled (as is before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) before my going into Fraunce: whether I doe rightly terme it the <hi>Mother</hi> or no, I know not: but it is wel knowne to the Phyſicians in London, that be aliue, and were then of any name, that my eldeſt brother <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Mainy</hi> had the ſame diſeaſe, and that he died of it: and Ma: <hi>Edmond Peckham</hi> (as I haue beene credibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) was likewiſe troubled with it. When I was ſick of this diſeaſe in Fraunce, a Scottiſh Doctor of Phyſick then in <hi>Paris,</hi> called it, as I remember, <hi>Vertiginem capitis.</hi> It riſeth (as he ſaid, and I haue often felt) of a wind in the bottome of the belly, and proceeding with a great ſwelling, cauſeth a very painfull collicke in the ſtomack, and an extraordinary giddines in the head. With this diſeaſe I am ſtill once in foure or fiue yeeres troubled, and I doe greatly ſuſpect that it wil end me, as it did my brother.</p>
                  <p>I began no ſooner to be troubled at <hi>Denham</hi> (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid) but as now I perceaue the prieſts had that,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21637:138"/>
which they looked for. The women of the houſe (whoſe names I doe not now remember) that came to help, and attend me, told me firſt, as my brothers maid had done before, how greatly the houſe was troubled with ſpirits, and afterwards that there were two poſſeſſed in the houſe with deuils: the manner of whoſe fits they deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto me in ſuch ſort, as I was much amazed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Whether theſe women vvere required by the Prieſts to tell me theſe things or no, I know not: but ſhortly after Ma: <hi>Dibdale,</hi> and Ma: <hi>Cornelius</hi> two prieſts comming vnto me, after ſundry queſtions, and ſpeeches vſed with me, they fell to be of opinion (as it ſeemed, and ſo told me) that I was poſſeſſed with a wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I ſay, <hi>(as it ſeemed)</hi> for I am fully perſwaded in my conſcience, that they knew wel enough, that neither I, nor any of the reſt before mentioned were indeede poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed: but that they did pretend ſo, to worke thereby ſuch matters, as they had propounded vnto themſelues, whereof for my part I wil no further iudge. Of this my perſwaſion I haue ſome reaſons, by that which I finde written, &amp; depoſed by others to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>When I firſt heard them ſay, that I was poſſeſſed, I told them that I doubted not, but that they were decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therein. I acquainted them with the nature of my diſeaſe, and how long I had beene troubled with it: but they perſiſted in their opinion. For that time leauing me, they came ſhortly vnto me againe, and began where before they had left: then they told me what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſtrength I ſhewed in one of my pangues, which moued me litle. For the nature of that diſeaſe, is to cauſe ones belly to ſwel in ſuch ſort, as two or three are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (vſing any good diſcretion) to keepe downe the wind, that ſeeketh to aſcend, as it is very wel knowne to thoſe, that haue ſeene eyther a man or woman in that fit, and as it is likely, the prieſts themſelues knew by their experience in Ma: <hi>Edmond Peckham,</hi> who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:21637:138"/>
oft troubled with it (as is before expreſſed.)</p>
                  <p>Diuers other reaſons they vſed vnto me, to cauſe me to ſuſpect the worſt of my ſelfe, and theſe as I think were ſome of them: they put me in minde of giuing ouer my ſtudy beyond the Seas, of leauing the courſe I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the <hi>Bonhommes,</hi> &amp; of my more youthfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation ſince my returne: theſe and ſuch like poynts they vſed, as arguments to conuince me, that I was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. But I replying for my ſelfe as I could, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them what a diſcredit it would be vnto me, to haue it reported of me, that I was poſſeſſed with a deuil, and how it would be a blemiſh, and a diſgrace vnto me, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt I liued: they made little account thereof, ſaying, that <hi>it was a leſſe diſcredit, and not ſo hurtfull for a man to haue 10000 deuils in him, then to haue committed one deadly ſinne:</hi> and to this purpoſe they alledged a place out of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> (as farre as I remember.) Beſides they reaſoned with me, to proue it the ſafeſt way for me, to ſubmit my ſelfe to their triall, whether I were poſſeſſed or no: for that (as they ſaid) if the deuill were not in mee, I could take no hurt by theyr triall, whereas if I were poſſeſſed, it could not but be very dangerous vnto mee, that the deuill ſhould ſtill continue in me. By theſe, and ſuch like meanes they perſwaded mee, to yeeld my ſelfe to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by them for the triall of my eſtate. When they had me at this point, then they permitted mee to haue acceſſe vnto <hi>Sara Williams</hi> when ſhe was in her fits, and informed me likewiſe of the manner, how ſhee, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had beene troubled.</p>
                  <p>This courſe held with me, they drew me to confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to promiſe that I would goe no more to the Proteſtants Churches: affirming that they could doe me no good, vntill I was become againe a member of the Catholique Romaine Church. After I had beene at one or two of <hi>Saras</hi> fits, and ſubmitted my ſelfe (as is before expreſſed) a pangue of my olde diſeaſe taking
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21637:139"/>
hold on me, Ma: <hi>Dibdale</hi> affirmed publiquely to the company, that then it was apparant, that I was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Vpon my recouerie he told me, that by applying of holy reliques vnto my belly, hee had compelled the wicked ſpirit to giue me eaſe: whereas I neuer found benefit by any ſuch things, but was eaſed (as I had been at other times before, when the fit of the Mother left me) by bending of my body forward, which is a cauſe of breaking of wind, and conſequently of apparant eaſe. And heereby (as I am perſwaded) I was at that time ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; not by any reliques. Within a day or two after (as I remember) they told me, that it was neceſſary for me to be exorciſed: where vnto although I was loath to yeeld, becauſe I had ſeene their manner of dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eyther with <hi>Sara,</hi> or <hi>Frauncis Williams,</hi> who by this time was ſaid to be all ſo poſſeſſed, yet I had ſubmitted my ſelfe ſo farre, that now it was too late for me to draw backe. All things therefore being in a readines, and I in good health, and no wayes troubled with my diſeaſe, they bound me faſt in a chayre, and fell to their Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes with much ſolemnity, and ſhew of great deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then they vrged me to drink a very vnpleaſant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which troubled me greatly; in ſo much as I deſired them to vntye me, and giue me leaue to lye downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my bed: but they regarded not my words, or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt entreaty, ſaying: <hi>It was the deuill,</hi> and not my ſelfe that deſired ſuch reſt, that ſo he might not be diſturbed in me. At other times when they had me bound in ſuch like manner, beſides the ſaid drinke, they vſed to burne brimſtone vnder my noſe, and ſome other things elſe, which vexed me exceedingly. What I did, and ſpake at thoſe times, I doe not now remember: by that which I ſee they haue written of <hi>Marwood, Trayford,</hi> of <hi>Sara,</hi> &amp; <hi>Frauncis Williams,</hi> I doubt not but many things haue beene reported of me, which are vntrue. It is not vnlike but that when I found my ſelfe ſo entangled with them,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21637:139"/>
as that I could not rid my ſelfe from them, I did, and ſpake many things which were inconuenient, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I think I ſhould be aſhamed, if I did remember them. For after I had learned their humour, and perceaued as wel by the reſt, as by mine own experience, what would content them, I framed my ſelfe accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt I was thus at <hi>Denham</hi> with them, I was neuer almoſt ſuffered to be quiet: but eyther I was to be exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed my ſelfe, or vrged to be with <hi>Sara,</hi> or her ſiſter <hi>Frauncis,</hi> or kept priuately in my chamber, and one way or other toſſed, and turmoyled by them, till at the laſt after ſundry Exorciſmes, and much further trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by their drinkes, &amp; violent fumigations, they gaue it forth, that they had caſt one deuil out of me: but with ſuch intimation, as might breede a ſuſpition that there were ſome other left in me. By this time Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas drew neere, and whether it was for that they meant to deale with <hi>Sara</hi> at <hi>Hackney,</hi> or for what other cauſe they knew beſt, they gaue me ouer for a while, and ſent me to Ma: <hi>Fittons</hi> by <hi>Windſor,</hi> where I ſuppoſe they thought I ſhould be wel looked vnto, &amp; ready afterwards when they ſhould ſend for me.</p>
                  <p>I remayned at Ma: <hi>Fittons</hi> till after the end of the holy dayes (as I remember,) and being free from their vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did ſolace my ſelfe with merrie company, as the time, and occaſion ſerued. In ſo much as ſome gaue it out, peraduenture by the prieſts procurement, that I was ſtill poſſeſſed with a merry deuil: and others ſaid, that if I were poſſeſſed indeede, it could not otherwiſe chooſe, but that he was a deuil, that was not much troubled with melancholly, or to that effect. Of theſe reports I heard nothing my ſelfe, whileſt I was at Ma: <hi>Fittons,</hi> for if I had, they would much haue abated the edge of my mirth, which they ſpake of. But now it is meete to be conſidered, how notably they ioyned their matters to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. It greeueth me much that I am conſtrained to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21637:140"/>
deale in theſe matters thus farre, but yet I ſee that if this occaſion had not fallen out, I ſhould neuer haue ſo well diſcerned their dealing with me.</p>
                  <p>Although they gaue it out, that they had caſt a deuil out of me (as is before mentioned) and amongſt many other reaſons had alledged, that the deuill entred into me, becauſe I gaue ouer the order of the <hi>Bonhommes,</hi> &amp; further, becauſe ſome might peraduenture ſuſpect, that notwithſtanding all that they had either done or ſaid of me, yet all the diſeaſe that I had was but onely the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now they haue a deuiſe to cleere all theſe poynts, as it is apparant in the ſaid booke ſo often before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. On Monday the tenth of <hi>Ianuary, Sara Williams</hi> is pretended to haue a meruailous great fit at <hi>Hackney,</hi> and amongſt many other ſpeeches which the prieſt that exorciſed her then vſed, hee commeth at laſt to theſe: <hi>There is one</hi> (ſaith hee to the deuill as it was pretended) <hi>that hath the</hi> Mother, <hi>what ſayest thou to him?</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill aunſwereth, <hi>that is a</hi> Mother <hi>indeed.</hi> So heereby they would makes it plaine, that it was not the <hi>Mother</hi> that I was troubled with. But the prieſt goeth forward ſaying, <hi>was there any ſpirit cast out of him?</hi> and the deuill aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,) <hi>yea a little one, but to no purpoſe.</hi> So as now they haue a ſufficient teſtimonie, that I was diſpoſſeſſed of one deuill whilſt I was at <hi>Denham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is pretended by <hi>Saras</hi> deuill, that there remaineth ſtill in mee the Prince of all other deuils, whoſe name ſhould be <hi>Modu,</hi> which gaue them mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to worke vpon againe with me. But yet all doubts were not cleered, and therefore the ſaid prieſt demanded this queſtion of <hi>Saras</hi> deuill: <hi>Came the prince</hi> Modu (ſaith he) <hi>into him to bring him from the houſe of S.</hi> Frauncis de Paula <hi>his order? Yea in troth</hi> (quoth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.) And thus they thought they had ſufficiently iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all that they had reported of him, as appeareth by the ſaid booke. But all this notwithſtanding, I am more
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21637:140"/>
and more confirmed heereby, in my former opinion of their bad proceeding with mee, and the rather, becauſe (as I am informed) <hi>Sara Williams</hi> vppon her oath hath denied, that euer ſhee vſed any ſuch ſpeeches of mee, as farre as ſhe remembreth.</p>
                  <p>When the ſaid prieſts had diſpatched their buſines at <hi>Hackney,</hi> they then returned towards mee, vppon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to caſt the great Prince <hi>Modu</hi> (as I ſuppoſe) out of mee. I beeing at Ma. <hi>Fittons</hi> (as is before ſaid) it fell out that by reaſon of good company, I daunced that night ſo long, that I caſt my ſelfe into a very great ſweat, and was weary. Afterward, whether before I went to bed, or when I was in bed, I doe not well remember, I had a fit of the <hi>Mother,</hi> as I haue had before, and often times ſince vppon ſuch violent exerciſes. It happened that this night ſom of the ſaid prieſts that were at <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> (as I thinke) came to Ma. <hi>Fittons,</hi> who hearing of my fit, ſaid it was no meruaile, for it was confeſſed by the deuill in <hi>Sara,</hi> that I had the Prince of many deuils in me, or words to that effect. Heereuppon in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one Miſtris <hi>Anne More</hi> a gentlewoman, waiting vpon Miſtris <hi>Fitton</hi> came vnto me, and told mee vvith weeping eyes, which of the prieſts were come that night to the houſe, and what they had reported of mee, and how much I was deceiued, in that I thought my ſelfe to be troubled with nothing but the <hi>Mother.</hi> I aunſwered her (as if ſhe be aliue ſhe can well beare me witnes) that I knew very well, whatſoeuer they ſaid, that the <hi>Mother</hi> was the onely diſeaſe wherewith I was vexed, and that I was free (I thanked GOD) from the poſſeſſion of anie wicked ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>All the while they wrought vpon me before, I found no other trouble in mee, but of mine old griefe when I had it, ſauing ſuch paine as they caſt mee into by theyr drinkes and perfumes. And when they ſaid that the deuill was caſt out of mee, yet I found my ſelfe neither
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21637:141"/>
better, nor worſe, which cauſed me to thinke, that thoſe things were moſt vntrue which they reported of me.</p>
                  <p>I was ſo confident heerein, that the better to colour (as I thinke) their future proceedings with me, they ſent to a Phyſician, one Doctor <hi>Griffith,</hi> who gaue me, as it is ſaid ſome Phyſicke. But through their information (as I am perſwaded) the concluſion amongſt them was, that there was no naturall cauſe of my diſeaſe: and ſo there was no remedy, but I muſt needes be poſſeſſed. Then it was thought meete that I ſhould be caried backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whether to <hi>Denham,</hi> or to <hi>Channon-row,</hi> I doe not wel remember, but rather (as I coniecture) it was to <hi>Denham.</hi> And for as much as the report was, that the ſpirit ſuppoſed to be in me, was the Prince of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which were in the parties poſſeſſed; Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> the Ieſuit, and chiefe of all the prieſts, that had to deale then in theſe actions, was thought the meeteſt man (as I ſuppoſe) to encounter with him. After that time, ſo far as I remember, none of the prieſts had to deale with me, but himſelfe, he was my ghoſtly Father, and to him (as it is giuen out) I reuealed many things.</p>
                  <p>When he had the managing of theſe matters with me, there was very great reſort to the place where we were, and a very extraordinarie expectation, (as I haue heard) of ſome ſtrange euent to fall out.</p>
                  <p>The courſe which he held with me was much more rigorous, then at any time before. When hee had me bound, if I did not frame my ſelfe in euery thing to his contentment (as ſometimes being angry with his vſage of me I thinke I did not) then he would ſay, the deuil was obſtinate in me. In which caſe ſometimes I was conſtrained by him to drinke moſt loathſome draughts of ſuch confections as he had ready for me: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they burnt ſuch abhominable ſtinking, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, holding my noſe by force ouer the ſmoake; as (I think) would make a horſe mad. No man (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:21637:141"/>
is able to endure ſuch a perfume without extreame torment. He dealt thus hardly with me, as I thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon pretence that the great Prince of deuils that was in me, would not otherwiſe be tamed. I haue ſeene them ſometimes ſo perfume <hi>Sara Williams</hi> with ſuch lyke ſmoakes, as her face hath looked blacker, then euer I ſaw a chimney ſweepers. Which heates, and ſmels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their potions, did make her to talke, &amp; rage as if ſhe had beene mad. And the prieſts would make ſome vſe of euery thing ſhe ſaid: and ſo I thinke I may by her eſteeme of mine owne caſe, when they had made me in effect mad, no meruaile though I ſpake, &amp; fared like a mad man.</p>
                  <p>Being thus dealt with, I became very weake, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Little meate that I tooke would endured with me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue an houre or two, and I was at my wits end, what I ſhould doe. The beſt meanes that I could thinke of for mine owne eaſe, was to frame my ſelfe in ſuch ſort, as might be moſt agreeable to Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> liking: which then I began to doe with ſome extraordinarie care. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no occaſion to goe to confeſſion, none ſhewed more zeale at Maſſe time, then my ſelfe: at the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I pretended to ſee extraordinarie lights, as if they had beene the Sunne beames, and that the ſame did ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me, as ſometimes I would fall backwards, when I was kneeling, as though I could not endure the glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſo glorious a ſight: whereas I proteſt before God, I neuer ſaw indeede any ſuch light, or was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but therein I did as I had heard the prieſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that both <hi>Frauncis,</hi> and <hi>Sara Williams</hi> had done before me. And I doe verily thinke, they told me the ſame to no other end, but that I my ſelfe ſhould put the ſame in practiſe. For I found my ſelfe very apt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch examples: and doe ſuppoſe, that any being in that caſe, that I, and the reſt were, would aſſay to ſpeak, and doe as they ſhould be enformed, that others in their
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:21637:142"/>
eſtate had done or ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Of my ſaid pretended aſtoniſhments, Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> would make large diſcourſes concerning the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament. And where it is reported of me in writing, as theſe things laſt mentioned are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that I did pretend to ſee a gliſtering light come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thumbs, and fore-fingers of the prieſts at ſundry times: I confeſſe, it may be that I haue ſo affirmed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they themſelues haue asked me, if I did ſee no ſuch thing, or elſe haue told me, that the reſt in my caſe had ſeene ſuch lights, whereby I was induced to ſay as much of my ſelfe: whereas indeede whatſoeuer I ſaid thereof, was altogether vntrue. For I neuer ſaw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lights about their thumbs or fingers, then ſuch as is ordinarie to all other mens hands, and fingers. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the pretence of ſuch lights (as I remember) was, for that the prieſts thumbs, and fore-fingers are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with holy oyle (as I haue heard) when they are made prieſts, and becauſe they doe with them at Maſſe time handle the body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I found it did well content Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> and the reſt of the prieſts, that I ſhould ſometimes rayle very earneſtly both againſt him, and the reſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes then preſent, &amp; generally againſt all prieſts. And that I ſhould on the contrary commend as earneſtly the ſeruice of the proteſtants, the Magiſtrates, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the chiefeſt in authoritie. So I knew that <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> and the reſt had done, and ſo I did my ſelfe, no doubt as artificially as any of them, if not in better ſort. For wee all knew how they would expound them for theyr owne glory, in that the deuils (as they pretended) could not endure them: and to the great diſcredite of the other ſide, becauſe the deuils extolled them as theyr louing friends. And certaine it is that the Catholiques that were preſent to my vnderſtanding, did take great contentment by ſuch our ſpeeches, and their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21637:142"/>
of them. By this my readines to doe, and ſpeake whatſoeuer I found that Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> liked, I eſcaped ſometimes (as I thinke) theyr lothſome drinks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable fumigations.</p>
                  <p>After ſome time thus ſpent with mee at <hi>Denham,</hi> (as I ſuppoſe) I was carried to the Earle of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> houſe in <hi>Channon-row,</hi> where my brother, and his wife were as I remember: I was then not paſt 16 or 17 yeeres old as farre as I can geſſe, and therefore (to ſpeake a little in mine owne excuſe) no meruaile, all circumſtances dulie conſidered, that I was drawne by the cunning practiſes of the ſaid prieſts, into theſe diſſembling courſes which now I vtterly diſlike, and deteſt. I am fully perſwaded, that there is neuer a youth in England, were he of neuer ſo ripe and pregnant a wit, but if he ſhould fall into the hands of ſuch prieſts, he would in a ſhort time be ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched by them, as that hee would be ſoone drawne to ſtoope to their lure, and doe as I did.</p>
                  <p>When I was going, and come to <hi>Channon-row,</hi> I was very much grieued, and in feare (as far as I remember) of theyr further proceedings with mee. For I was then brought to ſuch weakenes, as I was ſcarce able to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, vnleſſe I were vpheld. We were no ſooner come thether, but that there was great concourſe of many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho: to ſee (as I thinke) the euent of things: eſpecially becauſe Ma. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> a man of great account amongſt them, was the onely dealer in effect with me. By thoſe things which I find written, and reported of mee, and which I had otherwiſe forgotten of my ſelfe, at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Channon-row,</hi> I did pretend ſome traunces, and in them to haue ſundry viſions, into which courſe I was led (as I am fully perſwaded) by ſome ſpeeches of the prieſts, whom I had oft heard talke how <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> and diuers others, had many times certaine traunces: wherein they lay as if they had beene ſenceleſſe, and in them had ſundry viſions, which vppon theyr recouerie
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21637:143"/>
they did vſually tell vnto the prieſts, and diuers others, whereupon I verily thinke, that the firſt Sunday after I came to <hi>Channon-row,</hi> (as aforeſaid) I fained my ſelfe to be in a traunce, and afterwards told Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> many tales of my beeing all that time in Purgatory, and what I had ſeene, and indured there. I alſo told him at that time (as farre as I remember) that I perceiued by one of the viſions which I then had, how I was euery Sunday to haue the like traunces, and viſions about the ſame houres, vntill <hi>Good-friday</hi> next enſuing, and that the I ſhould depart in a traunce out of this life, and goe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly into heauen.</p>
                  <p>There are diuers things further reported of mee as touching theſe my pretended traunces, and viſions, (as that after I ſhewed my ſelfe to be recouered, I did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of great afflictions, and perſecutions, which ſhould happen to the Catholiques in England, and of ſundry ſuch matters) but whether they be true or no, I doe not remember. If I vſed any ſuch words, either Ma. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds,</hi> or ſome of the reſt induced mee thereunto, by ſome of their <hi>leading questions,</hi> or I had heard them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeake themſelues to that effect: or elſe the report is altogether falſe, and deuiſed by themſelues to ſerue theyr owne turnes: for of my ſelfe I doe not belieue that I had any apprehenſion of any ſuch matters.</p>
                  <p>It is written alſo of mee, how after ſome other of my pretended traunces and viſions, I vſed diuers times to fall into ſtrange exclamations, making the company to belieue, that I ſaw Chriſt himſelfe accompanied with a number of Angels in ſuch a corner of the chamber, and at other times the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> attended with a trayne of bleſſed virgins, and that thereupon my manners was to vrge them that were preſent, to fall downe vpon their knees to worſhip them, and to pray vnto them. Theſe things I doe in ſome ſort remember, and doe partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them to be true, becauſe I well remember, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:21637:143"/>
my ſaid motions, and vrging of them, both Ma. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and the reſt, did vſually lift vp their hands, now in this corner, now in that corner, and prayed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theyr knees, with theyr hands holden vp, as though Chriſt, and the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> had beene there indeed. Whereas I doe faithfully avow it, that I neuer ſaw any ſuch ſights, but did therein <hi>frame my ſelfe</hi> to doe as I had heard by the prieſts and others, that <hi>Sara Williams,</hi> and the reſt had done before mee. And I doe belieue that Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> himſelfe knew as much, and that hee did but ſeeme to worſhip, (as is before expreſſed) thereby to induce the reſt of the company ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth that Ma. <hi>Edmunds</hi> hath written a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of about a quire of paper, of all my ſaid preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded traunces and viſions, and it may be likewiſe of all the reſt of the proceedings held with me, eyther by him ſelfe, or the reſt of the prieſts: if euer that booke come to further light, ſo as any in authority doe take notice of it, I will be ready (if I be called thereunto) to giue my aunſwere truly to all the particulers, ſo farre foorth as I ſhall remember In the meane time, as touching all my pretended viſions in generall, (of my ſufferings in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and the reſt) they were all feigned by mee, to pleaſe Fa: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and it may be to gaine to my ſelfe a little fooliſh commendation, or admiration, becauſe I ſaw how the Catholiques that heard of them, and were preſent at many of my fond ſpeeches, did ſeeme to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at me.</p>
                  <p>VVhen <hi>Good-friday</hi> came, there was great reſort to the ſaid houſe where I was: and of my bahauiour that day, a prieſt (I perceiue) hath written at large. Of my ſelfe I ſhould haue remembred little that did happen at that time, but beeing vrged to aunſwer ſomething to that which is written of me, I will firſt ſet downe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors owne words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lying</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that day vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his bed, he made (as it were)
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21637:144"/>
a ſolemne exhortation, and telling the Catholiques preſent, that his houre was now come, hee willed them to continue constant in their profeſſion, ſaying that they were yet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the brunt of many perſecutions, howbeit, they that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered vnto the end, ſhould be ſaued: and ſo falling from his exhortations vnto prayer, he deſired all the company to pray with him: whereupon hee began to recite the</hi> Letanie, <hi>and they that were preſent, followed in aunſwering of him, euery perſon preſent beeing mooued to great deuotion. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing for a while, he then ſeemed to fall into a ſlumber, and after that into a traunce, which indured aboue two houres: ſo as many that were preſent, did verily belieue he would neuer haue awaked againe, but in the ſame haue giuen vp the ghost. At the last, of himſelfe hee did awake, fetching a great ſigh, and a groane, and then vſed theſe words:</hi> My time is not yet come: our bleſſed Lady hath appeared vnto me, and told mee that I muſt liue longer yet: for that God hath reſerued me for a further purpoſe to doe more good, and to tell of ſtrange wonders. <hi>With that there began to be a great muttering among the company, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greatly meruailing what this ſhould meane. Whereuppon Fa:</hi> Edmunds <hi>made an exhortation to thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and told them, that he thought it conuenient to prolong the time no longer, but to fall to exorciſing of him, whereby they ſhould perceiue, whether all were true that hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vnto them, or whether it had beene the enemy that ſought to delude them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre the prieſt, whoſe report (I thinke) is true in ſubſtance, though peraduenture he may erre in ſome circumſtance: but my memory is not ſo good, as that I am able to controll him in any particuler, and therefore I wil let it paſſe as it goeth. The fault is not mine, that theſe things are thus publiſhed. What moued me to pretend that I ſhould die vpon <hi>Good Friday,</hi> I cannot ſet downe directly: but ſure I am the deuiſe was boyiſh, and fooliſh, and very ſutable (as I thinke) to the reſt of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21637:144"/>
my proceedings, being greatly beſotted by them, as may appeare by my whole courſe, and by their dealings with me. As farre as I can geſſe my ſimple drift therein was, that when it ſhould be apparant, that I had lyed vnto them, they would for ſhame haue then diſmiſſed me from them: for there was nothing in the world that I deſired more. But I found I was deceaued in my ſimple plot, &amp; doe now perceaue by the ſaid prieſts words, that Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> was prouided, how to ſalue the matter, if the worſt fell out. God knoweth whether he ſuppoſed, that I would haue taken ſome courſe, to haue ſhortned mine owne time againſt that day, as conſtrained in ſome ſort there-vnto by the great weakenes, and indeede wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of my life, where-vnto he, and the reſt had brought me: but I wil iudge the beſt. This onely I perceaue, that when he found my ſimple plot, he was ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate to the Catholiques preſent, that out of doubt the report that I made of my death, was but an illuſion of Sathan; and this muſt be made manifeſt out of hand by an Exorciſme: for as the ſaid prieſt hath in writing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (although I my ſelfe had forgotten it) being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine exorciſed in the preſence of all the company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they departed I ſhewed no ſignes of any diſtemper, but rather of great deuotion, and piety: wherby Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> collected, that out of all queſtion it was Sathan in me that ſaid I ſhould die vpon <hi>Good Friday,</hi> and ſo the company departed very well ſatisfied. If he had giuen me at that time his holy potion, and perfumed my noſe with brimſtone, <hi>Aſſa faetida,</hi> and I know not what other vile ſmell (as before he had done) I ſhould not ſurely haue beene ſo quiet: but he had another drift, as wel it appeareth.</p>
                  <p>From the ſaid <hi>Good-friday,</hi> for ought I remember, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the three, and twentith of April (which was then S. <hi>Georges</hi> day) Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> ſuffered me to be quiet, I thinke now to gather ſome ſtrength, and imagined then
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21637:145"/>
that he would neuer haue troubled me further. But it fell out that a day or two before Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day (as it ſhould ſeeme) that I had againe a fit of the <hi>Mother,</hi> where-vpon they tooke occaſion to haue me in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againe, for as they ſaid <hi>Modu</hi> the Prince of deuils was yet in me: and now they pretended (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to do the beſt they could to caſt him out of me, that ſo I might be rid for altogether.</p>
                  <p>Ma: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and the reſt dealt with me at this time very extreamely, and I muſt confeſſe that in hope to be now diſpatched, I bent my ſelfe (as farre as poſſibly I could) to faine, and affirme euery thing that I percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued they expected at my hands. But what I then did or ſaid, if I ſhould haue beene tortured vpon the rack (had I not ſeene what was publiſhed in writing of me at that time) I could not now haue remembred ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers. After that Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> had exorciſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed me (as often-times he had done before) the deuil that had lyen ſecret long in me (as the writing ſaith) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appeare. But I wil ſet downe the effect of the ſaid prieſts reports as touching this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By commaundement of the Exorcist</hi> (which was Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi>) <hi>the deuill in Ma:</hi> Mainy <hi>confeſſed his name to be</hi> Modu, <hi>and that he had beſides himſelfe ſeauen other ſpirits, all of them Captaines, and of the great fame. There-vpon Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>commaunded that euery one of the ſeauen ſhould come vp in their degrees one after another, and to declare his name by his principall quality. Then Ma:</hi> Mainy <hi>by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the first of the ſeauen, began to ſet his hands vnto his ſide, curled his haire, and vſed ſuch gestures, as Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>preſently affirmed, that that ſpirit was</hi> Pride. <hi>Heere-with he began to curſe, and banne, ſaying:</hi> What a poxe doe I heere? I wil ſtay no longer amongſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of raſcall Prieſts, but goe to the Court, and braue it amongſt my fellowes, the noble men there aſſembled. <hi>And then after Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>had ſaid, that hee ſhewed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:21637:145"/>
himſelfe thereby to be the ſpirit of</hi> Pride: <hi>he went downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and Ma:</hi> Mainy <hi>became very quiet, and fell to his prayers. But Ma:</hi> Mainy <hi>could not tell one word (as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) of any thing that had beene then ſaid, onely he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he had all the while felt a great paine in his body. Then Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>did proceede againe with his Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, and ſuddainly the ſences of</hi> Mainy <hi>were taken from him, his belly began to ſwell, and his eyes to ſtare, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly cryed out,</hi> ten pounds in the hundred, <hi>he called for a Scriuener to make a bond, ſwearing</hi> that hee would not lend his money without a pawne. <hi>Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of that deuill, whether he were the ſame that had ſpoken before, he ſaid no. But yet affirmed, that hee was a good fellow, and a companion of his, and one that bare as great rule in England as any other deuill. There could be no other talke had of this ſpirit, but of mony, bargaining, and vſury: ſo as all the company deemed this deuill to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of</hi> Couetouſneſſe, <hi>not expecting any instruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from Fa:</hi> Edmunds. <hi>After a while this deuill goeth downe as the other did. Ma.</hi> Mainy <hi>recouereth his ſences, falleth to his prayers, and ere long Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe his Exorciſmes, wherein hee had not proceeded farre, but vp commeth another ſpirit, ſinging most filthy and baudy ſongs: euery word almost that hee ſpake, was nothing but ribaldry. They that were preſent, with one voyce affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that deuill to be the author of</hi> Luxury. <hi>And Ma.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munds <hi>beeing not able to endure ſuch lewd ſpeeches, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to be ſilent, and to get him downe forthwith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The deuill obeyed: Ma.</hi> Mainy <hi>recouereth, falleth to his prayers, and afterwards Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>goeth forward with the rest. And thus he did proceed, till he had raiſed vp all the ſeauen Captaines, and compelled them to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as the other had doone.</hi> Enuy <hi>was deſcribed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull lookes, and contemptuous ſpeeches.</hi> Wrath <hi>by furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gestures, and talke as though hee would haue fought.</hi> Gluttony <hi>by vomiting: and</hi> Sloth <hi>by gaping and ſnorting,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:21637:146"/>
as if hee had beene a ſleepe. Ma.</hi> Mainy <hi>at euery time reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering his ſences, and falling to prayer as he had done before. After theſe ſeauen deuils had thus ſhewed themſelues, and were againe at rest in Ma.</hi> Mainy, <hi>it ſeemed good to Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>to try what he could doe with</hi> Modu <hi>their prince and Captaine. He beginneth againe his exorciſmes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame, till after a while the ſaid</hi> Modu <hi>roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and asked Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>how hee liked his</hi> 7. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, who had appeared one after another? And furthermore hee fell a curſing, and ſaid:</hi> A pox on you all for popiſh prieſts. My fellowes the proteſtants can make very much of my ſaid Brethren, &amp; giue them good entertainment, bidding them welcome whenſoe-they come: but you ſcuruy prieſts can neither abide them your ſelues, nor ſuffer them to be quiet whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you are conuerſant. <hi>Heereunto Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they would be enemies both to him, and them all during their liues. And commaunded both him, and the rest of his companions for to depart out of Ma.</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>vrging them with ſuch ſeuerall adiurations, as are ſee downe to that purpoſe in the booke of Exorciſmes. Whilst he was thus proceeding with him, he required</hi> Modu <hi>by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Prieſthood, and power left by Christ in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Romane Church, to tell him truly concerning theſe viſions that appeared vnto</hi> Mainy: <hi>with that the deuill in</hi> Mainy <hi>fell out into a great laughter, ſaying that</hi> it had doone him very much good, that he had cooſened ſo many prieſts, and made all the company for to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: For (ſaith hee) all that time that you and the reſt ſeemed to pray vnto Chriſt, and vnto <hi>Saffronbag,</hi> it was I, and all my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany that you worſhipped. <hi>Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>beeing greatly mooued, defied him, &amp; ſaid that they had no intention of worſhipping him: and that if any wee ſo deceiued, it was of ignorance, and that his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be the greater for ſo intolerable an illuſion. Then Ma.</hi> Edmunds <hi>began againe his exorciſmes with
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21637:146"/>
great earnestnes, and all the company cried out vpon God, the bleſſed virgin, S.</hi> George, <hi>and all the company of heauen to helpe, and ſuccour them in that holy action, ſo as both that wicked Prince</hi> Modu, <hi>and all his company might be cast out of Ma:</hi> Mainy. <hi>And accordingly God heard their prayers, for ſhortly after they were all cast forth, and that in ſuch ſort as Ma:</hi> Edmunds <hi>directed them: which was, that euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſhould depart in ſome certaine forme, repreſenting either a beast, or ſome other creature, that had reſemblance of that ſinne, whereof he was the chiefe Author. Where-vpon the ſpirit of</hi> Pride <hi>departed in the forme of a</hi> Peacock. <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of</hi> Sloth <hi>in the likenes of an</hi> Aſſe: <hi>the ſpirit of</hi> Enuie <hi>in the ſimilitude of a</hi> Dog: <hi>the ſpirit of</hi> Gluttony <hi>in the forme of a</hi> Wolfe: <hi>and the other deuils had alſo in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture their particuler likeneſſes agreeable to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hetherto the Author of the ſaid Treatiſe, though in ſome more words, yet to this effect. Concerning the which report, the world muſt needes beare me witnes, if euer it come to their publique view, that I haue great cauſe to blame them, for making of theſe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which were wrought by themſelues in priuate, ſo much to my diſcredite. My charity ſhall deſerue very great commendations as I thinke, if I doe not hereafter ſeeke to be reuenged, both vpon Ma: <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and the reſt, that haue thus dealt with me. But to the matter it ſelfe as I am required. It is very likely that vpon Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day here mentioned, I railed againſt the prieſts, and ſpake of the Court, as that time gaue occaſion. But I doe verily thinke that I vſed the ſaid ſpeeches, as being led vnto them by ſome words vttered eyther by the prieſts, or by ſome in the company, and that they had ſome farther drift then I doe know of, in appoynting that day for their dealings with me.</p>
                  <p>And touching my deſcribing of the ſaid ſeauen deuils by ſignes, and geſtures, ſignifying the ſeauen deadly

ſinnes. I doe wel remember that I vſed ſome ſuch like geſtures to that end, but I am perſwaded that they are heere ſet downe in farre better ſort then I did act them, as their vſuall manner was in reporting of any thing that was done eyther by me, or any of the reſt. They would make a faire tale of any thing, though it were neuer ſo ſimple, that any of vs did or ſaid. But for mine owne part, how I ſhould be able to deſcribe the ſaid ſinnes, though it were neuer ſo ſimple, I cannot directly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. This onely I think, and am perſwaded in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that what I did therein, I was eyther led vnto it by ſome of the Prieſts <hi>instructing questions,</hi> or elſe I had beene told before, that others in my caſe had deſcribed ſuch deuils by ſuch geſtures, that did ſignifie ſuch, and ſuch ſinnes. For being not then fully xvij. yeeres of age, as I take it, I doe not thinke that any ſuch things would euer haue come into my head, if I had not beene cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth ſtrange vnto me, when I remember diuers things concerning theſe matters, as I may ſay of my ſelf, ſo I haue beene informed concerning the reſt, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had beene, or were then in my caſe. Wee were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffered to be quiet: few nights eſcaped, but either Miſtris <hi>Peckham</hi> when ſhe was preſent, or Miſtris <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or ſome other of the women, where we remained, would be with vs, eyther to bring vs newes ſeuerally, what each of vs had done or ſaid apart, when we were exorciſed the day before: or elſe to tell vs ſtrange tales, which they ſaid they had heard of ſome of the prieſts, concerning diuers things which had beene done, and ſpoken by ſuch, as had beene poſſeſſed in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: whether they did thus by the direction of the prieſts or no, I cannot tell, but I verily beleeue, that wee all of vs learned thereby to doe many things, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhould neuer haue thought of. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I learned from them the skill I had to doe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21637:147"/>
before mentioned, I know not, it may be I did.</p>
                  <p>And as I aunſwer to this point, ſo doe I vnto that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as touching the deuils ſuppoſed ſimilitudes in their pretended departing out of me. Eyther it is altogether falſe, and deuiſed by themſelues, or elſe they led me to ſay ſo by their queſtions. As if they asked me, whether <hi>Pride</hi> did not depart from me in the likeneſſe of a <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock,</hi> it is very probable that I ſaid he did. And ſo of all the reſt, or otherwiſe they told ſome in my hearing, that ſuch deuils did vſe to depart from ſuch, as they poſſeſſed in ſuch kinde of formes: I pray God forgiue them for all their bad dealings with me. My chiefe comfort is, that as I ſaid in the beginning, I am fully perſwaded that I was neuer poſſeſſed, and that all I did or ſpake, I did it, and ſpake it my ſelfe, being ſometimes enforced, and ſometimes induced ſo to doe, as before I haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And alſo that the moſt of thoſe things which are written of me, are eyther vtterly falſe, or greatly altered in the telling. And that the prieſts themſelues that dealt with me, are of right to beare the blame for that which eyther I or any of the reſt ſaid or did, that might giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iuſt cauſe of offence, eyther to her Maieſtie, or the ſtate heere in England.</p>
                  <p>Vpon my ſpeeches before mentioned to the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> the prieſts, and others, eſpecially thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour Ma: <hi>Edmunds</hi> as I thinke, did giue it out that I was ſtill poſſeſſed. And I doubt not but if at any time they vnderſtand of this my confeſſion, it wil be ſaid that now I haue many deuils in me. I had forgotten to ſet downe how I haue had a long time an ache in one of my knees, which I thinke I got whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was a child by a cold, &amp; how when I told the prieſts of it firſt, they vſed that for one argument to proue that I was poſſeſſed: ſaying, that it was very likely that the deuil kept about that place. Alſo I feare I ſhall be troubled with my old diſeaſe as I haue before ſaid. So as if they ſhall determine to hold on ſo
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21637:148"/>
wicked a courſe, they are like to haue the ſame cauſes to ſay that I am ſtill poſſeſſed, that they had before. But I hope they wil not dare to preſume to haue any further dealing with me, and that God will deliuer me from them. And this is all I can ſay to all ſuch points, and matters as haue beene propounded vnto me.</p>
