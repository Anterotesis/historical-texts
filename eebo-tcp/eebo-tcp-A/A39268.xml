            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>MUch of the Wisdom of the ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens hath been conveyed to after Ages in <hi>Proverbs.</hi> And these were in so high esteem with the learned'st of them, that even their gravest <hi>Philosophers</hi> thought them some strength to their Arguments, and their most Eloquent <hi>Orators</hi> no little ornament to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65540:4"/>
popular harangues: yea, in so great Veneration were they had with the generality of Mankind, that they thought fit to father them on their Gods themselves, and to signifie this, caused them to be written over the doors of their Idol-Temples, to the end that they might be the more universally learnt, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously reguarded by men. What a price then may we justly set on these <hi>Proverbs of Solomon,</hi> whose rare <hi>Wisdom</hi> for its singular eminency is its self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proverbial? If their <hi>Antiquity</hi> may serve to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their value, they are above four hundred years older than those which derive from the so much famed <hi>Wise Men</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> If their <hi>Form</hi> be regardable, they are short, close and pithy Sentences, comprizing a great deal of most sacred truth and necessary instruction in the fewest words, apt by the acuteness and smartness of the expression to imprint the sense more deeply in the Mind, and both by that and also their conciseness and brevity, mightily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friending the Memory. Like the most precious <hi>Iewel's,</hi> they are neither great nor burdensome, easily portable and of inestimable worth. Or like <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirits,</hi> the least drop whereof is of a very diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Vertue and strong Operation, such is their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal use, that we cannot miss amongst them the most excellent Rules of Duty both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> suited to all Relations in <hi>Family</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to all conditions of <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> to both <hi>Sexes</hi> and all <hi>Ages. Lastly,</hi> they are truely such, as deserve, not only to be written in Golden Letters on the Walls of our <hi>Churches,</hi> but to be indelibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved on the Tables of our Hearts, as the Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Living God,</hi> teaching us that only true <hi>Wisdom that is from above,</hi> which as St. <hi>Iames</hi> telleth us, is <hi>first pure, then peaceable,</hi> Jam. 3, 17. Even that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65540:4"/>
                  <hi>Wisdom</hi> whereby we are taught (as here in the <hi>Text)</hi> to attend to <hi>God's Counsel</hi> and to lay aside our own <hi>devices;</hi> the best way of honouring our <hi>Father</hi> which is in Heaven, and maintaining Peace among our selves who are <hi>Brethren</hi> upon Earth.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Proverb</hi> is made up of two <hi>Propositions,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or severed rather) with this adversative Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>nevertheless,</hi> signifying unto us thus much, that tho the former of these two Propositions contain a certain truth which well deserveth our serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, yet the consideration hereof will do us no good, but only increase our trouble, by discovering unto us our weakness and folly, if we do not firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, and finally acquiesce in that much more weighty truth which is taught us in the latter. This we shall the better understand by observing, <hi>First,</hi> The two <hi>Subjects</hi> of these two Propositions; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> What things are affirmed of these two Subjects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The two <hi>Subjects</hi> are, in the former Proposition <hi>Man,</hi> in the latter, the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Subject of the former is <hi>Man,</hi> a poor, weak, mortal creature, groaning out a few trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some dayes on Earth, under the afflicting sense of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and wants; hastening every moment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Death and Corruption. Who cannot well tell himself what he is, or whence he came, or whither he must go: and who knows himself by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so well, as by a feeling of his own manifold imperfections. He is the work of another, in the hands and at the sole disposal of another, on whom he totally depends for his life, motion and being. The History of his Life and Death <hi>Iob</hi> hath left us in a few words, <hi>Iob. 14. 1, 2. Man that is born of a Woman is of few dayes, and full of trouble. He cometh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65540:5"/>
up like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not.</hi> Would we know the very best of him that is to be known? This is it, <hi>Verily, every man at his best state is altogether vanity.</hi> Psal. 39. 5. How vain must be the devices of his heart, who is himself at best but vanity?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Subject</hi> of the second Proposition is <hi>the Lord;</hi> the most Great and Incomprehensible Glorious <hi>God,</hi> the Eternal and Inexhaustible Spring of <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Blessedness;</hi> the Independent, Self-sufficient, infinitely <hi>great, wise,</hi> and <hi>good Creator, Preserver,</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> of us and all the World: without whom nothing ever was, is or can be; <hi>In whom we live and move and have our being,</hi> Act. 17, 28. <hi>Who giveth to all, Life and Breath and all things,</hi> V. 25. The unexpressible, unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>I AM that I AM,</hi> Exod. 3, 14. <hi>The</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the beginning and the end,</hi> Rev. 21, 6. <hi>All in All,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 28. <hi>Above all, through all, and in all,</hi> Eph. 4. 6. <hi>Of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things: to whom be glory for ever.</hi> Amen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing now these two are of such widely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant natures, we must needs expect that very different things should be affirmed of them, as here indeed we find.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Man</hi> it is said, that <hi>there are devices in his heart.</hi> He is always full of Thoughts and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Considerations and Consultations, Projects, Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Contrivances; thinking what may be, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing what he would have to be, studying how to effect it: as one that is yet at a loss and unresolved, and knows not well what to do with himself, or for himself. He is not what he would be, nor where he would be, nor as he would be; and thinks much with himself, how to mend himself; but knows not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65540:5"/>
which way is best to go about it. His thoughts are very often nothing else but the wild and extravagant roavings of a rambling <hi>Phantasie,</hi> and at best but the uncertain and unsatisfactory reasonings of a very dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted and fallible <hi>Iudgment.</hi> But on the other hand, vastly opposite to these devices, here is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Lords Counsel,</hi> the certain result and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of an infinite and infallible <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Man</hi> is again said, That the devices of his heart are <hi>many,</hi> signifying not only their number or multitude, but also their great variety and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are numerous and multiform, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; seldom the same an hour together, rarely well digested or methodized, hardly ever unblended, but a very Miscellany of he knows not what. Many things a man thinks upon, many thoughts he hath of every one of those many things, and all these often very tumultuously clashing against and justling out one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. He thinks, and is vexed <hi>at</hi> his own thoughts and <hi>with</hi> them; he deviseth, and unravelleth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own devices; he deliberates and disputes, as he now thinks very wisely with himself; and in a moment is grown too wise for himself, calls himself fool, answereth and confuteth all his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet can draw to no Conclusion. He concludes, resolves, chooses, and applauds his own choice; saith to himself, well and wisely done; yet immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately undoeth all again, and he counteth it his wisdom to break his resolution. But in opposition to all this in man, of the <hi>Lord</hi> it is here implyed, that his Will and <hi>Counsel</hi> is but <hi>one</hi> and certain, like <hi>himself,</hi> the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, stable, fixed and immutable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Man</hi> (tho it be not expresly said in words) it is to make good the <hi>Antithesis,</hi> necessarily implyed,

that all his devices are <hi>ineffectual,</hi> or very rarely effect and bring to pass the thing that he would have; at least of themselves they cannot do it, but are vain. In this sense it will be truely said, <hi>Man walketh in a vain shew, surely they are disquieted in vain,</hi> Psal. 39, 6. After much and busie contriving, after great, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous and tedious studying, nothing is got, the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is delivered of a Mouse, disappointment and vexation is the issue of his Travels. As his playsom <hi>Phantasy</hi> in a <hi>Dream</hi> is always wantonly frisking and skipping from one thing to another, and in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination hath every thing to the full that it would have, feasts it self with its own sportings, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: yet anon the man awakes and is empty, finds that all was nothing but a foolish dream, and either he is vexed at his imaginary loss, or laughs at his own folly: so the <hi>devices of mans heart,</hi> seem they never so wise and sure, are usually all frustrated in a moment; and it is well, if they leave so much good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to pay for all, as a true and humbling sense of the devisers folly. But now of the <hi>Lord,</hi> it is expresly said that his <hi>Counsel shall stand,</hi> it is always to the purpose, and never misseth of effecting what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, but shall be fully accomplished. <hi>The remnant of</hi> Judah <hi>shall know whose word shall stand</hi> (or be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled) <hi>mine or theirs.</hi> Jer. 4, 4. 28. <hi>My word shall surely stand against you for evil,</hi> v. 29. 12. The evil that I have determined and foretold you of, shall surely come upon you. This is it, for <hi>God's Counsel to stand.</hi> Be the devices of mans heart never so many, and ordered with all the wisdom, policy and strength, that humane nature is capable of, whatsoever confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Authors of such devices may have in their own wit and prudence, <hi>nevertheless the Counsel of the Lord</hi> shall still take place of all, and shall <hi>stand</hi> in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65540:6"/>
spite of all, when they have done both their best and worst. And though what men design may come to pass; even then, when they are become Masters of their wishes, and are apt on that account to glory in their wisdom, yet doth it not alwayes follow their devices, as the effect doth the proper cause of it, but by the disposal of the Divine Counsel, for <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> alone standeth and <hi>shall stand,</hi> and can never be defeated.</p>
               <p>The plain sense and meaning of this <hi>Proverb</hi> being thus laid open before us, we may very easily discern the scope and drift of it to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> To make us sensible of the folly and vanity of mens arrogance, in setting up for themselves in the world, without a due regard to the all-disposing <hi>providence</hi> of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>God;</hi> in going about to make their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by their own skill and industry, without a due respect to the <hi>Will</hi> and directions of the universal <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> of the World. That being convinced hereof, we may not trust to, or depend upon the wisdom of men, whether of our selves or other men, how much soever they pretend, or are thought to be the great Masters of State-policy; but submitting our selves intirely to the Will and <hi>Counsel</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> we may be solely directed by it, totally relye upon it, and heartily acquiesce in it: verily believing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, that all the world is governed by it; and that therefore all the Affairs thereof are by it most wisely ordered, so as shall in the end appear to have been most for his own honour, and the eternal good of those that faithfully serve him. This is a <hi>Lesson</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> it self teacheth us, and all men are forced to acknowledg the truth of it, when they are at leisure to attend to reason. <hi>Man purposeth, but God disposeth,</hi> hath been long a common Proverb in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65540:7"/>
the world. <hi>The Lot, (saith</hi> Solomon) <hi>is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</hi> Prov. 16, 33. He doth not only foresee, but wisely order the things and events which to us seem most casual. Yea, so effectually doth he order them, that it would be labour lost, for all the men in the world, to undertake the ordering of them otherwise. <hi>There is no Wisdom, nor Understanding, nor Counsel against the Lord. The Horse is prepared against the day of battle, but safety is of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>This is a very seasonable Lesson for all men to learn in this Projecting, Plotting, and Designing Age, and part of the world wherein we live. Now that men seem grown up to that prodigious insolence and pride, as to quarrel with even <hi>God</hi> himself about his Government, to find faults in his works; every one would fain seem wise enough to be the modeller of a better form of <hi>Government</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> then the wisdom of former Ages hath been acquainted with; and nothing will satisfie men but a world of their own making, and the reputation of some new invention, tho it be a <hi>Babel</hi> of confusion. Indeed men that would seem wise above their neighbours, go alwayes big with some <hi>new nothing,</hi> and are very ambitiously bent upon undoing what hath been done; their chief faculty lyeth in destroying and demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Monuments of ancient wisdom, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may remain in the eye of Posterity, but mere rubbish. And who then will not be proud of any thing, when they know of nothing better? It hath been for many years too visible that our new <hi>devisers</hi> seem agreed in nothing more than in contriving mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and ruine, and like <hi>Samson</hi>'s Foxes, tho their faces look to contrary quarters of the World, yet they joyn together by the tails, and therein carry
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65540:7"/>
Firebrands to burn down the standing Corn and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of <hi>God.</hi> And such will be the mischievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of mans heart, whilst it is not wholly subjected to the Counsel of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to the particular doctrines of the Text, we must inquire a little into the extent of this word <hi>Man,</hi> as it is here used. And we need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it to any particular sort, sect or party of men; it may very well be allow'd to signifie the whole race of Mankind: tho more especially, the wicked or unregenerate part, who are not yet either so throughly illuminated by the light of the <hi>Gospel</hi> as to see, or so throughly sanctified by the grace of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to choose the <hi>Lord</hi> for their <hi>God: that is,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>him</hi> not the only <hi>Good,</hi> which they ought to propound unto themselves in all their designs, and who make not his <hi>Will</hi> the only rule of all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and practices, the only foundation of all their hope and comfort.</p>
               <p>It is too true indeed, that there is no man living, but hath too many devices of his own corrupt heart in this state of imperfection. For, tho <hi>God made man upright,</hi> Eccl. 7, 29. And the very fabrick of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so contrary to that of other Animals, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crawl upon the earth, or go always looking down towards it, should be his constant remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, that he was made to contemplate something higher, than what they are concerned to know; that his soul should be always aspiring towards Heaven, and his eye should be ever fixed upon his <hi>God,</hi> and all his motions should be govern'd by his Will and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> that <hi>sitteth in the Heavens and shall laugh,</hi> (Psal. 2, 4.) <hi>and have all the Heathen in derision,</hi> Psal. 59. 8. Yet alas, sin hath strangely bowed man down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and made him too like in many things to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65540:8"/>
Beasts that perish. And although it be the work of <hi>grace</hi> to raise him up again, and restore his Primitive posture of soul; yet will not this great work be done completely, so long as he is but growing here on earth; he will be always sucking into himself too much of what is earthy, and death must first transplant him into a better soil, before he can be altogether <hi>heavenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the unregenerate man abiding in the same posture whereunto by his fall from <hi>God</hi> he was brought; and in a state of separation from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; not being yet <hi>born again</hi> of the <hi>holy spirit</hi> of life and the <hi>incorruptible seed,</hi> nor ingrassed into the true <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>second man from heaven heavenly,</hi> and thereby reunited unto <hi>God</hi> the true principle of <hi>Unity,</hi> is evermore at variance with himself, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his thoughts within him, distracted into a confused Multitude of designs, by the great variety of contrary Objects pulling and hailing him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wayes unto themselves; so that he can never stand fixed in one point, or any long time together go the same way. His heart and mind within him is become the very seat of tumult and confusion; there is nothing but mere <hi>Ataxy</hi> and <hi>Anarchy;</hi> right reason being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned, and spoiled of all authority, and his thoughts within him, like a Seditious Rabble without any Head or Commander to order and overaw them, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual noise and hurry; and, as was said of that Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Multitude, (Act. 19. 32.) <hi>The more part know not wherefore they are come together.</hi> Something they would have of those many things whereof they find a want; but what it is, they cannot tell; and yet by any means they must and will have it, or else they will not be quieted; but they know neither where, nor how, nor of whom to seek it. Now how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65540:8"/>
for peace and due subjection to Government to be preserved in <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> so long as men are not able to make peace at home in their own hearts, nor know how to command or quiet their own thoughts and disorderly affections, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by their own devices raising and fomenting an endless <hi>Civil War</hi> in their own Breasts; down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Rebels to themselves, and Enemies to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> that <hi>God</hi> himself hath founded in man?</p>
               <p>Having thus seen what we are to understand by <hi>man,</hi> these four things we may now learn from the Text.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The heart of man, till it be rightly fixed on <hi>God,</hi> is a very unconstant thing, unsettled in its thoughts, full of various devices and Counsels.</item>
                  <item>2. The Devices and Counsels of mans heart, till they concentre in the Will and Counsel of God, are very vain, and cannot stand.</item>
                  <item>3. The Will and Counsel of God is alwayes one and the same, and never changeth.</item>
                  <item>4. Whatever the devices and projects of man may be, they can never alter or frustrate the Will and Counsel of the Lord.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us but have our faith well confirmed in these four things, and we shall soon see and feel the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent usefulness of them, not only for the quieting of our souls in a contented and joyful acquiescence in <hi>God's</hi> wise Government of the world; but also for the establishing of a blessed and lasting <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> in a due subjection unto, and well pleasedness with the present Government, under which by the good providence of <hi>God</hi> it is our lot to live.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65540:9"/>
I. <hi>The heart of man, unfixed on God the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and satisfactory good, is a very unconstant thing, altogether unsettled in its own thoughts, full of various devices and changeable Counsels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man is a thinking creature, and his thoughts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes busie within him, whether he will or no. And till he can come to the knowledge, and be taken with the beauty of that <hi>one</hi> most perfect and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Object, the innumerable Excellencies whereof, may wholly engage all his more noble faculties, and find them sufficient imployment, is thoughts will ever be ranging about the World, and wildly wander up and down from one thing to another, hoping to meet in every thing with something that he wants; but finding it in nothing, they cannot rest on any thing. Hence they are as vain and various, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant and changeable, as the things about which they busie themselves are empty and transient. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we consider the <hi>end</hi> men aim at, or the way they chuse to bring them to it, this is very evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider we first the <hi>end</hi> that all men aim at, the thing which they ultimately desire, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name and general notion whereof they are all agreed. This is <hi>happiness,</hi> and it is no less than the full and final satisfaction of mans soul, the enjoyment of his hearts desire. This is certainly the thing that all would have, and that without which man can never rest, and which all men, until they have the <hi>Lord</hi> for their <hi>God,</hi> do feel the want of in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and therefore concerning this the thoughts and devices of their hearts are many and various, and wonderfully confounded. For lack of heavenly light they cannot discover where it lyeth; missing it in what they already have, they flatter themselves with foolish hopes, that it may be found in any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65540:9"/>
thing, which they have not yet tried. The poor man finds it not in <hi>Poverty,</hi> and is apt to think it may be found in <hi>Wealth;</hi> and therefore are his thoughts always busie at work in devising how he may be <hi>rich.</hi> The <hi>rich</hi> man cannot meet with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst all his abundance, and sadly finds that no Treasure can be enough to purchase it; his thoughts are therefore hard at work to contrive some other way to get it; and perhaps is made to hope, it may be found in <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>greatness.</hi> Another that is mounted up to <hi>honour,</hi> begins to find his very height uneasie, and his greatness heavy, his station very slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and a fall both very possible and often mortal; and his thoughts are set on work to devise a way to <hi>retirement, ease,</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> The voluptuous <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> finds some sowr sawce with all his sweet morsels, something there alwayes is to imbitter his delights, and he cannot swill and glut himself so long and so undisturbedly as he would, but either he must be sick, or his fullness is uneasie. Thus the restless ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart of man wanders in the dark, and loseth it self in its own wandrings, and is made most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy by its own devices how to be happy. Whilst it is uncertainly led by blind affection, and wants the sure conduct of a divinely inlightened understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not able to discern that infinite <hi>Good,</hi> which offereth its self to its choice in every thing, the very thing it seeketh for becomes its stumbling Block in the way: the man falls and hurts himself against the very thing that he would have; he turns away in a chafe to something else, and still to as little purpose, and with as bad success. O the strange uneasiness of every condition to an heart that is void of God! Whatever it be that such a man hath, be sure it is not that very thing which he would have. That
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65540:10"/>
which is present is alwayes naught; and that which is not yet, is always better, till it be here; and when it is come, it is the worst of all. The ignorance of what is the only <hi>good</hi> keeps us alwayes miserable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all our long wish'd for and much endeavoured changes. Man is alwayes crying out, <hi>Who will shew us any good.</hi> Psal. 4. 6. Whilst the infinite <hi>good</hi> is before him every moment. He is ever complaining he cannot see it, but the fault is in his own eyes. The Sun shines, but he is blind. <hi>God, who is only good.</hi> Matt. 19. 17. is in all conditions present, but man will not be convinced that 'tis the <hi>light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> alone that can make him happy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But suppose we now, that men have already fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their thoughts not only upon <hi>happiness,</hi> but upon the only <hi>chief good</hi> that can make them happy, the <hi>Blessed God:</hi> yet will their thoughts continue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and various, and inconsistent with themselves, so long as they have not hit upon that only sure way of enjoying <hi>him,</hi> which himself hath taught us. How do they clash and combat within him, like the thoughts of a man lost in a Wilderness? Who, tho he know, and long to be at the place whither he aim'd to go, yet is utterly at a loss which way to take of the many that lie before him: he stands musing and thinking with himself, which is the most likely way to bring him home; now 'tis this, and anon 'tis that, and presently again 'tis neither; thus he stands dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting till the night overtake him, and even then his thoughts travel, and suffer not sleep to give him rest. O the vain projects of foolish man, so long as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 119. 24. <hi>the Laws of God his Delight and his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65540:10"/>
The ground of all this variety and confusion in the thoughts and <hi>devices</hi> of mans heart is very obvious. It is impossible it should be otherwise, so long as that, which he aimeth at, is certainly such as will deceive him; or whilest he walketh in doubtful paths with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sure guide. Man was not made to be his own <hi>God,</hi> nor was any creature made to be a <hi>God</hi> unto him, so that he should possibly find that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, or in any other created being, which may give him real satisfaction. If Man be not <hi>God,</hi> it is as certain he cannot make his own <hi>happiness.</hi> Nay, man is made such a creature, as can know and feel his own wants and weaknesses, and this is his <hi>Makers</hi> mercy to him, that he may not be always miserable by resting in himself; but being moved by the sence and feeling of his own emptiness and infirmity, may seek that out of himself in <hi>God,</hi> which he finds he cannot be well without. Till then a mans heart can fix upon that one thing which hath enough in it to satisfie all its desires, and get into that one way which will bring him to his desired happiness; his thoughts can have no rest, nothing wherein they may unite; But he is, as that <hi>double minded man</hi> St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of <hi>(Iam. 1. 8.) Unstable in all his ways.</hi> This is a thing too obvious to every understanding, to be any longer insisted on. We go on therefore to the next thing.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Devices and Counsels of a mans heart, till they concentre in the Will and Counsel of the Lord, are vain and cannot stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a truth which being duely considered, as it well deserveth, would certainly be enough to bring men out of love with their own devices, and make them weary and ashamed of their own <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> Who is there so foolish as to be willing to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65540:11"/>
disquiet his own soul, and cast away his peace for nothing? And this truth, <hi>That all such Devices and Counsels as concentre not in the Will of God are vain, and tend to no good issue, but shall end in disappointment and vexation,</hi> is so clear, that though men are very hardly brought to make the right use of it; yet is it impossible for them so long as they have any degree of reason above mere fools and children, to deny it. We shall at present consider but a few things to put this past all dispute. 1. <hi>What we are,</hi> and how little grounds of hope we can find in our selves. 2. <hi>What other men are,</hi> and what slender probability there is; that either by their help, or against their will we should effect our designs. 3. <hi>What God is,</hi> and how impossible it is to prevail against <hi>his</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us remember <hi>what we are.</hi> Consider but in our selves the greatness of our <hi>ignorance,</hi> and the weakness of our <hi>power,</hi> and we shall easily be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the vanity of our own <hi>devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our <hi>ignorance</hi> is such, how great soever is the opinion we have of our own wit and policy, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we do not know <hi>our selves</hi> perfectly, and much less our <hi>neighbours.</hi> And yet we must know both, before we can certainly say, that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> will fit either <hi>us</hi> or <hi>them.</hi> Our hearts are very <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> full of intricacies and windings, and he is a wise man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that understands all the little secret corners of his own heart so well, as to know exactly what will fit and fill them. Again the <hi>nature</hi> of things is too much in the dark as to us, we know but very little of it, and what we seek being yet untryed by us, we are very unfit to judge how suitable it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; or whether any of those things which we think we now most need, will fit us any better then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65540:11"/>
what we have already; yea, suppose the best, that the things which we so earnestly desire have something in them suitable to our wants and wishes, yet may they also have much more against us, and hurtful to us, which we cannot yet discern at a distance; but may feel afterwards to our sorrow. Yet more, so very changeable are both persons and things, that what seemeth to us the best to day, may seem as bad to morrow; and what now, if we had it, would real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be some ease to us, to morrow may prove as great a grievance: what might be now either Food or Physick, may to morrow by some corruption in it, or change of constitution in us, be very little better than Poyson, yea bodies <hi>politick</hi> change tempers as well as bodies <hi>natural;</hi> and those very <hi>Laws,</hi> which were with great wisdom at first enacted, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Medicines for curing the present diseases, have in a very few years after, upon this account, been found a worse disease then the other. Men are too short sighted to see what will be most suitable to another Age, or perhaps to any considerable part of the present. This our <hi>ignorance</hi> is therefore enough to teach us not to build any confident hopes on our own devices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But suppose our knowledge and skill were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as great, as usually is the <hi>Politicians</hi> self-conceit; yet must we needs confess, that our <hi>strength</hi> is very little, and how wisely soever we can devise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, we are too weak to bring about our own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This will appear more fully anon, tho indeed it is clear enough of it self. Who can be so mad as to think he can do what he lists, that he can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule providence, controll the World, and bring to pass all that he would have to be? All which he must suppose himself able to do, that can find cause
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65540:12"/>
in himself to hope he may accomplish the devices of his own heart. Considering then our selves only, all we can say is this, <hi>Vain man would be wise.</hi> Job. 11. 12. But he is not so; <hi>Mans goings are of the Lord, how can a man then understand his own way?</hi> Prov. 20. 24. Our eyes are too bad to see, our arms are too weak to work what is best for our selves or the World; no hope can we have in <hi>our selves</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore <hi>next,</hi> let us think <hi>what other men are.</hi> This consideration will make it appear a very improbable thing, for any one single man, or indeed, for any one <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> of men, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring about their own devices. Do we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these men to be our <hi>friends?</hi> Are they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our <hi>Complices</hi> or <hi>Partners?</hi> Or suppose we them our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and such as appear Adversaries to our designs? Or lastly, are they likly to sit <hi>Neuters?</hi> Which of these soever they be, they give us little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. This only we are sure of, they are <hi>men,</hi> and but men; they are therefore subject to the same infirmities as we our selves are; they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, they are mutable, they have peculiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests of their own, they are all subject to the same overruling Power: Are they in Appearance our <hi>friends?</hi> Who can know whether they be so indeed? Who knows whether they will prove firm and faithful to our Counsels? Are we sure that their hearts are as our hearts, that we may safely give them our hands and take them up into the secrets of our Bosomes? Whatever they be now, can we tell whether they will be the same to morrow? Can we tell what the temptations of one day, what the very fears and jealousies, covetous, or ambitious desires of their own hearts, yea what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65540:12"/>
the terrors of a nights dream may bring forth? He that dares too confidently trust his own heart is but a fool, how much more is he so, that dares trust anothers? If they joyn really with us now in our murmurings, discontents, and dislikes of that which is, are we sure that they joyn also as cordially in our desires and wishes, and that the future variance and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of minds about that which we would have shall not breed more confusion, and far greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences unto us all, then the very worst of those things we now concur to oppose and remove? Are these men our <hi>Enemies</hi> and such as are like to oppose our designs? And are we then sure that we are equal or superiour to them in strength? Or if we be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are we also as sure, that they are not our overmatch in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or interest? Have not they devices of their own as well as we? And are they not as much in love with their own devices as we can be with ours? And will they not venture as far to accomplish their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs? Have they not interests of their own? And shall they not be as zealous to promote them? As im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of all opposition to or attempts against them? Is the party we oppose but small and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable? And can we know how soon it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease either by the accession of others who will not shew themselves till necessity call them forth, or by the revolt of some other of our own? Or know we how many distinct parties there may be, whose designs are as inconsistent with ours as theirs are, and therefore rather then suffer either to prevail to the ruine of their own, are concerned to assist the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Lastly, are these men Neuters? Can we have any assurance that they will continue so when they are in a strait betwixt two, and are like to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by both or either? Are they not lovers of Peace,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65540:13"/>
upon what Principles it matters not? And shall they not be inclined even by that love, when they see they must side with one, to oppose the first disturbers of their Peace? Can we from mens faces or looks have any probable guess, with whom they will joyn when it comes to Tryal? Is is not most likely, it will be with their lawful Governors, under whom they have so long enjoyed their beloved Peace and Quietness? May not <hi>Egypt</hi> (if we have such a thing to trust to) prove a bruised Reed, and run into the hand of him that leans upon it? If we be but so wary as to look about us, we shall find too many of our own spirit; and because such, the less our friends. They are for themselves as well as we, are as ready to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the publick good to their own ambition. Their peculiar interests engage them as stronglyto oppose unto <hi>ours</hi> their <hi>own</hi> devices; and with as much fury and craft, from the same <hi>selfish</hi> principles, to endeavour our disappointment and defeat to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their own; and to hasten <hi>our</hi> ruine, as the first step to their <hi>own</hi> advancement. If again we look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, and observe the Histories of former Ages, we cannot miss of abundance of sad examples of rash and giddy Enterprisers miserably shipwrack'd by their own devices, caught deservedly in their own Nets, and fallen into the Pits they digged for others. If we providently look before us, we shall see but little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that the succeeding generation will applaud or approve of our doings; but rather fall upon new devices of their own to undo all that we have done, or rather to build what we have destroy'd. In a word, if we know not what's in man, <hi>God knows, that all his thoughts are vanity,</hi> Psal. 94. 11. So little probability have men of bringing to effect their own devices, when they consider <hi>what other men are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65540:13"/>
3. If mens devices have so little encouragement ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from themselves or other men, how much less can they have from <hi>God</hi> when they consider, <hi>what he is.</hi> viz. <hi>The just Iudge of all the earth that will do right,</hi> Gen. 18. 25. <hi>Tho hand joyn in hand, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall not go unpunished,</hi> Prov. 16. 5. Let them use all Arts to strengthen themselves in their <hi>Conspiracies, he that is higher then the highest regardeth, and will be higher than they,</hi> Eccl. 5. 8. Well said one who was no <hi>Saint, If this Counsel be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, take heed how ye oppose it, lest ye be found to fight against God,</hi> Act. 5. 39. What hopes can men have that their devices shall prosper without <hi>Gods</hi> Blessing, seeing <hi>not a Sparrow falls to the ground without him?</hi> And what confidence can men have that <hi>God</hi> will bless their devices, whilst they make not <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>im</hi> of their Counsel? If they advise not first with <hi>him</hi> to know <hi>his Will,</hi> before they begin to device for themselves, they take a preposterous course to engage him on their side; and be sure where ever he takes part, there goes the Victory. But if men will be so wicked, as to advance their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices against the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> they must needs make him their Enemy, whosoever being so makes it in vain for all the World to assist them; there is no fighting against <hi>Omnipotence.</hi> A Blasting instead of a Blessing must those men expect from our Heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> who, neglecting his commands, will presume of their own head to regulate his Family, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Kingdom by their own devices. As impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it is that such devices should stand, as it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and devest him of all Authority and Dominion, <hi>who hath established his Throne in the Heavens, and whose Kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Psal. 103. 19. Let men therefore consult, contrive, and act
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65540:14"/>
what they can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Let them associate themselves together, they shall be broken in pieces: let them gird themselves, they shall be yet broken in pieces; let them take Counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and it shall come to nought, speak the word, and it shall not stand,</hi> Isai. 8. 9. &amp;c. Let them either now consider it to move them to repentance, or they shall at last find it to their utter confusion, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the wisdom of their own devices, <hi>The Lord shall have them in derision,</hi> Psal. 2. 4. They shall be before him but <hi>like the Chaff which the wind driveth away,</hi> Psal. 1. 4. So impossible is it for the devices of mans heart to stand, when they are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in the Will of that God who ruleth Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>third</hi> thing we are now to observe is this. <hi>The Will and Counsel of the Lord is always one and the same and never changeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With God</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iames) there is no shadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. Whatever changes there be in the world amongst the creatures, it is impossible for the great <hi>Creator</hi> of all things to be any other then what he was from all Eternity. <hi>He will not lie, nor repent, for he is not a man that he should repent,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 29. This is a piece of humane weakness, to change purposes. If therefore at any time we read of <hi>Gods repenting</hi> or changing his purpose, as indeed sometimes we do in his own <hi>word,</hi> we must be sure so to understand it, as it may agree to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and not fasten upon him any of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of his creatures. It is said indeed of <hi>God,</hi> Gen. 6. 6. <hi>It repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</hi> And 1 Sam. 35. 23. <hi>The Lord repented that he had made</hi> Saul <hi>King over</hi> Israel. And concerning <hi>Nineveh</hi> it is said, Jonah 3. 10. <hi>God repented of that the evil he had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65540:14"/>
said that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>God</hi> is said to repent of what he had already done, as if he could wish it undone again; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of that which he had declared that he would do, as if, upon after thoughts, he had changed his mind. Now should we understand such sayings as these, as the words sound at first hearing, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the immutable nature of <hi>him,</hi> of whom they are spoken, we should thereby run our selves into one of the grossest and most wicked errors in the World, being tempted by such expressions, to fasten upon <hi>God</hi> an imputation of such <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>inconstancy</hi> to himself, as a wise man would account one of the greatest affronts we could offer him. But all this is indeed spoken of <hi>God, after the manner of men.</hi> The change that is, is not in <hi>God</hi> but in us. What <hi>God</hi> hath once done, he ever approves of; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he purposeth to do, that he certainly will do. Tho when we look only upon what is spoken and done, there is some appearance to us, as if there were some change of mind in the speaker or doer; yet is there no such thing. We hear what is said, and we see what is done: <hi>God</hi> hath threatned to destroy, yet he spareth: He hath done something, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he undoeth in some measure again. And hence he seemeth to us to repent of his sayings and doings, because he doth herein as men are wont to do, who repent and change their minds, and for this cause, by reason of this similitude of the doings of God &amp; men, are these expressions applyed to <hi>God.</hi> We are ignorant of the Will and Counsel of <hi>God,</hi> and can know no more of it, then he himself is pleased to discover unto us; he hath not discovered the whole of his Will unto us, but only so much as himself thinks fit for us to understand. Hence we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65540:15"/>
know but in part, and are very subject to mistake. To clear this, know we must that <hi>Gods Will</hi> being but <hi>one,</hi> is partly <hi>revealed</hi> to us in his word and works, and partly <hi>concealed</hi> from us, reserved only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>secret Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is not another from <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>revealed,</hi> as if there were two <hi>Wills</hi> in <hi>God;</hi> but both are <hi>one Will,</hi> whereof part is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, part is not; and both together are his <hi>one, eternal</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Purpose and <hi>Counsel.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> needed not, could not have any Counsellers to advise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, about what he was to do. <hi>With whom took he Counsel?</hi> Isai. 40. 14. So shall his <hi>Counsel</hi> alway <hi>stand,</hi> and without any alteration, be completely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. <hi>My Counsel (saith God) shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure,</hi> Isai. 46. 10. This part of <hi>Gods Will</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> being never imparted unto us, we cannot know it but only by the event; which when we see, whatever it is, we must conclude, that it was Gods unalterable Will, either to effect it himself, or to <hi>permit</hi> it to be so effected by others, infallibly fore-knowing it, and resolved not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods revealed Will</hi> is so much of his <hi>Counsel,</hi> as he hath thought fit to communicate, and by what means he pleaseth, make known unto us. Whereby he either acquainteth us with his own doings and purposes, or directeth us in our duty, and how we are to demean our selves in the world.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Will</hi> of his, which maketh our duty, shall <hi>stand</hi> as the Law and Rule of our duty: And that <hi>Will</hi> of his which declareth his purpose shall <hi>stand,</hi> as the firm foundation of our hope and expectation; both in that manner, as he from all eternity had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, whatever appearances of change and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65540:15"/>
there may be to inconsidering men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> is the sole and absolute <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of all the World: and the <hi>Law</hi> whereby he governeth all things can be no other, but his own <hi>Will</hi> and wise <hi>Counsel.</hi> Every thing he ordereth and ruleth agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the <hi>nature</hi> which himself hath given it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the <hi>end</hi> for which he made it. Why he made the World just so, and no otherwise then it is made, we are not worthy to inquire; nor can we know any further then he hath taught us; it was his <hi>Will</hi> so to do, and that ought to satisfie us. How he will order every thing in the World from <hi>first</hi> to <hi>last,</hi> he cannot be obliged to tell us; and it is too much for us to know: but that all shall tend to the demonstration of his own Power, Wisdom and Goodness, and the happiness of those that love and serve him, we are sure; and this again should fully satisfie us. <hi>Man</hi> he hath made a <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>free</hi> Agent, &amp; as such he is resolved to govern him. His <hi>Will, revealed</hi> is mans Law to live by, and by what parts and parcels soever, in what variety soever of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts according to the diversity of time and <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of persons, places, relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreseen by him; still his <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> and he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth it according to his own Eternal Counsel, with that variety of dispensations, as he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. His <hi>Commands</hi> it is his <hi>Will</hi> we should obey, <hi>and that</hi> according to our nature, freely; it is not his Will to necessitate us so to do, and to use us as Stocks and Stones which have neither Understanding to consider, nor Will to choose. And it is his <hi>Will</hi> that the obedient shall be rewarded with blessedness, and he encourageth them to obedience by many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which he will fulfil and make good to the full, if the condition of obedience be performed, and thus
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65540:16"/>
are all his promises of this kind to be understood. And he threatneth severe punishments to the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to deter them from their disobedience, and these shall certainly come upon them, if they repent not; and thus are his Menaces to be understood. In short, what changes there would at any time be in men, according to that <hi>freedom</hi> of choice which he hath given them, he knew eternally; and what changes would thereupon follow in the World, or in any part of it, he not only fore-knew, but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; and what reasons there would be for the delaying either of his promises, or his threatnings, or for any other change or circumstance, all was perfectly fore-known; and there can be nothing new to <hi>him;</hi> and therefore no <hi>change</hi> at all of his Eternal Counsel, but all things are exactly as he once for all hath determined.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>God</hi> is said at any time to repent, it signifieth no more but this, that the thing is come to pass which God foresaw, and that ho now doth not that, which he had always resolved to do, when such things should come to pass; here is a change indeed in his outward <hi>Actings,</hi> but none in his <hi>Will.</hi> When <hi>Gods promises</hi> are not performed, there is a a non-performance of the condition, which he was never ignorant of, but foresaw, and now he acteth no otherwise, than upon the foresight thereof, he had resolved to do. But we, because these things foreseen by God are not revealed to us, are apt to think there is a change where there is none at all.</p>
               <p>The reason why <hi>Gods Will</hi> is always <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same,</hi> is the infinite <hi>perfection</hi> of his Nature, which can admit of no degree of <hi>mutability.</hi> What can move a man to change his Mind or <hi>Will,</hi> but his find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65540:16"/>
or at least suspecting he hath taken wrong mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in his former deliberations and resolutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the rough want of foresight in men, that their purposes are alterable; and when things fall out, whereof they had no knowledge, they see cause to be of another mind then formerly they were. 'Tis always the discovery of something which they were ignorant of, or did not consider, that produceth this change in the minds of men. But there can be no such reason for God to change his purpose and Counsel; as he is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and can do whatever it pleaseth him to do, so also is he <hi>Omniscient,</hi> infinite in knowledge and wisdom, and nothing past, present or to come can be hid from him. All things lie <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and</hi> opened (or unbowelled) before him; the whole World, and all the Ages of the World, from its Creation to the Consummation of all things, are in his view at once, not the most secret thought of man, nor the minutest circumstance in things can escape his Eye. Knowing therefore eternally, as well all that shall be hereafter, as all that now is, or at any time hath been, nothing can happen contrary to his expectation, &amp; therefore nothing can possibly move him to any the least <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Counsels:</hi> but he must needs be, as in his nature and being, so in his purposes also <hi>immutable,</hi> the same <hi>yesterday</hi> and to <hi>day,</hi> and <hi>for ever.</hi> And this granted, we shall very easily see into the truth of our next Proposition, as necessarily following from this <hi>Immutability</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Whatsoever the devices and projects of man may be, they can never be able to frustrate or alter the Will and Counsel of the Lord, but it shall firmly stand, and most punctually be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65540:17"/>
And it must needs be so, if but for this one reason, that there can be no <hi>device</hi> or project of man, but God did eternally foresee it and hath provided for it. Yea, he is both <hi>wise</hi> enough and <hi>powerful</hi> enough, either to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it and make it of no effect; or to overrule it, and bring to effect his own <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> by it. Men cannot surely be such Fools as to think that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wise God can be outwitted or deceived by any humane <hi>Policy;</hi> or that the <hi>Almighty God</hi> can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by humane <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>force;</hi> or that the most <hi>vigilant Governor</hi> of the World <hi>who never slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth nor sleepeth,</hi> Psal. 124. 4. <hi>Whose eyes are in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15. 3. Can be surprized by Humane <hi>Treachery.</hi> No <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy</hi> in what dark <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Vault</hi> soever it be laid and hatch'd, can be hid from him; no <hi>Confederacy</hi> or <hi>Combination</hi> can be too hard for him, who is <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible</hi> as well as <hi>immutable,</hi> and therefore can never be disappointed of his Will. <hi>Our God is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, he hath done whatsoever he pleased,</hi> Psal. 115. 3. Yea, <hi>The Counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations,</hi> Psal. 33. 11. And v. 10. <hi>The Lord bringeth the Counsel of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to nought, he maketh the devices of the People of none effect.</hi> Hence that bold Challenge of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> to all the Churches Enemies, <hi>Take Counsel and it shall come to nought: speak the word and it shall not stand, for God is with us,</hi> Isai. 8. 10. And again, <hi>The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed so shall it stand,</hi> Isai. 14. 24. <hi>The Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disanul it,</hi> v. 27. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the Lord lieth very deep, <hi>Clouds and darkness are round about him.</hi> And whilest vain men would be so wise, as to design for themselves without him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65540:17"/>
and presume to teach or help him to govern the World, they unawares subserve his secret Counsel, and by an unseen hand are carried contrary to their own intentions, to promote those very designs of his which they strive with all their might and policy to defeat. Let them consult, <hi>God</hi> shall infatuate their Counsels: let them attempt, God shall frustrate all their attempts. He must be wise indeed that can impose upon God. <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Dream, and his Fathers special affection to him, grow jealous of him, and to prevent his coming to have dominion over them, sell him for a Slave unto Strangers: and what do they in all this, but unwittingly help him up to that dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which <hi>God</hi> had design'd for him, that they may hereafter <hi>bow</hi> before him with the greater shame? <hi>Pharoab,</hi> lest the <hi>Hebrews</hi> should encrease too fast, and grow too many for him and his people, decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the destruction of all their Male Children, but see how the providence of <hi>God</hi> turneth this about to his ruine, for hereby <hi>Moses</hi> is exposed, and being found by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, is brought up in his Court, receiving thereby an education suitable to his future dignity, who was to be the leader and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of that people which was to spoyl the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Saul</hi> will by all means suppress <hi>David,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from succeeding him in his Throne, and what doth he herein, but by pursuing and exposing him to dangers, give him the fairest opportunities of shewing his fidelity to him, and his wisdom and valour to the people, so winning their affections over whom he was to Reign? The <hi>Princes</hi> of mere Envy bring <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Den of Lions, but only to this end, that by a Miracle of <hi>God's</hi> goodness to him he might be advanced above themselves and to their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65540:18"/>
own ruine. <hi>Haman</hi> prepareth the <hi>Gallows</hi> for <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> and designs the <hi>honour</hi> for <hi>himself,</hi> but is herein an instrument of <hi>God,</hi> hereby to bring the <hi>honour</hi> unto <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>himself</hi> to the <hi>Gallows</hi> of his own setting up. The <hi>Iews</hi> would void the Counsel of <hi>God</hi> by crucifying <hi>Iesus,</hi> and in crucifying <hi>him</hi> they brought to pass <hi>what Gods hand and his Counsel had determined before to be done,</hi> Act. 4. 28. They kill him lest <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>should come and take away their Place and Nation,</hi> Joh. 11. 48. And for this both were afterwards destroy'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi> They will seal up the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and set a watch of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to prevent his Disciples never intended design of taking their dead Master away by night; and thereby they provide a strong Evidence of his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead. Let men do what they will or can, <hi>God</hi> will make men know themselves to be but <hi>men,</hi> and that it is not they but he that ruleth all things according to the pleasure of his Will. <hi>His Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and his Dominion throughout all generations,</hi> Psal. 145. 13. When <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> have done their worst, it shall stand; and therefore must his Counsel stand too, whereby he ruleth and governeth all things without consulting men. <hi>He putteth down one, and setteth up another,</hi> Psal. 75. 5. By him <hi>Kings</hi> reign, and he giveth them sometimes for a Blessing and sometimes for a Scourge to the People. If we would have them a Blessing, there is no way but obedience and an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute submission to <hi>Gods</hi> Will to procure that, and if we have by our sins deserved the scourge, no Devices or Counsels of men can prevent that. <hi>God</hi> will be <hi>God,</hi> and we should be thankful that we are <hi>Men,</hi> and shew it by giving him a reasonable service, and contenting our selves in keeping within our own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65540:18"/>
compass. We may easily break our hearts with our own devices, but we can never frustrate Gods Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, that shall <hi>stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus very briefly run over the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of this Text, for the confirmation of our <hi>faith,</hi> we now proceed to see of what excellent <hi>use</hi> all this may be unto us for the rectifying of our <hi>opinions,</hi> or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of our life and conversation. And we shall be sure to find matter enough in these few things we have learned, for our <hi>instruction, correction, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and consolation</hi> in the ways both of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Instructions</hi> which we shall at this time take notice of from the doctrine delivered are <hi>two;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> respecting the time past, the <hi>other</hi> the time to come; both presently necessary to be diligently attended to, if we be desirous to understand our duty to <hi>God</hi> as good <hi>Christians,</hi> or to the <hi>King</hi> as Loyal <hi>Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us reflect a little in our thoughts upon the time past, and being instructed to whose goodness we are to ascribe all those good things we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto injoyed, all those deliverances from evil, that have been hitherto given us: All these, how great, how many soever, are to be attributed only to the good <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Counsel of the Lord,</hi> that hath forborn to punish us for our own <hi>devices,</hi> that hath delivered us from the <hi>devices</hi> of men. Have we hitherto of a long time enjoyed the blessings of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> in a good and fruitful Land? Have we been blest with a good <hi>Government,</hi> wholesome <hi>Laws,</hi> the free exercise of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and use of our <hi>Estates?</hi> Let us thankfully acknowledge our selves indebted to Gods goodness for all this. If the <hi>Lord</hi> had not been on our side, may <hi>England</hi> truely say, if the Lord had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65540:19"/>
not been on our side, when men so often have risen up against us, they had swallowed us up quick, they were so wrathfully displeased at us. How many and various have been the devices of men against us? Of men of much different stamps, of contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, to subvert the Government, to destroy and corrupt our Religion, to undermine our <hi>Peace,</hi> to make us a Prey to our Enemies, and to set us at variance among our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to devour and cat up one another at home? Ever since it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> to own us for his People, to set any <hi>mark</hi> of his special favour upon us, to manifest a peculiar <hi>Providence</hi> over us, in setting over us religious <hi>Princes</hi> to be the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Faith,</hi> amongst us, and our gracious Protectors in the sound Profession of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and <hi>pure worship of God;</hi> how hath the <hi>Prince of darkness</hi> bestirred himself, and set all his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on work to create us trouble? What strange devices and devilish contrivances hath he put into mens hearts to obstruct the work of God amongst us and set forward his own? One while he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his work at home, in the very midst of us, tryeth what he can do by the <hi>powers</hi> which are by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God set over us, puts <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot</hi> into their hands to consume us; and when he seeth that this will not do, but that there is <hi>one</hi> even in the <hi>fiery Furnace</hi> with us, that is able to abate the fury of the Fire, and bring forth the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, like Gold out of the Furnace, more refined and pure: not able to indure the Lustre and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, he gets him away as far from it as he can, and beginneth the work anew, and layeth the <hi>Plot</hi> at the greatest distance, that it may ripen out of sight, and come upon us at full strength: he fetcheth his Race even from as far as <hi>Rome,</hi> and is resolved
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65540:19"/>
to bear us down with forreign Force; he leads up <hi>Armies</hi> marching under <hi>consecrated Banners,</hi> manneth out <hi>Navies</hi> Christened by the Name of <hi>Invincible,</hi> and with these he will come upon us like a sudden Deluge; and who is the Lord (saith he) that he should deliver them out of my hand? Will not this do against the Lord of Hosts? Then is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to return back again in a disguise, and fall to work in secret <hi>Holes,</hi> and <hi>Cells,</hi> and <hi>Vaults,</hi> he will lay his Snares in the dark, and <hi>who</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall see?</hi> Close <hi>Plots</hi> and private <hi>Conspiracies</hi> of men sworn upon the Sacrament to Secresie who can be so quick-sighted as to discover? And now let it be <hi>Poyson,</hi> or <hi>Dagger,</hi> or <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> or what <hi>Hell</hi> can invent, so the <hi>Anointed of the Lord</hi> may fall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> be rooted out, all's well enough, he hath served his <hi>own</hi> ends and the <hi>Popes,</hi> and what <hi>Devil</hi> can desire more? But still there is no <hi>inchantment</hi> or <hi>divination</hi> against <hi>Israel;</hi> so long as <hi>God</hi> is with us, what can <hi>Hell</hi> do against us? He must now therefore contrive, if possible, how to drive out <hi>God</hi> from among us; and no way so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do this, as to sow amongst us the Seeds of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, God is love,</hi> and will not own those for his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> who do not like <hi>Brethren dwell together in Unity.</hi> As long as we stand entirely <hi>one,</hi> united in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we have too much strength to give him hope of an easie Victory; but he knows well enough who hath said, that <hi>a house divided against it self cannot stand.</hi> To make a breach therefore, whereat he may enter, he fills mens heads with <hi>fears, jealousies,</hi> and <hi>scruples;</hi> makes them look like <hi>Monsters</hi> to one another. He works upon mens <hi>phantasies</hi> and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and presents before them as to Men in a <hi>dream</hi> strange <hi>Phantasms</hi> and Apparitions. Some
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65540:20"/>
conceive they see <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> in those very persons and things which are under <hi>God,</hi> our best fence against them; and so do these words always run in their minds, that they can call nothing which they are taught to dislike by any other name then those, and <hi>Antichristian.</hi> Some again imagine they see <hi>Tyranny</hi> in the best formed <hi>Monarchy</hi> that the World hath, ready to swallow up at once all <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> Others think they see <hi>Christ</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to reign upon the Earth, and commanding them to go before him, to prepare his way by <hi>levelling</hi> the <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>raising</hi> the <hi>Valleys,</hi> dashing in pieces the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the Earth like a Potters Vessel, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Kings</hi> in Chains, and their <hi>Nobles</hi> with Fetters of Iron. Thus by his subtle delusions were men, like such as are rouzed up in some frightful dream with a dismal cry of <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> made to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout so long to quench an imaginary fire, no where visible but in their own <hi>hot</hi> heads, till they had kindled a real one, that had almost burnt down not only their own but all the houses of <hi>God</hi> in the Land. But notwithstanding all this, it pleased God to awake us, and that by little less then a Miracle, in the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful restitution of our present most gracious <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</hi> And now, who would not think that our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miseries and our present Peace, and the long missed blessings of a gracious Government, should so strongly work upon us, as to perswade us to keep well when we may be so? But the <hi>Deceiver</hi> is still too cunning for us, and knows how to turn the very Motives of <hi>Union,</hi> into the occasions of <hi>Division.</hi> He takes advantage of those very <hi>Confusions</hi> yet fresh in our Memories into which he had formerly brought us, to keep alive our Jealousies on all hands of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: so that at this day <hi>mutual suspicions</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65540:20"/>
                  <hi>ill opinions</hi> keep us at as great a distance in the days of Peace, as <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Musquets</hi> did in the time of War. Still we are in <hi>Sides</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> devising how to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and ruine each other. The remembrance of former days unhappily fomenting and hightening our suspicions and jealousies to that degree, that we seem rather the Laughing-stock then the terrour of our Enemies, and <hi>Rome</hi> it self cannot chuse but laugh within it self to see us so industrious in doing her work for her, and by our <hi>contentions</hi> and <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> making an open way for that very evil which men pretend above all others to be afraid of. And now seeing we have been at so much pains in assisting our professed Enemies to destroy us, what can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine could have all this while preserved us against all those <hi>devilish devices</hi> that have been hatch'd both abroad and amongst our selves at home to undo us, but that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good God</hi> alone who overruleth all the <hi>devices</hi> of men, who sitteth in the Heavens above all <hi>Powers,</hi> who saith to the Sea, <hi>Hitherto shall thou come but no further, and here shall thy proud Waves be stayed,</hi> Job. 38. 11. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth be glad thereof, let the Multitude of the Isles be glad thereof,</hi> Psal. 97. 1. This Isle may be glad thereof. <hi>He is great in</hi> Zion, <hi>he is high above all People,</hi> Psal. 99. 2. <hi>His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi> Psal. 98. 1. It is his right hand, and not our Sword, his wise Counsel not our Policy, his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodness, and least of any thing our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness that preserveth us in safety. <hi>Except the Lord build the house,</hi> all our <hi>Builders</hi> shall labour but in vain, we shall quickly with our own hands pull it down upon our heads. Except the <hi>Lord keep the City,</hi> all our <hi>Watchmen</hi> shall wake in vain, our own devices, our own sins will be sure to fire all, and we shall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65540:21"/>
soon be like to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> Therefore not unto us, not unto us but unto the <hi>Lord</hi> alone let us ascribe the honour and the glory of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and all the wonderful deliverances which <hi>he</hi> and <hi>he alone</hi> hath given unto our gracious <hi>King</hi> and this whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> in him. It is only because his <hi>Counsel</hi> always <hi>stands</hi> unmoveable and cannot change, that our own devices have not long e're this utterly ruined us, or that the manifold devices of our Enemies have not prevailed against us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we are instructed hence to attribute all our past Mercies and Deliverancies to the goodness of God, who alone could disappoint the <hi>devices</hi> of men against us; so are we hence also taught, how both at present, and for the time to come, to behave our selves towards God, let the times prove never so troublesome to us by reason of the restless <hi>devices</hi> of men. We must always be sure to bear in mind, and fix immoveably upon this one <hi>point,</hi> that the <hi>Counsel of the Lord is altogether unchangeable, one and the same for ever, and shall undoubtedly stand</hi> for a <hi>Law</hi> to us, and for a <hi>Barr</hi> against every thing that can be devised by men against us not agreeable unto <hi>it.</hi> Conclude we certainly that the <hi>Lord he is God,</hi> and will be so, maugre all the <hi>devices</hi> of <hi>Fools</hi> that <hi>say in their heart there is no God.</hi> That <hi>he</hi> will alway govern the World by his own <hi>Will,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wicked in their own <hi>devices.</hi> That all things being ordered by him must needs be wisely ordered, and therefore as no device of man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him, but in wisdom; so of his goodness he will either confound these devices in his own time, or by them accomplish his own Wise Counsel, to the destruction of his Enemies, and the good of his <hi>Church</hi> and faithful Servants. <hi>All things shall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65540:21"/>
work together for good to them that love him,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
               <p>Let therefore our Behaviour be alway such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the faithful Subjects of the Great God and King of all the World: and our business, as we are such, is pure obedience to the Laws of his Kingdom, and not to help him to rule and order things by our Wisdom, as tho he could stand in need of our <hi>devices,</hi> or had thought good to make us of his Great <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</hi> Let us mind our <hi>Duty</hi> in attending to and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting cheerfully his <hi>Commands,</hi> and not intermeddle with that which is properly his work, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then he himself shall give to any of us Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Act under him. Unto some he hath given his <hi>Commission</hi> to Act and Rule his People <hi>under him,</hi> and for him. <hi>By his Wisdom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Iustice,</hi> Prov. 8. 15. <hi>The Powers that be are of God.</hi> He hath put a Sword into their hand, <hi>and they bear not that Sword in vain,</hi> Rom. 13. And they that will not stand in awe of it, deserve to feel it. <hi>He hath also set some in the Church,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 28. And hath made them <hi>Overseers over his Flock to feed it,</hi> Act. 20. 28. And we are commanded <hi>to obey them that have the Rule over us and watch for our Souls,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. These are <hi>God's Commission'd</hi> Officers, put in Authority under him, and over us; and as they are to do their own duties in their several places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God,</hi> whose Servants they are, and to whom they must give an account as well as we; so can they not do their duty unto him, but by governing us, and using all such means as he hath ordered, or allowed, to keep us in due subjection both unto God and them, and to see as much as is in them, that we do our duties too. Let no <hi>devices</hi> therefore of other men out of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>School</hi> they come, perswade or provoke us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow theirs, or set up new devices of our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65540:22"/>
own against this certain <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or to cast off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by our restless endeavours to free our selves from the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> We cannot be <hi>Christs Subjects</hi> if we will be our own Masters. It is just that he assign to each Servant in his Family his proper work, and call them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as he shall please; if we shall arrogate to our selves a right of Judging them, whom he hath set to Judge us, we place our selves in his <hi>Throne</hi> and usurp his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> which is the highest <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>King of Kings:</hi> and can we think that such shall go unpunished by him? Let our <hi>condition</hi> be never so uneasie, let our <hi>Grievances</hi> be never so many, let our <hi>sufferings</hi> be never so great, let us be sure to keep in mind, <hi>what</hi> we are, and <hi>whose</hi> we are, and what is our <hi>Business</hi> to do. We are not <hi>Gods,</hi> nor <hi>Lawgivers</hi> to our selves, but <hi>Men</hi> under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that made us and redeemed us. <hi>We are not our own, but his that bought us with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. What then can be our work, but that which beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Subjects of so absolute a <hi>Monarch?</hi> Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to own the Priviledges we have, of his grace and goodness, hitherto injoyed, acknowledging that the very least of them far exceedeth all our merits: contentedly to rest in his choice for us, and in the state and condition his Providence hath assigned us, acknowledging always that to be very good, and best of all at present, which he hath appointed: wholly to resign our selves with all our concerns and interests into his hand, unto his sole disposal, saying heartily, <hi>it is the Lord, let him do whatsoever seemeth good to him,</hi> not <hi>ours but his Will be done.</hi> Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that as his <hi>Will</hi> must <hi>stand</hi> and cannot be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, so it is fit we should own him in our hearts to be what really he is, our <hi>Supreme Lord</hi> and absolute
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65540:22"/>
                  <hi>Governor,</hi> and shew our selves well pleased, that his <hi>Will</hi> should <hi>stand;</hi> and, be it what it will that he doth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our wishes and hopes or not, we being his Creatures as well as Subjects, we that should be both willing to it, and delighted in it. We may be very sure of this, and that should be full enough for us, that God cannot Act against himself, nor contrary to his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore he can never do otherwise then <hi>wisely</hi> and <hi>well,</hi> and that he will make it appear so in the end, whatever it seems now. If then God grant us a plentiful, peaceable and flourishing state, and give us <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> that are <hi>Davids</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>men after his own heart,</hi> and <hi>nursing Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church,</hi> encouragers of true <hi>Piety,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of their Subjects in their just <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> he doth <hi>wisely</hi> and <hi>well;</hi> and we are to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him as for an undeserved blessing; and if, on the other hand, God for the punishment of our sins of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Rebellion, Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Formality,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall</hi> give us <hi>Sauls</hi> or <hi>Ieroboams,</hi> oppressors of their Subjects, or Persecutors of Religion, still we must confess that <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>wisely</hi> and <hi>well,</hi> and like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a most <hi>just Governor;</hi> it is less then we have deserved, and it is no more then we need. He is both <hi>just</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as well in <hi>punishing</hi> as <hi>rewarding,</hi> and we ought to bear with patience, yea and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness the chastisement of our sins. Let it be our business then to persecute and mortifie our Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Lusts, and God will provide that we want not sit Governors, when he seeth us desirous to live in obedience unto him. The instruments in Gods hand may be changed, as he seeth his work requireth, but still the same God reigneth, and his <hi>Counsel</hi> must <hi>stand.</hi> Thus much for our instruction.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the next place, the Doctrine of this Text
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65540:23"/>
is an excellent corrective for the malignant <hi>humors</hi> wherewith the <hi>Body</hi> of this Kingdom hath for some time too much abounded. It may serve to restrain the heady and furious attempts and practices of some, and to abate the discontents and silence the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of others among us. And these two sorts of People are very easily met with in most places.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are too many in the World, who will needs be thought as <hi>wise,</hi> not only as their Humane <hi>Governors,</hi> but as <hi>God</hi> himself. And indeed, it were less to be wondered at, if such men were only to be found in that <hi>Church,</hi> which hath so long pretended to an infallibity of Judgment: tho, blessed be God, whatever it be in its Doctrines, it hath not yet proved so in its <hi>Treasonable</hi> and <hi>Bloody</hi> Attempts and Practices. But that any men of such a mischievous self-conceit should be found among them that call themselves <hi>Protestants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Reformed Christians,</hi> is a thing wonderful indeed, and ought to be as much lamented by us, as our Adversaries will be sure to rejoyce in it, and make a bad use of it. And surely such poysonous Weeds could never have sprung up among us, had it not been from that evil seed which those <hi>Seminaries</hi> imployed by the <hi>Evil one,</hi> have cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly sowed in our good Field whilst the Keepers of it slept. There is a viperous Brood of men, tho they are not willing to own their own Original, or it may be have been ingendred so much in the dark, that they do not know their own Parents, which cannot live but by eating out the Bowels of that Government under the warm Wings whereof they shelter themselves. These things are always big with new <hi>devices,</hi> not how to <hi>serve,</hi> (as hath been much pretended) but rather to <hi>direct</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Providence.</hi> And by their Practices, they might
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65540:23"/>
persuade men to believe, that in all their Prayers they do not desire of God so much to <hi>guide</hi> them, as to <hi>follow</hi> them whithersoever their own wild <hi>devices</hi> shall lead him. If <hi>Religion</hi> have not yet discovered unto such men their folly and wickedness, yet, a man would think, that unto men that talk so much of <hi>Providence</hi> as they have been wont to do, their own so often frustrated <hi>devices</hi> should be sufficient to convince them of their vanity, and make them feel how hard it is to kick against the Pricks; and that very <hi>confusion</hi> of Languages that is amongst them, so that they have not been ever able well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another, should discourage them from all designs of building another <hi>Babel,</hi> or advancing their own <hi>devices</hi> in spite of Heaven. Will men that are so high pretenders to a <hi>divine spirit</hi> and a <hi>new light,</hi> be always like those <hi>silly</hi> ones, of whom 'twas said, <hi>They are ever learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> this easie truth, that <hi>the Powers that be, are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and that whosoever resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation?</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2. What but the want of that <hi>Self-denial,</hi> wherein they are wont so much to glory, can make men so dull, as not to be able in so many years, no not with the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> or the <hi>Rod</hi> of Discipline, to learn so plain a Lesson? Will men be always so much children, as to think they can do more or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for themselves by their own <hi>devices,</hi> then their Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> will do for them by his wise <hi>Counsel,</hi> if they will approve themselves his dutiful Children, and shew their intire submission to him their Supreme <hi>Lord,</hi> by obeying those whom he hath placed over them, and <hi>submitting themselves</hi> (as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them, 1 Pet. 2. 13.) <hi>To every Ordinance of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65540:24"/>
man for the</hi> Lord's <hi>sake; whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governors, as unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of Evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well?</hi> Will men always be so absurd, as to think they best secure the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their <hi>Consciences,</hi> by rebelling against those whom they must <hi>needs be subject to, not only for wrath, but Conscience sake?</hi> Rom. 13. 5. If it be so hard a task to yield Obedience to the <hi>standing Will of God,</hi> written so legibly in his <hi>word,</hi> and so often proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by his Ministers, as the Rule of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> how much harder will it be found to submit with Alacrity to his <hi>secret Will</hi> when it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the course of his Providence by the <hi>Event,</hi> in a patient <hi>suffering</hi> even for <hi>well doing?</hi> How shall men have the face to call themselves <hi>Christians</hi> by the name of <hi>Christ</hi> (except it be by the same figure as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> are by the name of <hi>Iesus)</hi> who so wholly neglect the commands of <hi>Christ,</hi> and lean more to their own <hi>devices</hi> then to his <hi>promises?</hi> Do they think to make themselves more happy, and to prosper better by their own <hi>Consultations</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies;</hi> by Plotting of <hi>Insurrections</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> and by such devices as these to secure their Religion and their Liberties, (tho, blessed be <hi>God,</hi> such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (if there be any) is yet at a distance) then by preparing themselves, as we are all commanded on pain of sorfeiting our Christianity, to bear the <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>suffer for righteousness sake? If when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ye should follow his steps,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Yet truely, were there nothing of <hi>Religion</hi> in the case, there be two things nevertheless, which well
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65540:24"/>
considered would go near to check all such <hi>devices,</hi> tho to the devisers they may seem to aim at what is best.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Which of us is so wise, as to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that his own Projects shall either succeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mind, or be approved of by others, or produce the publick good, or indeed his own? I think there is no man that can in reason pretend to such a certainty, and, considering the various and contrary tempers of men, it is hard to come up to a <hi>probability.</hi> If so, then the certain, or but likely Troubles and Commotions, War and Blood-shed, that the whole Nation may suffer in order to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of these <hi>uncertain</hi> Devices in such great changes as are usually designed, should make him that loves his Country, (which love is the fair colour such men commonly paint over their foulest designs withal) very shy in setting abroach his own <hi>devices.</hi> It is a very easie matter to set discontented men together by the ears, but not so easie to make them friends again, or perswade him, that thinks he hath the advantage, to sheath his Sword; nor yet can he that raised the Fray, be sure that himself shall not be wounded in the Scuffle. Men are much easilier agreed to pull down one Government, then to set up another: because it is much easier to find one, which hath something in it contrary to all the several private interests of the Conspirators, then one that will promote them all; which it may be are too various, ever to meet in one point, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed within the Compass of any one <hi>Model,</hi> that which the common cry of <hi>Liberty</hi> doth sufficiently declare. <hi>Love thy Countrey,</hi> that's <hi>God's</hi> Will: and for the <hi>love</hi> of it, lay aside thine own <hi>devices. My Son fear thou the Lord, and the King, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65540:25"/>
not with them that are given to change,</hi> Prov. 24. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do these men indeed love <hi>themselves,</hi> and their own <hi>safety?</hi> Let them then for their own sakes, take the safe way. Keep the many <hi>devices</hi> of the heart <hi>within</hi> the heart, for if they once be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to pass the <hi>Tongue,</hi> there is no longer any safety. He must have a faculty more then humane, who can be sure, that <hi>that</hi> man, unto whom he first reveals his secret, (and revealed it must be or it can do nothing of what he would have it to do) hath not another <hi>device</hi> ready to defeat his, and make him pay the charges of both. If men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would in all their <hi>Consults</hi> advise with <hi>God's Will,</hi> the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> or their own private <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> those many <hi>devices</hi> which quicken in their hearts would die there too, and have the same Womb and Tomb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>second</hi> sort of People, which this Text should correct is, that very numerous part of Mankind, the <hi>Querulous, Murmuring</hi> and <hi>discontented,</hi> whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is <hi>present</hi> will either <hi>please</hi> or <hi>silence.</hi> If these be not all so daring as to <hi>devise,</hi> they are so ill natur'd as to be <hi>angry,</hi> that all their desires, how unreasonable soever, are not fully satisfied; and to satisfie them will be found no easie matter, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till themselves seem better to understand them. They would have the World to be Governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their mind, but how that should be, their thoughts are not to this day well agreed. They think too well of themselves, not to think too ill of their present condition, as too much below their Merits: and therefore cannot be reconciled to the Publick Management of Affairs, whilest it giveth them not the opportunity of bettering themselves every day according as the every days new devices
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65540:25"/>
of their hearts shall prompt them. The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint among such is, that the <hi>wicked</hi> are <hi>exalted,</hi> and <hi>good men discouraged,</hi> and the course of <hi>Iustice</hi> is <hi>perverted;</hi> and the common discourse is of the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> of the <hi>times,</hi> and the <hi>loosness</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Discipline.</hi> It is true, that if at any time such things as these are visible, and whilest <hi>men</hi> are <hi>men,</hi> they will be at all times too visible, good men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but be very sensible of it, very sadly bewail it, and mourn before <hi>God</hi> for the sins of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Rivers of waters will run down</hi> Davids <hi>eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men keep not Gods Law,</hi> Psal. 119. 136. Yea, and what becometh every one of them in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Stations and Callings with all humble submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and modesty, yet with all Godly <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> they will be ever ready to do towards the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of mens lives, the rectifying of errors, correcting Abuses, and redressing all Grievances. But they begin at home, as is fit, and proceed regularly, and keep to their proper provinces, and are more ready to do their own duty, then to complain that others do not theirs. To make the <hi>Failings</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>faults</hi> in <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Grievances</hi> of the Nation a common <hi>Table-talk</hi> and to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways signifying to the World their <hi>discontents</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness,</hi> is too great an Argument of a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Factious</hi> Spirit, and savoureth too rankly of a mind corrupted with Seditious and Rebellious Principles, and too much Estranged from the God of Peace. In thus doing men shew they regard themselves and their own Wills more then the Will of God. What evils hath the Government at any time brought upon us that we have not by our manifold sins too much deserved, at least at the hand of God the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65540:26"/>
Governor, if not at the hands of <hi>those</hi> who rule under him? And how many Blessings may we enjoy under the <hi>worst</hi> of Governments which we have never in the least deserved? Dare we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take presumptuously to prescribe to God, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that either we are such, as he ought not to punish at all, or at least, such as he ought not to punish after this manner? If God send a Plague, or a Famine, or any kind of <hi>Mortal Sickness</hi> on a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their sins, is it reasonable for them to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur against the Air and unseasonableness of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if God chastise us with evils of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, by what or whomsoever, shall it be more reasonable to quarrel with and complain of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or the Messenger for executing upon us the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then to seek out where the fault lieth whereby we have provoked him to anger, and to amend it? <hi>Iehu</hi> received the promise of a Kingdom to the fourth Generation for executing punishment on those whom <hi>God</hi> had determined to punish, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 30. Yet did not <hi>Iehu</hi> depart from the sins of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> which made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin. <hi>God</hi> sometimes <hi>giveth a King in his wrath, and taketh him away again in his displeasure,</hi> Hos. 13. 11. If he deliver men into the hands of their Oppressor, tho he be the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they must serve him and be quiet, because they see it is the Will of God so to deal with them, <hi>Ier. 27. Patience</hi> under our Sufferings, and <hi>repentance</hi> of our sins, and <hi>reformation</hi> of our lives, and <hi>obedience</hi> to our Superiours in all lawful things even to the utmost, to shew we own their Authority, and decline not the hardest of their just commands, are the best ways of reconciling our selves to <hi>God,</hi> and turning his Judgments away from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65540:26"/>
us, and not to stand murmuring and complaining of that which in justice he is pleased to inflict upon us by what hand soever. <hi>Why should a living man complain? A man for the punishment of his sins?</hi> Lam. 3. 39. Thus much for Correction.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In the <hi>next</hi> place, let us be exhorted, <hi>first,</hi> ingeneral, to attend <hi>God's Will</hi> in all things, and let that take place of all the <hi>devices</hi> of our <hi>hearts.</hi> Alas, what would become of the World, if God should disregard it, slacken the reins of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and permit all to the hands of men? <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi>'s guiding the Chariot of the Sun, and firing the World, would look no longer like a Fable. Hot spirits and giddy heads with their bold devices and rash enterprizes would soon turn all things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, and put more then one Nation into a combustion. Men are of too different complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and divided interests ever to unite in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order:</hi> contrary humors and principles would always produce contrary <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> and every Party would be concerned to maintain <hi>that</hi> which would best uphold <hi>it,</hi> not only to the ruine of the opposite Party, but to the rending of the publick Peace and Welfare. Then, and no sooner, let men talk of carrying on their own devices and designs when they either know themselves to be too strong for all men, or can assure themselves that all men will be of their mind.</p>
               <p>If any shall now ask whether we would have them sit still and unconcern'd how matters go right or wrong, and whether it be not every mans duty to endeavour with all his might the rectifying of what he seeth amiss in Kingdom or Church? To this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65540:27"/>
some Answer hath been given already, to which may be added thus much more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be very sure that what you think to be amiss, be so indeed, before you go about to mend it. Men are too apt to make their own irregular desires and wishes, yea, and not seldom an irrational Conceit and Phant'sie, or even such a thing as this in some other men or party for whom they have a kindness, the rule of right and wrong, and so judge every thing to be amiss, which they, or such as they count their friends dislike. Measure things by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rule, not that of <hi>Self-interest</hi> or <hi>Affection,</hi> but <hi>God's Word;</hi> view and examine them by a true light, be not misled by mens reports, or vain surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but <hi>try all things and then hold fast that which is good.</hi> If you take not this course, instead of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what is amiss, you will only marr that which his good. Be sure that what you would amend be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>God's Will,</hi> or else it needs no mending, and none will owe you thanks for your vain <hi>devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be as sure in the <hi>next</hi> place that you are every way rightly fitted and duly qualified for the work you take in hand. See that you have both skill and strength and good Authority for what you undertake. It is not every bold Bungler that hath face enough to praise himself and laugh at others, who is fit for such a work as is the reformation of Kingdoms and Churches. It is not all a thing to hold a <hi>Plow-staff</hi> and a <hi>Scepter.</hi> Be content to employ your Talents accordingly as you are fitted with them, and think it is Gods Will you should busie your selves in those employments for which he hath best furnished you, and in those stations wherein he hath thought fit to place you. If he had designed you for higher Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65540:27"/>
he would probably have given you a more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Education, and furnished you with better Tools. And if other men, who pretend to higher things, shall tell you that they are wise enough both for themselves and you, and thereby would tempt you to second them in their devices: be sure first that they have indeed all that which you find wanting in your selves to fit them for being your leaders in such bold Attempts, and that's not only <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> but good <hi>Authority</hi> and a just <hi>Call</hi> unto the work from God. Let them produce their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and shew <hi>you, thus it is written,</hi> and that must be the Will of God declared in his word, not whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered into the Ear by a <hi>Pidgeon,</hi> not dictated from an infallible <hi>Chair,</hi> not sent in some flash of <hi>new Light,</hi> or suggested by something blasphemously called the <hi>Spirit</hi> within them, for the truth of all which you must at last be content with their own bare word, which is sure to deceive you. If you have not <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>God</hi> for what you do, he will say, <hi>Who hath required these things at your hand?</hi> Isai. 1. 12. To support the tottering <hi>Ark of God</hi> must needs appear a thing well pleasing unto God, but let <hi>Uzzah</hi> do it, and he <hi>dies</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7. Be his <hi>zeal</hi> what it will, he must have patience and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Call. Men must know, that tho it must needs be <hi>good to be zealous always in a good matter,</hi> Gal. 4. 18. Yet should they take time to consider and pains to satisfie themselves, that the matter be indeed as <hi>good</hi> as now it seems to them; and that their <hi>zeal</hi> for it be <hi>good</hi> too, for all <hi>zeal</hi> even for <hi>good</hi> is not so, and that the <hi>good zeal</hi> carry them not beyond the bounds of their <hi>Authority.</hi> Zeal for <hi>God</hi> must have the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for its <hi>Rule,</hi> it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65540:28"/>
a <hi>blind zeal,</hi> a <hi>blemished Offering</hi> which <hi>God</hi> will not accept. 'Tis a very absurdity and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Act in <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God</hi> against <hi>Gods Will.</hi> It is not a mans own <hi>Conscience</hi> that is his <hi>Law-giver,</hi> or that can Authorize him of its self to any Action; it is a part of its office to direct us, but it must be by the Law of God to do his Will, and must produce his Commission to prove its own Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Gods Counsel</hi> only can be our <hi>Authority</hi> in such cases, and that must be revealed to us, before it can warrant us in our work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is express, there is no disputing about <hi>convenient</hi> or <hi>inconvenient,</hi> the thing is by command made <hi>necessary,</hi> and must be done whatever follow. But where there is no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and you would do a thing because you think it expedient and needful to be done; be sure you do it not till you have Authority from those whom <hi>God</hi> hath placed to govern you, neither go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to move them for such Authority till you have good reason to believe that what you go about will bring <hi>good,</hi> and not more <hi>hurt</hi> then <hi>good.</hi> Many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>inconveniencies</hi> are rather to be born then one great <hi>mischief</hi> so much as hazarded. I had rather indure some little fits of sickness, then purge, when I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without destroying my Body. Labour to see through to the end of your work before you set upon it in earnest. They repented of their folly too late, that by removing one Tyrant brought in a Multitude, much more shall they who not content to bear some small inconveniencies under a lawful Prince, shall by <hi>Rebellion</hi> make way through <hi>Anarchy</hi> for <hi>Tyranny.</hi> What <hi>Government</hi> in the World was ever yet without some inconveniencies, 'tis the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65540:28"/>
of all things under Heaven to be imperfect and to admit a mixture of Evil. If a Beam or Post in my house stand so as either somewhat to deform it, or to be otherwise inconvenient, yet before I remove it, I would consider whether I can do it with safety, and not bring down the Building to my greater trouble and cost. God never intended eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be an <hi>Heaven,</hi> no more then that all <hi>men</hi> should be <hi>Angels.</hi> Let him therefore that would correct what is amiss in his own judgment, be sure he shall not turn all into an Hell of Confusion, and by a vain endeavour to make all men <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> let in a <hi>Devil</hi> which he knows not how to drive out again.</p>
               <p>Having premised these needful cautions it is easie now to see what we are to do, under what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment soever we live.</p>
               <p>Our first business is, to find out that which we are sure will stand, and can never deceive us, the <hi>Revealed Will of God,</hi> and let all our <hi>devices</hi> be, how we may most effectually obey it. Let us never be so rash or conceited, as to hope any device of our own can prosper that is not governed by this. Let <hi>God</hi> therefore preside in all our <hi>Consults,</hi> let his <hi>Book</hi> lie open before our Eyes, and advise with him before we attempt any thing, and then I am sure we shall never be a <hi>Rebellious</hi> People, and unless our former sins have taken too fast hold upon us, it may well be hoped, no <hi>miserable</hi> people neither.</p>
               <p>And certainly <hi>God</hi> hath not been sparing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing unto us his own mind, so far as we should be concerned to know it, especially as it is to be the Rule of our Behaviour towards our <hi>Governors. Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> Rom. 13. 1
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65540:29"/>
Is a standing Rule which God will never cancel: And <hi>submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13. is as sure and plain. <hi>Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to obey Magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</hi> Tit. 3. 1. <hi>Give unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars, <hi>and unto God the things that are Gods,</hi> Mar. 12. 17. <hi>Render to every man his due, Tribute to whom Tribute, Custom to whom Custom is due,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>Let Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Prayers, Intercessions and giving of Thanks be made for all men, for Kings and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. All this, and much more to the same purpose is plain enough without either <hi>Rhemish</hi> or <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes to explain it to us. Nothing of all this is <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> nor the <hi>Tradition</hi> of men. And he that can devise how with a safe <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>resist</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late therein the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> must have an Art to make <hi>Gods Word</hi> say what he will. You see your duty as clear as the light can make it, Be <hi>subject, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, obey, pay Tribute, pray heartily, suffer patiently, resist not at all;</hi> if you will be happy, do it; if you have any love for <hi>God,</hi> for your <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>your selves,</hi> do it. Think not that <hi>God</hi> can ever bless any Rebellious or Treasonable Designs. His Will of Duty is, <hi>obey or suffer:</hi> his Will of Government is, <hi>He that resisteth shall receive damnation.</hi> Let all your <hi>devices</hi> be, how by doing the one to escape the other. For the <hi>Counsel of the Lord that shall stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> observe the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Gods Providence</hi> in the <hi>Event,</hi> and rest your selves fully satisfied in it. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made your Prayers unto God to direct all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65540:29"/>
things to his own glory and the good of his <hi>Church, continue in well doing, persevere in the Faith,</hi> and say, <hi>O Lord, thy Will be done.</hi> Think with your selves, that this is the due <hi>homage</hi> you owe unto <hi>God,</hi> this is the true <hi>love</hi> you owe unto <hi>your selves,</hi> this is a just <hi>debt</hi> you are to pay unto the World. Pay therefore your debts, and give every one his due.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be just to <hi>God,</hi> and let him be <hi>your God</hi> indeed, and you do not take him for <hi>your God,</hi> if you do not cheerfully rest in his Government, if you do not heartily rejoyce in all his doings, and give him thanks <hi>in all things always.</hi> Why should you not do thus, but that you think he doth not well, or that he hath not an over-ruling hand in all that is done? And either way, you cast him off from being your <hi>God,</hi> seeing you disown either his <hi>Goodness</hi> or his <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Be just to <hi>your selves,</hi> grudg not your Souls that peace and comfortable rest in <hi>God</hi> which they might enjoy. If you expose your selves to the <hi>devices</hi> of men, whether of your selves or of any others, you bring your selves into a restless state of trouble and vexation. Say therefore unto your own hearts, <hi>stand still and see the Salvation of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Be just to the World of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and wish it not so ill as to change one infinitely <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> and <hi>powerful Governor</hi> for a Multitude of <hi>foolish, weak and wicked Tyrants,</hi> the Lusts and Humors of Carnal Men. What a <hi>Bedlam</hi> would the whole World soon be<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome, if all men were left to be ruled by the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their own hearts?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. In the last place, let all such amongst us as fear the <hi>Lord,</hi> and rejoyce to do his <hi>Will,</hi> draw much comfort to their Souls from this Spring of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65540:30"/>
What is there in the World that such men can reasonably be afraid of? <hi>The Counsel of the Lord that shall stand,</hi> when all the World hath done its worst; and this is his Will and Counsel, <hi>That nothing shall harm us if we be followers of that which is good,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13. Against all the <hi>devices</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> this is our Armour of Proof, <hi>Gods Will shall stand.</hi> We know not indeed what sharp chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our manifold Sins may require, but we know this, that it is his Will thus to purge away our <hi>Dross,</hi> and resine us for himself, that we may be bound up among his <hi>Iewels.</hi> We know not what strong <hi>Physick</hi> our diseased Souls may stand in need of, but this we know, we have both a wise and good <hi>Physician,</hi> that knows our temper and what will fit it, and whose end is his own <hi>honour</hi> in our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> and who hath no delight in our torment, nor design to destroy us. If <hi>God</hi> permit the devices of wicked men, of what Sect or Party soever they be, to create us some disturbance, it is but either by the smart we feel to confirm us more in our just dislike of such <hi>Religions</hi> as are to be upheld by <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> or if he bring us thus to the <hi>fiery Tryal,</hi> to carry us the sooner into Heaven, that we may be safe out of the reach of all <hi>infection</hi> or <hi>vexation. A mans heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth his way, but the Lord directeth his steps,</hi> Prov. 16. 9. The Pilot steareth, but <hi>God</hi> gives the Wind, and directs the Ship whither he pleaseth. And this is the never failing comfort of all good men, that <hi>God</hi> is always at the <hi>Helm. The Clouds are turned round by his Counsels; that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the World or the Earth. He causeth it to come, whether for Correction, or for his Land, or for Mercy,</hi> Job. 37. 12, 13. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65540:30"/>
be God, we have often tasted of his Consolation, and by our former Manifold Experiences of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, should learn yet more to comfort our selves with hopes of future Blessings; and that he who hath so often delivered us already will deliver us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. There are but these three things can give us cause to doubt of it. Our great <hi>unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> for past Mercies, our present <hi>uneasiness</hi> under and <hi>disobedience</hi> to his Government, and our <hi>distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of his Providence. Therefore that we may be able to comfort our selves in <hi>him</hi> and the Stability of his Counsels, let us make sure of these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we heartily praise his Holy Name for all the rich Mercies we injoy, and the great deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he hath wrought for us at all times, and more particularly for those singular tokens of his Mercy in the many Deliverances and continued Preservation of the <hi>Person</hi> of our <hi>Dread Sovereign Lord the King:</hi> a Mercy, which many years Confusion and Misery should in all reason have taught us before this time how to value, and which God himself may seem to commend to our special notice by those truely won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Methods he hath used to confer it upon us; so wonderful, that hardly any thing can seem more so, then that there should be yet any among us, whom the observation thereof hath not convinced of the vanity of all Rebellious and Treacherous devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Many devices and much talk there hath been of late about the <hi>Succession,</hi> but had our Gracious <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Royal Highness</hi> been taken in the Nets of their Enemies, an unhappy end had been put to that dispute, and who should have succeeded in the <hi>Throne, any</hi> or <hi>none, one</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> it is happy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65540:31"/>
for us we are not driven to consider. A long <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in all likelyhood we should have had of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Calamities, and might have despaired of seeing Peace in our days. It is an easie thing to lop off more Boughs in an hour then will grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in many years. <hi>Governments</hi> are like Glasses, the easiest things to break in pieces, but the hardest to cement again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us continue in an <hi>absolute Obedience</hi> and <hi>resignation</hi> to God in all the Branches of his Divine Will, and particularly in a <hi>subordinate Obedience</hi> unto his <hi>Anointed.</hi> Let the <hi>fear of God</hi> overaw us in all our undertakings, and let the same fear move us to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> and restrain us from all <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal</hi> Attempts and Thoughts. There is no comfort for Rebels but what they must fetch from their own <hi>devices,</hi> and before they can find any solid comfort in those, they must cease to be rebellious either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God or the King, by submitting all their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> to the <hi>Counsel of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>THat Sacred <hi>Truth,</hi> which our Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> hath revealed unto us in his <hi>Gospel,</hi> is the Doctrinal Foundation whereupon the <hi>Christian Church</hi> doth stand; if this were lost, there could be no such thing as that which we call a <hi>Christian Church</hi> upon Earth. The joynt <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> in this Sacred Truth is the erecting of this Spiritual Building upon that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65540:32"/>
firm Foundation; and where this consent is not, in the Fundamental Doctrines of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be <hi>one.</hi> The <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> which they have in the first place unto <hi>Christ</hi> their <hi>Head,</hi> as Members of one body, united under him, and living by him; and in the next place, unto each other mutually and suitably to their proper sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and offices in the Body, is the <hi>Cement</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with these <hi>living stones</hi> in this Spiritual Building are held together; and where this decayeth, the Walls chap, and the House goes to ruine. All this we may read in those words of St. <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 4. 15, 16. where the <hi>Apostle</hi> telling us what care <hi>Christ</hi> took after his Ascension into Heaven for the planting and governing of his <hi>Church</hi> upon Earth, <hi>the edifying of the Body of Christ,</hi> as he expresseth himself, <hi>v.</hi> 12. saith, all was to this end, that <hi>speaking the truth in love, we may grow up into him in all things</hi> [increase in or unto him] <hi>which is the Head, even Christ. From whom the whole body fitly joyned together and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by that which every joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth increase of the Body, unto the edifying of it self in love.</hi> Now if this be the great end, for which <hi>Christ</hi> furnished men with gifts for the Preaching of his Gospel to all Nations; that by imbracing that <hi>one</hi> truth Preached, they might become <hi>one</hi> Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and continue united in love, as the Members of the same Body, governed and directed, as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened by <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>head</hi> of the Body, and mutually caring for, and assisting one another, according to the measure or proportion, Faculty or Office of every several part, for the benefit of the whole, its health and growth and preservation; it can be no wonder here to find the <hi>Apostle</hi> so earnest in his Exhortation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65540:33"/>
to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity. If</hi> (saith he) <hi>there be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the spirit, if any Bowels of Mercies.</hi> It must needs be a matter of exceeding great weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, we must needs conclude it is something whereby God is highly glorified, and the Salvation of <hi>Christians</hi> greatly promoted, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> would obtain at their hands by all these affectionate obtesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, 'tis such a thing, as he saith, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and perfect his joy, <hi>fullfil ye my joy,</hi> saith he. He was now for the sake of that Gospel of Peace and Joy to them, which he had Preached unto them, a Prisoner in Bonds; and he seemeth to desire no more to make his Bonds easie to him, and his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a delight, but only this, <hi>that they be like mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or mind the same thing; <hi>having the same love, of one accord, of one mind.</hi> That they would live in Unity, loving one another mutually, as one <hi>Body</hi> with but one <hi>Soul;</hi> having the same affections, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the same designs, all joyning heads, and hearts, and hands in a vigorous pursuit of the same end by the same Methods.</p>
               <p>This is a request so very reasonable, that a man would wonder what need there could be of usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in with so much earnestness: the thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth is so evidently good in it self, so apparently conducive to the happiness both of Church and State wherever it is practiced, so much the interest of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very single Member of the Body, that it is almost unimaginable, how any man should be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, as not to gratifie with all readiness, I say not the <hi>Apostle,</hi> but <hi>himself,</hi> in a matter wherein it is so visible, that every mans private welfare is so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned. What man is there among us that doth not profess himself (of what <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65540:33"/>
soever he be) most ready to joyn with the <hi>Church</hi> in singing, <hi>Behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity?</hi> Psal. 133. 1. It is so, without all doubt, and all of us willingly grant it to be so; yea, and all of us would be glad to see it; but then, it must be upon those terms only as it can never be hoped for. Like two Armies in the Field ready to joyn Battel, both are very willing to hear of Peace, and would be content not to hazard their lives in the Fight; but each will have Peace on its own terms only, and neither will abate an Ace of its own demands; and so still they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in nothing, but in being unreasonable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring that which cannot be. All the difficulty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, to find out an expedient, whereby all Parties may agree, not only in a general desire of Unity; but also in the likeliest means or effecting it. And truely this would be no very hard matter to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, were we all really as good <hi>Christians,</hi> as we would be thought to be. We should not need to run as far as <hi>Rome</hi> to seek for an <hi>infallible</hi> Judge to put an end to our Divisions: Which why any man should see cause to do, I know not, except he be perswaded that no hand can heal them but that which made them. Would we but only have that real Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which all Protestants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have, and submit our Wills and Humours, which some men have been apt to mis-call the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to the directions of that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> which we all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be infallible; and follow his advice concerning the means, whose exhortation to the thing we all acknowledge to be very reasonable, much of the difficulty would soon disappear.</p>
               <p>In order to the establishment of so excellent and desirable a Blessing of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65540:34"/>
among <hi>Christians; something</hi> there is, which must be laid aside, as that which certainly obstructs and frustrates all Peaceable Attempts; and <hi>something</hi> there is, which must be learn'd and practised, which will mainly promote this glorious design. But men are not so ready to do, either the one or the other, as the Principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> oblige them to be. What these things are we read in the Text. <hi>Let nothing be done through strife or vain-glory, but in low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of mind, let each esteem other better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have the best expedient in the World for the maintaining both of <hi>Unity</hi> in Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of <hi>Unanimity</hi> in Love and Affection, and of <hi>Uniformity</hi> of Practice and Behaviour, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the <hi>Peace</hi> and Tranquility of both <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> O that all they who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be desirous of the happiness and prosperity of both (as certainly all good <hi>Christians</hi> are) would begin to account it their greatest Wisdome to learn with <hi>Christian Politicks</hi> of such as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> men indued with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> Wisdom, which hath this double commend<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion, that it is <hi>first pure and then peaceable,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. And would lay aside that other kind of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which they have too long admired, and been in love with, which is <hi>earthly, sensual and devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,</hi> where by <hi>envying and strife fill the World with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and every evil work,</hi> v. 15, 16. How soon would the World look with another face? How soon should we see that happily effected to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable joy and glory of <hi>Christendom,</hi> which hath so long miserably baffled all the great Wits of the World?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rules</hi> here given us to this end by the <hi>Apostle</hi> are two,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65540:34"/>
1. The <hi>former</hi> shews us, what we must remove out of the way, that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> may enter and take possession, in these words, <hi>Let nothing be done through strife and vain-glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>other</hi> teacheth us, what is that right truely <hi>Christian</hi> temper of Spirit, whereby <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> may be cherished and maintained, in these words, <hi>But in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better then themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now suppose, not only that all who read this are in profession <hi>Christians,</hi> but also sufficiently convinced that it is every mans both duty and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, strenuously to endeavour all he can in his proper Place and Calling, that <hi>the Unity of the Spirit may be kept in the Bond of Peace,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 3. That our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> may be <hi>as a City that is compact together,</hi> Psal. 122. 3. That we may yet see those happy days, wherein we may <hi>take sweet Counsel together, and walk unto the House of God in company,</hi> Psal. 55. 14. And this supposed, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this discourse is not to perswade such men to do, what they can need no perswasion to do, to desire the return of Peace and Unity in the Church; but to take the right way to endeavour it, and to put every man his hand to the work in good earnest; Acting by those never-deceiving <hi>Rules</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath here given us. And this that we may all do, our present Business is to learn, 1. To understand. 2. To use them. And that in the same order as here they lie before us.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The first Rule here given us is this, <hi>Let nothing be done through strife and vain-glory.</hi> Or thus. <hi>These two things, strife and vain-glory must very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be avoided by us in all our Actings, if we would contribute any thing to the Peace and Unity of the Church.</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65540:35"/>
And <hi>God</hi> knows, they are every where too visible, as the two <hi>Doors</hi> at which all our <hi>Disputes</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi> and whatsoever is destructive to true <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> then which nothing is a greater stranger among us at this day, are wont to enter but never can find their way out again. To learn, <hi>first,</hi> what these things are, and <hi>Secondly,</hi> how we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them out of the way, will be enough for the understanding of the first Rule and its use.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let nothing be done through strife or contention.</hi> This <hi>strife</hi> is a <hi>quarrelsom</hi> humour, a Spirit of <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> and <hi>Contradiction,</hi> a strange <hi>crossness</hi> of temper wherewith very many men are exceedingly troubled themselves, and are as troublesome to others: who are never well as long as they are quiet, or suffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be quiet; their very <hi>life</hi> seems to consist in being <hi>sick</hi> of every thing almost that they see or hear, and they feed upon the <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>infirmities</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The chief exercise of their Souls is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>gainsaying</hi> and <hi>contending</hi> right or wrong. They study not for the <hi>Truth,</hi> but for the <hi>Maistery</hi> and pester the World with <hi>disputes</hi> and <hi>invectives;</hi> not to <hi>confute</hi> Errors, and shame Vice; but to vent the boyling humor, and to <hi>vex</hi> those by whom they are vexed, tho not by any thing done to offend them; 'tis enough that they are not of <hi>their</hi> opinion, and that they are such as they are pleased to <hi>choose</hi> out for their <hi>Adversaries,</hi> and to shoot their <hi>poysoned</hi> Arrows at, even bitter words. Men of this <hi>currish snarling</hi> temper must be <hi>snapping</hi> at every thing that comes in their way, and <hi>barking</hi> at all that comes not from themselves; and usually the best things are with them the greatest faults, if <hi>they</hi> be not the <hi>Authors</hi> of them, as rarely they are of any <hi>good,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent what by following their own <hi>litigious</hi> humour,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65540:35"/>
they may sometimes chance to <hi>stumble</hi> upon. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they must ever have, whatever it cost them, to <hi>oppose</hi> to every thing that another either affirms or denies. This is certainly as wicked and devilish a temper, as it must needs be very uneasie; and that which hath served <hi>Satan</hi> to as many evil purposes, as any evil himself was ever Father of. A pious and ingenious Writer calls it very fitly, the Devil's <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah-stratagem,</hi> which hath served him not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, but even to defeat the Armies of the Living <hi>God.</hi> To these men may well be applied what the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, 1 Thes. 2. 15. <hi>They please not God, and are contrary to all men.</hi> In a word therefore, by <hi>strife,</hi> I suppose we are here to understand, that <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>selfish</hi> humour, whereby a man is so wedded to his own will and conceit, that he is always in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of defyance to every thing that opposeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and prizeth his own <hi>opinions,</hi> only because they are his own, above the best <hi>reasons</hi> of other men; is discontented with every thing that suiteth not exactly with his own <hi>Sentiments</hi> or <hi>Desires,</hi> and so idolizeth his own <hi>imaginations</hi> and <hi>inventions,</hi> that he thinks the publick Welfare, the Tranquility of the World, and whatever else will not fall down and worship them, but a cheap <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto them. This or something of it, is the thing which we are in the <hi>first</hi> place to remove out of the way.</p>
               <p>Now how great reason every man hath to correct this <hi>peccant humour</hi> in himself, when ever he finds it stirring, and wholly to disburden his Soul of it, will be very easily discerned by him that shall consider but these three things. 1. <hi>The evil root from which it grows. 2. The utter inconsistency of it with the truth of Christianity.</hi> And, 3. <hi>The pernicious influence which it hath upon the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65540:36"/>
1. The <hi>root</hi> of it is not always one, but whatever it be, it is never good.</p>
               <p>In some men, it seems to be nothing else, but a certain kind of <hi>Childishness,</hi> or a <hi>Pettishness</hi> and <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness</hi> of Nature, as Children are crying earnestly for every new thing they hear of, and will by no fair means nor foul be quieted, till they have it; and when they have got it, are as soon weary of it again, and as apt to cry for something else, though they cannot tell you what it is; and it may be for that same thing again, whereof but now they were so weary; and those Children above all others that are the greatest <hi>fantlings,</hi> and most indulged by fond Mothers, are commonly noted to be of this pettish humour: such a giddy inconstancy there seems to be in many men. Some little things there be for or against which they are wont to be very eager; and yet can they give no considerable reason either for their like, or dislike of them; but they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with what is present, and (tho they cannot well tell what to call it) they are very angry with those in whose power they think it is to give them what they want, and give it not. Their phant'sies are keenly set upon it, and quiet they will not, nor cannot be without it, nor will they suffer those that are near them to be at quiet for them. Surely this is not the temper of a sober serious <hi>Christian,</hi> who like a good natured Child, is content, so he have his wholesome Food, which his <hi>Father</hi> alloweth him; tho he cannot have it dressed according to his own phant'sie: and is as unwilling, as afraid to make any disturbance in his Fathers Family about things that are not of very great concernment.</p>
               <p>In others, this looks like a contracted Disease, brought upon themselves, by some disorderly usage
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65540:36"/>
of themselves. It seems to be a <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishness</hi> of Soul, much like unto that of the Stomach, which ariseth from a disorderly Diet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is come to pass, that it na<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>seateth every thing, but only that which is most hurtful, and serveth only to feed the distemper. Or, as men in some diseases long for many things, but relish nothing that's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them; taste greedily, but spit it out again with a loathing. Some men having disordered their heads by poring into some of the profoundest Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are too deep for them; and having confounded their Brains with (at least to them) unintelligible Notions, are come at last, to think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainest thing mysterious, and dispute like <hi>Skepticks</hi> about it. Some have so baffled themselves with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring through a Wood of Opinions, that they can find no way out again, but presently flie out of every Path that they enter into, tho for no other reason, but a phant'sie only, that it may not be the right. Some have been so nicely educated, and taught to be so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they dare hardly taste of any thing that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath made ready for them, for fear of poyson, or at least fluttishness; every Ceremony is to some <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and to others a very <hi>Idol,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> himself shall rather want his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then it shall be indured by some, or not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped too by others. All this is far from the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper of the sound and serious <hi>Christian;</hi> who whilst he can have the Daily Bread of his Soul which may feed him to Eternal Life, sits down contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the rest of the Family, feeds heartily, and gives <hi>God</hi> thanks, asking no question for Conscience sake, either who first invented the fashion of the Dishes, or to what uses they have been sometimes put; all his care is to see it be the Food his Father
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65540:37"/>
hath provided for him; and that all things are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about it, that he hath commanded; and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he leaves them to their ordering, to whose care the Government of the Family is intrusted.</p>
               <p>In others again, this seems to come from an <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>waspish</hi> nature. Some mens Souls seem to be all Fire, or else as <hi>Tinder,</hi> the least spark presently sets them all on fire. They cannot hear so much as a word with any Patience, or Calmness, that sounds not just as they would have it; and it is all one to anger them, and not in every little thing to humour them. And be sure of this, that <hi>an angry man stirreth up strife,</hi> Prov. 29. 22. <hi>A wrathful man stirreth up strife, but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife,</hi> Prov. 15. 18. <hi>And as Coals are to burning Coals, so is a contentions man to kindle strife,</hi> Prov. 26. 21. How far this is from the Meek and Lamblike temper of a good <hi>Christian,</hi> I need not now stay to shew.</p>
               <p>In another sort of men, this may spring from a preconceived <hi>prejudice</hi> against the <hi>persons</hi> of men; and then, as he that hath been taught before hand to have an ill opinion of his <hi>Physician,</hi> is apt to disgust e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that he prescribeth, without so much as once examining, what it is or how likely to conduce unto his health; and by this means often deprives himself of the readiest means of cure, by a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable jealousie of being poysoned: so, when men are once possessed with a prejudice against the persons of others, especially of their Teachers and Governors, they grow jealous of their instructions, and commands; and dispute where they should learn, or obey; and quarrel with their duty, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think it is not so, but because they know by whom it is injoyn'd; and imagine they can never enough oppose what comes from those, whom they have learn'd to suspect or hate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65540:37"/>
Others are, it may be, not well pleased with their <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Station</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and cannot be pleased with any thing whilst they are displeased with <hi>that,</hi> but will think themselves concern'd to dispute against every thing that comes from such as are advanced above them. <hi>Envy</hi> is a very restless and quarrelsome thing, and in whatever Breast it once gets entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that man shall never want an evil tongue; if he have not wit enough to <hi>dispute,</hi> he shall never want Malice enough to rail or slander. <hi>Strife</hi> can never be a stranger to the <hi>Envious,</hi> they are often Companions, and go hand in hand in Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We must not here pass by, without any Notice, that which is called the Root of all Evil, the <hi>love of Money.</hi> Where the love of this World is, there is not the love of the <hi>Father;</hi> and then be sure, there will be too little love among the Brethren. What a Multitude of Strifes and Contentions hence daily grow up in the World (every one seeking, who shall get most of it) no man can be ignorant. And as little can it be doubted, that this is the cause too of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance in the <hi>Church.</hi> Where shall a man hope to find a <hi>Church</hi> that is Sanctuary enough against <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness?</hi> and where <hi>Covetousness</hi> finds room, it will be no news to see <hi>Altar</hi> set up against <hi>Altar.</hi> If every <hi>Party</hi> in Religion have a <hi>Craft</hi> of its own to get <hi>Wealth</hi> by, every <hi>Party</hi> will cry up its own <hi>Diana,</hi> and no <hi>Diana</hi> shall want an Army to fight for her. It hath sometimes been accounted a piece of good policy, to reconcile the <hi>Factions</hi> to the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> by giving them a share in it. And where this is practiced, the <hi>Covetous</hi> will sure have so much policy too, as rather to be <hi>Factious,</hi> then to be poor. There is no danger of disturbance from the <hi>moderate</hi> and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65540:38"/>
                  <hi>peaceable;</hi> let <hi>him</hi> therefore dwell poor in a corner, feasting by himself on a <hi>good Conscience;</hi> 'tis pity to prejudice his expectation of a greater reward in Heaven by giving him preferment here on earth. But the <hi>importunate</hi> man is troublesome, and must be preferred lest he weary us; and the <hi>turbulent</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious</hi> man is dangerous, and must be bribed to be quiet. And shall we now think the worldling a fool, to be either <hi>modest</hi> or <hi>peaceable</hi> when he fears to be <hi>poor</hi> by being so? Again, <hi>Contention</hi> keeps up a <hi>Party,</hi> and a <hi>Party</hi> keeps and maintains us: If we stir it not, the fire will go out; the <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> will cool together: we have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated our opposites, and made the Church too hot for us; and if we keep not our friends warm, they will not keep us from starving. Thus 'tis well, if whilst <hi>God and Religion</hi> is the <hi>word,</hi> and fairly writ in the <hi>Banner, Mammon</hi> be not set up in the heart, and the Battels that are fought be not all his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall name but one thing more, and that is <hi>Pride.</hi> And perhaps it might have been enough to have named this one for all: seeing we are told, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. that, <hi>only by Pride cometh Contention.</hi> Whilst one will brook no <hi>superiour,</hi> and another no <hi>equal,</hi> what's become of <hi>Peace?</hi> One is angry because he thinks his <hi>Merit</hi> above his <hi>Fortune;</hi> and another as angry because he thinks anothers <hi>Fortune</hi> above his <hi>Merits.</hi> One is vexed to think his own <hi>Glory</hi> eclipsed by anothers shining too bright, and another is in a Fume, that any man should dare to take notice of his <hi>Spots.</hi> One strives to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up at the <hi>hight,</hi> and thinks he grows <hi>lower,</hi> as he sees any other grow <hi>higher;</hi> and they must all either be kept so much below him, as to look like almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or he can hardly think himself any thing.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65540:38"/>
Another thinks himself hot advanced at all, so long as he sees but one step more, by which he may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; and will never leave justling, 'till he get up to the highest. It is a fine thing, to march in the <hi>Head</hi> of a Party; and if this honour may not be bad, yet is it something to follow such a Leader, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in braving Authority to its Face; and it is no little glory to be thought wiser then the most, and especially then our Teachers and Governors, or to be thought sufficient to set up for our selves. And it is an odious thing to be told of our Errors and Faults, and more odious yet to tell our selves and our followers of them, to call our selves <hi>Fools,</hi> and confess we have <hi>befooled</hi> others. And if we contend not to uphold what we have done, we shall seem to <hi>destroy</hi> what we have <hi>built;</hi> or to suffer tamely that to be <hi>built,</hi> which we have destroy'd; and how into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable a thing is this to a <hi>proud</hi> Spirit? <hi>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife,</hi> Prov. 28. 25. But <hi>cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out, yea strife and reproach shall cease,</hi> Prov. 22. 10. From which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of these roots <hi>strife</hi> ariseth, or whatever else it may be that gives being to it, be sure we may, it is very evil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the <hi>next</hi> place, to shew how altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent this contentious humour is with the right <hi>Gospel</hi> temper, a very few words may suffice. The <hi>peaceable</hi> State of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was in the <hi>Prophets</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in such expressions as these. <hi>They shall beat their Swords into Plough-shares, and their Spears into Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Hooks,</hi> Isai. 2. 4. <hi>The Woolf also shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf and the young Lyon, and the Fatling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a little Child shall lead them. They shall not hurt nor destroy in my holy Mountain,</hi> Isai. 11. 6. &amp; 9.

Accordingly, we meet with nothing in the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but the sweet breathings of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> At the first revealing of our Blessed <hi>Saviours</hi> Nativity, those Heralds of Heaven, the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> are sent down into the World, to proclaim <hi>Glory to God in the Highest, on Earth Peace, good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men,</hi> Luk. 2. 14. He that then was born into the World was the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>work</hi> he had to do was to make <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> were <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>blessing</hi> was to the <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> and his Legacy at his death was <hi>Peace.</hi> He came to <hi>reconcile</hi> us unto <hi>God,</hi> and he came also to reconcile us one unto another, and <hi>to make of twain one new man,</hi> Eph. 2. 15. He himself was the great <hi>Exemplar</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> of <hi>Condescention</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> of whom it was said by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, He shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. A bruised Reed shall he not break, and smoaking Flax shall he not quench,</hi> Mat. 12. 19. He lived in all due obedience to the <hi>Powers,</hi> and in conformity to the <hi>Customs</hi> that then were; and commanded all to <hi>render unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that were</hi> Caesars, <hi>as well as unto God the things that are Gods,</hi> Mar. 12. 17. He smartly rebuked the two <hi>Sons of Thunder, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> when they would in imitation of <hi>Elias,</hi> have called down fire from Heaven on the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Village, that had affronted him; telling them, they understood not the true <hi>Gospel Spirit,</hi> Luk. 9. 55. When he was led <hi>like a Lamb before the Shearers, as one that is dumb so opened he not his mouth,</hi> Act. 8. 32. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatned not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 23. So little of <hi>contention</hi> was there to be seen in him. And he hath given in charge to all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65540:39"/>
that follow him, <hi>that is,</hi> to all <hi>Christians,</hi> to deny themselves, and take up his <hi>Cross,</hi> and to learn of him to be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly of heart;</hi> who disdained not to stoop so low, as to wash the <hi>Feet</hi> of his Disciples, and lower yet, to converse with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> Now, most certain it is, that <hi>if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. And his <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Peace, and Unity; and teacheth all that have it, not to <hi>hate,</hi> but to <hi>love</hi> their Enemies, not to <hi>curse</hi> but to <hi>bless</hi> them, not to render <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> but <hi>to overcome evil with good,</hi> Rom. 12. 21. And <hi>to pray for them that despitefully use and persecute us,</hi> Matt. 5. 44. And. <hi>The Servant of God</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing such as oppose themselves,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. And if this be spoken more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto the <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet is it not only, that they may know their own duties, but that they should teach others also <hi>to walk so as they had them for an example,</hi> Phil. 3. 17. And <hi>as much as in them lieth, live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12. 18. The <hi>Apostle</hi> ranketh <hi>strifes</hi> among the works of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> which they that do shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 20. They therefore that indulge this humour, must lay aside not only all pretence of being <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but all claim to the <hi>Kingdom of God. Whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of</hi> Paul; <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>are ye not carnal?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Where there is strife and envying, there is confusion and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3. 16.

3. And therefore <hi>lastly,</hi> must it needs be destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> unless any man can be so unreasonable as to think, that <hi>Confusions,</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schismes</hi> can consist with its <hi>happiness,</hi> which evils the <hi>Apostle</hi> joyns with <hi>strife,</hi> as the <hi>effects</hi> with their <hi>cause,</hi> or at least, as those close Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which are very rarely separated, <hi>Gal. 5. 20. &amp;c.</hi> Sure it is, that <hi>an house divided again<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t it self cannot stand,</hi> Matt. 12. 25. The strength of the Church which is the <hi>house of God,</hi> lieth in the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love. Strife</hi> is the very cutting asunder of that <hi>Bond of Peace</hi> wherein the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> is to be held. It is the violent forcing asunder the stones of the Spiritual Building, and dashing them in pieces one against another. <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Affections</hi> there can be none where <hi>strife</hi> comes, but <hi>a biting and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another, and being devoured one of another,</hi> Gal. 5. 15. And indeed an opening of a broad way to some common Enemy to enter in and make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of all. And the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is in no little danger. Men of a contentious Spirit are always brim full of <hi>Objections</hi> against every thing, and must swell till they burst, if they have not leave to give vent to their uneasie Souls (always in travel to bring forth something new) in troublesome <hi>disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which are soon begun, but not so soon ended. When the humour is once set abroach, it runs ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly. It would be labour to no purpose to say more of this, the mischiefs of <hi>Strife</hi> have been a long time too visible not to be seen of all, tho they seem to be too little considered by the most, even so visible as to render the <hi>visible Church</hi> of Christ on Earth almost <hi>invisible</hi> too. Let us only here add the wise <hi>Kings</hi> Observation, and, if it come not too late, as I hope it may not to some of us, let us take
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65540:40"/>
his advice too. <hi>The beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out water; therefore leave off contention before it be medled with,</hi> Prov. 17. 14.</p>
               <p>How this Malignant, and (God knows) at this day too predominant humour, which so destroyeth the healthful State of the <hi>Church,</hi> may be purged out, the <hi>Second</hi> Rule will teach us. In the mean time, a <hi>Question</hi> is, I suppose, ready to be here ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some, which seemeth not impertinent, and therefore deserveth some answer. It is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Are we <hi>Christians</hi> bound, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute at all, to swallow down every <hi>Doctrine</hi> which our Teachers shall commend unto our Faith? And must we without any Examination of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> or <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of the things injoyned, rest in the Will of our Superiors, applying our selves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado, to the executing of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? May we not oppose <hi>Falshood,</hi> and contend for the <hi>Truth,</hi> and refuse to do <hi>wickedly</hi> when we are bid by men in Authority?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> To this <hi>Question,</hi> which hath been often ask'd, and as often answered, we shall here answer only so far, as it seems to reflect upon the <hi>Rule</hi> here given, or what hath been said of it. We say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let it be far from any <hi>Christian</hi> to plead for or countenance an <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> and a <hi>blind Obedience;</hi> or to disswade any man from making use of his <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> in a sober inquiry into the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Falshood</hi> of any <hi>Doctrine</hi> that is Preached; or into the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> or <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of any <hi>Command</hi> which is given by men. All that we are to be disswaded from in this place is, that we do not any thing of this out of <hi>Strife,</hi> or with a <hi>quarrelsome</hi> and <hi>contentious</hi> mind. Do it in <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> and with a <hi>peaceable</hi> frame of Spirit, as men truely zealous for the <hi>Truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65540:41"/>
and desirous to do your duty to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and you shall neither hurt your selves, nor be obnoxious to the <hi>Woe</hi> which belongs to them by whom <hi>Offences</hi> come. More particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are commanded <hi>to search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. For tho those words were spoken to the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> and not to <hi>Christians;</hi> yet, by a Parity of reason, are we equally concern'd in the duty there injoyned. If they, having received of <hi>God</hi> the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> were obliged to search those Books for directions in both; and <hi>particularly</hi> to convince them of their present duty, now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Iesus</hi> as the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> to the saving of their Souls: as much cause have we, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Writings of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> as our <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holyness,</hi> to search them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and to try all things by them, that we may be sure we obey the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> without which there is no salvation to us. That we may be alway in a readiness <hi>to give an answer to every man that asketh us a reason of the hope that is in us with meekness and fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 15. And that we be <hi>no more Children, tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive,</hi> Eph. 4 14. <hi>And may not believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1. Leave we therefore this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith,</hi> and taking things on trust on the naked credit of our Teachers without all Search and Tryal of their Doctrine, to the Disciples of <hi>Rome,</hi> against whose <hi>new Faith</hi> were there nothing more to object, even this alone were enough to render it suspicious, that it is afraid of the <hi>Light,</hi> and of a fair Tryal by the <hi>Written Word. God</hi> forbid that we should put
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65540:41"/>
out mens eyes, and bid them stalk after others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven in the dark, so long as <hi>God</hi> himself hath both given them Eyes to see withal, and hath left them a plain <hi>Rule</hi> to walk by, and a strict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to observe it. A judgment of <hi>discretion</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>truth</hi> from <hi>falshood,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> from <hi>Evil,</hi> by such light as <hi>God</hi> hath given them, must be allow'd to all, if we will allow them to be <hi>Men</hi> and not <hi>Brutes.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let not this Universal Priviledge be abused to <hi>Strife.</hi> And that it may not be so, take these <hi>Directions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Have not the Faith of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Lord of Glory with respect of persons,</hi> Jam. 2. 1. These words of the <hi>Apostle Iames,</hi> whatever interpretation they admit of as there used, I may thus accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to the present matter. Let not the <hi>Enmity</hi> or <hi>Prejudice</hi> you have taken up against any man or party, nor yet the good <hi>opinion</hi> you have conceived of, or great <hi>affection</hi> for any such, byass or over-rule your search after the <hi>truth;</hi> let them not corrupt your Judgment, nor be your Motives to embrace <hi>some</hi> and reject <hi>other</hi> Doctrines. But impartially weigh them all in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and choose them by their own weight. Use men you may and must, as far as you need them, as helps to your own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but consider their <hi>reasons</hi> not their <hi>persons,</hi> and what <hi>help</hi> you have by them, not what <hi>opinion</hi> or <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> you have had for them; left you run into an Error not unlike that you condemn in the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> of pinning your <hi>Faith</hi> upon your <hi>Friends</hi> sleeve. For tho you thus may chance to hit upon the <hi>truth,</hi> yet shall you be found herein to act through <hi>Strife,</hi> and that infecteth even your belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of truth it self with sin.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65540:42"/>
2. Take heed of <hi>doting about Questions and Strifes of words, whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railings, Evil Surmisings, Perverse Disputings of men of corrupt minds,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 4. See that they be not things <hi>unprofitable and vain,</hi> Tit. 3. 9. that you are so earnest about. Were all <hi>word-bickerings,</hi> and <hi>impertinent disputes</hi> laid aside, we should soon see <hi>controversial</hi> Divinity reduced into a much narrower compass. Weigh well the matters in debate, and be sure there is something in them that will quit cost, and pay you well for your pains. Take heed, if the <hi>contention</hi> be but about a little <hi>straw,</hi> and things of very little or no concernment to mens <hi>Souls,</hi> or the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> that your <hi>zeal</hi> grow not too hot; lest you set all on fire, and burn down the House over your heads. Especially beware of that most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but very common disease of most wranglers, fighting about <hi>words,</hi> whilest you are agreed in the <hi>things</hi> themselves, and see it not for the much dust that slies in your eyes by your bustling about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Search for the <hi>Truth</hi> always, and that purely for the <hi>Truths</hi> sake, and the usefulness of it. To find out <hi>Gods Will,</hi> and not something that may suit with your <hi>own wishes,</hi> should be your design. That whereby <hi>God</hi> may be glorified, the <hi>World</hi> benefitted, your <hi>Souls</hi> saved, not your <hi>humours</hi> pleased. Some men seem to take great pains to search for the <hi>truth,</hi> as before-hand resolved to hold it no longer, or at least, not much to regard it, when they have found it upon any other account, then that they see some others hold an <hi>Error,</hi> whom they may be able to oppose with it: they value the <hi>truth</hi> for nothing so much, as for this, that it is a Warrant for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their faculty of <hi>wrangling</hi> and <hi>contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65540:42"/>
4. Search the <hi>Scriptures</hi> sincerely and reverently as the Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi> of life, not being <hi>partial</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>opinion</hi> which you have already taken up by chance, and are faln in love with. Take heed of wresting and forcing the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> to comply with your present <hi>Sentiments;</hi> or of picking out hete and there a broken piece of a Sentence to patch up your own thoughts withal; or how you judge of the sound of the <hi>words</hi> you hear, by the sound that already rings in your ears. Go to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of saving truth, resolving to fetch both your <hi>Opinions</hi> and your <hi>Practice</hi> thence, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect whatsoever is at present amiss in your self by them. This is to give <hi>God</hi> his due honour, and to let him be the sole Lord of your <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Content your selves with the most plain, easie, and obvious Truths; for those are also the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and least subject to <hi>disputes;</hi> and meet with least opposition on any hand, except it be from mens <hi>Lusts,</hi> and against those you have liberty to contend with all your might, so it be in your own <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Station,</hi> and with <hi>Christian Charity.</hi> Remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that in the <hi>Scriptures there be some things hard to be understood which the unlearned are apt to wrest to their own and others destruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16.

be ten to one, whether one of ten ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Have you found something, which seemeth to you to be a <hi>truth,</hi> whilest yet the greatest and most Learned part of the <hi>Christian</hi> World, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the <hi>Church</hi> wherein you live, thinketh it an <hi>Error?</hi> Set not your selves presently, as some <hi>Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> use to do, in the <hi>Pope's Chair.</hi> Remember you are at best, but <hi>fallible</hi> men, and should learn to be <hi>wise unto Sobriety.</hi> Love not to be troublesome to the World with your pretended <hi>Knowledge,</hi> neither be angry that all mens Judgments will not bow to yours. <hi>Hast thou Faith? have it to thy self before God,</hi> Rom. 4. 22. Think it not a duty in you, to make all the World know what you think you only know, or the duty of all men to learn of you. A good and humble <hi>Christian</hi> will satisfie himself in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving himself faithful to <hi>God</hi> and his own <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and will always have the <hi>Modesty</hi> to think, that many men in the World are <hi>wiser</hi> then he: and for this reason he cannot think it fit for him, either to <hi>pride</hi> himself in his singular opinions, or to <hi>vent</hi> them every where to draw <hi>Disciples</hi> after him, to the breach of the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace. We have a command indeed that <hi>our light so shine before men that they may see our good works, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven;</hi> but where is the command, to vent our opinions, that they may see our Wisdom and glorifie us upon Earth? Thus much concerning opinions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now to that part of the <hi>Question</hi> relating to the <hi>commands</hi> of <hi>Superiours,</hi> we may say again more generally, That it is a most certain truth, <hi>That we must obey God rather than men,</hi> Act. 5. 29. And that we are bound to use all the means that <hi>God</hi> hath put within our reach to be <hi>fully perswaded in our minds,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65540:43"/>
touching the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of every Action we go about, be it <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>uncommanded</hi> by our Superiours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. And we are well assured by the <hi>Apostle, That whatsoever is not of faith is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. And therefore no man ought to be debarred the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of securing his own Soul as well as he can, by examining the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of the things commanded. Only let this again be done without <hi>Strife. That is to say,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Make it manifest by your <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>unforced Obedience</hi> in all things, of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> whereof you are already satisfied, that your <hi>disobedience</hi> in other things, wherein you are not yet satisfied, is purely for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake, and not through <hi>Strife;</hi> but that as you <hi>obey</hi> cheerfully for the <hi>Lords</hi> sake, so if in any thing you <hi>disobey,</hi> 'tis purely for the <hi>Lords</hi> sake too. If this course had been taken in time by some men, they might, it is probable, at this day have seen the <hi>Wisdom</hi> as well as <hi>Iustice</hi> of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He that with-holdeth <hi>obedience</hi> upon pretence of <hi>unlawfulness</hi> only, must needs <hi>obey</hi> in all things which he granteth to be <hi>lawful,</hi> or else he utterly voids his own pretence, and declares himself more a lover of <hi>Strife</hi> than <hi>Conscience. Whereunto then we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing,</hi> Phil. 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In examining the <hi>Commands</hi> of Superiours, make it not your business to seek out something which you may with some colour for your <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> oppose against them, when you see before-hand no apparent reason, why you should not obey them. He that seeing no cause why he should not <hi>obey,</hi> goes to seek for one, sheweth plainly his affection to <hi>Strife,</hi> and that the reason of his <hi>disobedience</hi> is not <hi>unlawfulness</hi> but <hi>wilfulness.</hi> Take heed therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65540:44"/>
how your enmity to the <hi>Government</hi> send you a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for something to make the Commands of your Governors seem disputable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be well contented to be satisfied in your <hi>own</hi> Consciences, concerning the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of what is injoyned by publick <hi>Authority,</hi> and being so satisfied, take heed of two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you be not too forward to <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> those that are otherwise perswaded, and think it to be their duty to do, in <hi>obedience</hi> to their <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> what you dare not do. It is an uncharitable censure to say, that others act against their own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> as often as they will not be over-ruled by your <hi>Iudgments,</hi> or cannot be convinced by your <hi>Arguments.</hi> Too much of this Spirit of <hi>Strife</hi> and rash censuring seemeth to shew it self in some late <hi>Writings,</hi> wherein the Authors forgetting what they promised, a bare <hi>Vindication</hi> of, or rather <hi>Apology</hi> for themselves, fall into a down-right <hi>Accusation</hi> of others, even to that degree, as to deny them all possibility of satisfying their own Consciences in what they do. I do not see whither such things as these can tend, whatever was the intention of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to the gendering of <hi>Strifes,</hi> which I would fain hope them to be better Christians then to make their design. However let us study that healing Rule the <hi>Apostle</hi> giveth, <hi>Rom. 14. 3. Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth. Who art thou that judgest another Mans Servant? to his own Master he standeth or falleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not make it your business to put <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>scruples</hi> into the Consciences of <hi>others,</hi> to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of both their <hi>own</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace. The Itch of making <hi>Proselytes</hi> to every mans private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65540:44"/>
hath ever been as pernicious an evil to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as that which is commonly said of men in the <hi>Plague,</hi> were it true, would be to the Neighbourhood, that a part of their Disease is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to <hi>infect</hi> the Sound. Think well how you have enough to do, in a doubtful case, to answer <hi>God</hi> for your own disobedience to the Powers, unto which he hath commanded to be <hi>subject for Conscience sake,</hi> and therefore can have no need to engage your selves in that hard task of answering for the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>many,</hi> which they would never have been guilty of but through your perswasion.</p>
               <p>I shall now only add a few things to conclude this <hi>first</hi> point. Seeing man is so very restless a thing in this World, and it is so hard a matter quite to root out of him this humour of striving, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cut a way for it into its proper Chanel, where it may run freely, and men may <hi>strive</hi> to good purpose. Yet by the way we must be warned to put away all <hi>Rancor,</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Evil speaking,</hi> and all must be a <hi>Strife</hi> of <hi>Love. A man is not crowned, except he strive lawfully,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 5.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Strive</hi> we may then, and even <hi>for the Mastery to obtain the incorruptible Crown,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 25. And shew us any thing else, that's truely worth the <hi>stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> for. For this, let us all be perswaded to <hi>fight</hi> with all our might and courage, yet not with such Enemies as are the creatures of our own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or opinions; we have Enemies enow to hold us doing, and put us to all our shifts, besides those; even the same, which we have ingaged our selves in our <hi>Baptism</hi> to wage a continual <hi>War</hi> against, <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> He that knoweth what these are, knoweth he hath enough to strive against.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65540:45"/>
If we will have the <hi>Crown</hi> we must strive to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all these; this is to strive like a <hi>Christian</hi> indeed, and this is our encouragement, the <hi>Victory</hi> is sure, and it is a Noble <hi>Victory.</hi> Foolishly therefore do we wast our time, and our strength in <hi>contending</hi> with one another about <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Formalities,</hi> where he that conquereth shall but like the proud <hi>Emperor</hi> triumph in <hi>Cockle-shells.</hi> Surely we think but little whither we are going, or from what we flee, and what Enemies watch for our ruine, if we can be at leisure to stand bogling at Straws. Certainly we shall all have enough to do, without casting such rubs as these strifes are in our own way, to come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Strive together for the faith of the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 1. 27. But if we will do this indeed, we must as the <hi>Apostle</hi> there also faith, <hi>stand fast in the Spirit, with one mind.</hi> A scattered and divided Army is easily vanquished by piece-meal, which in a full body might have daunted the Enemy with the very sight of its <hi>number, order</hi> and <hi>unity.</hi> We cannot choose but be sensible that our <hi>Faith</hi> hath very considerable Enemies at this day, and how can we invent a way to do them better, or our selves worse service, then by keeping open our divisions, which hath cost them so much pains to make amongst us? O how do they hug themselves to see us so industrious to save them a labour, and ruine our selves? Let us but be <hi>united</hi> amongst our selves, and strive together for the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and we may confidently promise our selves what the <hi>Apostle</hi> there addeth, v. 28. <hi>We need be nothing terrified by our Adversaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the <hi>Ministers</hi> strive to preach <hi>Christ, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man and teaching every man in all Wisdom, that they may present them perfect in Christ Iesus.</hi> Unto
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65540:45"/>
this let them labour, <hi>striving according to his working, which worketh in them mightily,</hi> Col. 1. 28, 29. How much livelier a work would this be, how much more beseeming the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> set over the <hi>Flock,</hi> thus to feed and watch daily over the <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs,</hi> and combining together to keep them from the ravenous <hi>Wolves</hi> and wily <hi>Foxes,</hi> then to stand pelting one another with ill words only to make sport for the Adversary?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the <hi>People strive together with their Ministers in their Prayers to God for them,</hi> Rom. 15. 30. to this end, as it there follows, <hi>That they may be delivered from them that do not believe, and that their service may be accepted of the Saints.</hi> This would be a much more <hi>Christian</hi> and profitable work, then theirs of whom we read, Hos. 4. 4. <hi>The People are as they which strive with the Priest:</hi> whether it were, who should outdo other in wickedness, or to oppose his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> obstruct him in <hi>Discipline,</hi> or revile his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Function</hi> in all Companies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us all <hi>strive to enter in at the strait Gate,</hi> Luk. 13. 24. And who should go on fastest in that <hi>narrow way</hi> that leadeth unto Life Eternal. <hi>Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and provoking one another to love and good works,</hi> Heb. 10, 24. And not strive to anger and vex and revenge our selves on one another by <hi>unchristian</hi> and even <hi>inhumane</hi> affronts and injuries.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Strive against sin,</hi> Heb. 12. 4. Let our earnestness against this common Enemy of Mankind be as great as can be. Here exercise all our wrath and revenge. Let us be very bitter against it, have no pity on it, resolve never on any terms to be reconciled unto it, or be satisfied with any thing less then its death. Let us strive to subdue it and mortifie it in our selves, and to correct it as we have opportunity in others.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65540:46"/>
It is a much better work this, than making sins of those things which are none, of indifferent things, or cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aspersions of Sin upon others for those very things whereby they labour all they can to shun all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it in obeying their Superiors.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Lastly,</hi> let us <hi>strive</hi> who shall outgo others in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>meekness,</hi> and <hi>tenderness</hi> of affection, <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,</hi> and <hi>forbearing one another in love,</hi> Eph. 4. 2. Putting always the best and most favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble construction upon all one anothers words and actions, and exercising all our severity upon our selves, our sinful flesh and lusts. Seeking how we may <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things to all men, that we may by all means gain some,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 20. Not to a <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> of our own, but to <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let this suffice to have been said of the former of these two things, which we are to remove out of the way, in order to the introducing of Peace and Unity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> thing which we are to remove and put far from us is <hi>Vain-glory.</hi> And till this be put away, <hi>strife</hi> will abide, the <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> man will ever be <hi>contending,</hi> thinking it the likeliest way to be taken notice of for somebody. This indeed is more usually the Vice of <hi>Teachers,</hi> then of <hi>Learners.</hi> Yet is there no rank of men which is not troubled with some spice of it: In speaking whereof we must shew, 1. <hi>What it is, 2. Why to be avoided, 3. How to be cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Vain-glory</hi> is a Disease of Mind, whereby a man swells himself up to what bigness he can in the sight of the World. Either he hath a very high conceit of his own Excellencies, and Perfections, and is concerned that they are not as much taken notice of by others, as they are admired by himself; and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65540:46"/>
that all the World should not be as proud and fond of him, as he is of himself: or else, it may be, he is conscious enough of his own emptiness, and would make up what he wants of real worth at home, by the <hi>Estimation</hi> of others. <hi>Praise</hi> is the thing he thirsts for, and so he can get it, he cares not much what there is in him to deserve it. So he may but have a Name and Reputation of Wife, and Learned and Pious, and other ways gifted, and qualified above others, and as few are, and be pointed at by the Vulgar as he goeth for a <hi>few-such,</hi> he is well enough pleased with himself, whatever he be in truth; he can fall out with himself for nothing but his obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and too little care to make himself known abroad, or rather to deceive all men into a good opinion of him by seeming something that he is not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his Studies and Endeavours are bent upon this one thing, how to be <hi>known,</hi> and yet <hi>unknown;</hi> to have his <hi>person</hi> had in esteem and admiration; and his real worth unknown, lest the knowledge thereof should abate any thing of that <hi>reputation</hi> and <hi>fame,</hi> which he so insatiably thirsteth after. So he may be had in honour, and advanced to some hight, he is well enough content; what tho the <hi>Statue</hi> be but of <hi>common</hi> Wood or Stone, and have nothing in it of the life of vertue, or any thing else that's good, yet it stands in a publick place, and is finely painted, and guilt, and all that pass by look upon it and call it a fine thing, and fools admire it, and that's enough. This is the thing in short.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now why we must avoid this Vice of <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> we shall see cause enough, if we may but be brought to see, 1. <hi>How odious it is to men. 2. How disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God. 3. How contrary to the Gospel-spirit. 4. How destructive to our endeavours and hopes,</hi> and,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65540:47"/>
5. <hi>What a Plague it is to the Church and the Peace thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is certainly <hi>odious</hi> to <hi>men</hi> of what sort or complexion soever they be. It is a thing which no man can indure in any man but himself, and for which, more then for any one thing beside, <hi>good</hi> men are apt to fall out with themselves. The <hi>proud</hi> man, tho he can freely indulge himself in it, yet can least of any man see it with any patience in another, nor can he look upon him as any better then as a <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> man doth upon a <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Robber,</hi> because all praise and honour he accounts his own due, and thinks whoever gets it robbeth him of what is his. He therefore is sure to condemn it in all men, if for no other reason, yet for this, that it stands, as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> did betwixt the <hi>Sun</hi> and the Proud <hi>Cynick,</hi> too much in his <hi>light,</hi> and will not let him look so <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly</hi> as he would do. And the <hi>humble</hi> hates it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is <hi>humble,</hi> and hates every thing that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So that all the <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> man can get by his foolish ambition, is only that, which above all things he abhorreth and most studiously endeavoureth to prevent, <hi>that is,</hi> when ever he is discovered, to be despised of all. But this is little.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vain-glory is a thing most <hi>odious</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> How should any man think otherwise, that knoweth what <hi>God</hi> is, and what is due to <hi>him</hi> from his <hi>Creature?</hi> All <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> because all <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is so, are <hi>his,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> his: and hence the <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> man is the most <hi>sacrilegious</hi> man in the World, and a greater <hi>Robber of God,</hi> then they that rob him of <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> taking to himself the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> due unto <hi>God's</hi> name, whereof he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself to be very <hi>jealous.</hi> The <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> man may be called an <hi>Idolater</hi> without a figure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65540:47"/>
an <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>himself,</hi> and desirous that all the World should worship him. This we are plainly told, and that's enough, <hi>God resisteth the Proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How contrary <hi>Vain-glory</hi> is to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is so visible, as nothing can be more. Our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iesus</hi> hath more particularly commended his own <hi>example</hi> to our imitation herein, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I am meek and lowly of heart,</hi> Matt. 11. 29. <hi>He sought not his own glory, but the glory of him that sent him,</hi> Joh. 8. 50. 7. 18. He took especial care to prick this Bladder in his Disciples as soon as he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spied it beginning to rise in any of them, as in the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Zebedee, Matt. 20. 25, 26. Self-denial</hi> was one of the principal Lessons he taught them, and he hath left it upon record for our instruction, that one great reason why no more <hi>believed</hi> on him and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came true <hi>Christians</hi> was this, that <hi>they received honour one of another, and sought not that honour that cometh from God only,</hi> Joh. 5. 44. And <hi>loved the praise of men more then the praise of God,</hi> Joh. 12. 43. Now saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> at the 5th <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Iesus.</hi> What that was he tells us, <hi>v. 7. He made himself of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but took upon him the form of a Servant, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself.</hi> If we will then be the followers of <hi>Christ,</hi> and walk worthy of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> this is the mind we must be of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It certainly blasteth all our very best <hi>performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and destroyeth all the <hi>hopes</hi> we had of a blessing upon them. Even all those otherwise <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> Acts, which done in <hi>love</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are most highly acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> and have his sure promise of an everlasting reward, such as are <hi>Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Alms-giving,</hi> when thus <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaically</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:65540:48"/>
performed for <hi>ostentation</hi> and to be seen of men, must all be content to take up with that poor, airy, pittiful thing, the <hi>plaudite</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> of a few sinners, instead of the approbation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>God,</hi> that, <hi>well done good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> Matt. 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Lastly,</hi> how this <hi>Vain-glory</hi> pestereth the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> and disturbeth daily the <hi>Peace</hi> of it, is a thing needless to shew in many words. It hath reigned too long in the World to have the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mischiefs it hath done in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in all Ages, concealed from any observing man. When once any man is infected with this disease, he groweth restless in himself, he longeth to go abroad, and to become <hi>popular,</hi> to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and thought a wise man in his generation, a <hi>Master</hi> in <hi>Israel;</hi> and then <hi>Conscience</hi> must be laid aside of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, as a thing which would mightily disturb him in his way to <hi>glory,</hi> tho a <hi>pretence</hi> to it, and to a very great tenderness of it, must by no means be made away, for that's the best staff he hath to lean upon. Such men always think themselves too much hid in the Crowd of ordinary <hi>Christians;</hi> alas, what <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> can it bring them to <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>speak,</hi> or <hi>write</hi> as other good <hi>Christians</hi> do? Or what <hi>glory</hi> can come of living by the same <hi>common</hi> rules, whereby the whole body of <hi>Christians</hi> are to be governed, tho they be such as <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath given? They are not only Papists that affect works of <hi>Super-erogation.</hi> The man that will be <hi>Famous,</hi> must resolve to step out boldly before the rest, and attempt something that others dare not do, venture to be <hi>singular</hi> in some new Doctrine or Practice, that men may take particular notice of him, and admire his <hi>Wisdom</hi> or his <hi>Courage,</hi> saying, Shew us another man that <hi>could</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:65540:48"/>
or <hi>durst</hi> do this. Nor can such an one be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Company, he that cannot have the honour of the <hi>first invention,</hi> will strive for that of the <hi>first approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> thinking it some praise to be first able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Wisdom of a wiser then himself. Men will rather be content with a <hi>fame</hi> at second hand then want it. And if he cannot maintain the Novelty by dispute; yet is it possible, he may soon be taught a Catalogue of bad names, and when he hath them once on his Tongue, whether he understand them or not, he can bestow them as freely as another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing he is bid to shew his dislike of; especially on those <hi>dull</hi> Souls that can so contentedly go on in those beaten Roads wherein good <hi>Christians</hi> have so long walked before them. Should we take a view of all the <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> which have troubled and rent the <hi>Church</hi> from its first Plantation to this day, it is very probable we might find most of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from this never-failing Spring of <hi>Vain-glory.</hi> I close this with those words of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Gal. 5. 26. <hi>Let us not be desirous of Vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Some may possibly here ask, Whether we <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> should be wholly regardless of our <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> in the World, and unconcerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have a <hi>good name</hi> amongst men or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> To such we say with <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 7. 1. <hi>A good name is better then precious Oyntment. And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be chosen then great Riches,</hi> Prov. 22. 1. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ought to be truely tender of his <hi>Reputation,</hi> even with b<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d men if possible, this affording him many special advantages of doing <hi>God</hi> better service among them. <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> are no despicable things, and they may be sought and upheld in due place as well as <hi>Riches</hi> and other Earthly Blessings
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65540:49"/>
without offence to God or Man. Let us only take heed that we take the right course to do both, and secure to our selves the true honour of really <hi>being,</hi> and not <hi>seeming</hi> only wise and <hi>good,</hi> and all will be well. To this purpose take but a few Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See that <hi>God</hi> have his due <hi>honour</hi> intirely to himself, and let us be content with ours as it shall fall unto us. Let our principal care be to seek the <hi>honour that cometh from God only,</hi> and to have his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and <hi>well done</hi> in every thing, and we shall hardly want so much as is due unto us, or at least is fit for us, from men. To <hi>honour God</hi> is our great duty, and our great incouragement is this, <hi>Them that honour him, he will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and how far we shall be <hi>honour'd</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> whilst we are doing our duty, the only thing to which it can belong, let us leave it to <hi>God,</hi> that ordereth all things. <hi>By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honour, and life,</hi> Prov. 22. 4. If he give them, praise him, and return all we receive unto him: if we want the honour men should give, let this suffice us, that we can approve our selves unto God, <hi>By ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dishonour, by evil report and good report,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having made sure that <hi>God</hi> have his <hi>honour</hi> from us, and from all men as far forth as it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to promote it. Let us use the proper means to gain and keep up a good reputation among men; yet not so much for our <hi>own</hi> sakes, as for <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>theirs.</hi> Let us conscienciously do our duties, every man in his respective place and calling, by this means we shall be sure either to <hi>get</hi> a <hi>good name,</hi> or not to <hi>deserve</hi> a <hi>bad</hi> one. A good name thus gotten is very valuable, because it may be very serviceable to us to many good purposes, both in relation to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65540:49"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> whom we serve, and to other men with whom we have to do, and to our selves as an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to greater Alacrity in our duty. But let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How we make our <hi>own</hi> reputation the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal motive or end of what we do, for this is to seek our own honour more than <hi>God,</hi> and to rob him of the honour due unto his name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How we seek to raise up to our selves a <hi>rame</hi> by any <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>wickedness,</hi> or an <hi>hypocritical</hi> shew of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for this were to build our reputation upon God's dishonour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How we endeavour to build our <hi>own</hi> reputation upon the ruine of <hi>another</hi> mans, for this is a sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both the <hi>Iustice</hi> and the <hi>Charity</hi> which we owe unto all men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How we abuse our <hi>reputation</hi> amongst men to the countenancing of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> or any evil thing whatsoever. In short.</p>
               <p>Let our <hi>own</hi> glory always stoop and veyl to the Glory of <hi>God,</hi> the Edification of the <hi>Church,</hi> the Peace and Tranquility of <hi>State,</hi> the subjection which we owe to our <hi>Superiors,</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and it shall be no <hi>Vain-glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How both these, <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> are to be cast out, we must learn by the second <hi>Rule</hi> given us in the Text, of which we are now to speak.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>In lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves.</hi> Such a measure of <hi>Humility</hi> as will make men <hi>esteem others better than themselves,</hi> will by rooting out <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> settle the <hi>Church</hi> in a blessed <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How this Doctrine will be entertain'd and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this <hi>proud</hi> Age, <hi>God</hi> alone knows, and to him we must leave it, when we have done our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>your.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65540:50"/>
Our Task at this time is, 1. <hi>To lay down a brief Description of the Grace commended, lowliness of mind. 2. To shew its great Efficacy for the rooting out of Strife and Vain-glory, the two grand Enemies to Love and Peace.</hi> And, 3. <hi>To declare the Practice of it in esteeming each other better than our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Grace or Vertue which is here commended to us is <hi>Humility</hi> or <hi>lowliness of mind.</hi> A <hi>Grace</hi> which abundantly commends it self, and engageth the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of all that see it, wherever it is; but as all things of greatest worth commonly are, almost as rare as it is excellent. One most illustrious <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of it we have to imitate, which, were its worth unknown, is enough to commend it unto all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and if it do not so, they are not <hi>Christians,</hi> whatever they are pleased to call themselves. Look upon the whole <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of him who came to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and you see this Divine Vertue expressed to the life. How wonderful then must it be, that it should be so great a stranger in the <hi>Christian</hi> World, and so few that bear the name of <hi>Christ</hi> have any intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with it? Tho all commend it in others, yet few labour to find it in themselves. <hi>This is it.</hi> An holy frame and temper of Spirit whereby a man doth most heartily give <hi>all</hi> honour possible to <hi>God,</hi> as much as is <hi>due</hi> to every <hi>man,</hi> and is content with a very <hi>little</hi> for <hi>himself.</hi> It wholly emptieth him of all Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, checketh in him all aspiring thoughts, maketh him truely sensible what he is, and teacheth him not to think of himself above what he finds himself to be, and to be content although others shall think him to be much less than indeed he is. The humble man is very much in considering himself to be the <hi>Creature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to depend wholly upon him, and to have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65540:50"/>
nothing at all but only what it had pleased God to bestow upon him. He considereth yet farther that he is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and that he offendeth <hi>God</hi> daily, and serveth him at best very imperfectly and weakly, that he hath often abused <hi>God's</hi> Goodness, and is thereupon become less than the least of his Mercies: he acknowledgeth that his <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>infirmities</hi> are much more than his <hi>Abilities,</hi> and that there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Creature of <hi>God,</hi> but doth now, as he is a sinner, excel him in something, at least, in <hi>innocence;</hi> and that in one respect or other he stands in as much need of them, as any of them do of him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth how unable he is of himself to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to any thing that is <hi>good,</hi> either for his <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> without the assistance and blessing of another. And now considering all this, and much more to this purpose, his own <hi>Glory</hi> vanisheth from his sight, he entertaineth low and just thoughts of himself, as a <hi>poor, weak, wicked,</hi> and for that, a very <hi>contemptible</hi> Creature, that can deserve nothing at the hands of <hi>God,</hi> not do either <hi>God</hi> or his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> or <hi>himself</hi> any considerable part of that <hi>service</hi> which he ought to do. He looketh upon all that he hath as anothers free gift and bounty. He looketh upon all that he doth or can do in relation to <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and <hi>himself,</hi> as imperfect at best, and, without <hi>God's</hi> Blessing, <hi>vain</hi> if not <hi>hurtful.</hi> And hence, he looketh upon himself as a very <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>useless</hi> thing, but only as he may be an <hi>instrument</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Good God,</hi> and may by the Power and Wisdom of his <hi>Manager</hi> be directed to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good. From hence it also cometh, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this humble man hath, he holds himself, as a debtor to <hi>God</hi> for it, so also most unworthy of it, and it, whatever it be, too good for him; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65540:51"/>
but admire <hi>Gods</hi> goodness and bounty to such a thing as he is, in permitting him yet to live. If he suffer any evil, he accounts it a very light thing in comparison of what he hath deserved to suffer, and therefore repines not at the greatness of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but admireth <hi>Gods</hi> goodness still in dealing so <hi>gently</hi> with him, and blesseth him that they are no greater. Whatsoever he doth, if it be <hi>sinful,</hi> he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it all to himself, he owns the <hi>shame</hi> of it, and thinks of himself as a <hi>sinner</hi> ought to do: and if it be <hi>good,</hi> he blesseth <hi>God</hi> that hath enabled him to do it, and calleth nothing of it his own besides the imperfections of it, nor can he think any part of the World beholden to him for doing but a very little part of his duty in it and very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Nothing that he either is, or hath, or doth, can swell him up with any proud thoughts of himself, but still he is less in his own eyes than he can be in any mans else, and accounts himself a very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thing. This is a man of a lowly mind. And that this is a right Christian temper sufficiently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from two things which I need but only name.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it hath so much of the Image of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> visible in it, who made himself of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as before we saw.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it hath his Special Blessing resting upon it. <hi>Blessed are the Poor in spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> Matt. 5. 3. Which I shall now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose enough to commend this lovely Vertue to the Practice of <hi>Christians;</hi> and proceed to the second thing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To shew in a few words the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Vertue,</hi> to drive out <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory.</hi> And the thing is so obvious, that <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this</hi> only can do that work, that it seemeth even needless to say any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65540:51"/>
thing of it. For if <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, by <hi>Pride cometh Contention,</hi> then by what else but <hi>Humility</hi> can <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> come? The <hi>proud</hi> man knows not how to be <hi>peaceable</hi> except it be by the help of some other Vice, such as <hi>Laziness, Covetousness,</hi> or especially, <hi>Cowardice.</hi> And the <hi>humble</hi> man knows not how to be <hi>contentious,</hi> because he is <hi>humble.</hi> Alas, saith the <hi>humble</hi> hearted <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> what am I, that any the least disturbance ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> should be made either by or for such a poor Worm as I am, or for a thousand such as I? He hath not such high thoughts of his own Wisdom, as to turn <hi>proud fool,</hi> and think that he may not be deceived as well as other men, or ought to be humour'd in his mistakes more then they, therefore is it alway far from him to commend his own <hi>judgment</hi> or <hi>opinion</hi> unto others as the true Standard whereby he would have them measure <hi>theirs.</hi> How great soever such a mans <hi>knowledge</hi> is, be sure his <hi>modesty</hi> is as great, and this will ever restrain him from making his knowledge a trouble to the World. He will heartily bless <hi>God</hi> for enabling him by it to do others any service in seasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and directions in their course to Heaven; but he hath no temptation at all by it, to obtrude himself upon all men as their only <hi>Iudge</hi> of right or wrong. He is so far from an eager desire and hunting after the <hi>praise</hi> of men, and all affectation of <hi>popularity,</hi> that there is hardly any thing he more dreads, then the applause and admiration of the <hi>many;</hi> and nothing is apt to humble him more, by making him grow jealous of himself, knowing well how hard it is for a Multitude to agree in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of what is good. He thinks every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> allots him in this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65540:52"/>
World so good, and indeed so much too good for him, as far exceeding his deserts, that he concludes it very misbecoming him to make any bustle to get up higher: and he is so well satisfied with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Door-keeper</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or of sitting at <hi>Iesus feet</hi> to hear his <hi>words;</hi> that he hath no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition at all to be called of men <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med some <hi>great</hi> one, and admired by the <hi>gazing</hi> Multitude. His mean and modest opinion of his own improvements makes him indeed very inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and industrious to learn of any man that he thinks able to teach him those things whereof he supposeth himself ignorant: and he blesseth <hi>God</hi> for the opportunity, and both loves and honours his Teachers, and acknowledgeth by whom he hath profited: and if he attain to that competent stock of knowledge as may fit him to teach others, he doth it freely as the payment of a due debt, and he doth it as humility commands him, not scornfully and disdainfully, not proudly and imperiously <hi>Lording it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mens faith, but as an helper of their joy,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 24. Not <hi>Preaching himself, but Christ Iesus the Lord, and himself their servant for Iesus sake,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 5. Serving them in love, as the Servant of him that came not to be <hi>ministred</hi> unto, but to <hi>minister;</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring not to his own fame, but to the needs of mens Souls. His <hi>humble</hi> thoughts of his own merits, make him well content with the honour and respect that is bestow'd upon him be it never so little, and all his care is how to deserve that little better then he thinks he hath yet done; and to pay all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, honour and obedience which he finds owing from himself to others, willing to condescend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is not sinful be it never so low, for the good and quiet of that part of the World wherein
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65540:52"/>
he liveth. What am I (saith he alway) that for my sake or satisfaction, or the gratifying my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or opinion, the publick peace should suffer, or any the least bustle should be made in the World? Thus it is impossible for <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory</hi> to live where <hi>Humility</hi> reigneth, it will certainly pull down every high thing that exalteth it self against <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us now see how this lowliness of mind is to be put in practice, and set on work, that it may effect this blessed and most desireable reformation, which we have all the reason in the World most heartily to pray for, and most strenuously to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And this must be its work, to teach us to <hi>esteem each other better then our selves.</hi> This is the work of <hi>Humility,</hi> but where shall we find <hi>Humility</hi> enough to do this <hi>work? Humility</hi> not only maketh a man <hi>little</hi> in his own eyes, but others <hi>great;</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to depress himself, that other men may have the advantage of him. A <hi>Work</hi> this, of which I fear I may say, as was said of that, Act. 13. 41. <hi>It is a work which men will in no wise believe, tho a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto them.</hi> O that men would be perswaded to think that such a thing can be, as this <hi>esteeming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers better then our selves.</hi> Indeed it is such a <hi>work</hi> as necessarily requireth the help of the mighty <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> mans <hi>proud</hi> heart will not down so <hi>low</hi> by any less power. But if we see not this effect of <hi>Humility</hi> in the practice of such as we take to be <hi>humble,</hi> let us not say that <hi>Humility</hi> cannot do it, but that there is not <hi>Humility</hi> enough to do it. Let <hi>Humility</hi> be <hi>Humility</hi> indeed, and it will do it. For this being its proper <hi>work,</hi> to make a man very <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> in his own thoughts, a little thing will serve if they have any so much as shew of <hi>goodness</hi> at all, to make others seem <hi>better.</hi> It needs not much <hi>goodness,</hi> that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65540:53"/>
is only to be thought better then what is thought <hi>stark naught.</hi> It is however a piece of <hi>Self-denial</hi> which every Disciple of <hi>Christ</hi> is bound to learn. And tho every man be a great lover and admirer of himself upon any very slender account <hi>naturally,</hi> yet <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> will cast the Soul into another mould, and make us <hi>new Creatures,</hi> and then we shall be able to do greater matters.</p>
               <p>But, say some, how is it possible we should esteem men contrarily to what we see them to be? And we cannot but be perswaded that we see many men much worse and wickeder than we our selves are, and to say that we think them otherwise would be to lie.</p>
               <p>Well, suppose you think them, according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>worse</hi> than your selves; have you done enough to assure your selves that it is not the want of <hi>Humility</hi> that maketh them <hi>appear</hi> worse? Are you sure that if you saw with the <hi>humble</hi> mans eyes, things would not appear to you much otherwise then now they do? Think not the <hi>Apostle</hi> here gives a <hi>Rule</hi> which no man can follow, but learn to be more <hi>humble,</hi> and perhaps the matter may prove very easie Let us try therefore what <hi>Humility</hi> will do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider we then <hi>otber</hi> men, that they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really better then we, or really worse. The one of these two they must be, except we may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them really in all points exactly our <hi>Equals,</hi> which if they should chance to be, it is impossible for us to discern it, and therefore humility will be sure to weigh down the Scale on their side.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If others be really better then we, there needs not much <hi>Humility</hi> to <hi>esteem</hi> them <hi>better;</hi> it is no act of <hi>condescention</hi> in us to account them as good as they are. 'Tis a debt we owe to <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> to value them as much as they are worth, and in doing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65540:53"/>
otherwise we should sin against <hi>God</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> Against <hi>God,</hi> by not honouring <hi>him</hi> in his <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> and so much of his <hi>Image</hi> as we discern in any one. And against <hi>them,</hi> in with-holding from them that which <hi>God</hi> hath made their <hi>due,</hi> the <hi>pre-eminence</hi> unto which he hath exalted them in any kind; in not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them whom <hi>God</hi> hath pleased to honour. We ought both in <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and in <hi>justice</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> behave our selves towards them as our <hi>Superiors,</hi> whom it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> to place above us. The reasonableness and equity of this I need not to spend time or words to demonstrate, seeing no man can be so void of reason, as not to think it <hi>just,</hi> that all real <hi>goodness</hi> or <hi>excellency</hi> should have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> tho all men have not (I may say, but a few men have) that <hi>Humility</hi> to acknowledge those <hi>Excellencies</hi> which are in other men. Nay such is the crossness and perverseness of mens spirits, that instead of <hi>honouring,</hi> too many have wickedness enough to <hi>envy, malign</hi> and <hi>calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> all such as they see <hi>above</hi> themselves in any <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>Vertue, Place</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> whatsoever. And whence is all this, but from the want of <hi>Humility,</hi> (shall I say,) or rather <hi>Humanity,</hi> and that confessed piece of <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>doing to all others as they would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>others</hi> be not <hi>better,</hi> but really <hi>worse</hi> then we, yet if we could but once be brought to understand the work of true <hi>Humility,</hi> we should soon see, that it would teach us to think much otherwise of them, then yet our <hi>Pride</hi> will suffer us to do: and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing violence to <hi>truth,</hi> or undervaluing any <hi>Gift</hi> which it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> to give us more then other men. Let us consider but these few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility</hi> will teach us to descend very low in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65540:54"/>
our selves, and to discover very much evil in our selves which lieth hid from other men. It keeps the thoughts very much at <hi>home,</hi> and suffereth them not to ramble much <hi>abroad,</hi> to spie wonders in <hi>other</hi> mens houses to talk of, and busie themselves with, when they should be observing the <hi>Slut-holes</hi> and <hi>dirty</hi> corners of their <hi>own.</hi> The <hi>humble</hi> mans eye is very much fixed upon his own sins, infirmities and failings. And when at any time he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his <hi>own</hi> good qualities, of what kind soever they be, as it is his duty to do, it is not his business to make comparisons with others, to see how much <hi>he</hi> excelleth <hi>them,</hi> but to compare <hi>himself</hi> with <hi>himself,</hi> and observe how much he is improved in Grace and Knowledge, and how much better these have made him then formerly he was; and this carries his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations up to God in the first place, in praise and admiration of his infinite goodness who hath done so great things for him; and <hi>next,</hi> unto the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of these qualifications, how they fit him to serve <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> But nothing of this can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider without exercising his <hi>Humility</hi> in reflecting on his <hi>own</hi> unworthyness, the thoughts of his former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyness serve him to heighten his admiration of, and thankfulness for <hi>Gods</hi> bounty to such a sinner, and the thoughts of <hi>Gods</hi> goodness in thus inriching him lessen his esteem of <hi>himself,</hi> and bring him to a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of <hi>Humility,</hi> whilst he thinks with himself, how little he answereth the end of so much goodness, and how little good in the World he doth in respect of what <hi>God</hi> hath fitted him with ability to do. Thus he never wants work enough at <hi>home</hi> for his thoughts to busie themselves, so that they have but little leisure to search into the failings and weaknesses of his <hi>Neighbours:</hi> and when he unwillingly sees
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65540:54"/>
them, they are apt to seem but <hi>Motes</hi> to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Beams</hi> in his Eye, his <hi>own</hi> sins, which he is apt so much to magnify, that the sins of <hi>others</hi> seem small things to him in comparison of his <hi>own;</hi> or he considers them only so, as to endeavour their <hi>Correction</hi> not their <hi>Aggravation.</hi> The <hi>humble</hi> man cannot be <hi>vile</hi> in any measure, but he will be more <hi>vile</hi> still in his own eyes. But this same <hi>Grace,</hi> and that other, which is never absent from it, <hi>Charity,</hi> directs a mans eye most unto the <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi> that are to be seen in others; which shine so much to him that for them he cannot see their <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> Their <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of any kind he thinks it of some concernment to himself to see and learn and imitate, and to praise <hi>God</hi> for, admiring his goodness to <hi>others</hi> as well as to himself. But as for their <hi>infirmities</hi> and <hi>failings,</hi> they mostly concern <hi>God</hi> and their own <hi>Consciences;</hi> and his <hi>Humility</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to leave them to <hi>God,</hi> and to take no further notice of them, then <hi>Charity</hi> and his <hi>place</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> hath set him command: and <hi>these</hi> will never command us to think men worse then our selves, but to endeavour to make them better then they are. Thus <hi>Humility</hi> rendring our <hi>own</hi> faults, yea such as <hi>others</hi> would count none, very visible to us; and those of <hi>other</hi> men, either not at all, or so far only as they are of publick cognizance, reasonably moveth us to esteem them <hi>better</hi> then <hi>our selves. Charity co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppose we <hi>next,</hi> that very many evils in <hi>other</hi> men do visibly appear to us, yet still many of our own will also appear, if we be <hi>humble;</hi> and in all likelyhood many more in our selves then in them. And besides those many in our selves, which we daily observe, we know there be, and <hi>Humility</hi> maketh us
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65540:55"/>
think there are very many <hi>secret</hi> sins lurking within our hearts, watching an opportunity to break forth, and many that have privately broken forth and esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our notice in the passage, which do not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us. So that how many soever the visible sins of <hi>other</hi> men be, yet still the <hi>humble</hi> man fears he goes beyond them in number and weight too. However, when the <hi>humble</hi> man comes upon any occasion to compare <hi>himself</hi> with <hi>other</hi> men, his wont is, not to consider <hi>other</hi> mens <hi>failings</hi> but his <hi>own,</hi> neither his <hi>own vertues</hi> but the <hi>vertues</hi> of <hi>other</hi> men. And as <hi>Pride</hi> teacheth a man to compare his own <hi>vertues</hi> with other mens <hi>vices,</hi> as the proud <hi>Pharisee</hi> did, that he may find something in himself to boast of: so <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> teacheth a man a quite contrary course, to compare his own <hi>vices</hi> with other mens <hi>vertues,</hi> that he may be yet more <hi>humble,</hi> and think himself with the <hi>Apostle</hi> the <hi>chief of Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We will yet go farther, and suppose that <hi>other</hi> mens <hi>Vices</hi> and failings may be much more visible to us then our own, and their <hi>apparent</hi> vertues by much fewer then our <hi>own;</hi> yet the <hi>humble</hi> man, when he comes to lay the <hi>one</hi> against the <hi>other,</hi> is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cast in all the advantage, and make all the allowances to others that can be imagined. He can partly know, and as far as he can know them, he is sure to take into consideration all the numerous <hi>aggravations</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> sins, and is very apt sometimes to lay on too much weight, even till he press down his Soul almost into despair. But as he knows he cannot see into all the <hi>aggravations</hi> of <hi>another</hi> mans sins, being unable to see into the heart; so doth <hi>Charity</hi> restrain him alway from making any narrow search into them. And hence it is, that though <hi>other</hi> mens sins may be as visible to him as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65540:55"/>
his <hi>own,</hi> so far as they lie open and obvious to the view of all men, yet shall his own be made always to out-weigh <hi>theirs</hi> in the aggravating circumstances which others cannot see. And again, on the other hand, the <hi>humble</hi> man considereth all the <hi>opportunities, advantages</hi> and <hi>incouragements himself</hi> hath had to be vertuous, and then all the good he doth, how much soever others value it, and see great cause to bless <hi>God,</hi> and love <hi>him</hi> for it, shall yet seem <hi>little</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> compared with what he thinks both might and ought to have been done by him. And as much doth his Charity prompt him to excuse the little he seeth done by others, by a supposition of the want in them of all those helps which he hath had. Thus therefore is he always saying to himself, What tho my Neighbours faults seem more than mine? What tho the good that he hath done seem much below what I have done? His <hi>knowledge,</hi> it may be is much less then mine; his <hi>opportunities</hi> of learning much fewer then I have had; his <hi>natural faculties,</hi> which is not his fault, may be much weaker; he wanted, it may be, the wise <hi>Instructors</hi> and faithful <hi>Monitors</hi> which I have never lacked; he met with many and strong <hi>temptations,</hi> and lay under many <hi>difficulties,</hi> which I have been in good measure free from: Were I under such <hi>Circumstances,</hi> I should, it may be, sin much more then <hi>he,</hi> and do less good then he: and were <hi>he</hi> in my <hi>Circumstances,</hi> had <hi>he</hi> the same <hi>means</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>opportunities</hi> of doing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously, and lay under the same <hi>restraints</hi> from sin, it is probable <hi>he</hi> would do and live much better than I have done. Thus the <hi>humble</hi> man is very apt to blame <hi>himself,</hi> but any thing rather then his <hi>Brother.</hi> Yea rather then not esteem him <hi>better</hi> then <hi>himself,</hi> he will charge much of his evil upon himself, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65540:56"/>
say, if <hi>he</hi> be wicked, it is much <hi>my</hi> fault, who have not done what I ought to make him good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the <hi>humble</hi> man be put to compare <hi>his own</hi> Vertues with <hi>other</hi> mens Vertues, and his <hi>own</hi> Vices with other mens Vices, (which it is hard to bring him to) he will set <hi>Vertue</hi> against <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> against <hi>Vice</hi> so long, that if it be possible by any means to bring it to pass, the Scales of Vertues shall ascend, and that of Vices descend on his <hi>own</hi> side. And thus will he argue <hi>for</hi> his Brother against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. I excel him it may be in one thing, but for ought I know he excelleth me in many. I may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be free from some sins whereof he is guilty, but it is not unlikely he is free from many more that I find my self guilty of. If I be more sober, yet may he be more <hi>Charitable</hi> and <hi>liberal,</hi> and I by my <hi>sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> do good to my self, but he by his <hi>liberality</hi> doth good to many. I may be less <hi>prodigal,</hi> but he is less <hi>covetous;</hi> I may be less <hi>careful</hi> for the World, but he is more <hi>serviceable</hi> to the World. I may pray oftener and longer, but he <hi>prayeth</hi> more heartily. I may be more <hi>zealous,</hi> but he is less <hi>censorious.</hi> I may be more <hi>chaste,</hi> but he may be more <hi>peaceable;</hi> I may be more <hi>active,</hi> but he may be more <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble;</hi> I may be more <hi>wise,</hi> but still he is the <hi>better</hi> man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If he can none of these ways give his <hi>Neighbour</hi> the <hi>advantage</hi> of himself, yet hath he not done, nor can he have done, till if possible, he do it. What, <hi>saith he,</hi> tho I see little good in him, may there not be much that I cannot see? He <hi>talketh</hi> not so much of <hi>Religion</hi> as I do, it is his <hi>modesty,</hi> he is afraid of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy,</hi> he is afraid it may become too <hi>vile</hi> by being made a <hi>common talk</hi> His <hi>Humility</hi> is too great to let him shew himself too openly; he is afraid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World into too good an opinion of him,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65540:56"/>
or give occasion to any man to over-value him, or lest by admiring his vertues they should be tempted to imitate his vices. I dare not judge him as bad as he seems, except I could see as far into his heart, as I can into his outward behaviour. Tho this be bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet there may be some spark of <hi>Grace</hi> within, that lying yet raked up in corruption, and by an <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi> of nature to comply with the customs of men, and an immoderate <hi>bashfulness</hi> to resist the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of company, or a <hi>timorousness</hi> of nature to venture on the cross, and the like hinderances; or for want of good <hi>means</hi> and <hi>helps,</hi> is kept from acting and warming the Soul with true <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Piety;</hi> yet it may in due time get life and strength and shew it self. And as I see not what good there is within <hi>him,</hi> so neither do I see half that evil that is within <hi>my self, the heart is deceitful above all things, who can know it?</hi> Yea every man is apt to be too favourable to <hi>himself,</hi> and too severe a censurer of <hi>others,</hi> and it is safest for me to judge <hi>my self,</hi> and leave others to stand or fall to their own Master. There is nothing I have more cause to fear then a <hi>spiritual Pride, Publicanes</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> are justified sooner than a proud <hi>Pharisee</hi> that despiseth and croweth over them. <hi>Humility</hi> stands more in the way of the sinner then of the conceited <hi>Iusticiary.</hi> It will be seen at the last day who is <hi>best, he</hi> or <hi>I.</hi> Now 'tis enough that <hi>God</hi> knows it, who will then judge righteously. Be he <hi>better,</hi> be he <hi>worse,</hi> I am content he should <hi>take place</hi> of me in my <hi>own</hi> esteem. It is my duty to set <hi>Strangers</hi> above me in mine <hi>own</hi> house. I may lose something on earth by my <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> but <hi>Pride</hi> will certainly keep me out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I may safely esteem <hi>others better</hi> then <hi>my self,</hi> till I can know both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>my self</hi> better then yet I do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:65540:57"/>
Thus will <hi>Humility</hi> teach us to <hi>strive</hi> who shall give place to the other, and if the <hi>humble</hi> man can really think others better then himself, he will; and if he cannot, yet he will do all that he can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and that will, I suppose, satisfie the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> Exhortation, and will effect what is desired. If we be impartial in judging our selves, and not forward to censure others; if we be not more busie in casting out the <hi>Mote</hi> that is in our <hi>Brothers</hi> Eye, than the <hi>Beam</hi> that is in our <hi>own</hi> Eye, but more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man to reform <hi>himself</hi> then to find faults in <hi>others;</hi> we shall practise according to the Rule here given.</p>
               <p>Having thus far seen how the duty is <hi>practicable,</hi> we may easily perceive how happy the <hi>Church</hi> would be were it duly <hi>practised.</hi> And indeed, although a truely <hi>humble Christian</hi> will hardly satisfie himself in doing less then all that hath been said; and tho it may be, nothing less then all this will serve to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a man truely <hi>humble;</hi> yet were something less then this well practised among us, we should soon taste the blessed fruits of such a practice. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then that the <hi>Apostle</hi> by these words, <hi>Let each esteem other better then themselves,</hi> meant no more but thus. Either</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we should esteem, honour and love them better, whom we really think to be better. That we should not envy them, nor endeavour any way to lessen them in the esteem of men, nor strive to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, but let them enjoy without disturbance the respect and honour they deserve. What a happy change in the face of the World would even this make? <hi>Preferment</hi> would follow <hi>Merit</hi> and every thing would stand in its own <hi>place</hi> and <hi>order;</hi> there would be no justling for pre-eminence, nor any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65540:57"/>
thing else but <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> in the <hi>Building</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Or suppose</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we should every one esteem our <hi>Superiors</hi> as our <hi>Superiors,</hi> and think them <hi>better</hi> only for this, that they are our <hi>Superiors.</hi> If this were all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> meant, it would certainly very much avail to the Establishing of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity.</hi> There would be no resisting, but an humble subjection for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake. And <hi>Humility</hi> would teach us either to rest in the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or submit at least to the <hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Governors.</hi> The same grace that teacheth us to obey <hi>God</hi> both <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>passively,</hi> must teach us also to obey <hi>them</hi> that have the rule over us for the <hi>Lords</hi> sake, <hi>actively</hi> where we <hi>can,</hi> and <hi>passively</hi> only where we must needs: and tho we could not see in them the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God's Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> we would at least see and reverence the <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Or suppose the meaning were, that we should do all things with that <hi>quietness</hi> and <hi>humbleness,</hi> as if we had every one a better opinion of the other's wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Piety than his own, as a very <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious Annotator</hi> paraphraseth the words, it is too obvious how this practice would conduce to <hi>Peace,</hi> to need any farther explication. Or suppose</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all were but this, that we should every one look upon others as our <hi>Superiors,</hi> thus far at least that we owe them a <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and this is a duty that every man oweth to every man. Nor will this debt of Love be paid by any less than humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending to promote their good, especially the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Good of their Souls by any the <hi>lowest</hi> and <hi>humblest</hi> services we can do them. Were this done indeed and were, <hi>your humble servant</hi> as much the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65540:58"/>
Language of the heart, as of the Tongue and Pen, we should soon all write our selves <hi>Loving Friends</hi> too.</p>
               <p>O that we could all be brought to be more in love with this most charming grace of <hi>Humility,</hi> not as it is in others only, but chiefly in our selves! How happy a thing would it be for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> Where <hi>Humility</hi> reigns in mens hearts, (and it reigns not where it commands not a chearful subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all our <hi>Governors)</hi> it is impossible there should be any strangers to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> or that there should not be on all sides a mutual and delightful administring to one another's comfort and happiness.

               <p>I shall now close this discourse with a short <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> only, willing to leave a more particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the truths delivered to every man's own Conscience.

               <p>Let us therefore all labour, instead of <hi>censuring</hi> and <hi>gain-saying</hi> one another, to close at least in this one grace of <hi>Humility,</hi> in the commendation whereof we are all unanimous.

when it is not, but shew our selves heartily thankful for what by his blessing we have. <hi>And the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, make us perfect in every good work to do his Will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</hi>
