         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT appears unto me, by what I have heard from you and the whole Nation, that the Peace and happy Settlement of theſe bleeding Nations, next under God, lyeth in your hands. And when I conſider that <hi>Wiſdom, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Self denial,</hi> which I have reaſon to be confident, lodgeth in you, and how great a ſhare of the Nations ſufferings will fall upon you, in caſe the <hi>Lord</hi> deny us now a <hi>Settlement,</hi> I am in very good hopes there will be found in you all, ſuch melting bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe poor Nations, and towards one another, that you will become <hi>healers</hi> and <hi>makers</hi> up of all its woeful <hi>Breaches.</hi> And that ſuch an opportunity may clearly appear to be in your hands, I thought good to aſſure you, and that in the preſence of God, that I have nothing before my eyes but Gods Glory, and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of theſe Nations, upon Common-wealth <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</hi> In purſuit whereof I ſhall think nothing too
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168783:4"/>
dear; And for my own particular I ſhall throw my ſelf down at your <hi>feet</hi> to be any thing or nothing in order to theſe great Ends. As to the way of future <hi>Settlement,</hi> far be it from me to impoſe any thing, I deſire you may be in perfect Freedom; Onely give me leave to mind you, that the old Foundations are by Gods Providence ſo broken, that in the eye of Reaſon, they cannot be reſtored but upon the ruines of the people of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have engaged for their Rights, in defence of the Parliament, and the great and main ends of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for uniting and making the Lords name One in the three Nations: And alſo the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Repreſentatives in Parliament will be certainly loſt; For if the people find, that after ſo long and bloody a War againſt the King for breaking in upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, yet at laſt he muſt be taken in again, it will be out of queſtion, and is moſt manifeſt, he may for the future govern by his Will, diſpoſe of Parliaments and Parliament Men as he pleaſeth, and yet the people will never more riſe for their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>And as to the intereſts of this famous City (which hath been in all ages the Bulwork of Parliaments, and unto whom I am for their great affection ſo deeply engaged) Certainly it muſt lie in a Common-wealth; That <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> onely, being capable to make them (through the Lords bleſſing) the <hi>Metropolis</hi> and <hi>Bank</hi> of Trade for all Chriſtendom, whereunto God and Nature hath fitted them above all others.</p>
            <p>And as to a Government in the Church, the want whereof hath been no ſmall cauſe of theſe Nations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions; It is moſt manifeſt, that if it be <hi>Monarchicall</hi> in the State, the Church muſt follow, and <hi>Prelacy</hi> muſt be brought in, which theſe Nations I know cannot
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168783:4"/>
bear, and againſt which they have ſo ſolemnly <hi>Sworn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed moderate not rigid <hi>Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> with a ſufficient Liberty for <hi>Conſciences</hi> truly tender, appears at preſent to be the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and acceptable <hi>way</hi> to the Churches <hi>Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main thing that ſeems to lye in the way, is the Intereſt of the <hi>Lords,</hi> even of thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> who have ſhewed themſelves noble indeed, by joining with the people; and in defence of thoſe juſt rights, have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their deareſt bloud and large eſtates. To that I ſhall only ſay, that though the ſtate of theſe Nations be ſuch, as cannot bear their ſitting in a diſtinct <hi>Houſe</hi>; yet certainly, the wiſdom of Parliament will finde out ſuch <hi>Hereditary</hi> marks of honour for them, as may make them more Noble in after ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> upon the whole matter, the beſt reſult that I can make at preſent for the peace of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> will be in my opinion, that you forthwith go to ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Parliament: In order,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the ſetling the conduct of the Armies of the three Nations in that manner, as they may be ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to the peace and ſafety of them, and not to its own and the Nations ruine, by Faction and Diviſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the providing ſufficient maintenance for them; That is, for the Forces by Land, and for the Navie by Sea, and all their arrears of both, and other contingencies of the government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the appointing a Council of State with Authoritie, to ſettle the Civil Government and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to take care, for the iſſuing of <hi>Writs,</hi> for the ſummoning a <hi>Parliament</hi> of theſe 3 Nations united, to meet at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 20 day of <hi>April</hi> next, with ſuch qualifications as may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168783:5"/>
ſecure the Publick cauſe we are all engaged in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch Diſtributions, as were uſed in the year 1654. Which Parliament ſo called, may meet and act in Freedom, for the more full eſtabliſhing of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, without a King, ſingle Perſon, or Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To a legal Diſſolution of this Parliament to make way for ſucceſſion of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And in order to theſe good ends, the Guards will not only willingly admit you, but faithfully both my ſelf, and every the Officers under my command, and (I believe) the Officers and Souldiers of the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will ſpend their blood for you and ſucceſſive Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
            <p>If your <hi>Conjunction</hi> be directed to this end, you may part honourably, having made a fair ſtep to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Nations, by making a way for ſucceſſive Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But I muſt needs ſay, that if any different councels ſhould be taken (which I have no reaſon to fear;) theſe Nations would preſently be thrown back into force and violence, and all hopes of this much deſired eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment buried in diſorder, which the Lord in his great mercy I hope will prevent. And ſo God ſpeed you well together, and unite your hearts for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Peace</hi> and ſettlement of theſe Nations to his own <hi>Glory</hi> and yours and all our <hi>Comforts.</hi>
