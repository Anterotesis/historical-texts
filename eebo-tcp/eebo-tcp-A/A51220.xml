         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The People likewiſe were in
ſuch ſort Incenſed, as that they
ſought to ſtone <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ran all of

Thraldom impoſed upon them,
for if it had been God, that had

<hi>High Prieſt;</hi> he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
ſuch a one to the <hi>Dignity</hi>

well aſſured that his Brother ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the <hi>Prieſt-Hood</hi> not by his

are worthy of Honour: Yea, I
Contemn not the reſt of this Aſſembly,
altho' they are not to be compared with
you in Riches, and other Endowments.
For neither doth <hi>Aaron</hi> therefore poſſeſs
the <hi>Prieſt-Hood,</hi> becauſe he is Richer,
for thou haſt more ample Poſſeſſions than
either of us, neither becauſe he is more
Noble, for God hath equally Imparted
the ſame unto us all, having given us
one and the ſame <hi>Grandfather:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have I been moved thereunto by
Brotherly Affection, to beſtow it on
him, which was due to others: For
had I not Reſpected Gods Right, in

ſince there is no Man more near

rather wiſh well to, then my ſelf: For
what Wiſdom had it been in me, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

they incurr, who make breach of Laws,
to ſuffer another Man to Reap Fruit

O God! (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) thou Lord over all

And thou art he, who haſt given me
Power to Execute my purpoſes: Thou

Hear this my Prayer, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is either done or thought can
be hidden from thee; for which Cauſe,
I hope, thou wilt not Diſdain to Teſtifie
and Juſtifie the Truth; and manifeſt

            <p>Thou doſt exactly know the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>

as I led a Peaceable Life. And
<pb facs="tcp:49985:10"/>
that by thy Council, I forſook the

I have ſuffered for theſe Men.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, for their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

grievious Travels; now therefore,
ſince I am grown into Suſpition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
theſe Men, who by my

ſo many Miſchiefs, and Miſeries.
Thou that appearedſt unto me in

and Vouchſafeſt to ſpeak unto me
and to Confirm me by the ſight of
Miracles, that in thy Name ſentſt
me a Meſſenger into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and haſt
given me Means to eſcape their

power and Armies inferior to my

Fortunes, that when we were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

of the Bowels of the hard Rock,
when we found no Meat on the

            <p>And now having Adminiſtred the

as if I had beſtowed the <hi>Prieſt-Hood</hi>

and that nothing is brought

thy ſpecial <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and to Expreſs,

the Earth, which they unworthily
tread on, open it ſelf, and ſwallow
them up, both with their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

            <p>By this means, both thy Power

But if thoſe Crimes be

ſecure and void of that

            <p>Whileſt he ſpake theſe Words;
and intermixed them with Tears,
the Earth inſtantly trembled, and
ſhaking began to remove, (after
ſuch a manner, as when by the

hereat were all the People
amazed; but after that, a horrible

<pb facs="tcp:49985:12"/>
their Tents, and the Earth
opened and ſwallowed them up,
both them and all that which they
eſteemed dear, which was after a
manner ſo exterminated, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remained of theirs to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held;
where upon. in a Moment,
the Earth cloſed again, and the
vaſt gaping was faſt ſhut, ſo as
there appeared not any ſight of
that which had happened. Thus
periſhed they all, leaving behind
them an example of Gods Power,
and Judgments.</p>
            <p>And this Accident, was the more
miſerable, in that there was not
any one of their Kinsfolk and Allies
that had Compaſſion on them; ſo
that all the People whatſoever,
forgetting theſe things that were
paſt, did allow Gods Juſtice with
Joyful Acclamations, eſteeming
<pb facs="tcp:49985:13"/>
them unworthy to be bemoaned;
but to be beheld as the Plague
and Perverters of the People.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Dathan,</hi> with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

be Confirmed to him, whoſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
ſhould be moſt acceptable in
God's ſight, for which cauſe the

And before he Executed his Judgments
upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> for their unjuſt Dealings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of Cruelty upon this very ſelf ſame Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in my <hi>Text,</hi> he treated with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> from

hard Heart towards them.</p>
            <p>But, for the Sin of theſe, his lately, and for

ſuddenly commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
themſelves from them, that he might
Conſume them in a Moment. <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing then, before I come to the
Words of my <hi>Text,</hi> muſt be to enquire
what their Sin was, that ſo we may the more
readily and eaſily underſtand the Doctrine we
are to learn from thence.</p>
            <p>Their Sin and Wickedneſs under the cloak
and colour of Holineſs, is drawn up in a brief
Remonſtrance, in <hi>ver.</hi> 3, in theſe Words:</p>
            <p>They gathered themſelves togather againſt
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſaid unto them,
ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are Holy every one of them, and the Lord is
amongſt them: wherefore then lift ye up your ſelues
above the Congregation of the Lord.</p>
            <p>In which bold Remonſtrance of theirs,
there are four Articles. which they xehibited in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49985:17"/>
               <hi>foro</hi> in open Court, two directly againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron,</hi> one pretendedly for God, and the
other point blank for themſelves.</p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>Firſt,</hi> they draw up a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for exceeding the
Bounds of their Commiſſion, <hi>Ye take too much
upon you, ye do more than you can juſtifie, more
than ye have Warrant from God to do.</hi> This Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of yours, is not <hi>Jure Divino:</hi> we know
our Duty to God without your Lordly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence it was that</hi> Moſes <hi>told them</hi> ver. 28.
Hereby ſhall ye know that the Lord hath ſent me
to do all theſe Works; for I have not done them
of my own Mind.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond <hi>Article,</hi> contains a Plea for
their own Holineſs, to Juſtifie the Innocency
of their Enterprize, and to let all <hi>Iſrael</hi> know,
that their Proceedings were from Religious
Principles, that Religion is the Center of all
that they go about to compaſs; ſeeing all the
Congregation are Holy, they will not allow
one prophane Perſon to be amongſt them: If
we were a wicked and prophane People ye
might have ſome colour.</p>
            <p>3. In the third <hi>Article,</hi> they take God to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir Intents were Juſt and Honeſt,
that they thought nor meant any Harm nor
Evil to any one, and avouch God to be the

               <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of their Intents and Purpoſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as if they had ſaid, <hi>Be it known unto you</hi> Moſes
<hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>and let all</hi> Iſrael <hi>take notice, that
what we do, proceeds not from our ſelves, we are
moved of God to do it,</hi> and that it is a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind and Will of God, <hi>the Lord is
amongſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The fourth <hi>Article,</hi> contains a ſeemingly
Rational Argument, for the Confirmation of
the former three. Wherefore then, mark
that word, <hi>Wherefore then lift ye up your ſelves
above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not we the Congregation and People
of the Lord? Are not we the only holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of an holy God? Have not we the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Almighty God amongſt us?
What Reaſon have you then, <hi>to lift up your
ſelves above us?</hi> Can ye teach us better than
the Lord, who is in us? for ſo one <hi>Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
reads the <hi>Text Omnis multitudo Suncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
eſt, et in ipſis eſt Dominus,</hi> the People are
all Holy, and the Lord is in them. Why do
ye then go about to preſcribe us a way, or tye
us up to a Form of Worſhiping God.</p>
            <p>This was the ſubſtance of their Charge
againſt their faithful Rulers.</p>
            <p>Their Prolocutors were <hi>Corah,</hi> a ſelf-wil'd
<hi>Levite,</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> two unſtable

Aſſiſtance of 250 Chieftains, the boldeſt and

            </p>
            <p>Now, who could preſently think or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that under theſe Words, we are all Holy,
and the Lord is amongſt us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there ſhould lie ſo

clean Cup, and Platter, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
filled with Ravening and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
That thoſe white Painted Sepulchres
had been full of dead Mens Bones and Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs.
Who would have imagined, that
theſe Mens Principles, would have digged
ſo many Graves for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Carcaſes,
as afterwards they did? That ſuch Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Diſorders, would have followed the
Heels of theſe Men, profeſſing extraordinary
Holyneſs and Righteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>Our work then at this time, will be to get
the true and real Knowledge of theſe Mens
Sin; that knowing it, we may the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly
dereſt and abhor it, and thence ſhun
and avoid them.</p>

And this way we muſt go to work, even
to enquire of the Oracles of God, what they
were, in a three-fold reſpect.</p>
            <p>1. What they were in their Generation
and Tribe.</p>
            <p>2. In their Qualifications, or Parts.</p>
            <p>3. In their Eſtimation, or Credit, and that
<list>
                  <item>1. With God.</item>
                  <item>2. With the People.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For their Generation, or Tribe, we read,
that they were of the two Tribes of <hi>Reuben</hi> and
<hi>Levi,</hi> as the firſt <hi>ver.</hi> of the <hi>chap.</hi> plainly
ſhews in theſe words, <hi>Now</hi> Corah, <hi>the Son of</hi>
Izhar, <hi>the Son of</hi> Kohah, <hi>the Son of</hi> Levi, <hi>and</hi>
Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>the Sons of</hi> Eliab, <hi>and</hi>
On, <hi>the Son of</hi> Peleth, <hi>Sons of</hi> Reuben, <hi>took
Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which two Tribes, theſe two things are
Recorded, that they were Unſtable, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will'd,
and by no worſe a Man, than their
own Father: And this upon his Death-bed
too; two infamous Blots, in both their
Eſcutcheons; the Records are written in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 49. the Blot, upon <hi>Reubens</hi> Eſcutcheon
at <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Reuben, <hi>thou art my Firſt-born, my
Might, and the beginning of my Strength, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Dignity, and the excellency of Power,
Unſtable as Water,</hi> a foul Blot, in a fair Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49985:19"/>
               <hi>The Blot in</hi> Levi's <hi>Eſcutcheon, at</hi> ver. 5, 6.
<hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> are Brethren, Inſtruments of
Cruelty are in their Habitations</p>
            <p>O my Soul, come not thou into their Secret, unto
their Aſſembly, mine Honor, be not thou united:
For in their Anger they Slew a Man, and in their
Self-will, they digged down a Wall.</p>
            <p>In their Self-will, there is the Blot in <hi>Levi</hi>'s
Eſcutcheon.</p>
            <p>Now if we joyn the Blots in both their
Eſcutcheons together, and compare them
with theſe Mens Words, and Actions, in my
<hi>Text,</hi> we may ſafely conclude the truth of
that Proverb,</p>
            <q>Naturae ſequitur Semina quiſque ſuae.</q>
            <p>And take this for a <hi>Maxim</hi> in Divinity,
That Inſtability of Heart, to walk with God
in his antient ways, and Self-will'dneſs of
Spirit, to prefer a private Error in Judgment,
before the publick Peace and welfare of the
Church: Is the grand Anvil, upon which
the Devil hath forged all his Machination of
Hereſy, and Sciſme, to the Continual diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the Church, in all Ages of the
World.</p>
            <p>2. In the next place, we will conſider
them in their Qualifications and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and this to
<list>
                  <item>1. Negatively.</item>
                  <item>2. Poſſitively.</item>

            <p>

1. Negatively, they were not the Ignorant
ſort, altho Thouſands of thoſe were ſeduced
by their Leaders, nor yet of the loweſt,
baſeſt, and meaneſt among them; altho Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of theſe were ready to Aid and Aſſiſt

Prophane, or Debauch'd Perſons, altho' ſuch
(had there been any ſuch in <hi>Iſrael</hi>) would
eaſily have become Sticklers to theſe Mens
Principles.</p>
            <p>2. But Poſſitively, for their Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they were Men of excellent Gifts and
Parts, for there were many <hi>Levites</hi> amongſt
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many of good Rank and Quality.
<hi>Reubenites</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Firſt-born;
and without all Peradventure, Stout Men of
their Hands too, if need required. And this
is clear from what is Recorded, in <hi>ver. 2.
And they</hi> (i.e. <hi>Corah,</hi> and his Confederates)
<hi>roſe up before</hi> Moſes, <hi>with certain of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Two Hundred and Fifty Princes
of the Aſſembly, famous in the Congregation,
Men of Renown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fame of theſe Men ſpread far and

talkt of in every Tent, eſpecially of theſe Two
Tribes Thus did their Renown ring in the
Ears of unſteadfaſt and backſliding <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49985:20"/>
Famous and Renowned they were, for
what? Not for any open or viſſible Sin or
Wickedneſs; for the Iniquity of theſe Men,
was a Miſterious Riddle to many honeſt
Hearted <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Latet anguis in Herba.</q>
            <p>The green Herbs of their admirable Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and ſeeming Holineſs, did ſo flouriſh
and ſpread it ſelf in the ſight of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they could not
ſee, nor perceive the Serpent at the Root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was Gods choſen People, above all
Nations upon the face of the Earth; and
theſe Men the choiſeſt of all <hi>Iſrael Pſal.</hi> 78. 31.</p>
            <p>Having now conſidered them in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
and Qualifications, it remains,
that we conſider them in their Eſtimation;
in what Eſteem they were both with God,
and the People.</p>
            <p>And 1. That they were once in high
Eſteem with God, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
it in <hi>ver. 8, 9. And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi>
Corah, <hi>Hear, I pray you, ye Sons of</hi> Levi:
<hi>Seemeth it a ſmall thing to you, that the God of</hi>
Iſrael, <hi>hath ſeparated you from all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to
bring you near to himſelf, to do the Service of the
Tabernacle, and to ſtand before the Congregation,
to Miniſter unto them.</hi> And that they werein
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49985:20"/>
great Credit and Eſteem with the People, we
have their own words for it, in <hi>ver.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But on the Morrow, all the Congregation of</hi>
Iſrael, <hi>Murmured againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt</hi>
Aaron, <hi>Saying ye have Killed the People of the
Lord.</hi> How ſtrong were the deluſions of
theſe Men? When notwithſtanding the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unheard of Judgments, which the
Lord Plagued them with. In cauſing the
Earth to open her Mouth, and ſwallow up
ſome of them; and Fire from Heaven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the reſt. Yet on the Morrow, whileſt
theſe things were freſh in their ſight and
memory, they could tell <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
with murmuring Words, that they were guilty
of Murder, in the the Death of theſe Men,
<hi>Ye have Killed the People of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye have not only lifted up you ſelves, and made
your ſelves Lords over Gods Heritage, but Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
and Cruely, Murdered the Saints, and
People of God.</p>
            <p>Thus did they by way of Recrimination,
charge the Meekeſt, and Faithfulleſt Man
upon the face of the Earth, with the Guilt
of the greateſt Wickedneſs, that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be Committed. And doubtleſs, had
they had an Armed Power, anſwerable to
their Envious and Arrogant Hearts, they
would have Erected a <hi>Sanedrim</hi> of their own,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49985:21"/>
and Arraigned him as Guilty of the Death of
all the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that dyed for their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in the Wilderneſs, ſince the Day that
they came up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till
then. Juſt ſo, the worſt of Helliſh Villanes,
except <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Julian.</hi> the Apoſtates,
Araigned the beſt of Kings, (Jeſus Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt:</hi> I mean, as
Guilty of all that Blood, that had been ſhed
in the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the time of thoſe unnatural
and Bloody Wars, continued for ſo many
dreadful Years of that Pious Prince's Raign.</p>
            <p>And here I could willingly make a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from my matter in hand, by ſaying, That
I could wiſh that my Head were Waters, and
mine Eyes, Fountains of Tears, that I might
Weep Day and Night; not only for the Sins
of mine own unſtable Heart, but for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Miſeries, which without ſpeedy and
unfeigned Repentance, will certainly fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church of God in theſe Kingdoms;
the Lord hath ſhak'd his Rod at us, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years paſt, nor hath he yet laid it aſide, for
the noiſe of it, is ſtill in our Ears, and we ſeem
to take little or no notice of it, as if we did
either ſtop our Ears at it; and ſo refuſe to hear
it, or by a careleſs ſlighting of it, make a puff
at it, or were wholly void of Sence and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49985:21"/>
Reaſon, not to underſtand the meaning of it;
like thoſe whom the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> exclaim'd
againſt, <hi>chap. 1. ver. 3. The Ox knoweth his
owner, and the</hi> Aſs, <hi>his Maſters Crib; but</hi> Iſrael
<hi>doth not know, my People doth not conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, it is very ſad to think that
when God condeſcends to ſpeak to poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Creatures in ſo many different ways, as he
hath done to the People of theſe Kingdoms;
and ſo few of us underſtand his meaning in
any of them.</p>
            <p>That we ſhould be ſo deſtitute of Evangelical
Wiſdom, that we ſhould neither Hear nor See,
nor Taſt nor Feel God in the various Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of his Providences, but continue in a
ſenceleſs, ſtupid, dull frame of Spirit, as if
we reſolved to walk contrary to his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
be they what they will. But leaſt a
larger Digreſſion ſhould divert your Thoughts
from the Subject I am diſcourſing of, I will
immediately return to them where I left them,
and ſhew you more of their Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for ſo ſtrangly and ſo ſtrongly, were
theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> enſnared, and bound with the
Cords and Chains of this ſpiritual Deluſion, and
ſo cheated by the ſeeming Holyneſs of theſe
eminent and famous Men, that they adventur'd
to Canonize them for Saints, after they were
dead, altho' they died Impenitent Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49985:22"/>
And a probable Reaſon why they had ſuch
an eſteem for them after they were dead, was
either becauſe the Two Hundred and Fifty
Men, Confederates with <hi>Corah,</hi> Juſtified their
doings to the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Tabernacle
of the Lord, and in the preſence of God, and
died with Cenſors in their Hands and Incenſe
burning thereon.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it was becauſe they intended to
play over again the ſame Game that their
Brethren had loſt, and ſo prove a ſecond
Brood of Religious Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this is more then probable, the words
in</hi> ver. 42. <hi>do plainly demonſtrate, for do but
mark the Words,</hi> And it came to paſs when the
Congregation was gathered againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
againſt <hi>Aaro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that they looked toward the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eacle
of the Congregation; and behold the Cloud
covered it, and the Glory of the Lord appeared.</p>
            <p>Hence it is very evident, that theſe Chips
of the old Block, were reſolved to revive the
good old Cauſe of their deceaſed Friends, and
had not the Lord again Graciouſly preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Church, this laſt Seditious Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
might have been worie than the former.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, did but charge
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with the Sin of ſelf-promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But theſe Off-spring, of theirs, charge
them with the ſhedding of Innocent Blood,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49985:22"/>
even the Blood of the People of the Lord;
and ſo might pretend that God had put into
their Hand the Sword of Vengeance for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Blood.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being well weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
without doubt, this was the Root and
Riſe of their Sin.</p>
            <p>The high conceit, which they had of their
own Knowledge and Holyneſs, together with
the Applauſe and Eſtimation which they had
with the People, had ſo lifted them up with
Pride, that they thought themſelves ſo full of
Knowledge, and ſo Holy, and in both ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that their Conſciences would not ſuffer
them to live any longer in obedience to a
written Law, that is, to ſuch a Law, or to ſuch
Rules and Orders as ſhould be delivered to
them by any other hand then their own.</p>
            <p>And this is clear, if we conſider the time of
their publick diſcovering of it; and we ſhall
find that it was immediately upon <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
preſſing them to a ſtrickt Obſervation of an
harmleſs Ceremony for Decency, and Order,
to be placed upon the border of their Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Form of it, and the Orders of God for
it, is written in the 4 laſt <hi>ver.</hi> of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And the Lord Spake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying,</p>
            <p>Speak unto the Children of, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bid
them that they make them Fringes in the Borders
of their Garments, throughout their Generations,
and that they put upon the Fringe of the Borders a

and be Holy unto your God.</p>
            <p>I am the Lord your God, which brought you out
of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to be your God: I am the
Lord your God.</p>
            <p>Which Command, was no ſooner deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but preſently <hi>Corah</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,

and <hi>Aaron, ver.</hi> 23. 24.</p>
            <p>2. The Meſſage it ſelf, which was both

whom he thought not paſt recovery, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Meſſage to them in ſuch a frame

            </p>
            <p>Now from theſe parts of the <hi>Text,</hi> and
from what hath been ſpoken as previous to it.
I ſhall deliver theſe ſix Propoſitions, or Points
of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49985:24"/>
1. That it is dangerous and unſafe for
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to Congregate themſelves with
ſuch a People, (tho' never ſo full of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and ſeeming Holyneſs) that do deny
<hi>Conformity</hi> to ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as
God hath delivered to them, by the Hands
of faithfull Governors.</p>
            <p>2. That God will reject and diſown the
Knowledge and Holineſs of ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>3. That the Sin of ſuch <hi>Nonconformity,</hi>
doth exceedingly provoke the Lord to
Anger, and ſtir up the Fire of his Jealouſie.</p>
            <p>4. That a People under ſuch Deluſions,
may think themſelves Holy and Righteous,
and at the ſame time, be moſt ſinful and
wicked.</p>
            <p>5. That it is no new thing, for a Spirit of
damnable Deluſions, to ſhelter it ſelf under
the Cloak and Maſque of extraordinary
Holineſs.</p>
            <p>6. That it is the Part and Duty, of all
the Servants of God, in their ſeveral and
reſpective Places, and Callings, to uſe all
Lawfull means, and endeavours, to ſtop
the further breaking forth of ſuch horrible
Deluſions, and Deſtructive Principles.</p>
            <p>Having delivered theſe ſix Propoſitions,
I ſhall return to proſecute the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49985:24"/>
Which, whilſt I am doing, I humbly pray
you, to hear me without Prejudice; for
the Lord, who knoweth the Secrets of all
Hearts knows that I have none againſt the
Perſons of any of the Sons of Men; for I Believe
that Chriſt dy'd as well for them, as for my
ſelf, and therefore I cannot hate them: And
the Method I ſhall Obſerve will be this.</p>
            <p>1. I offer to your Conſideration the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why I Judge it dangerous, and unſafe
to Congregate with ſuch a People.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall give you a Proſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
and unlucky Diſpoſitions of theſe
Mens Spirits, under this new diſcovery of
theirs, Sciſme, I may call it.</p>
            <p>3. Give you a Taſte of the harſh, bitter,
and lamentable Effects, which this new
Doctrin of theirs brought forth in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth</hi>
of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which, when we have
weighed in the Ballance of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> we
ſhall eaſily be perſwaded to believe <hi>Solomon,
That there is no new Thing under the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Shew you how the Juſt, Holy, and

            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Is becauſe the Breath of ſuch
Mens Doctrine, is infectious to a ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Sons of Men are as really ſnbject
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49985:28"/>
to Spiritual Infection, as the Body is to
that which is Carnal; the Body is not more
liable to the Infection of the Plague of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
than the Judgments of the Sons and
Daughters of Men, are to the Plague of
Spiritual Deluſions.</p>
            <p>And this my Aſſertion, I ground upon
Reaſon, drawn from the Teſtimonies of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writ; beſides Woful and Daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>There are three Diſeaſes amongſt Men,
notably Infectious above others, (<hi>viz</hi>) the
<hi>Leproſie,</hi> the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and the <hi>Cancer,</hi> all
whieh three Diſeaſes of the Body, do para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell
the three grand Infectious Diſeaſes of
the Soul, <hi>viz. Diſobedience, Hereſie</hi> and
<hi>Sciſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt whereof is Epidemical, and
hath Infected all Mankind with the <hi>Leproſie</hi>
of Original Sin. The ſecond is more Secret
and indiſcernable, falling upon ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
when they think leaſt on't, even
whileſt they are Talking and Drinking
with their Friend; and concerning this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
it is obſervable that the Party Infected,
hath a deſire to Infect others, tho' never
ſo near and dear to them; the like deſire
have all Sciſmaticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49985:28"/>
The third Infectious Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Cancer,</hi> hath its Reſidence for the moſt part
in the Mouth or Tongue; that they who
drink of the ſame Cup with them, are in
danger of Infection.</p>
            <p>For Confirmation of this Aſſertion, I ſhall
give you a Precedent and Precept, from the
Sacred Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The Precedent is double, and of Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Memory, becauſe the Sin appeared
in the Puniſhment of thoſe that Committed it.</p>
            <p>The Precept is alone, yet worthy of a
ſerious notice, becauſe it was Tranſmitted,
by an <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> from an Univerſal <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to
a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of a particular Charge 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 16.
17. 18.</p>
            <p>The firſt Precedent or Example is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. where two prime
Servants of God are found Tardy in their
Obedience to him, which ſhewed it felf in

was not angry with his Brother and Siſter,
for aſpiring to ſhare with him in a piece
of Earthly Government; when he knew
that his own firſt Parents aſpired to an
Heavenly Throne, by endeavouring to be
as Gods. Nay, <hi>Aaron</hi> in another ſinful
<hi>Act</hi> of his outdid his <hi>Progenitors;</hi> for they
preſumed to be but as Gods, to know
Good and Evil; but <hi>Aaron</hi> preſumed to

<hi>Make us Gods,</hi> (ſaith ſinful <hi>Iſrael) that may

            <p>The ſame Serpent that perſwaded our firſt

prevailed with <hi>Aaron,</hi> not to conceit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Employment of making a God, and ſo to
be greater than God. For as he that makes

ſo he that makes a God, may conceit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

            <p>If it ſhould here be askt why <hi>Aaron</hi> guilty of

not Plagued with the ſame Puniſhment of
<hi>Leproſie,</hi> as ſhe was, according to the rule
of Juſtice, the ſame Sin, the ſame Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
I anſwer, it is true, the Lord might
in Juſtice have ſmitten <hi>Aaron</hi> with the
Plague of <hi>Leproſie,</hi> as he did <hi>Miriam,</hi> but
he did not; he ſpared <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<hi>Miriam,</hi> and that for ſeveral good
and weighty Reaſons, as I humbly conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49985:30"/>
1. That the Church, and all the World
may know, that he hath two Hands as
well as two Eyes, the one to lay on the
ſtroak of Juſtice, and the other, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Grace and Mercy; that he is Mercy
as well as Juſtice; and Judgment as well
as Mercy.</p>
            <p>2. That the Sons of Men may know,
that God is a free Agent, and may do
with his own what he pleaſeth; that he
can have Mercy upon whom he will have
Mercy, and Puniſh others for the Iniquity
of their Tranſgreſſions; and leave them to
the hardneſs of their own Hearts.</p>
            <p>3. The Sin was greater in <hi>Miriam,</hi> then
in <hi>Aaron; Aaron</hi> might have a ſeeming
colour for what he ſaid, having formerly
been <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Speaker for God, to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>
but for <hi>Miriam</hi> to aſſume the Privilege of
a Speaker, was neither proper to her Sex,
nor ever an Office in the Church for a
Woman to Execute. <hi>I permit not a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
(ſaith St. <hi>Paul) to Speak in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Aarons</hi> Office might excuſe him, and
ſpeak ſomething for him, being by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Holy Oyl, <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> to offer
Sacrifice for the Sins of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and no
<hi>Leper</hi> was to Officiate in that calling, nor

ſtand at Gods Altar; ſo that the Purity of
his Office, freed him from that foul and
lothſom Puniſhment of the Plague of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie;</hi>
God's Altar was nor a fit place
for a Deformed Perſon to ſtand at, to
offer <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> therefore, for the Glory of
his  Name, and the Holineſs of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
he exempted the <hi>Sacrificer</hi> from the
Puniſhment of ſo loathſom a Diſeaſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
he went not Scot-free, for for this, and
other failings; he was debarr'd both of
the sight and enterance into the Land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> the Land of Promiſe.</p>
            <p>5. It might probable be, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was
not Principal, but Acceſſary to this Sin,
for <hi>Miriam</hi> is firſt named in the <hi>Text,
Numb. 12. And</hi> Miriam, <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſpake

And it is very likely, that the

<hi>Ziporah</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> about what I

<hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which prevails mightily by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
killing Thouſands in a ſhort time.
So doth the Plague of Spiritual Deluſions
Infect and Deſtroy many Thouſands of
Souls in a very few Days.</p>
            <p>And that theſe Mens Principles (in my

in their Puniſhment, and one may
read their Sin in their Puniſhment. And
that there was a Spiritual Plague fore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and running upon theſe Mens Spirits.
It is evident by the Injunction, which God
laid upon the reſt of the People, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them, and not to come near
them, nor touch any thing of theirs, leaſt
their Sin ſhould Infect them, and they
periſh with them in their Sins.</p>
            <p>And ſo Infectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them on the Morrow, and in a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Aſſembly, Murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
told him, <hi>he had Killed the People of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How nearly doth Hereſie in the Soul,
reſemble the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> in the Body; for as
faſt as that lothſom <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> cleaves to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49985:32"/>
Body, ſo faſt doth <hi>Hereſie</hi> ſtick in the Soul
and Heart of a Man. For as it is a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
thing, and almoſt Impoſſible for a
<hi>Phiſttian</hi> to heal the Plague of <hi>Peſtilence</hi> in
the Body.</p>
            <p>So it is a very hard and difficult thing,
for the beſt Majeſtrate, or the beſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in the World, to reclaim any Man or
Woman from the Error of their way, that
have forſaken the Publick Service of God,
the High-way of Salvation, and betook
themſelves to the By-paths of a Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Conventicle one Year. Hence it is
that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Exhorts <hi>Titus</hi> to
Reject <hi>A Man that is an Heretick, after the
firſt and ſecond Admonition.</hi> And ſubjoyns
this Reaſon, <hi>Knowing that he that is ſuch, is
ſubverted and Sinneth, being Condemned of
himſelf.</hi> Titus. 3. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now you may happily ask what an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick</hi>
is. I Anſwer.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Heretick,</hi> is one that obſtinately De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends

to the Faith, Practice, and Profeſſion of the

            <p>But ye may happily ſay, why doth the

the Mount.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> went up unto God, and the Lord
called unto him out of the Mountain, ſaying,
Thus ſhalt thou ſay unto the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and tell the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Ye have ſeen
what <hi>I</hi> did unto the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and how <hi>I</hi> bare
you on Eagles Wings, and brought you unto my

            <p>Now therefore, if ye will Obey my Voice indeed,

            <p>And ye ſhall be unto me a Kingdom of <hi>Prieſts</hi>

which thou ſhall ſpeak unto the Children of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> came and called for the Elders
of the People; and laid before their Faces all theſe
words which the Lord commanded him.</p>
            <p>And all the People anſwered together, and
ſaid, All that the Lord hath ſpoken that will
we do. and <hi>Moſes</hi> returned the Words of the
People unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>And at another time <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 3.</p>

               <hi>Moſes</hi> came and told the People all the
words of the Lords, and all the Judgments;
and all the People anſwered with one Voice,
and ſaid, All the Words which the Lord hath
ſaid, will we do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again at</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> took the Book
of the Covenant, and Read in the Audience of the

ſaid, will we do, and be Obedient.</p>
            <p>Now who would ever have thought,
that theſe Men, after ſuch Solemn Vows,
Promiſes, and Proteſtations, made in the
hearing of God, Angels and Men, would ſo

            <p>And indeed, there is little or no difference
betwixt a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and a <hi>Reprobate:</hi> If ye call
a Man a <hi>Rebel,</hi> ye call him a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and if
he be really the one, he is certainly the

            <p>They are inſeparable Companions; for he

               </gap>nſtable Heart.</p>
            <p>Here comes in <hi>Reprobation</hi> in its right
place, for he is not a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> that dieth in
the State of natural blindneſs, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God and his Ways; but he that
hath known both, and revolts from them,
this Man is a right <hi>Reprobate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Five times in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> is the
word <hi>Reprobate</hi> mentioned, and in every one
of them the word bears the ſame Sence.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> is the firſt that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Ordained of God before he was born, to be

the true and right way to eternal Happineſs;
and therefore perfectly knew what <hi>Epithite,</hi>
to give to every one of them, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Degrees and Stations; and he hath given

            <p>Reprobate Silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall Men call them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord hath rejected them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Latin Tranſlation</hi> renders it thus,</p>
            <p>Argentum reprobum vocantur illi, quia Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat

            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49985:40"/>
So that by the <hi>Latin Tranſlation,</hi> and our
<hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> compared, the Words
<hi>Reprobate</hi> and <hi>Reject</hi> have one Signification.</p>
            <p>And why did the Lord Reject and call
them <hi>Reprobates?</hi> Why verily the Prophet
himſelf, hath ſhew'd it unto us in ſuch large
Characters, that he that runs may read it,
except he willfully ſhuts his Eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
not to ſee it; it is ſet down in <hi>ver.</hi> 16,
17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways and
ſee, and ask for the old Paths, where is the good
way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for
your Souls; but they ſaid. We will not walk
therein.</p>
            <p>Alſo I ſet Watchmen over you, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the ſound of the Trumpet; but they ſaid,
We will not hearken.</p>
            <p>Therefore hear, ye Nations, and know O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,

               </gap>ar, O Earth, behold, I will bring Evil
upon this People, even the Fruit of their thoughts,
becauſe they have not hearkned unto my Word,
nor to my Law, but Rejected it.</p>
            <p>From hence it is evident, that by their
firſt Revolting from their antient Paths, and
good old Ways, which God had bounded

and Authority of thoſe Watchmen, or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,

whom he had ſet over them; and
their Contumatious Refuſal to return to
them again, they Reprobated themſelves,
and ſo God Rejected them, and calls them
grievious Revolters, walking with Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
out-faceing with brazen Impudency,
the Commands of their Governors, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.
(and at laſt Proclaims them by the Mouth
of the Prophet) <hi>Reprobate Silver ſhall Men call
them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The ſecond, that mentions it, is the
Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul, Romans 1. 28. God gave
them over to a Reprobate Mind, <hi>the Reaſon for
it, he gives in the former part of the</hi> ver. <hi>in
theſe words,</hi> And even as they did not like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
God in their Knowledge, So God gave them
over to a Reprobate mind.</p>

            <p>Now that many of this Church, to whom
he thus writes, were Revol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing from the
Truth, (which they had formerly embraced)
and Sciſmatically going off from the Body
of the Church; of which by an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
they had for a long time been Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49985:41"/>
its evident from ſeveral paſſages in
both his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>1. He calls them the Church of God at
<hi>Corinth. 1. Cor.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>2. Thanks God for them, that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with all Vtterance and Knowledge; and
that they came behind in no Gift, 1. 1. 4, 7.</p>
            <p>3. Perſuades them to unity of Judgment,
and avoiding of Diviſions, yea, beſeeches
them in theſe Words, 1. <hi>Cor. 1. 10. I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (that is, in the Name of our
Anointed Saviour) <hi>that ye all ſpeak the ſame
thing, and that there be no Diviſions among you;
but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame
mind, and in the ſame Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Checks them, for entertaining ſeveral
Errors, as the eating of Meat offered to <hi>Idols,</hi>
contrary to the <hi>Apoſtolical Decree</hi> at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
which he brought from thence in his
own Perſon, and delivered to them with his
own Hands, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>5. Reproves them, for Praying in the
Church with their Heads cover'd, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>

their undecent carriage at the Communion
thereof, <hi>Chap.</hi> II.</p>

All which Errors, being directly contrary
to their former Faith, and Profeſſion of the
Goſpel, which they received and embraced
at his firſt Preaching of the Goſpel to them;
he earneſtly exhorts them to a ſerious Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their preſent and former State,
and ſo to make a ſpeedy return to their firſt
love of the Truth, from which, they were
now falling into a State of Reprobation,</p>
            <p>The fourth place where the word <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi>
is mentioned, is in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſecond <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 3. 8. 13, 14,</p>
            <p>As <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi>
ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the Truth: Men of corrupt
minds, Reprobate concerning the Faith.</p>
            <p>But evil Men, and Saducers ſhall wax worſe
and worſe, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
            <p>But continue thou in the things which thou haſt
learned, and has been aſſured of, knowing of whom
thou haſt learned them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men, whom he here calls <hi>Reprobates,</hi>
muſt needs have Relation to them, whom he
names in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of his two <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> the firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Church of
<hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. He names <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom, he there ſaith, he
had <hi>delivered up to Satan, for making a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of Faith, and a good Conſcience, ver.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49985:42"/>
Now I am apt to think that this <hi>Hymeneus,</hi>
whom he mentions here, is the ſame whom
he mentions in his ſecond <hi>Epiſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap, 2.
ver. 17. And their word will eat as doth a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
of whom are</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Philerus.</p>
            <p>Who concerning the Truth have erred, ſaying,
That the Reſurrection is paſt already, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Faith of ſome: <hi>That is, throw them
into a State of Reprobation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two others he names, in 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 15.
This thou knoweſt, that all they which are in</hi> Aſia
<hi>are turned away from me;</hi> (that is are turned
Reprobates, and have forſaken their firſt love
to the Truth) <hi>of whom are</hi> Phygellus <hi>and</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound Words, which thou
haſt heard of me, ver.</hi> 13. And I am apt to
believe that the former mentioned <hi>Alexander,</hi>
is the ſame he bids <hi>Timothy</hi> beware of, 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14, 15. Alexander <hi>the Copper-ſmith
did me much evil; the Lord Reward him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of whom be thou aware alſo; for he hath greatly
withſtood our Words.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater Enemies to the
Truth, then thoſe that once profeſt it, and
at laſt revolt from it.</p>
            <p>I am further apt to think, that this <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
is the ſame that took <hi>Pauls</hi> part in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49985:42"/>
uproare at <hi>Epheſus</hi>) againſt the Prieſts of
<hi>Diana</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> Acts 19. 33. <hi>And they drew</hi>
Alexander <hi>out of the Multitude, the</hi> Jews <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him forward. And</hi> Alexander <hi>beckoned
with his hand, and would have made his defence
unto the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when they knew that he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> all
with one Voice, about the ſpace of two Hours, cryed
out, Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whither it where the ſame, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that name, he made himſelf a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
to his Faith, and Profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>And thus much briefly to the fifth Reaſon,
to prove it dangerous and unſafe for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
to Congregate themſelves with any
ſuch People, tho' never ſo full of Knowledge

party amongſt them, I mean among
that party of them, that were ſo; for many of
them ſtood faſt to God, and his Servant <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
in obſerving the Rules of that Religion,
which contained a preſcript Form of <hi>Laws</hi>
and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> cemented, with harmleſs
and inoffenſive Ceremonies, as ye have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard, and which they, themſelves
once promiſed to obſerve and keep.</p>
            <p>But now their ſpiritual Pride was ſuch,
and their Minds ſo eſtranged from that their
Promiſe and Profeſſion, that they dare tell
him to his Face, <hi>That he took too much upon
him, to lift up himſelf above them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This one Fly of ſpiritual Pride, had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mar'd their whole Box of Sacred Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(manifeſt in their former Submiſſion
and Obedience) and engaged the Lord to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them.</p>
            <p>Had not ſpiritual Pride been the Root of
their Sin, the Lord had not ſet himſelf againſt
them, for the humble and poor in Spirit, are
his joy and Delight: but the proud and
haughty in Spirit, are the Objects of his
hatred and contempt.</p>

138. 6. Though the Lord be high, yet hath he
reſpect unto the lowly; but the proud he knoweth
afar off. <hi>And another Scripture ſaith,</hi> God
reſiſteth the proud, but giveth Grace to the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>James</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Apoſtle St.</hi> Peter, <hi>is much larger
in this point,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. Likewiſe ye Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

            <p>Both of theſe Apoſtles have their Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in the Original
is larger then both, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 3. 33. 34. 35.</p>

            <p>The Wiſe ſhall inherite Glory, but ſhame ſhall
be the promotion of Fools.</p>
            <p>Spiritual Pride, tho'it be an horrible Sin,
yet it is very hard to be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul, <hi>was very near fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into this Sin, and very likly he was for
it, as he Teſtifies himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7.

Neceſſities, Diſtreſſes for Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
            <p>O my Friends, with Grief I ſpeak it, it
was ſpiritual Pride, that laid the Corner-Stone
of <hi>England</hi>'s late and Lamentable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
Acted by a Company of Pretended
Saints, who never left exalting themſelves
till they had trod upon the Crown, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Lords Anointed, (and at that
time, with him, the true Proteſtant Religion,
and all the Devout and Sincere Profeſſors
thereof) and at laſt Murdered him, at the
Gates of his own Palace, and trampled his
Sacred Blood under their baſe and dirty Feet.</p>
            <p>All this the Pride of their Spirit carried
them forth, to Enact againſt, as ſweetly
qualified, and as bravely an accompliſhed
Prince, as ever breathed upon the face of the
of the Earth, (ſtill I ſay) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be doubted, but theſe ſpiritual
proud Men in my <hi>Text,</hi> had not God, by a
ſudden overthrow prevented them, would
have ſerved <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with the ſame
Sauce, having already drawn up a Charge
againſt them as implacable Enemies, to the
Liberty they aimed at, and Murdering ſo
many of the People of the Lord. (as they

call'd themſelves) altho' they were Eye
Witneſſes, that it was the immediate Hand
of God, that ſtruck ſome of them Dead with

opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed up the reſt.</p>
            <p>O Lord, for thy Mercies ſake, ſave us for

themſelves, for if they would have given
the preference to any, they would ſurely
have given it to <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom the Son of God
thought worthy to keep him Company four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

And afterwards on the Mount, at his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 17.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> alone ſhall come near the Lord; but
they ſhall not come nigh, neither ſhall the People go
up with him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Moſes</hi> came and told the People all the
Words of the Lord, and all the Judgments; and
all the People anſwered with one Voice, and ſaid,
All the Words which the Lord hath ſaid, will
we do.</p>
            <p>It doth not appear that at this time,
there was one <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> or <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49985:45"/>
And yet within a little time after, afew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereof <hi>Corah</hi> was chief;
had ſo ſeduced the Church of God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
that if God had not appeared himſelf, with a

            <p>Thus you ſee, that for all their pretended

ſee, nor open their Ears to Hearken to God,
nor the Rulers of his Church.</p>

               <hi>For Inſtance, take the Word of God</hi> Num.
12. 5. And the Lord came down in the Pillar of

and called <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam;</hi> and they
both came forth.</p>
            <p>And he ſaid, Hear now my Words; if there

            <p>My Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> is not ſo, who ìs Faithful
in all my Houſe.</p>
            <p>With him wîll I ſpeak Mouth to Mouth, even

            <p>And thé Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt
them, and he departed.</p>
            <p>There are ſeven things to be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
from this Proof.</p>
            <p>1. Which of the three Perſons in the
God-Head, it was, that came down from
Heaven in the Pillat of the Cloud; the Son
of God it was, no doubt.</p>
            <p>2. What his buſineſs was, that he came
about, <hi>viz.</hi> to Examin two Criminals, to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and Judge them.</p>
            <p>3. What their Crime was, <hi>viz.</hi> Speaking
againſt <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Aarons</hi> Penitency, and the benefit of
his Clergy.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Miriams</hi> Impenitency, and Puniſhment.
6. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Pitty, and Prayer for her, which
voided the perpetuity of the Sentence.</p>
            <p>7. The fairneſs of the Tryal, he ſtood in
the Door of the Tabernacle, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi>
might hear, and ſee, and take warning.</p>
            <p>God might have ſpoken ſo loud, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth ſhould have heard it, ſo as they
ſhould not have need to come forth for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but now he calls them out to the
Bar, (that they may be ſeen) it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him, to chide them within Doors; the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49985:46"/>
ſhame of their Fault had been leſſer, in a
private Rebuke, but the Scandal of it, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
open Reproof.</p>
            <p>From theſe ſeven Conſiderations, I have
Collected theſe Obſervations.</p>
            <p>1. That God, is the God of Order, Rule,
and Government; their Repining was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
and where the Sin is not affraid of the
Light, God loves not the Reproof ſhould be
ſmothered.</p>
            <p>2. That it is a greater Sin, than Men are
aware of, to ſpeak againſt the Rule, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Government, either in <hi>Church,</hi> or
<hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That in the end, God will ſeverely
puniſh all ſuch Diſpiſers, of ſuch Rule, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Government.</p>

               <hi>And to this he adds, 2. Epiſtle, 2. to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
us that,</hi> Such there are, and have been, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49985:47"/>
do ſpeak Evil of Government, and ſhall not go
unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 9, 10. The Lord, knows how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Godly out of Temptation; and to reſerve
the Vnjuſt, unto the Day of Judgment, to be
Puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But chiefly them that walk after the Fleſh, and
diſpiſe Government,</hi> Preſumptious are they,
Self-will'd, they are not afraid to ſpeak Evil
of Dignities. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> Harps on
the ſame String; and particularizeth theſe
Men in my <hi>Text,</hi> at <hi>ver. 11. Wo unto them,
for they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and ran
greedily after the Error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for Reward,
and Periſh in the gain-ſaying of</hi> Corah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then at</hi> ver. 19. <hi>gives a Mark, how

<hi>tho' they ſaid they had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They were of a ſelf confident Spirit,
they were confident in themſelves, that God
would own them in their deſign.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Moſes</hi> Summoned them to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the Lord, to anſwer to their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Words; they accepted the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
and undertook to diſpute it before the
Lord in a Religious Duty, too manifeſt in
<hi>ver.</hi> 19, 17, 18, 19. in theſe Words,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49985:47"/>
And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Corah,</hi> be thou, and all
thy Company, before the Lord, thou and they, and
<hi>Aaron</hi> to Morrow.</p>
            <p>And take every Man his Cenſer, and put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
thereon; and bring ye before the Lord, every
Man his Cenſer, two Hundred and Fifty Cenſers,
thou alſo, and <hi>Aaron,</hi> each one his Cenſer.</p>
            <p>And they took every Man his Cenſer, and put
Fire in them, and laid Incenſe thereon, and ſtood
in the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Cheek by Jole
with them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Corah,</hi> gathered all the Congregation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, (<hi>either by ſome Solemn League,
and Covenant, or ſome Engagement or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>)
unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the
Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>There never was ſuch a Challenge made
in the Church of God upon Earth, before or
ſince; never ſuch apparent Confidence in
a Seditious Party, to accept of, and anſwer
it, known, or heard of, altho' ſome People of
our times, have ſhreudly immitated them.</p>
            <p>Nor did ever ſuch a Stickler appear in a
Quarrel; for God himſelf appeared on <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Aarons</hi> ſide; and at his firſt enterance
on the Stage, which was the Tabernacle, he
gave the Spectators a glimps of his Glory;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49985:48"/>
and made bare his Arm, and uttered with
his Lips, theſe dreadful Words, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>Separate your ſelves from among this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that I may conſume them in a Moment.</p>
            <p>As if God had ſaid, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
ſtand ye by, and let me alone to deal with
theſe Seditious Rebels, they will be to hard
for you; let me lift up my Hand againſt them,
the Quarrel is mine, as well as yours.</p>
            <p>For I have whet my glittering Sword, and
my Hand ſhall take hold on Vengeance; and
I will abate their Pride, aſſwage their Envy,
diſcover their Deſign, and overthrow their
Devices.</p>
            <p>That all the Earth may know, that I hate,
and abhor all Pretences to Religion, that are
acted, and done in Diſobedience, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
to my Commands; and contrary to the
Rule, and Order of Government, that I have
Eſtabliſhed in my Church.</p>
            <p>And at the firſt Blow, he made at <hi>Corah,</hi>
and his Two Hundred and Fifty Confidents,
he ſtruck their <hi>Cenſers</hi> out of their Hands, and
with a flaſh of Fire Conſumed them to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>As if the Lord had ſaid, What have you
to do to handle <hi>Cenſers;</hi> to meddle with
Publick Matters of Religion; ſeeing ye do it
in Spite, and Contempt of the Government,
(Eſtabliſhed by Law) for Strife, and Debate,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49985:48"/>
and in Diſobedience, and Rebellion againſt
the Governours, that I have ſet over you.</p>
            <p>For in very deed, Envy at the Eſtabliſhed
Government in the Church, was the ſeed
Plot of <hi>Corah</hi>'s Sin, and <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams</hi>
Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>And therefore, it was high time, for God
to put to his helping Hand, to Vindicate <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and <hi>Aaron;</hi> for they were but God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
employed by him, to lead them in the
right way to Happineſs, and to Govern them
therein, by a Sacred Platform of good and
wholſome <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is written <hi>Pſal. 77. 20. Thou leadeſt
thy People, like a Flock, by the Hand of</hi> Moſes,
<hi>and</hi> Aaron, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) Magiſtracy, and Miniſtry.
'Tis true, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is the Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
and Lord of all things in Heaven,
and in Earth; but he doth not Govern in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>But by Angels, and Men, Deligated by
him, to bear Rule for him, over their fellow
Creatures; and from them, expects an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

He choſe <hi>David</hi> alſo, his Servant, and took him from
the Sheep-fold.</p>
            <p>From following the <hi>Ews</hi> great with Young; he
brought him to feed <hi>Jacob</hi> his People, and <hi>Iſrael</hi>
his Inheritance.</p>
            <p>So he fed them, according to the Integrity of
his Heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of
his Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Church</hi> Tranſlation <hi>of the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>reads
it thus,</hi> So he fed them, with a Faithful, and a
true Heart, and Ruled them Prudently with all his
Power.</p>
            <p>This of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> is an Extract of that
Meſſage, which God ſent by the Prophet
<hi>Nathan,</hi> to King <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, ſo ſhalt thou ſay unto my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>David,</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I took
thee from the Sheep-fould, from following the
Sheep, to be Ruler over my People <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I was with thee whither ſoever thou wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and have cut off all thine Enemies out of thy
ſight; and have made thee a great name, like unto
the name of the great Men, that are in the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now when the Spirit of Sedition ſhall
poſſeſs the Minds of Men, and prompt them
not only to diſlike, but ſpeak Evil of ſuch
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49985:49"/>
Dignities, and thoſe that enioy them; and
to aſſemble in Companies, to Aſſault their
Governours, as theſe Men in my <hi>Text,</hi> did
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> whom they knew God had
ſet over them, and frequently acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No wonder, the</hi> Pſalmiſt, <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 119. 126.
<hi>ſaid,</hi> It was time for God to work, when Men went
about to undermine the Laws of God, to make
them void.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Tranſlation <hi>of our Church</hi> Pſalms,
<hi>reads it thus,</hi> It is time for the Lord, to lay to
thy Hand, for they have deſtroyed thy Law.</p>
            <p>When theſe Men in my <hi>Text,</hi> had gathered
the Congregation together, againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
<hi>Aaron,</hi> what to do? Why to cut them off,
and Subvert the Government, both of Church
and State.</p>
            <p>It was high time for God to appear in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire, to take Vengeance upon them; and
pluck of the Crown of ſpiritual Pride, from
their haughty Heads.</p>
            <p>Which he did, as you have heard, and ſo
rejected their Confidences, and blaſted their
intended Proceedings.</p>
            <p>4. They were of an envious Spirit, they
envied the State and Dignity, which God
had conferred upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in
Conſtituting them, their Governours in the
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:49985:50"/>
This ill Quality, Cooperated with the reſt,
to provoke them to a Commotion, and civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>And that the old Serpent, had ſhed the Spawn
of Envy, into their Spirits; the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
affirms it, with a ſad <hi>Memento,</hi> 106. 16.
17, 18. <hi>They envied</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Camp, and</hi>
Aaron, <hi>the Saint of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earth opened, and ſwallowed up <hi>Dathan,</hi>
and covered the Congregation of <hi>Abiram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a Fire, was kindled in their Company;
the Flame burnt up the ungodly.</p>
            <p>By the laſt words in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. viz. <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of</hi> Abiram. It is very probable,
that <hi>Abiram</hi> had a gathered Church which
ſome of our Modern <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> call the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational,
or <hi>Independent</hi> way of gathering
Churches.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, as it is very likly, then he was the
firſt, that ever I read of, who gathered a falſe
Church out of a true one.</p>
            <p>And ſo by the <hi>Text,</hi> it is clear, that whilſt
<hi>Corah,</hi> and his Confederates were affronting
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in publick, <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
were at a private Meeting, in their Tents,
Praying for their good Succeſs, or waiting for
a Watch word from them, when they ſhould
ruſh forth with Weapons, to Aſſault their
Rulers,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49985:50"/>
For when <hi>Moſes,</hi> gave a charge to the
reſt of the People to come away from their
<hi>Tents,</hi> they came forth, and ſtood in their
<hi>Tent-doores,</hi> with their Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
with brazen faced Impudency, as if
they would outface God, and all juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>I did not know, till after more than For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times reading this Antient Record of
Holy Writ, and an exact Inſpection into the
Deſign of the Seditious Party, with a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Obſervation of their prerended Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
grounded upon falſe Principles.</p>
            <p>Their gathering the Common People,
like Herds of <hi>Goats,</hi> in a Tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
againſt their Rulers, their crying

            <p>I ſay, till I had diligently conſulted the

not know that <hi>Presbiter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were of ſo long a ſtanding in the World.
For <hi>Chorah,</hi> an inferior <hi>Levite,,</hi> contends
with <hi>Aaron,</hi> to level the Office of an <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi>
to that of a <hi>Levite;</hi> and flatly tells
him, that he takes too much upon him, to lift
up himſelf above them, being all of one <hi>Tribe,</hi>

Elders under him, of his own chooſing.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> they

               </gap> all Superintendency, for it were they,
as well as <hi>Corah,</hi> that told <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,
That they took too much upon them, to lift up

            </p>
            <p>They were able of themſelves to give
<hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> to their Congregated

               </gap>urisdiction;
and in this State of Independency, they
died Impenitently. How fitly may we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the Former,
and Latter Troubles of the Church,
<hi>Eccle.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The thing that hath been, is that, which
ſhall be; and that which is done, is that
which ſhall bedone; and there is no new thing
under the Sun.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing, whereof it may be ſaid,
ſee this is new? It hath been of old time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us.</p>
            <p>And whence is it, but from the Envy,
and Malice of the old Serpenr, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Devil, and Satan? Who as our
Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Was a Murderer from the beginning, and
abode not in the Truth.</hi> And ſo became an
Enemy to all Government above himſelf,
which Practice he continues ſtill in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49985:51"/>
World, by ſeducing the Sons of Men, into
his old Principles of Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, indeed this old Serpent doth often
renew his Shape, but never alters his ill
Qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he often changeth his Habit,
but not his Diſpoſition, alters his name, but
not his Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhifts places, but retains
ſtill his old Principles.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Branch, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Caution of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter, 1. Eph.</hi>
3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe
things before, beware, leaſt ye being lead away
with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your
own Stedfaſtneſs.</p>
            <p>But grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be
Glory both now, and for ever, Amen.</p>
            <p>5. They were of a ſullen, ſelfwill'd Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
nothing would pleaſe them, but what
proceeded from their own Wills.</p>
            <p>They anſweared <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ſome of their
Succeſſors did the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Chap.</hi>
19. 11. <hi>Return ye from the Evil of your
ways.</hi> They ſaid,</p>
            <p>Ver. 19 There is no hope, but we will walk
after our own devices, and we will every one
do the Imagination of his evil Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49985:52"/>
Yea, when they were in Captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,</hi>
they would not be Reclaimed from
their own Wills; but they made him
this deſperate Anſwer, <hi>As for the Word,
which thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the
Lord, we will not hearken to thee, but we
will certainly do whatſoever thing goeth out of
our own Mouth.</hi> Jer. 44. 14.</p>
            <p>Spiritual Wickedneſs, doth not only
blind, but bind the Spirits of unſtable Men,
with ſtrong Cords of ſelfwill'dneſs.</p>
            <p>It is a hard thing to recover any one
out of any Error, that hath laid the Reins
of his own will; into the neck of his own
Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sic volo, ſic Jubeo, ſtat proratione voluntas,</hi>
His own Will, is the Rule he reſolves to
walk by, and to any other Perſuaſion, he
is like the deaf <hi>Adder,</hi> that ſtops her Ear at
the Voice of the Charmer, charm he never
ſo wiſely.</p>
            <p>One of the ſoreſt Plagues, that God can
inflict on any Man, is to leave him to his
own Will, and the Councils of his own
Heart, which muſt needs deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>Some do think, that <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi>
is the only way to propogate the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
and the ſureſt way to Enthrone Chriſt in
the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of
Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49985:52"/>
And, I ſay the contrary, and will prove,
that there is no ſuch thing in Religion, as
<hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> ſuch a <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
I mean, as for every Man to ſerve God
after what way, and manner, pleaſeth him
beſt.</p>
            <p>It is eaſier to keep Sin out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
than to caſt it out when it is in.</p>
            <p>If that Light, which is within us, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
(for God hath lighted up a Candle
in every Mans Conſcience) be darkned with
Spiritual Errors, how great muſt that Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
needs be?</p>
            <p>The Devil, is the Prince of Darkneſs,
but he can Transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of Light. He is a fiery flying Serpent;
and if he can but get in his Head, he will
quickly winde in his whole Body.</p>
            <p>How many Virgin Profeſſors, have loſt
their Spiritual Chaſtity in an hour, by
gadding abroad, to trim their way, by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to go in a cleaner Path, than the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Salvation is, and ſo in a trice, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themſelves of that Peace of Conſcience,
which they have not recovered again whileſt
they have lived.</p>
            <p>O take heed, then of being Humorſom,
and Selfwill'd under your Profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Pray, that the Lord will not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49985:53"/>
leave you to your own Wills, nor to the
Councils of your own Hearts, nor to the
Wiſdom of your own Spirits, nor to the
Nerves of your own Strength, nor to the
Steps of your own ways, nor to the courſe
of your own Natures, nor to the Liberty of
your own Conſciences, for if he ſhould,
ye are in the High-way to eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

the Ways, and ſee, and ask for the old Paths;
where is the good way, and walk therein, and
ye ſhall find Reſt for your Souls.</p>
            <p>Now, I beſeech you, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that this Prophet, was not ſent only
to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo to the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and therefore the Words of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>
belong to us, as well as to them;
for when he wrote this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> he inſerts
his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>Chap. 1.
ver. 4. 5, 6, 7. Then the Word of the
Lord came unto me, ſaying, Before I Formed
thee in the Belly, I knew thee, and before thou
cameſt out of the Womb, I Sanctified thee, and
Ordained thee a Prophet to the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid I, ah, Lord God, behold, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeak, for I am a Child.</p>
            <p>But the Lord ſaid unto me, ſay not I am a
Child, for thou ſhalt go to all that I ſhall ſend
thee, and whatſoever I command thee, thou ſhalt
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49985:55"/>
Then the Lord put forth his Hand, and
touched my Mouth, and the Lord ſaid unto me,
behold, I have put my Words into thy Mouth.</p>
            <p>See, I have this Day ſet thee over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and
to pull down, and to deſtroy, and to throw down,
and to build, and to plant.</p>
            <p>I have read the Book of this <hi>Prophet,</hi>
very frequently in my daily Courſe of
reading the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and have taken
diligent notice of the Meaſures he took in
delivering it, which I humbly conceive, to
conſiſt mainly in theſe Six Heads.</p>
            <p>1. He gives them a Breviate of his Call, and
Commiſſion from God, to his Place and Office.</p>
            <p>2. Gives them a Draught of his Charge
againſt them, for their manifold Sins, Iniquities
and Tranſgreſſions, which with grieſ of Heart,
and with Checks bedewed with Tears, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlyrepeats.</p>
            <p>3. A Demonſtration, of God's juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them, for ſuch their Tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>greſſions.</p>
            <p>4. Exhortations, and Admonitions, Tears,
and Intreaties, to for ſake their own evil Ways,
and ſo prevent the Execution of thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he Denounced againſt them.</p>
            <p>5. The Way and Method he took, to perſuade
them there unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49985:56"/>
6. The nature of the Puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on them, in caſe they did not return,
and leave their ill Courſes.</p>
            <p>Now it is very remarkable, that before
he chargeth them with any groſs Polutions
of the Fleſh, or Prophane Debaucheries,
he begins with their Faults of Spiritual
Wickedneſs; and amongſt the many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
theſe following are ſome.</p>
            <p>1. He chargeth them with their unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and indiſcretion, in forſaking their
firſt Love, to the firſt Principles of their
Profeſſion of Religion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 1. 2. in
theſe words,</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Word of the Lord came unto
me, ſaying,</p>
            <p>Go and Cry in the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the
Kindneſs of thy Youth, the Love of thine eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
when thou wenteſt after me in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>But now they were no ſuch People, they
knew better things, or at leaſtwiſe, were
reſolved ſo to do, they were now
for ſome <hi>Novelties,</hi> they muſt have Quails,
to their <hi>Manna,</hi> which put the Lord to this
Expoſtulation, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>What Iniquities, have your Fathers found in
me that they are gone far from me? As if the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49985:56"/>
               <hi>Lord</hi> had ſaid, what Evil, do ye find in
the <hi>Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof,
which I ſet before you, as a Rule to walk
by.</p>
            <p>2. He charges them with their Delight
and Pleaſure in changes. <hi>Aarons Bells,</hi>
made no <hi>Muſick</hi> in their Ears, except they
Rung the Changes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are
no Gods? But my People have changed their
Glory, for that which doth not profit.</p>
            <p>Except they might have Alterations and
Amendments in the High-way of Salvation,
agreeable to their own Humors, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
not to walk in them any longer.</p>
            <p>This made the <hi>Lord</hi> Expoſtulate with
them again, after this manner, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Generations, ſee ye the Word of the Lord,
have I been a Wilderneſs unto</hi> Iſrael? <hi>A
Land of Darknes. Wherefore ſay my People, we
are Lords, we will come no more unto thee:</hi>
That is, we are our own Maſters, and at
our own liberty, to ſerve God how, and
when we pleaſe; and as for the Antient
ways of God, we will know them no more,
ſo as to walk in them any longer.</p>
            <p>And further, at <hi>Ver.</hi> 33. the Prophet
asketh them this Queſtion, <hi>Why trimmeſt
thou thy way to ſeek Love? Therefore, haſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49985:57"/>
thou alſo taught the wicked ones thy Ways,</hi> (i. e.)
to forſake the High-way of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And then at <hi>Ver.</hi> 36. He reinforceth
this charge, ſaying <hi>Why gaddeſt thou about ſo
much, to change thy ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is very remarkable, that in this
2. <hi>Chap.</hi> the Prophet gives the unſtable
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the reproachfull <hi>Epithites</hi> of
<hi>Trimmers, Gadders,</hi> and <hi>Changlings,</hi> as the
Product of diſcontented Spirits, that did
not know when they were well, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
would not.</p>
            <p>And then in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. he follows his Charge
and Reproves them.</p>
            <p>1. For a ſtubborn Refuſal, to walk in
the Antient ways of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. For Revolting from them, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Backſliding. <hi>Ver.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>3. For being no better than <hi>Reprobate
Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18, He calls upon them to
<hi>Return from the Evil of their own new Ways,</hi>
to walk in the Antient and true ways of
God, from which they were (without any
juſt Cauſe) ungratfully, and unkindly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
But inſtead of hearkning to him,
they gave him this reſolute Anſwer at <hi>ver.</hi>
12, <hi>There is no Hope, but we will walk after
our own Devices, and we will every one do the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49985:57"/>
Imaginations of his own Heart.</hi> To which
dreadful Anſwer of theirs, the Prophet
makes this lamentable <hi>Reply, ver.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord, Ask ye now
amongſt the</hi> Heathen, <hi>who hath heard ſuch
things; the</hi> Virgin <hi>of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath done a very
horrible thing.</hi> And again, at <hi>ver.</hi> 15. he
pronounceth a dreadful Sentence againſt
them, in the Name of the Lord, in this
Form of Words.</p>
            <p>Becauſe my People have forgotten me, and
have burnt Incenſe to Vanity; and they have
cauſed them to ſtumble in their ways, from the
Antient Paths, to walk in Paths, in a way not
caſt up.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I have had great ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Heart, what the meaning of the
Peoples words might be, in the firſt Part
of their Anſwer, (<hi>viz.) There is no Hope.</hi>
Certainly it could not be, <hi>There is no Hope
of Salvation.</hi> For the cloſe of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
imports the contrary; for they ſaid,
<hi>We will walk after our own Devices, and
we will every one do the Imaginations of his
own Heart.</hi> It ſeems by this Anſwer, that
they did intend to ſerve God, ſome way
or other, but it muſt be in ſuch a way as
pleaſed them, and in no other way did
they intend to walk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49985:58"/>
So that I underſtand by theſe Words of
theirs, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> they mean that the
Prophet had no hope of Reclaiming them
from following their own ways, that he
might as well hold his Peace and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as to perſuade them to return from
their new Practice, that they had taken up,
to Repair to the Antient ways of God;
and ſo eager and to earneſt, and ſo intent
and reſolute were they to make good their
ſeditious Words, that they were making ready
to run a way from him, and get out of the
hearing of him; and this is clear, if we
conſider the words of the Prophet, in <hi>Chap.</hi>
2. 25. His Words <hi>There, are theſe, Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
hold thy Foot from being unſhod, and thy Throat
from thirſt; but thou ſaidſt, there is no Hope,
no, for I have loved Strangers, and after
them will I go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were putting off their Shooes, to
run in their Vamps, with more ſpeed and
haſt to get out of his ſight and hearing;
and ſuch a thirſty deſire had they after
ſtrange <hi>Novelties</hi> that they could not ſtay
ſo long with the Prophet as to give him
the hearing of what it was, that he had
further to ſay to them: For he would
willingly have <hi>Reaſoned</hi> with them, butthey
were in ſuch haſt, that they would not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49985:58"/>
ſtay to hear the ſound of his Trumpet ſound
a retreat to them, to return to the good old
way, that they had caſt behind their Backs;
and at laſt by their frequent refuſing to hear
him, and the ſnapiſhanſwer that they gave him:
He calls Heaven and Earth to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
againſt them, in ſuch Words as theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens at this! And be
horribly affraid.</hi> Chap. 2 12. And then
with bitter Sighs, calls to the Earth, <hi>O!
Earth, Earth, Earth, Hear the Words of the
Lord.</hi> Chap. 22. 19. and elſewhere, Chap.
6. 17, 18, 19, 20. Where after he hath
ſpoken theſe Words, <hi>I ſet Watchmen over you,
ſaying, Hearken to the ſound of the Trumpet.</hi>
But they ſaid, <hi>We will not hearken:</hi> He then
proceeds in his Appeal, to his former Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Therefore, here ye Nations, and know O Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
what is amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Hear O Earth, behold, I will bring Evil upon
this People, even the Fruit of their thoughts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have not hearkned unto my Word, but
Rejected it.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe cometh there to me <hi>Incenſe</hi>
from <hi>Sheba,</hi> and the ſweet Cane from a far
Country: Your Offerings are not acceptable, nor
your Sacrifices ſweet unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49985:59"/>
From whence, you may obſerve, if ye will,
that the true God accepts of no kind of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done to him, that hath not the ſtamp
of his antient High way upon it.</p>
            <p>Enquire of all the Prophets, and you will
not find one of them, that doth not ſharply
reprove and inveigh againſt all ſorts of <hi>Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
that have forſaken the plain High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of Salvation, to follow the Dictates
of their own Hearts, and deviſe to themſelves,
new ways of Worſhipping God, and that
every one of them did put the Trumpet to
his Mouth, and ſound a Retreat to them, to
return to the High-way of Salvation,
wherein God had formerly led them.</p>
            <p>I Confeſs, we are under a Cloud of God's
Anger, and the Rod of his diſpleaſure is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, eſpecially in our Diviſions, about Sacred
things; for if Unity, Peace and Concord in a
Kingdom, owning Chriſt for our Lord and
Saviour, be one of the choice Bleſſings that
we can wiſh for, under Heaven, then certainly
(by the rule of Contraries) Diviſions, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and Diſſentions, are one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Plagues and Curſes, that can poſſibly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all upon ſuch a Kingdom, and People up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth.</p>
            <p>If Diviſions bring Deſolations to a well
ſetled <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> ſo will Diviſions in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49985:59"/>
the Church, at laſt, bring ruine and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Religion, and make us worſe than
the <hi>Heathen:</hi> For a People, ſo divided are
in the High way, to all ſorts of Miſeries,
as Chriſt hath aſſured, and experience
taught us. If any one beneath Chriſt, had
aſſerted ſuch a thing, I might have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
his Prediction, but when the only
begotten Son of God, who is truth it ſelf,
and therefore can not poſſibly lie, for he is
his Fathers true and faithful Witneſs of all
things paſt, preſent, and to come. And
was not this the Voice of the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> And
is not this his ſaying, <hi>A Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it ſelf, cannot ſtand, but is brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi>
that is, puts the Kingdom where
ſuch Diviſions are, into the direct way of
Deſolation and Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, that ſince the Son of God
hath ſpoken the Word, I dare not give
him the lie, by thinking that a Nation
divided in it ſelf, can poſſibly ſtand in a
ſtate of ſecurity. Therefore, did he give
this Advice and Charge to his Diſciples,
to have Salt in themſelves, and to be at
Peace one with another. Certainly, it was
the ſame thing that the Prophet <hi>Jenemiah</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49985:60"/>
aimed at, in that Word of Advice, which
with grief of Heart he gave to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a
little befere they were carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
into <hi>Babilon. Chap.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>Be thou Inſtructed O <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> Leaſt my
Soul depart from thee; leaſt I make thee De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate,
a Land not Inhabited.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that ſuch Offences will come,
but woe be to them, by whom they do
come: o ye think that Chriſt (the
Prince of Peace) will Patronize your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.
Will ye lay the Burthen of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Wickedneſs upon his Back, and by
force of ſtrange Arguments, compel him
to bear another Croſs? This would be
one way to Crucifie him afreſh, and to
preſs him down, as a Cart is preſſed with
Sheaves. Are the Diviſions of Chriſtians,
pleaſing to God? Do ye think that Chriſt
takes it well at your Hands, to Foment
ſo many Diviſions, as ye have crumbled
your ſelves into, ſince ye have left our
Church? Is the Study of Diviſions, the
viſible mark of Chriſtianity? Is this to
do the Will of God on <hi>Earth,</hi> as it is
done in <hi>Heaven?</hi> Are there any ſort of
<hi>Diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nters</hi> there? No.</p>
            <p>The, Angels were never known ſince
the Fall, to fall out amongſt themſelves,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49985:60"/>
either in <hi>Heaven</hi> above, or in any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that they have been imployed in for
Chriſt upon <hi>Earth.</hi> There is no Strife or
Contention amongſt them, they ſerve
Chriſt with one Conſent, and Praiſe him
with one Voice; they all Glorifie his name
in one Form of ſound Words, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
in the ſame. Thoſe two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Chriſt, the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
and the great Evangeliſt St. <hi>John,</hi> do
both agree in their Teſtimonies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this thing. The Teſtimony of the
Prophet, is written in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 3. And
one Cried unto another, and ſaid, <hi>Holy,
Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole
Earth, is full of his Glory.</hi> The Teſtimony
of the Evangeliſt, is written in the Book
of the <hi>Revelation</hi> Chap. 4. 8. <hi>And they
Reſt not Day and Night, ſaying, Holy, Holy,
Holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,
and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may plainly perceive by theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Records,</hi> that there are no <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
in Heaven; that the Angels do ſerve
Chriſt in Unity of Spirit, and in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Words. So that we may eaſily
geſs, who were the firſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> even
the fallen Angels; and therefore the
name of a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> can be no Glory to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49985:61"/>
the Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>But that the fallen Angels, were the
firſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the way of Truth.
The Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in whom are hid all
the Treaſures of Wiſdom, and Knowledge,
hath put the Queſtion out of Doubt, in
his Diſcourſe with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 8.
44. Where after they had told Chriſt,
that <hi>Abraham,</hi> was their Father, and that
God was their Father; Chriſt tells them
plainly, that they were Related to neither,
but that they were of their Father the
Devil; and the Luſts of your Father will
ye do; for he was a Murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the Truth.</p>
            <p>From theſe Words of our Saviour, we
may underſtaud what the Devils Sin is,
for which they are Reſerved in Chains of
Darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great
Day. Alſo</p>
            <p>From Chriſt's Words here, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the fallen Angels did know the
Truth, and by their Unbelief fell from it,
and of pure and upright Angels, became,
unclean Spirits and Devils. For as no
Man can be blamed for not abiding in a
Houſe wherein he never was,
neither would Chriſt have blamed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49985:61"/>
the Devils for not abiding in the Truth,
if they had not known it, and been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in it. Wherefore did <hi>Chriſt</hi> call
<hi>Judas,</hi> Devil? <hi>Have I not choſen Twelve,
and one of you is a Devil?</hi> Was it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew the Truth, and Preach'd
the Truth, and afterwards became an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to it? and betrayed his Lord and
Maſter, that had taught and Inſtructed him
in it, as by his Confeſſion, before he Hanged
himſelf, it was too manifeſt.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Eternal Happineſs, conſiſts
chiefly in two things.</p>
            <p>A true Faith, and an Holy Life. A
Judgment rightly inform'd in matters of
Faith, and a Converſation rightly ordered
in the Practical Duties of true Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Men and Women, whoſe Lives
and Converſations are Holy, are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with the Holy Ghoſt; and they that
are truly Zealous for the Honour of God's
Holy Name, are Baptized with Fire; ſo
that to be Holy in our Lives, and Zealous
in our Spirits for the Glory of the Holy
God, is an outward Teſtimony of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and with
Fire, precedent to which, is the Baptiſm
of Water, the Gate of Enterance into
an outward Profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49985:62"/>
Now both theſe Pillars of the <hi>Chriſtian
Religion,</hi> are apparently to be ſeen in the
Doctrine and Prayers of our Church, to
all that have not ſhut their Eyes againſt it,
nor turn'd their Back upon it.</p>
            <p>I am bold therefore to ſay, that the
Service of God in our Church, is Holy,
becauſe it is Founded in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
Compoſed of <hi>Precepts, Examples,</hi> or
<hi>Commands,</hi> Collected out of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
Therefore many of our Prayers are
called by the Name of <hi>Collests,</hi> becauſe
they are <hi>Collected</hi> out of thoſe Portions of
<hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> that are Appointed to be
Read that Day that they are uſed.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Hymns</hi> that we uſe, both at
<hi>Morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Evening Prayer,</hi> are the very
Words of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> or clearly
deduced from them.</p>

Form of ſound Words, call upon the name
of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent,
for the only Wiſe God, hath promiſed it by
the Mouth of the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah, Chap.</hi>
3. <hi>Ver</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord,
until the Day that I riſe up to the Prey, for
my Determination, is to gather the Nations,
that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms, to pour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them mine Indignation, even all my fierce
Anger, for all the Earth, ſhall be devoured
with the Fire of my Jealoucy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49985:63"/>
For then will I turn to the People a pure
Language, that they may all call upon the name
of the Lord, to ſerve him with one Conſent.</p>
            <p>If all <hi>Scripture,</hi> given by Inſpiration, is
profitable for Doctrine, what may we
then learn from this ſacred Oracle of God's
Revealed Will? Why, I humbly conceive,
they teach us theſe Three things.</p>
            <p>1. That Uniformity of Prayer in
the Publick Worſhip of God, is the beſt
way and manner of waiting upon God</p>
            <p>2. That ſuch Publick Worſhip of God,
comes neareſt to the Heavenly, of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon Earth, and therefore moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Nature, and moſt agreeable to
his Mind and Will.</p>
            <p>3. That ſuch Uniformity, is the abſolute
Determination of his Divine Will, and
ſhall be the ſtanding Rule, and Practice
of his Church and People, in the midſt of
all their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Thoſe People then, that reject, deſpiſe,
vilify, and reproach, with opprobrious
words, and ſcurrilous Language, ſuch a Form
of Prayer, and ſuch a Method of Serving
God, which is Beautified, and Adorned,
and Seaſoned with the Salt of God's Holy
Word, are one ſort of <hi>Anti-Scripturians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49985:63"/>
But tho' there be too many that do ſo,
yet it is never the worſe, for their dirty
Language, no more than the Heavenly
<hi>Manna</hi> was, becauſe ſome ſeditious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
gave it the ſcurrilous name of Light Bread.
The Holy and Heavenly Angels conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
feeding on that Food, which proud
and haughty Men trampled under their
Feet, and gave it no better Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that Light and Lothſom Bread. I
do not therefore much admire at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
which ſome have taken up againſt the
Prayers of our Church, when <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God's
choſen People, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
grew weary of Heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> the Food
of Angels.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to theſe things?
For ſince the chief of the fallen Angels,
in the ſhape of a Serpent, Poiſoned our
Nature with the Venome of his own Sin,
no Age hath been free from ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of it, among the Sons of Men,
nor ever will be, till Satan be confined
to the Bottomleſs Pit.</p>
            <p>I am ſure in the time of the Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Church was peſtered with ſuch
ſort of Cattle, as he calls them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.
18, 19, 20.</p>

Seemeth a it ſmall thing unto you, to have
eaten up the good Paſture, but ye muſt tread
down with your Feet the reſidue of your Paſtures?
And to have drunk of the deep Waters, but
ye muſt foul the reſidue with your Feet.</p>
            <p>As for my Flock, they eat that which
ye have trodden with your Feet; and they
drink that which ye have fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God unto
them, Behold, I, even I will Judge between

            <p>Hence it is Evident, the Lord will one
Day Judge between the <hi>Holy Martyrs,</hi> that
Compoſed the Prayers of our Church for us,
and afterwards Sealed it with their Blood
in Flames of Fire. Whither they did
well in ſo doing, or whither they do
wickedly, who think their Tongues their
own, to vilify and ſcornfully reproach it,
at their own Pleaſure, and with out all
controul, for who is Lord over them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49985:64"/>
Come, my Brethen, be not angry with
me, nor account me an Enemy, becauſe
I tell you the truth, and I will ask you
a few Queſtions.</p>
            <p>I. What good thing there is, that any
of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ask in your <hi>Extempore Prayers,</hi>
that we do not ask in a well-ſet Form of
ſound Words.</p>
            <p>II. Whither there be any one Petition
in the Daily Prayers of our Church, that
doth contradict the leaſt Branch of God's
Revealed Will, that ſavours of Impiety,
or that can be truly ſaid to hinder the
work of Grace in the Heart of any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>III. Whither there be any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that may make a miſerable Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
even in this Life, if he can obtain the
things he Prays for.</p>
            <p>IV. Whither the things we pray for
therein, if granted, be not of force to make
the worſt of Sinners to become one of the
better ſort of Saints upon Earth.</p>
            <p>V. Whither there be any thing that is
requiſite or neceſſary for Soul or Body, to
make our Lives comfortable here, and our
Souls eternally Happy hereafter, that is
omitted or left out in the Prayers of our
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:49985:65"/>
VI. Whither the matter contained in
the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> be not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
acknowledgment, and Vindication of
the Faith, which was once delivered to the
Saints? And whither we are not Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
earneſtly to contend for it?</p>
            <p>VII. Whither there be any thing that
may ſavingly inform the Judgments of Men
in mattrrs of Faith, or enlighten the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the Myſtery of Mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or that may encourage Sinners to
turn from Darkneſs to Light; and from

not to be found in the Doctrin and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I beſeech you my Friends,
ask your ſelves this one Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Whither it ſavours of Wiſdom in any
that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, or own
themſelves to be his Servants, to queſtion
the truth of his Word. Who as a Prophet
hath foretold, the deſolation of Kingdoms,
to proceed from their Diviſions.</p>
            <p>Hath not <hi>Moſes,</hi> that Man of God, told
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, that God would raiſe them
up a Prophet like to himſelf, and that
God the Father would put words into his
Mouth; and that whoſoever, would not
give heed thereto, God would require
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49985:65"/>
it of him? And doth not the Apoſtle St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> tell us, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. That Chriſt was that
Prophet, <hi>and that whoſoever would not hear
him ſhould be deſtroyed from amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
And hath not Chriſt, by vertue of
his Prophetical Office told us, <hi>That a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
divided cannot ſtand, but is brought to
deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let us not Tempt Chriſt by our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions!
to try whether he will, or can ſave
us from Deſolation, contradictory to his
own word.</p>
            <p>I think therefore, and I do Appeal to
the Conſcience of any unbiaſſed Man, that
profeſſeth the Chriſtian Faith, whither it
be not better for you to return to the High-Way
of Salvation again then by your
Diviſions to continue rambling from one
by-path to another, till ye know not
which way to take, and leave the Breach
open for our Enemies to break in upon us,
and lay our Land Deſolate.</p>
            <p>Do ye not hear what the Son of God
ſaid? <hi>Mat. 24. 15. When ye therefore ſhall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Abomination of Deſolation, ſtand in the
Holy Place: Standing where it ought not,</hi> ſo
St. <hi>Mark</hi> reads it: And hath he not told
us elſewhere, that <hi>The Diviſions of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
will bring it to Deſolation.</hi> Shall we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49985:66"/>
then call our ſelves Believers, and give no
credit to his Word in ſo weighty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as the Preſervation of a Kingdom
from Ruin and Deſtruction?</p>
            <p>May we not ſafely conclude from the
Words of our Saviour, that Diviſions and
Diſſentions amongſt Profeſt Chriſtians, is
an Abomination unto the Lord? And that
<hi>Sciſm</hi> is a provoking Sin. Did not Chriſt
weep for the Diviſions of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And
ſhall we reioice and glory in ours?</p>
            <p>O take heed of writing contrary to the
Copy that Chriſt hath ſet you! Did God
deſtroy the <hi>Jeruſalemites</hi> by their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions?
And do ye think that he will ſave us
by ours? Surely, No: For if Jeſus Chriſt,
be the ſame yeſterday and to day, and
for ever, as certainly he is; and he is a

can we ſhelter our ſelves for ſafety under
the ſhadow of his Wings, that are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
amongſt our ſelves?</p>
            <p>O take heed of entring into Judgment
with Chriſt, or holding an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any thing that he hath ſpoken!
Are ye wiſer and ſtronger then he is? Is
not he a conſuming Fire, and your ſelves
but dry ſtuble? Will ye contend with
him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or Maſtery? Can ye ſpeak more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49985:66"/>
for your Diviſions, then Chriſt hath already
declared againſt them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do ye not hear what the Lord ſaith by the
Mouth of the Prophet? I ſay,</hi> Chap. 27. 4.
Who would ſet the Briers and Thorns againſt me
in Battle? I would go thorow them, I would
burn them together.</p>
            <p>Did Chriſt ever exerciſe his Prophetical
Office in vain? Did his Words ever fall
to the Ground without effect? Did he not
Prophecy that <hi>Judas</hi> would betray him,
and <hi>Peter</hi> deny him? Did he not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that falſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophets</hi>
would ariſe, and deceive many? And are
not his Sayings fulfilled? Did he not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
(with Tears running down his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Cheeks) that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would be
utterly deſtroyed, and the manner how?
For are not theſe his Words? <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 43,
44. <hi>For the Days ſhall come upon thee, that
thine Enemies ſhall caſt a Trench about thee,
and compaſs thee round, and keep thee in on
every ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall lay thee even with the Ground,
and thy Children within thee, and they ſhall not
leave in thee one Stone upon another, becauſe
thou kneweſt not the time of thy Viſitation.</p>
            <p>And were not theſe Prophetical Words
of his, fulfilled by the <hi>Roman Souldiers?</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49985:67"/>
Did he not likewiſe fore-tel the ſpoiling
of the <hi>Temple,</hi> in theſe Words? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 2,</p>
            <p>And <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid unto them, (<hi>i. e.) his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>)
Se ye not all theſe things? Verily I
ſay unto you, there ſhall not be left one Stone
upon another, that ſhall not be thrown down.</p>
            <p>Was not this ſaying of Chriſt, alſo ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
and verified at the ſame time that
<hi>Titus Veſpatianus</hi> took the City, and the
Souldiers burnt the Temple, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to quench the Fire newly begun in

fulfilled, and therefore it was in vain for
<hi>Titus</hi> to endeavour the quenching of thoſe
Flames, which by a ſure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
were kinded and fomented by the

God, is not a Man, that he ſhould Lie;
neither the Son of Man, that he ſhould
Repent. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not
do it? Or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he
not make it good? and may not we ſay,
Hath not the Son of God, the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt (into whoſe Hands, the Order, Rule
and Government of all things in Heaven,
and in Earth, and in the Sea, and in all
places, is given by an eternal Decree of
his Father) ſaid, <hi>That a Kingdom divided, is
brought to Deſolation?</hi> And will he not
make good his Word? Yea, certainly he
will, There is not one jot or tittle of his
Words ſhall fall to the Ground, till all of
them are fulfilled,</p>
            <p>Did ye never read, and conſider, that
word of the Lord, by the Mouth of the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Chap.</hi> 66, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Behold, the Lord will come with Fire, and
with his Chariots like a Whirl-wind, to render
his Anger with Fury, and his Rebuke, with
Flames of Fire.</p>
            <p>For by Fire and by his Sword, will the Lord
plead with all Fleſh: And the ſlain of the Lord
ſhall be many.</p>
            <p>The Prophet means, that all ſorts of
carnal Men, ſhall feel the ſmart Rod of
God's Anger, when he cometh forth of his

Do ye not know that the Church of

If ye have forgotten theſe things,

            <p>The firſt, is that of the Prophent <hi>Iſaiah,
Chap.</hi> 35. 8.</p>
            <p>And an High-way ſhall be there, and it

So that by all theſe Experiments it is too
evident that where Striſe and Diviſions are,
there will be certainly Confuſion, and every

Prince of Peace, and the Covenant that he

Do ye not yet know that <hi>Satan</hi>'s Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of Malice, whereby he endeavours to
work Miſchief to the Church of God, is, to
ſow the Tare-ſeed of Diviſions amongſt them?
For if he can but ſtart a queſtion from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
Heart of any one of them, that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
a doubtful Diſputation amongſt them, he
hath his ends; and tho' it may ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
Knowledge; yet if it will but make
the leaſt rent he hath as much as he looks
for; he knows that there will be ſome Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by,
that will blow at the Coal.</p>
            <p>Nothing can harm the Church of Chriſt
but the Diviſions of her own Children; to
avoid which, a true Believer will deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and be ſilent in many things of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
rather than he will maintain a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
that may in the leaſt be prejudicial to
the Church's Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had cauſe enough to have held
a diſpute with <hi>Lot,</hi> when their Herdſmen fell
out (about what I know not) and doubtleſs
might have had the better of it, but he will
not; he had rather be ſilent, and ſo quench the
Coals of Strife, than to encreaſe the Flame,
by contention, he wiſely foreſaw the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
that was likely to follow the Strife
and Contention that was begun betwixt
them; ſo that he preſently endeavours to put
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49985:73"/>
out the Fire before it was too much kindled,
by refuſing to contend at all.</p>
            <p>Let there be no Strife I pray thee (ſaith
he to <hi>Lot</hi>) betwixt me and thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
my Herdſmen, and thy Herdſmen, for
we be Brethren.</p>
            <p>All true Believers are the Children of
faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore I could wiſh
with all my Heart that theſe Words were
written in Characters of Gold, upon the
fleſhly Tables of the Hearts of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Chriſt, whom the Doctrin of the
Goſpel hath united by Articles of a true Faith,
how ſweet would Peace, and how bitter
would Diviſions be to them?</p>
            <p>It is a remarkable thing, and worth our
notice, that all the Miſeries that the ſubtle
Serpent hath brought upon all Mankind,
had its Riſe and Beginning from a doubtful
Diſputation betwixt himſelf and our firſt
Parents; and thus he began with a ſoft,
ſmooth, oily Language; yea, hath God ſaid,
<hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Woman ſaid unto the Serpent,
<hi>we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.
But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midſt of
the garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it,
neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die. And the
ſerpent ſaid unto the woman, ye ſhall not ſurely die.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49985:73"/>
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,
then your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as
gods, knowing good, and evil;</hi> as if the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
had ſaid, you talk of dying, if ye eat,
why ſurely ye ſhall not die. God hath kept
that Secret from you, which I will reveal to
you; I am an Angel of Light, I came down
from Heaven, and therefore muſt needs
know the Mind and Will of God better than
you do. Ye ſay, that if ye eat of the Tree
in the midſt of the Garden, you ſhall die;
but I tell you, that God knows, that in the
very day ye eat thereof your Eyes ſhall be
opened, your Underſtanding's enlightned,
your Knowledge increaſed, and ye ſhall be
as Gods, perfectly knowing Good and Evil.
Will ye then be limited by a Law, when ye
may have perfect Freedom? Will ye be tied
to the Obſervation of an Ordinance, when
ye may live above all Ordinances; will ye
be ſuch Enemies to your own Good? Will
ye ſtand ſo much in your own Light? Will
ye continue blind, when ye may have your
Eyes open'd? 'Tis but ſtepping a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of your uſual walk, and ye
ſhall enjoy ſuch unſpeakable Priviledges, which
God never yet diſcover'd to you. In this
doubtful Diſputation did the Dragon, that
old Serpent, (which is call'd the Devil, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49985:74"/>
Satan) lay the foundation of the myſtery of
Iniquity; which, we may plainly perceive,
was not wrought by a temptation to Carnal
Infirmities, but by a crafty Deluſion to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Wickedneſs; and if you will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the ſacred Scriptures, as Chriſt hath
commanded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. and take diligent
notice of the things ye read; ye will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive that Spiritual Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
hath had the greateſt ſhare in thoſe
Sins that have provoked the Lord to pour
forth the Vials of his Wrath upon his Church
and People in all Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>And being aſſured by ſo ſacred a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as the Word of God is, that the Diviſions
of a Kingdom do portend its Deſolation, let
us follow thoſe things that make for Peace,
and let us take the advice which the Apoſtle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Grieve not the holy ſpirit of God, whereby ye
are ſealed to the day of redemption.</p>
            <p>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and
clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from
you, with all malice.</p>
            <p>And be kind one to another, tender-hearted,
forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's
ſake hath forgiven you.</p>

and thereby expoſe the Proteſtant
Faith to the Scorn and laughter of a cruel
Adverſary; for over your Shoulders do the
Blood-thirſty Papiſts ſhoot at our Hearts.</p>
            <p>O that ye vvere vviſe, that ye vvould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
theſe things, and return to the high

way of Salvation again! What joy would
there be in our Churches? What loving
Embraces? What mutual Society? What
Gladneſs of Heart? What inward Comfort
and Conſolation to our Immortal Souls?
What reviving of Spirits? How ſweet would
ſuch Unity Peace and Concord, be to the
whole Kingdom? How mediately-ſecure
ſhould we be, not only from all fears of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invaſion, but from all doubts of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War amongſt our ſelves? Then ſhould
we offer our daily Sacrifices of Praiſe and
Thankſgiving, and call upon the name of
the Lord, to ſerve him with one Shoulder,
and one Conſent.</p>
            <p>Thus have I diſcharg'd my duty to all
that profeſs the name of Chriſt in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
wherein I was born. What the effect
of it may be God knows, for I do not; I
leave the iſſue of it to the only wiſe Saviour
of the World, in whom are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Wiſdom and Knowledge, whoſe
poor, weak, and unworthy Servant I am,
and hope to perſevere therein.</p>
            <q>Dum Spiritus hos Regit ortus.</q>
            <p>And leſt any Reader ſhould here and there
meet with a word or two in this Poſtſcript,
which he may happily think hath a tang of
Acerbity; I have thorowly ſeaſon'd, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49985:77"/>
ſweetned it with the judgment of a Martyr'd
Monarch, a Stedfaſt and Faithful Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the truly antient, Catholique, and
Apoſtolick Faith.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Upon the Ordinance againſt the
Common-Prayer-Book.</head>
               <p>IT is no News to have all Innovations uſher`d
in with the name of Reformations in Church
and State, by thoſe, who ſeeking to gain Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Vulgar for their extraordinary
Parts and Piety, muſt needs undo whatever was
formerly ſettled never ſo well and wiſely.</p>
               <p>So hard can the pride of thoſe that ſtudy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,
allow former times any ſhare or degree of
Wiſdom or Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>And becauſe matter of Prayer and Devotion to
God juſtly bears a great part in Religion, (being
the Souls more immediate converſe with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majeſty) nothing could be more plauſible to
the People then to tell them, They ſerved God amiſs
in that Point.</p>
               <p>Hence our public Liturgy, or Forms of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Prayers muſt be (not amended, in what upon
free and publick advice might ſeem to ſober Men
inconvenient for matter or manner, to which I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49985:77"/>
ſhould eaſily conſent, but) wholly caſhiered and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
and after many popular Contempts offered
to the Book, and thoſe that uſed it according to
their Conſciences, and the Laws in force, it muſt
be crucified by an Ordinance, the better to pleaſe
either thoſe Men, who gloried in their extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Vein and Fluency; or others, who conſcious to
their own formality in the uſe of it, thought they
fully expiated their Sin of not uſing it aright, by
laying all the blame upon it, and a total rejection
of it as a dead letter, thereby to excuſe the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Hearts.</p>
               <p>As for the Matter contained in the Book, ſober
and learned Men have ſufficiently vindicated it
againſt the Cavils and Exceptions of thoſe, who
thought it a part of Piety to make what prophane
objections they could againſt it, eſpecially for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Superſtition; whereas no doubt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
was exactly conformed to the Doctrin of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and this by all Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches is confeſſed to be moſt ſound and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.</p>
               <p>For the matter of uſing Set and Preſcribed
Forms, there is no doubt, but that wholſome words,
being known, and fitted to Men's Vnderſtand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs,
are ſooneſt received into their Hearts, and apteſt to
excite and carry along with them judicious and
fervent Affections.</p>
               <p>Nor do I ſee any reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49985:78"/>
be weary of a well-compoſed Liturgy, (as I hold
this to be) more then of all other things, wherein
the Conſtancy abates nothing of the Excellency and
Uſefulneſs.</p>
               <p>I could never ſee any reaſon why any Chriſtian
ſhould abhor, or be forbidden to uſe the ſame Forms
of Prayer, ſince he prays to the ſame God, believes
in the ſame Saviour, profeſſeth the ſame Truths,
reads the ſame Scriptures, hath the ſame Duties
upon him, and feels the ſame daily wants for the
moſt part, both inward and outward, which are
common to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Sure we may as well before-hand know what we
pray, as to whom we pray, and in what words, as to
what ſenſe; when we deſire the ſame things, what
hinders we may not uſe the ſame words? Our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and Digeſtion too may be good when we uſe,
as when we pray for, <hi>our daily Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Men, I hear, are ſo impatient not to uſe
in all their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>votions their own Invention and Gifts,
that they not only diſuſe (as too many) but wholly caſt
away and contemn the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> whoſe great
guilt is, that it is the warrant and original pattern
of all ſet Liturgies in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>I ever thought that the proud Oſtentation of
Men's Abilities for Invention, and the vain affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
of variety for Expreſſions, or in Publick
Prayer, or in any ſacred Adminiſtrations, merits a
greater brand of Sin, than that which they call
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49985:78"/>
Coldneſs and Barrenneſs; nor are Men in thoſe
novelties leſs ſubject to formal and ſuperficial
tempers (as to their hearts) than in the conſtant
Forms, where not the words, but Men's Hearts
are to blame.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt but a Man may be very formal
in the moſt extemporary variety, and very fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devout in the moſt wonted Expreſſions: Nor is
<hi>God more a God</hi> of Variety than of Conſtancy:
Nor are conſtant <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayers more likely to
flat and hinder the Spirit of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than un-premeditated and confuſed variety to
diſtract and loſe it.</p>
               <p>Wherein Men muſt be ſtrangely impudent, and
flatterers of themſelves, not to have an infinite
ſhame of what they ſo do and ſay, in things of ſo
ſacred a nature before God and the Church, after ſo
ridiculous, and indeed, profane a manner.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be expected, but that in duties of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
performance, as Sacramental Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the like, which are ſtill the ſame: Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
muſt either come to uſe their own Forms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
which are not like to be ſo ſound, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of the nature of the duty, as Forms of
Publick Compoſure; or elſe they muſt every time
affect new Expreſſions, when the Subject is the
ſame; which can hardly be preſumed in any Man's
greateſt Suffitiencies not to want (many times)
much of that compleatneſs, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der, and gravity,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49985:79"/>
becoming thoſe duties; which by this means are
expoſed at every Celebration to every Miniſter's
private Infirmities, Indiſpoſitions, Errors, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and Defects, both for Judgment and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>A ſerious ſenſe of which inconvenience in the
Church unavoidably following every Man's ſeveral
manner of officiating, no doubt, firſt occaſioned the
Wiſdom and Piety of the antient Churches, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe miſchiefs, by the uſe of conſtant Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of Publick Compoſure.</p>
               <p>The want of which I believe this Church will
ſufficiently feel, when the unhappy Fruits of many
Men's ungoverned Ignorance, and confident defects,
ſhall be diſcovered in more Errors, Schiſm; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and uncharitable Diſtractions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which are already but too many, the more is
the pity.</p>
               <p>However, if violence muſt needs bring in, and
abett thoſe Innovations, (that Men may not ſeem
to have nothing to do) which Law, Reaſon and
Religion forbids, at leaſt to be ſo obtruded, as
wholly to juſtle out the Publick Liturgy.</p>
               <p>Yet nothing can excuſe that moſt unjuſt and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
ſeverity of thoſe Men, who either lately had
ſubſcribed to, uſed, and maintained the Service-Book,
or refuſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe it, cryed out of the rigour
of Laws and Biſhops, which ſuffered them not to
uſe the Liberty of their Conſcience in not uſing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49985:79"/>
That theſe Men (I ſay) ſhould ſo ſuddenly
change the Liturgy into a Directory, as if the Spirit
needed help for invention, tho' not for Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or as if matter preſcribed did not as much
ſtint and obſtruct the Spirit, as if it were cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, and confined to fit words: So ſlight and
eaſie is that Legerdemain, which will ſerve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the Vulgar.</p>
               <p>That further, they ſhould uſe ſuch ſeverity as
not to ſuffer without Penalty, any to uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book
publickly, altho` their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
bind them to it, as a duty of Piety to God,
and Obedience to the Laws.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſee, no Men are prone to be greater Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and more rigorous exacters upon others to
conform to their illegal novelties, than ſuch,
whoſe pride was formerly leaſt diſpoſed to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of lawful Conſtitutions; and whoſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
humours moſt pretended Conſcientious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
which freedom, with much regret they
now allow to Me, and My Chaplains, when they
may have leave to ſerve Me, whoſe Abilities,
even in their extemporary way comes not ſhort of
the others, but their modeſty, and learning far
exceeds the moſt of them.</p>
               <p>But this matter is of ſo popular a nature, as
ſome Men knew it would not bear learned and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Debates, leſt being convinced by the evidence
of Reaſon, as well as by Laws, they ſhould have
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49985:80"/>
been driven either to ſin more againſt their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
by taking away the Lìturgy, or to diſpleaſe
ſome Faction of the People, by continuing the uſe
of it.</p>
               <p>Though I believe they have offended more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Men; not only for their numbers and
Eſtates, but for their weighty and judicious piety,
than thoſe are, whoſe weakneſs or giddineſs they
ſought to gratifie, by taking it away.</p>
               <p>One of the greateſt faults ſome Men found with
the Common-Prayer-Book, I believe, was this,
That it taught them to pray ſo oft for Me; to which
Petitions they had not Loyalty enough to ſay
<hi>Amen,</hi> nor yet Charity enough to forbear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and even Curſings of Me in their own
Forms, inſtead of praying for Me.</p>
               <p>I wiſh their Repentance may be their only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
that ſeeing the miſchiefs which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
of Publick Liturgies hath already produced,
they may reſtore that Credit, Uſe, and Reverence
