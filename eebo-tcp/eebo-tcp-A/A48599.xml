            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Who as a Scholler there did read.</l>

               </argument>
               <l>Listen a while, I will relate,</l>
               <l>VVhat at <hi>Staffod,</hi> befell of late,</l>
               <l>At that Counties <hi>Summer</hi> Assize,</l>
               <l>By a false rumour did arise,</l>
               <l>Out of ones mouth on him I frown,</l>
               <l>Who said a Beam was tumbling down,</l>
               <l>Even that same time, from roofe oft'hall,</l>
               <l>VVhich did amaze both great and small,</l>
               <l>The Barron from the bench did go,</l>
               <l>The Lawyers followed him also,</l>
               <l>Through all the croud, that Judge did pass</l>
               <l>Till down the staires he gotten was,</l>
               <l>The people pressed on the raile,</l>
               <l>By force it broke which made them quaile</l>
               <l>Then they fell one upon another,</l>
               <l>And some they did there almost smother.</l>
               <l>One Lawyer lost part of his Gown,</l>
               <l>Another had a broken crown</l>
               <l>Some there were bruised in the back</l>
               <l>and others legs they went to wrack,</l>
               <l>Some lost their hats, some lost their bands,</l>
               <l>others were crusht in arms and hands,</l>
               <l>Yea some through fear durst not arise,</l>
               <l>Being more opprest then by Excise:</l>
               <l>Some stood by them quaking through fear,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56633:9"/>More then Quakers it did appear.</l>
               <l>there many panted for more breath.</l>
               <l>Expecting then untimely death.</l>
               <l>Many were there pluckt from that place.</l>
               <l>God knows whether they cal'd for grace</l>
               <l>or thought of heaven or else of Hell.</l>
               <l>Upon the stairs they did them quell.</l>
               <l>they trod upon them pressing down.</l>
               <l>Gentlemen Yeoman and the Clown.</l>
               <l>Even as a storm it came in hast.</l>
               <l>But God be prais'd that storm is past,</l>
               <l>And though Reports most fals are spread.</l>
               <l>there is but one of them yet dead.</l>
               <l>His Name was <hi>William Pickard</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That fatall fall did him discard.</l>
               <l>From living mens society,</l>
               <l>To be in dead mens company.</l>
               <l>Yet many there were bruised sore.</l>
               <l>our Neighbors harms we must deplore</l>
               <l>the Sheriff heard one cry treason.</l>
               <l>And he without a just Reason.</l>
               <l>the Judge that time he did forsake.</l>
               <l>And to his flight did him betake:</l>
               <l>For hast he left his Cloak behind,</l>
               <l>His Page him following did it find.</l>
               <l>And to his Master gave again.</l>
               <l>Reward he had then for his pain.</l>
               <l>one womans smock it did appear.</l>

               <l>She like a Fury then appears:</l>
               <l>The Lord Chief Justice I commend,</l>
               <l>Who there was constant to the end.</l>
               <l>For from that Hall he would not start.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> he plaid his part.</l>
               <l>No base <hi>Sanballat</hi> could him fear,</l>
               <l>Or make him flye it did appear,</l>
               <l>He kept his place being grave and wise,</l>
               <l>Though fals Reports did then arise,</l>
               <l>He bad the Gaoler look to's Jayl.</l>
               <l>Lest in his trust he then should fail.</l>
               <l>Yet for all that one ran away,</l>
               <l>For all his hast one did him stay,</l>
               <l>And brought him to the bar again,</l>
               <l>Who then a Pris'ner did Remain,</l>
               <l>Till he was sentenced to dye,</l>
               <l>For stealing horse flesh certainly,</l>
               <l>And yet that Williams is alive,</l>
               <l>The Judge in love did him Reprieve.</l>
               <l>But gave the Sheriff a command,</l>
               <l>To banish him out of the Land,</l>
               <l>I wish all theeves were served so,</l>
               <l>Then Juries should have lesse to do,</l>
               <l>And true men then enjoy their own.</l>
               <l>Which by fals theeves is dayly stoln.</l>
               <l>One woman she condemned was,</l>
               <l>That kil'd her child alas alas.</l>
               <l>that she should be so void of grace,</l>
               <l>In whose lewd heart God had no place,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56633:10"/>Her fact she did deny till death.</l>
               <l>Yea till the Rope did stop her breath.</l>
               <l>Four theeves were burned in the hand,</l>

               <l>If you will walk now in that street.</l>
               <l>A second News it shall you greet.</l>
               <l>Some said that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hall Roof was faln down,</l>
               <l>Others cry'd fire was in the Town,</l>

               <l>Some ran like to <hi>Orlando</hi> mad,</l>
               <l>To quench the fire which made some sad.</l>

               <l>Those men in Stafford Hall did not once dream,</l>
