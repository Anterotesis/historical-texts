         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The LIFE of EDGAR, King of the
West Saxons.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>EDgar,</hi> by his Brother's death, became King of all
<hi>England</hi> at Sixteen Years of age; but his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
when, and where, and by whom; is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
Some say he was Crown'd at <hi>Kingston</hi> upon
<hi>Thames</hi> by <hi>Otho</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the First
Year of his Reign; others say not till the Twelfth;
and <hi>William of Malmsbury</hi> not till the Thirtieth. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Chronicle saith in his Eleventh year, and that
in the City of <hi>Bath,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Dunstan,</hi> whom he
call'd home out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he liv'd in Exile.
This King had no Warr all his Reign, yet always well
prepar'd for Warr; he govern'd the Kingdome in
great Peace, Honour and Prosperity, gaining thence
the Sirname of <hi>Peaceable.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> acknowledg'd
him their sole Soveraign without Division of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Titles; under him ended the <hi>Heptarchy;</hi> till
<pb facs="tcp:99094:3"/>
then the Land was cantl'd out into Seven Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>His Acts were some Virtuous, some Politick, some
Just, and some Pious, and some with a mixture of
Vice; but those related to Women.</p>
            <p>His Care and Wisdome was great in guarding the
Coast round with Ships, to the Number of Three
thousand six hundred, which he divided into Four
Squadrons to sayl to and fro about the Four Quarters
of the Land, meeting each other. Thus he kept out
wisely the Force of Strangers, prevented Foreign Warr,
and secur'd the Coasts from Pyrats. He would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sayl round his Kingdome once every Summer. In
the Winter and Spring time he usually Rode the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
as a Judge Itinerant through all his Provinces, to
see Justice well administer'd, and the poor not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
he severely punish'd his Judges, if he found
them corrupted with Bribes.</p>
            <p>To repress Drunkenness which the <hi>Danes</hi> had
brought in, he made a Law, ordaining a size by certain
pinns in the Cup, with penalty to any that shou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to drink deeper then the Mark.</p>
            <p>To clear the Land from Wolves which in his dayes
did great annoyance to his Country, he wholly remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Tribute imposed on the Princes of <hi>Wales</hi> by
King <hi>Athelston,</hi> appointing in lieu thereof a certain
Number of Wolves yearly to be paid, whereof the
Prince of <hi>North Wales</hi> for his part was to pay Three
hundred, which continu'd for Three years space, and
in the fourth year there was not a Wolf to be found,
and so the Tribute ceas'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99094:3"/>
Towards the end of his Reign the <hi>Welsh-men</hi> mov'd
some Rebellion, against whom he went with a
Mighty Army, and chastis'd the Authors; but when
his Souldiers had gotten great Spoyls, and made prey
upon the Innocent Country people, he commanded
them to restore it all back again, which if it made
some few <hi>English</hi> angry, it pleas'd the whole Country
of the <hi>Welsh,</hi> and rais'd him high in their admiration.</p>
            <p>His Pious Acts were, that he built and re-edify'd
seven and forty Monasteries, and meant to have made
them up Fifty, but was prevented by Death.</p>
            <p>In his Progress going to <hi>Chester,</hi> he summon'd to his
Court there all the Kings that held of him, took ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of them, their names are <hi>Kened,</hi> King of <hi>Scots;
Malcolm</hi> of <hi>Cumberland; Maccuse</hi> of the <hi>Iles;</hi> Five of
<hi>Wales, Duffnall, Howell, Griffith, Iago, Iudethil.</hi> These
he had in such awe, that going one day into a Gally
he caus'd them to take each man an Oar and row him
down the River <hi>Dee,</hi> whilst himself sate at the Stern,
saying, <hi>That his Successors might then glory to be Kings of</hi>
England, <hi>when they had such Honour done them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Year he gave to <hi>Kened</hi> the <hi>Scottish</hi> King
many Rich Presents, and the whole Country of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
or <hi>Lothien,</hi> to hold of him on condition, That he
and his Successors shou'd repair to the <hi>English</hi> Court at
high Festivals when the King sate Crown'd; gave
him also many Lodging places by the way, which till
the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, were still held by the
Kings of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was of Stature not tall, of body slender, yet so
well made, that in strength he chose to contend with
<pb facs="tcp:99094:4"/>
such as were thought strongest, and dislik'd nothing
more, then that they shou'd spare him for Respect or
fear to hurt him. <hi>Kened</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> then in the
Court of <hi>Edgar;</hi> sitting one day at Table, was heard
to say jestingly among his Servants, <hi>He wondered how
so many Provinces could be held in subjection by such a little
dapper man.</hi> His words were brought to the King's
Ear, he sends for <hi>Kened</hi> as about some private business,
and in talk drawing him forth to a secret place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
two Swords, gave one of them to <hi>Kened, And
now,</hi> saith he, <hi>it shall be try'd; which ought to be the Subject;
for it is shameful for a King to boast at Table, and shrink in
Fight. Kened</hi> abash'd demanded his pardon for what
he had simply spoken and no way intended in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
or to his disparagement, wherewith the King
was satisfy'd.</p>
            <p>His Faults were, that he deflowr'd a sacred Nunn
call'd <hi>Wolsechild,</hi> on whom yet he begot a Saint, the
Chaste <hi>Edyth.</hi> After her, he took another Virgin out
by force, call'd <hi>Ethelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ede;</hi> where she was placed by
her Friends to avoid his pursuit. For her excellent
Beauty she was call'd <hi>Ethelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed</hi> the <hi>White;</hi> He kept
her as his Concubine, but liv'd not obstinately in the
offence; for sharply reproved by the Archbishop
<hi>Dunstan,</hi> he submitted to seven years penance.</p>
            <p>Another Story there goes of him, that he chanc'd
to hear of a Virgin, Daughter to a Western Duke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
prais'd for Beauty, and coming to <hi>Andover,</hi>
commanded her to his Bed; The Mother not daring
flatly to deny, yet abhorring that her Daughter shou'd
<pb facs="tcp:99094:4"/>
be so deflowr'd, brought in the dark her Maid to him
dress'd in her Daughters Cloaths. A Wench it seems
not unhandsom nor unwitty, who supply'd the place
of her Young Lady. In the Morning making haste
to rise, daylight scarce yet appearing, was by the King
ask'd <hi>Why she made such haste?</hi> She answered, <hi>To do the
Work her Lady had set her, not daring to hazard her displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
by a longer stay.</hi> By which words the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Deceit, and turn'd it to a Jest. But so well
lik'd her company, that he kept her with him, advanc'd
her in Honour above her Mistress, and made her take
place of her in publick; Lov'd her and accompany'd
her only till he marry'd <hi>Alfreda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alfreda</hi> was the only Daughter of <hi>Ordgar</hi> Duke of
<hi>Devonshire,</hi> Founder of <hi>Tavestock</hi> Abby in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
She was extreamly cry'd up for a Beauty; the
King hearing the loud Commendations, sent his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
Earl <hi>Ethelwold</hi> to see her, intending if she were
found such as answer'd report, to demand her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
The Young Earl at sight of the Lady was so
surpriz'd with Love, that he began to court her for
himself, and concealing the Kings Intentions, got her
Fathers consent. Hereupon the Earl posted to the
King, told him that the Lady was fair indeed, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
answerable to the fame that went of her; yet
desir'd the King that he might marry her, as being her
Fathers Heir, thereby to raise his Fortunes: The
King consented, and he took another Journey to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
the Marriage. Soon after the Fame of her
Beauty began to spread more than before; The King
<pb facs="tcp:99094:5"/>
began to doubt he had been abus'd, and to find out
the truth, sent the Earl word, that he would come
and hunt with him in his Park. <hi>Ethelwold</hi> fearing the
Event, and to cover his deceit from the Kings Eyes,
acquainted his Wife with the wrong he had done both
her and the King, and earnestly requested her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her self what she could either in Dress or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
lest the King whose Amorous inclination was
not unknown, shou'd chance to be attracted. But she
considering, that now was the time to make the most
of her Beauty, and longing to be a Queen wou'd not
be accessary to her own wrong. Against his coming
she us'd all her Art in Dressing, put on her Richest
Cloaths, and omitted nothing might make her appear
charming in his Eyes; which took effect, for the
King at first sight was struck with admiration, and in
mind resolv'd to recover his intercepted right, and to
punish the Interloper of his destin'd Spouse: But hid
his resentments under a clear brow, appointing, as
was usual, a day of Hunting in a Forrest now call'd
<hi>Harewood,</hi> where in the midst of the Sport singling out
the Earl, struck him through with a Dart of Javelin.
It chanced that the Earl's base Son coming by upon
the Fact, the King sternly ask'd him, <hi>How he lik'd this
Game?</hi> He submisly reply'd, That <hi>Whatever pleas'd the
King, must not displease him.</hi> The King for this Answer
took an Affection to the Youth, and ever after highly
favour'd him, making amends in the Son for what he
had done to the Father. <hi>Alfreda</hi> was not long a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
for after this he made her his Queen, who to
expiate her former Husband's death, though therein
<pb facs="tcp:99094:5"/>
she had no hand, cover'd the place of his blood shed
with a Monastery of Nunns to sing over him.</p>
            <p>This King built the Monastery of <hi>Ramsey</hi> in
<hi>Hampshire.</hi> He Reigned Sixteen years, Liv'd Seven
and thirty, and with great Funeral Pomp was
Buried in the Abby of <hi>Glassenbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These only are his Faults upon Record, rather
to be wonder'd how they were so few, and so soon
left, he coming at Sixteen to the Licence of a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and that his Virtues were so many, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he dying before the age wherein Wisdom can
in others attain to any ripeness: However, with
him dy'd all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Glory. After him was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
heard but their Decline and Ruine.</p>
            <p>For the Fact of <hi>Ethelwold</hi>'s Death, this King is
Censur'd by most Historians as Cruel and Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
but consider'd well, it may be judg'd more
favourably, and that no Man of sensible spirit, but
in his place, without extraordinary Perfection, wou'd
have done the like; for next to Life, what worse
Treason cou'd have been committed against him?
From this last Act of his I draw the Argument of
this <hi>Play,</hi> taking notice of no passage of his Life, but
his Love to <hi>Alfreda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have introduced new Persons to raise a Plott,
and vary'd from the <hi>Chronicle,</hi> to better the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the King; Knowing that the Criticks in
Poetry are more Censorious and Severe, than the
Historians.</p>
            <p>Several Forreign Authors have writ upon this
part of the Story; some have disguis'd it under bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
<pb facs="tcp:99094:6"/>
Names, but all of 'em were at a loss when
they came towards a conclusion, and have left it
imperfect, fearing to blemish the Character of the
King: I found it difficult, but hope I have succeeded
so well as to make the last Act the best, and the
Catastrophe in that point not blameable; the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
receives his death from another hand, whence
it appears just, yet accidental. I have mix'd with
it a run of Comedy, but not after the manner of
our Old <hi>Tragi-Comedies,</hi> where one half of the <hi>Play</hi>
are Heroes, and the other Mechanicks and Buffoons.
The Character of <hi>Durzo,</hi> I presume is so well judg'd,
that none may count his presence in the Court im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
or unsuitable to the business of the Place.
But I submit all to a free Censure, careless of the
Fate of any trifle in this nature.</p>

            <l>THis <hi>Play</hi> at least Ten Years ago was writt;</l>

            <l>Without Romantick Love and mighty show.</l>
            <l>And nothing pleas'd you in those dayes but Rymes,</l>

            <l>Well he forbore, and well has nick'd the time,</l>
            <l>If Sense may do that is not shodd with Ryme.</l>
            <l>If Heroes too that are no more than men,</l>
            <l>May be allow'd to tread the Stage agen,</l>
            <l>If Lovers may be Lovers, yet not by fits</l>

            <l>But if you'll still have Poets wrack their Brain</l>
            <l>For Sense that shall your Understandings strain—</l>
            <l>To Verse we will return—</l>
            <l>And once more let the Goss-Hawk fancy fly,</l>
            <l>That beats the Aire and flutters in the Sky,</l>

            <l>Still there remains the Musick of her Heells,</l>

               <l>Of the setting Sun, adorn'd with streaks of red,</l>
               <l>And little sprays of light, as if some beam</l>
               <l>Had been untwisted into Golden threads</l>
               <l>And through his airy Fleece had shot</l>
               <l>Their trembling lustres.</l>
               <l>Admiring it, and fixt in wonder I thought</l>
               <l>I saw it open, and like Curtains draw.</l>
               <l>Divided thus, O what did I not see?</l>
               <l>I beheld Heaven in it's glory. I saw</l>
               <l>A Woman with blushes more beautiful</l>
               <l>And eyes more radiant, an Army of <hi>Cupids</hi>
