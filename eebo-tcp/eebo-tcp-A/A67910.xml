            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiarch, marking his stern countenance, subtil nature, &amp;c. quippingly said, Hitherto I have heard, but now I have also seen and plainly known; adjoyning with a deep sigh, that saying, As we have heard so have we seen: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring also <hi>Emmanuel</hi>'s words, wherewith he had lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Andronicus</hi> (never seen before) many times to his view.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andronicus</hi> (all things in the City being to his mind) departing from <hi>Damalum,</hi> crossed the strait, oftentimes singing that saying, <hi>Return my soul to thy rest, &amp;c.</hi> Coming to the Emperour's Countrey-house near <hi>Philopatium,</hi> he most humbly prostrated himself before the Emperour with deceitful tears, kissing his feet: saluting his mother <hi>Xene,</hi> as it were, but for fashion sake; staying a good while with the Emperour, he desired to go to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to see his Cosen <hi>Emmanuel</hi>'s grave, where coming he wept bitterly, and roared as it were out, divers ignorant standers by saying, Oh what a wonderful thing is this, &amp;c. He would not be removed by his kinsman, pulling him from the Tomb; and secretly said something, as if he had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

some saying, it was a charm: Others and more truly, that he triumphed over the dead Emperour, with these or the like words, I have thee now fast, my cruel persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, &amp;c. And now I will be revenged of thy posterity, and satisfie my self as a Lion with a fat prey, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He afterwards (disposing of all matters at his pleasure) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Emperor hunting and other delights, watching him by Keepers, that none should talk of any important matter with him; He took all the Government to himself, to drive away the contrary faction that had born sway. The state of that time (by his rewarding bountifully the Souldiers that helped him, bestowing Offices on his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or other favourites, shortly driving divers Nobles to exile, depriving some of their sight, casting others into prison for something or other that grieved him) began to be most miserable. Some accusing their nearest kinsmen, for deriding <hi>Andronicus</hi> his proceedings, or that without regard of him they more favoured the Emperour; Yea, many accusing &amp; charging others with treason, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves charged by the accused, and both clapt up together. You might have seen not only his enemies, but some of his best friends, the same day to be crowned and beheaded, graced and disgraced: the wiser deeming his praises, bounty and kindnesse; the beginning of a mans disgrace, undoing and death. <hi>Mary, Emmanuel</hi>'s daughter, who above all others wished for his coming, was first cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poysoned by <hi>Pterigionites</hi> a corrupted Eunuch, her husband supposed also to be poysoned with the same cup. He made as if he would depart, if the fair Empress <hi>Xene</hi> were not removed from her Son: the incensed vulgar people flocking unto, and ready to tear the Patriarch out of his cloaths, if he consented not thereunto. So in a Councel of his favourites she was after many false things accused of treason, as to solicite <hi>Bela</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> her Brother in Law, by Letters to invade <hi>Branisoba</hi> and <hi>Belligrade,</hi> belonging to the Empire; for which she was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:130480-02:22"/>
condemned, and cast into a most filthy prison. Four of this Counsel, being asked their opinion of her, said They would know whether it was called by the Emperours consent? Whereupon <hi>Andronicus,</hi> in great rage starting up, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Empress now hourly expected the deadly blow. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi> demanding of the assembled former Councel, What punishment there was for betrayers of any Town or Province? The answer being in writing, that it was death; he brake out in choller, as if she had done it. By and by a writing was subscribed by the Emperour, (lab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to write it) unworthily condemning his Mother to dye; <hi>Manuel</hi> his eldest son, and <hi>George Augustus</hi> his kinsman, saying plainly, They would not see her innocent body dismembred, never consenting to her death. At which troubled <hi>Andronicus,</hi> plucking himself by the hoary beard, &amp;c. sighed at his own most miserable tyrannical estate, &amp;c. Yet few daies after, he commanded her to be strangled by <hi>Pterigionites</hi> and another: which was done accordingly; her (lately adorned) body was secretly raked up in the sand by the Sea-side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andronicus</hi> (all being covered under pretence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and safety) to manifest his loyalty to his cosen the Emperour, perswaded the Nobility to have him so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Crowned, (who for his tender age was not yet) his own shoulders, at the time, supporting him to and from the great Church, with Crocodiles tears, as if it had been for joy; many accounting the young Emperour thrice happy in him. So cunningly, under pietie's vail, shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed he his most execrable treachery. For (having got into his power both Emperour and Empire) he called a Councel of his favourites, declaring unto them the danger of the Empire, through a rebellion at <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bithinia,</hi> and another at <hi>Prusa,</hi> who (before sufficiently instructed) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,

The people swarming like Bees in every part of the City, soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his praises; and a world following him out of his house, crying the same thing. The Emperour seeing the Court full of people saluting <hi>Andronicus</hi> his fellow, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed the old Tyrant, sore against his will, as his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Empire. Whom, dissemblingly unwilling, some flattering favourits carried up with both hands, placing him in the Imperial Seat: others putting on him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Robes.

Being to be Crowned in the Temple, he first, with a chearful countenance, began to fill the people with large promises of a more happy Government. And the more to deceive, the Coronation past, he with eies cast up to Heaven, receiving the bread and taking the cup, swore and deeply protested by those mysteries, that he took on him the fellowship of the Empire, for no other end, but to assist <hi>Alexius</hi> in the Government. But spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a few daies in feigned devotions, he called together his own corrupt Councel, having that saying of the Poet in their mouths,</p>

            <p>They by general consent decreed, That <hi>Alexius</hi> (as unfit) should be deprived of all Imperial dignities, and live a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life; another more cruel suddenly coming out, That he should be put to death. <hi>Theodore Badibren</hi> Captain of the tormentors, with two more: strangling him with a Bow-string in his Chamber; <hi>Andronicus</hi> shortly after spurned the dead body, railing at his Father and Mother;

               <hi>Andronicus</hi> being 70 years old, as made hereby young again, married <hi>Anne</hi> the French Kings daughter 11 years old, procuring an absolution for all people from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops (whom for a while he had in great honour) from the Oath of obedience given to <hi>Emmanuel</hi> and <hi>Alexius;</hi> and for establishing his estate, secretly poysoned some, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived some of their sight, some he hanged, some he burnt all of great honour and place that favoured <hi>Emmanuel</hi> or <hi>Alexius.</hi> For colour whereof (Oh deep dissimulation) he pretended himself sorry for them, &amp;c. with rears run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down his aged cheeks.

Yet they, cut off his privities, as he hung, one thrusting a sword to the twist thorow his throat: two others proving to strike with swords farthest into his buttocks. After 2 years reign, he thus miserably perished, a man of honourable descent, and notable vertues, &amp;c. had he not obscured the same with ambition and cruelty. <hi>Isaac</hi> suffered him not to be buried, but he lay a space, in a base vault, till charitable men removed him into a low vault near a Monastery.</p>

            <p>But ere long, envy and distrust, ministred new matter of greater discontentments between the 2 Kings; King <hi>Richard</hi> requested the <hi>French</hi> King, to bind himself with him by oath, to stay 3 years for regaining <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine;</hi> but he, estranged before from <hi>Richard,</hi> plotting matters nearer home, would not be perswaded so to do; but in a colour fell very sick, sending for <hi>Richard</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: to whom in few words, he declared his purpose; That seeing he could not indure the hot air's intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

And consulting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout means to satisfy them, (that the Citizens might more willingly do what was to be commanded) he intreated the <hi>Latines</hi> (as they did) to retire out of the City.

But the Emperour bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with desire of revenge, and thinking himself more bound to keep promise with the <hi>Latines,</hi> (for he could not satisfy both) he sent secretly to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to send him certain souldiers about midnight, assuring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in by a Gate nigh the Pallace.

            <p>The Princes and great Commanders now considered what was best to do with the gained City and Empire, thinking not good to rase a City so ancient &amp; important, it overlooking <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and so commodiously placed to keep under the Christians enemies, but to place there a <hi>Latine</hi> Governour, Lawes, and Customs, uniting it with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some would have but one Emperour in Christendome, and would choose <hi>Philip</hi> Germane Emperour, whose Wife <hi>Irene</hi> was daughter and Heir of <hi>Isaac Angelus.</hi> But all approved of this opinion, as better to choose one among themselvs, by whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall presence (which the <hi>Greek</hi> affaires needed) the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> might be alwaies aided in their wars against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.

Had not the chief Commanders mured up the gates, and commanded none to come on the Walls or Rampiers, the City had been by the most yielded, who searching, especially Shops and Ware-houses, divided the small store of Wheat among themselves; the people ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whatsoever came to hand, prolonged life with what they could find. These not able to endure famins extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, were greatly slaughtered with the plague, which so encreased, that men were wanting, not only to succour, &amp;c. the sick, but to bury the dead.

Then the too late repenting Earle, cried out to <hi>Sarisbury</hi> (valiantly fighting) to fly, &amp;c. who answered, God forbid, my Fathers son should run from the face of a Saracen.

why (like an ill husband) he suffered them to rot and rust by him.

So passing the foord afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, coming where his Brother's battle was fought, he might see the mangled Christians (the Sultan having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed great reward to whomsoever brought him a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians head or hand).

But one being against ten, and the Army fainting for sicknesse and food, they were, at last, all (except a few saved in hope of great ransome) slain: The King, with two Brothers, was taken also: who, to the Sultan demanding, why he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against him, answered, 'twas for Religion, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his God's name.

And the elder they grew, they increased in mutual affection: and he, as in greatest favour, was promoted to the greatest honours, and married to the Emperour's nigh Kinswoman. An Oath of obedience unto the young Prince, and them, as Tutors, was exacted of all sorts whatsoever, both before and after the Emperour's death: for many Nobles murmured at <hi>Muzalo</hi>'s sudden fortune, many thinking themselvs to have better right thereto, as of nearer Kin to the Emperour; and fitter for such a charge than <hi>Muzalo,</hi> who, not honourably born, and having been <hi>Theodore</hi>'s minister of wrath against some Nobles, was to be hated and contemned; and if be should now affect the Empire, he would spare no villany to effect his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate desire. <hi>Muzalo</hi>'s wits being awakened with these dangers, he called all the Nobility into the Court; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously offering to yield up both the Empires administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the tuition, to any one whom they thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for such a charge, which all refused, saying, He was to be preferred, to whom the Lord of both had committed both: <hi>Muzalo</hi>

The mourning Matrons thronging out, fled as fast as they could: but the Priests and Monks thinking to do the like were, by the Soulders, forced into the Temple, and on the Pavement (slippery with blood) ended in fear those bloody Obsequies. <hi>Arsemius,</hi> the onely Tutor, was much troubled, for, though for learning and integrity not inferiour, yet, in state matters he was far to seek, and of no great reach, yet wishing all well, he consulted with the Nobility, what were best to be done for government of the Emperour and Empire, now <hi>Muzalo</hi> was dead.

Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, he was by certain great favourites, near <hi>Magnesia,</hi> with great applause, saluted Emperour: <hi>Arsemius</hi> being much troubled therewith, fearing what would become of the young child. He thought it better by Oath to bind the Emperour and his makers not to seek his life, nor to go about to deprive him, than to excommunicate them, which was done. Within a moneth, the Patriarch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, set the Imperial Crown on this Usurpers head; not as still to enjoy the Empire, but according to present necessity, till the child came of age, to whom he was then to resign.

to intreat of marriage, who answered, there was great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of birth betwixt her and <hi>Othoman,</hi> &amp;c. but one cause of this answer was, because some had put in her head, that <hi>Othoman</hi> meant under that colour to obtain a few daies pleasure with her, and afterward to cast her off: which was far from his thoughts.

Thus, he in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate declated his mind: and, at the generall assembly, (by his example to encourage others) saluted him their great Lord, promising him all loyalty; whereunto ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great applause of the people, as to a Governor sent them by God. Thus <hi>Othoman</hi> was great Governour of the <hi>Oguzian Turks,</hi> and named <hi>Osman Beg,</hi> or, <hi>Lord Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Yet this honour was included in a small, plain, and homely circuit: Amongst which rude Heardsmen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

upon occasion: who, with this proviso, That none should come in but the women onely, easily granted it; which courtesy <hi>Othoman</hi> refused not. The women usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally presented the Captain with one Countrey present or other, which afterwards was the losse of the Castle. Yet <hi>Othoman</hi> purposing to be revenged on the other Captain, chose 70 most able men, secretly to passe <hi>Ormenius,</hi> and (if possible) to surprize or fire <hi>Eigeniol</hi> Castle. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Captain laid a strong ambush upon the mountain to cut them off: <hi>Othoman,</hi> no lesse wary, with an augmented number, marched to the place where they lay; where many were on both sides slain, <hi>Hozza, Othoman</hi>'s Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, being one.

But <hi>Othoman</hi> said, The Castles &amp;<hi>c.</hi> must be kept with strong Garrisons, elle they will be again recovered: which Garrisons cannot be maintained, if we dispeople the adjoyning Countreys: I think better that we make a league with the Christians about us, which we will keep or break, as shall serve our purpose. And he made a peace with all, chiefly with <hi>Michael Cossi,</hi> who became also a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> This he did the rather, for the envy of <hi>Germean Ogli,</hi> a <hi>Salzuccian,</hi> who (as others) sought by all means to hinder his greatnesse.

when <hi>Othoman</hi> besieging him, took his Castle, and slow him. He of <hi>Belizuga</hi> was so proud of the victory, (though most gained by the <hi>Turks)</hi> providing a great feast for him and his followers: that, giving Garments of great price to <hi>Othoman,</hi> in token of his favour, rewarding also his souldiers, but all with a presumptuous grace, he offered the <hi>Turk</hi>'s common Souldiers his hand to kisse: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Othoman</hi> was so offended that he could scarce hold his hands from him; yet he secretly imparted the disgrace to his Cousin <hi>Dunder,</hi> inquiring of him how the Captain was to be corrected for it: who, being the Captain's Lievtenant, told him, That, seeing <hi>Germean Ogli</hi> was their enemy on one side, and all the Christians would be in his neck if he offered him any wrong, nothing was then to be attempted. <hi>Othoman</hi> hereby perceiving his Cousin's affection to him, and lest the mischief should by him be revealed or hindered, slew him suddenly with his bow.</p>

When the Captain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood his request by <hi>Cossi,</hi> he sent him back to hasten his coming, and to bring what Guests he pleased. Because the Castle was too little for the expected multitude, there was another place appointed, about 3 miles distant. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoman</hi> had accustomed to send his best things in packs to <hi>Belizuga</hi> Castle, but now instead of houshold-stuff, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> he thrust in armed men, chargeing the carriages to come thither before twi-light. Then he apparelled some of his best Souldiers in Womens apparel, as his Wife and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law with their Women: So contriving it, that they and the packs might at one instant meet at the Castle. The Captain thought his late coming was because the <hi>Turkish</hi> Women shun the sight of Christian men. <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (being come unto the marriage place) requested the Captain that his Gentlewomen might lodge convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his Castle, apart, according to their homely fashion, lest the presence of such Gallants might put them out of countenance, which the Captain granted, saluting them

Yet, at length, they were shipped over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Asia</hi> under <hi>Michael</hi> the Emperours Son, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Empire: who came and encamped about <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia,</hi> were the <hi>Turks</hi> at first retired into Mountains and Woods, that, protracting time, they might learn what strength they were of, and what discipline they kept; and pèrceiving them often to roave disorderly after prey (for, as Mercenaries, they spoiled their friends as if they were enemies) they came down, at first, adventuring but little; but afterward came further on with greater confidence: wherewith they being discouraged, retired, the <hi>Turks</hi> following them, who were (thinking one thing to be two) blinded with their own fear: neither were they like to do any great good, who setting forth carried with them the bitter curses of their friends. <hi>Michael</hi> seeing the <hi>Messagets</hi> flee retired into the Castle of <hi>Magnesia:</hi> But the <hi>Messagets,</hi> spoiling the Countrey as they went, passed over into <hi>Europe. Michael</hi> returning, not many daies after, to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> came down and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all unto the Coast of <hi>Lesbos.</hi>

                  <hi>Mary</hi> in marriage: But one <hi>Tenza,</hi> another <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonian,</hi> coming a while after with more aid, he named <hi>Ronzerius,</hi> Caesar; &amp; <hi>Tenza,</hi> Great Captain. But when they were to be transported into <hi>Asia,</hi> they did unspeakeable harm, to the People, for which they had many a bitter Curse. The next spring they valiantly raised the siege of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> which was hardly bestead without and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: to these <hi>Catalonians,</hi> great numbers of the best <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Souldiers, and all the <hi>Messagets</hi> were joyned; so that, had not the Emperour before commanded not to pursue the <hi>Turks</hi> too far, 'twas thought they might have soon recovered all they had taken. This service done, the <hi>Greeks</hi> returned home, and <hi>Messagets</hi> also. But the <hi>Catalonians</hi> turned their forces on them that they were sent to relieve; alledging they had not their pay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Poor people were every where spoiled, wives and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ravished, Priests and aged men tortured to confesse their store; yea many, that had nothing, lay by the high waies begging, having hands or feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cut off upon their greedy imagination. The Emperour was much grieved, but his Coffers were not able to redresse any thing. <hi>Ronzerius,</hi> thus spoyling <hi>Asia,</hi> passed over into <hi>Europe,</hi> and leaving his Army at <hi>Calipolis,</hi> he went to <hi>Michael,</hi> then at <hi>Orestias</hi> with 200, to demand, or with threats to extort, his pay: with whose insolency he now
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:130480-02:71"/>
more offended, his Souldiers present, compassing him in, slew him, with some others, the rest fleeing to <hi>Calipolis.</hi> Neither was the <hi>Catalonians</hi> pride abated by <hi>Ronzerius</hi> his death, but was cause of greater evills: for they first slew all the Citizens of <hi>Calipolis,</hi> making it their refuge; then, manning 8 Galleys, under the leading of <hi>Tenza,</hi> they robbed and spoyled the Merchants ships passing to and from <hi>Constantinople:</hi> the rest (the mean time) forraging the Countrey. But <hi>Tenza</hi> was overthrown shortly after by a <hi>Genoway</hi> Fleet, himself being taken; yet afterwards redeemed. Now the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> somewhat discouraged, kept themselvs, certain daies, within their wals, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well what to do; for they feared both the <hi>Messagets</hi> and <hi>Thracians;</hi> for outrages upon whom, they despaired of the Emperouur's favour. But the expectation of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>'s coming to assault them, most terrifyed them: for fear of whom they cast a deep ditch about the City, with a strong Counterlcarp: But the Emperour delaying his coming, they maliciously craved aid of the <hi>Turks,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Asia,</hi> on the other side of the Streight: who sent them 500 good Souldiets, other fugitives following; with whom (themselves being 3000) they forraged the Country, and brought great heards of Cattell, with their Keepers, into the City. This was the first coming of the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> that I read of, and the beginning of those miseries wherewith the Christian Commonweal hath been ever since most grievously afflicted, and in great part overwhelmed.</p>
               <p>These now lying about <hi>Cypsella</hi> and <hi>Apri, Michael</hi> with his Souldiers, with the <hi>Messagets</hi> and <hi>Turcopuli</hi> encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Apri.</hi> These <hi>Turcopuli</hi> were about a 1000 <hi>Turks</hi> which <hi>Jathathiues</hi> left behind him when he was delivered from the Emperour by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had become Christians. The Emperour, advertised of the enemies approach, put his Army in order: whose Captains divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their battle, as their enemies, into 3 parts. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:130480-02:72"/>
riding from place to place, encouraged his men. The Sun rising, the enemies (much inferiour in number) began to come on: But the <hi>Messagets</hi> (whether by a fore-agreement, or on a sudden treason) withdrew as idle beholders, as did also the <hi>Turcopuli,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discouraged in the very battles joyning. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour intreated the Captains, by name, not to be so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly discouraged: but they still shrinking, he turned himself to his few foot that were left, saying; <hi>Now, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, is death better then life, &amp;c.</hi> Valiantly charging the enemies, his horse was slain; but one of his followers remonted him on his own horse, with the loss of his life. The Emperour fleeing to his Father, to <hi>Dydimoticum,</hi> was joyfully received, but sharply reproved for adventuring so far. The enemies pursuing, slew some, and took others: &amp; next day divided the spoyl, forraging the Country at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The <hi>Turcopuli</hi> revolting, were enrolled in <hi>Chalel</hi>'s Regiment, who was a <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after, the <hi>Catalonians</hi> mutinied; <hi>Tenza,</hi> and <hi>Pharenza</hi> disdained to be commanded by <hi>Recafort</hi> their Generall. <hi>Tenza</hi> was slain, <hi>Pharenza</hi> glad to flee to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> who honourably entertained him. The <hi>Messagets</hi> were now also (having done the <hi>Greeks</hi> more harm then the <hi>Turks)</hi> about to return, with Wives, Children, and wealth, beyond <hi>Ister:</hi> for whom the <hi>Turcopuli</hi> and <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> laid wait, as they passed the streights of Mount <hi>Hemus;</hi> where they slew almost all of them, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing themselves with their spoyl, for the wrongs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them before, in dividing the <hi>Greeks</hi> spoyl. And being proud of their Victory at <hi>Apri,</hi> spoyled all along the Sea coast, and the inland Country also. Forraging <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> they brake into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and wintred about <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> à City then desolate. At spring they removed purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to spoyl, especially <hi>Thessalonica;</hi> wherein they were, by the Emperour's foresight, prevented; and finding a forsaken Countrey, were about to return into <hi>Thracia:</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:130480-02:72"/>
But being informed, that the Emperour had shut up the passage by a mighty wall at <hi>Christopolis,</hi> from the Sea to the top of the Mountains; they thus beset, desperately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to break into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> (being above 8000 men) to relieve their wants, or towards <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> there to seat themselves: at least-wise, to enter a League with some on the Sea coast, and so return into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. They came in 3 daies to the <hi>Thessalian</hi> Mountains, at the foot whereof, finding plenty of all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they wintred. But Winter being past, they came down into the Plains of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> spending that year at pleasure, havocking whatever came in their way. That Countrey was but weak, the Prince being but young and like to die, &amp;c. And to avert these forreigners: the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity offered their Commanders gifts, and guidance into <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Boetia,</hi> Countries more commodious for them: promising if they needed aid, there to seat them. Of which offers the <hi>Catalonians</hi> accepted: So at Spring, receiving their rewards and guides, passing over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains beyond <hi>Thessaly</hi> and the straits of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> they encamped near <hi>Locris,</hi> and the River <hi>Cephisus.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Thebes,</hi> &amp;c. hearing of their coming, with great pride and contempt, denied them passage thorow his Countrey, reckoning them but as loose wandring rogues, &amp;c. wherewith they enraged, resolved there to seat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or to die. So they encamped not far from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Boetia,</hi> 3500 horse, 4000 foot. But lying there, they caused the ground where about they lay to be plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, which they watered with cuts out of the River, that it little differed from a deep Marsh. Hither comes the Prince with about 6400 horse, and 4000 foot, casting no peril, coming bravely on with his horsmen; but before he was come to the middle of the Plain, his horses sinking deep, lay with their riders for most part, tumbling in the mire, &amp;c. other-some sticking fast stood with their riders like very Images, not able to move. The <hi>Catalonians</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:130480-02:73"/>
slew them at their pleasure, and so speedily pursued the rest, that they surprized <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens;</hi> so they (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wone a goodly Countrey stored with all wealth) there ended their travels and seated themselves: not ceasing (as saith <hi>Nicephorius Gregorias)</hi> by little and little to extend their bounds unto this day.</p>
               <p>There were 3000 <hi>Turks</hi> in the <hi>Catalonians</hi> Army, of whom about 1100 were the Turcopuli under <hi>Melech;</hi> the other came with <hi>Chalel</hi> out of <hi>Asia,</hi> being sent for by the <hi>Catalonians:</hi> All these, when the <hi>Catalonians</hi> were about to invade <hi>Thessaly,</hi> &amp; seek new fortunes, partly distrusting their society, and partly loth further to follow, began to mutiny; Whereupon <hi>Melech</hi> and <hi>Chalel,</hi> requested of the General leave to return: which he easily granted, and so they departed, proportionally deviding the captives and spoyls taken. After which, they divided into 2 parts; the Turcopuli following <hi>Melech,</hi> and the rest <hi>Chalel. Melech</hi> having violated his Religion again and revolted, despairing of the Emperour's friendship, chose rather to go to <hi>Crales</hi> Prince of <hi>Servia</hi> (by whom he was sent for) with 1500 horse and foot; but all his Souldiers (delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up horses and armour) were to fall to Trades, and not to bear Arms, but when, and so many as, the Prince saw good.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chalel</hi> with about 1300 horse and 800 foot, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Emperour quietly to depart his Countrey, so he would give him passage by <hi>Christopolis,</hi> and transport them and their substance over Hellespont. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour considering the great harm done, desirous to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of them, sent <hi>Sennacherib</hi> to conduct them out of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to the straits of Hellespont; Where the <hi>Greeks</hi> thinking it indignity, to suffer them to carry such abundance of horses, mony, &amp;c. taken from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> into <hi>Asia:</hi> and in hope of so rich a prey, they neither provided for them shipping, nor cared for their safety, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing by night to destroy them. Os which the <hi>Turk</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:130480-02:73"/>
surprized a Castle thereby, which they nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fortified: the <hi>Greeks</hi> were glad to get further off, and to certifie the Emperour thereof, who delayed the time, to his enemies advantage; who speedily sent over the strait for aid of the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> which they presently sent them; wherewith encouraged, they oft times grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously wasted the Country round about. The <hi>Greek</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains greatly discontented, requested <hi>Michael</hi> with all his power, to come to suppress these dangerous enemies. For which not only Soldiers, but the Country in general flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Michael</hi> with spades and mattocks, as though they would have digged down the Castle. Most part of whose followers, not considering the danger in gaining it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded carelesly and disorderly in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, that their enemies, who before feared the very fame of their coming; therewith much more encouraged, bestowed all their wealth, &amp;c. within their trenches: themselves with 800 chosen horsmen, sallyed out to the place of the Imperial Ensign; with which sudden and desperate eruption, the <hi>Grecians,</hi> especially the rustical, terrified began to flee: after whom by little and little, all fled. The Emperour did what he could to stay them; but in so general a fear, Who regarded him? wherefore he was glad to flee with the rest. Yet many expert Captains ashamed, making stands, stayed the barbarous from further pursuit. In which doing, many were taken by the <hi>Turks;</hi> Whatsoever was found in the Emperour's Tent, yea the Imperial Crown it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a prey also; which they say <hi>Chalel</hi> putting on his head, scoffed at the Emperour.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Turks</hi> spoiled almost all <hi>Thracia;</hi> so that for 2 years, the people scarce durst go out of their Towns to plow and sow; the Emperours exceedingly grieved, all their hope was in forreign aid; wherein they found many difficulties, their Coffers being empty, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Territories so long wasted: yet <hi>Andronicus</hi> sent to the Prince of <hi>

no haste, and the misery encreasing, one <hi>Phites Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logus</hi> the Emperour's Kinsman, undertook his Countries deliverance. He had been brought up in Court, &amp;c. belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all for integrity of life, but altogether unskilful of wars, being by nature weak and sickly: and more given to devotion, than worldly affairs. He requested the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that with some small power, and a few Captains of his own choice, he might go out against the <hi>Turks,</hi> hoping (he said) to revenge the wrong, and return with victory. Whereunto he easily yielded, saying, God delighted not in any mans leggs, but in a contrite heart &amp;c. For I have seen (said he) the swift not to gain the prize, &amp;c. the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to gain favour, and the subtil to fall into disgrace. So he furnished him with such conveniences as he desired; which he receiving, first he by all waies of courtesie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his Souldiers, perswading them to a temperare life, promising (the war ended) rewards according to every ones desert; and before setting forth, understanding, <hi>Chalel</hi> with 1200 horse and foot was forraging about <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia,</hi> he hasted to encounter them by the way laden with spoil, encamping the 3d day near the little River <hi>Xerogip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> where he left nothing unsaid or undone for the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating his Souldiers. Within 2 daies, his scouts brought tydings about midnight, that the enemy was even at hand, who by Sun-rising were come in sight; wherefore, first of all compassing themselves with their Waggons, &amp;c. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing their bound &amp; captives booty therein, casting dust on their heads, and their hands towards Heaven, they came on. The Christian Army came on also, <hi>Philes</hi> right well conducting them. He that led the right wing at first on-set, unhorsed two enemies; but his horse sore wounded, he retiring hastily out of the battel, somewhat troubled the Christians, and encouraged the <hi>Turks. Philes</hi> with chearful words encouraged them, and with eys cast up, and tears running down, heartily besought God, &amp;c. The footmen encountring hand to hand, slew the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:130480-02:74"/>
and were of them slain: But <hi>Philes</hi> having almost encompassed their horse with a valiant company, brake in upon the sides of the enemy; who circumvented and hardly charged, most of them fell: a few horsemen were pursued to the entrance of <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> whither came <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> 5 Galleys were sent to keep <hi>Hellesponts</hi> Straits, 2000 horsemen came out of <hi>Servia,</hi> and 8 Gallies moe by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate of <hi>Pera;</hi> wherefore, shutting them up by Land and Sea, <hi>Philes</hi> encamping about the Town and Trenches, greatly battered the Castle, making great slaughter. The <hi>Turks</hi> by night set first upon the <hi>Grecians,</hi> by sallying out and then upon the <hi>Servians,</hi> with vain attempts: wherefore (utterly despairing) about midnight, they full of Coin, ran to the Sea, purposing to yield themselves to the <hi>Genowaies;</hi> But the night being dark and misty, many unawares came to the <hi>Greek</hi> Galleys; who lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them of their mony, and slew them. The <hi>Genowaies</hi> slew only those with the most Coin, lest it should be sought for by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> the rest, some they sent to the Emperour, some they kept as their own prisoners. Thus by <hi>Philes</hi> his valour, the <hi>Turks</hi> for that time, were chased out of <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>Innovation and change of the <hi>Greek</hi>'s Religion, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, envy, ambition, distrust, Forreign aid, and foul discord, were the chief causes of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ruin.

But when he was grown a lusty youth, he began to contemn all Government, his companions leading him forth to walk the streets, hawk, hunt, and haunt Plays, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night-walks: which requiring great expence, and his Grandfather giving him but a spare allowance, He took up mony of the rich Merchants of <hi>Pera, &amp;c.</hi> with secret consultations of flight. For seeing his Grandfather live

long, &amp; his Father like to succeed, his ambitious thoughts suggested to him such purposes: seeking after the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial liberty, that he might have sufficient for himself, and to reward others; which, seeing he could not do, he sought one while after <hi>Armenia:</hi> then after <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> sometime dreaming of <hi>Lesbos</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> for which he was reproved by the one and the other. He used by night to repair to a Gentlewomans house, whom another gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant no lesse affected then himself; wherefore he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Russians to watch her house. <hi>Manuel</hi> about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night seeking him, passed by these watchmen; who in the dark, supposing him the man they looked for, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that he fell down for dead, and so was carried half dead to Court: which ourrage cast the Emperour into great heaviness; but <hi>Michael,</hi> hearing at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> of <hi>Manuel</hi>'s being dead with the wounds; shortly after dyed with grief. The unstayed youth, purposing to flee, became more and more suspicious to his Grandfather; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one <hi>Surgiannes</hi> (who was suspected of aspiring, imprisoned, and by the Emperour enlarged) warily to observe the young Princes doings. But he, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of former wrong, and in hope to aspire himself, took the Prince aside, discovering his Grandfathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to set them together by the ears, as followeth. Thy Grandfather most noble Prince (said he) hath set me a watch, or rather a bloodbound over thy actions, and if possible thy most secret thoughts, &amp;c. whilst thou follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy shallow conceits; for what shall it avail thee to flee away? &amp;c. But if thou hearken to my counsel, I will shew thee a ready way to aspire the Imperial Seat, which is by leaving <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and fleeing into the <hi>Thracian</hi> Provinces, and proclaiming immunity for ever from thy Grandfathers long and heavy yoak; If thou likest this, I will bring the whole matter to effect: so that thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me to reward my travel according to desert, and that no great matter be done, without my consent; for thou
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:130480-02:75"/>
seest how unwillingly I make my self partaker of thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, &amp;c. And seeing delay brings danger, let's impart the matter to such as are like to keep counsel, and further our designes. He, moved herewith as with a charm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his desire by an Oath in writing. <hi>John Catacuzene, Theodore, Synadenus,</hi> men of great honour, and aged; and <hi>Alexius Apocaucus,</hi> a man of great place being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who shewed themselves as Ring-leaders therein. <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> and <hi>Catacuzene,</hi> by corrupting divers great ones, procured the Government of places, fittest to begin their rebellion in.

All which <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> dissembling, oft certified the Prince what he had done, and was to do. But the Emperour seeing his Nephew proceeded in his dissolute life, was about to reprove him before the <hi>Patriarch</hi> and others: but being otherwise perswaded, for that it was on the point of Shroveride, when as the people (through excess) were fittest to be drawn into a tumult, he let him alone.

At his coming out, he was discouraged and ashamed at the speeches of the fretting and fuming conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, saying, Thou hast left us in the Devils mouth to be devoured, &amp;c. and sent for <hi>Theodore Metochita,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing to deal with his Grand-father for his followers pardon: whereof he disliked, telling them, himself was to give God thanks for escaping so great a danger, &amp;c. Wherewith the Prince troubled and discontented, and (after a whiles musing) commanding him to depart; he by his Companions perswasion, entertained his former designements: which his Grand-father suspecting would often say, In our time is lost the Majesty of our Empire, and devotion of the Church. Yet he thought good to lay hands betime on him; acquainting none but the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> therewith, who acquainted the Prince, (flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself before) who with all his Complices, the night before his apprehension to be, fled out of the City by the gate <hi>Gyrolimnia,</hi> (still at his Command); and next day came to <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> and <hi>Catacuzens</hi> Camp at <hi>Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> the Emperour the same day proclaimed him tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, proscribing him, with all his conspiratours; swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole City to be loyal to him. But he proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming liberty in all <hi>Thracia,</hi> the people resorted to him armed, in great numbers.

Four daies after they encamped at <hi>Selybria,</hi> whither the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour sent Embassadours to his Nephew, for appeasing so dangerous troubles, sending with them <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> his Mother, to perswade him to retire a little, and so come to talk and demand what he pleased. <hi>Syrgiannes,</hi> retired to the Prince about <hi>Orestius,</hi> whither the Embassadours came also: with whom it was agreed, that the Prince should hold all from <hi>Christopolis</hi> to <hi>Rhegium</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>'s

Wherefore he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved again to revolt to the Emperour, not doubting but shortly to overthrow the Princes Counsels and State. He secretly (by a trusty friend) acquainted the Emperour of his purpose, alleadging; He could not abide the sight of him that sought to corrupt his wife, meaning the Prince.

In few dayes an attonement was made and he lighting from his horse, met the Emperour, kissing his hand and foot on horse-back, then taking horse, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, kissing one another.

               <p>
                  <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> now spake hardly both of the Emperour and his <hi>Nephew,</hi> wronged (as he thought) by them both. But seeing one <hi>Asanes Andronicus</hi> walking melancholy, he acquainted himself with him, as grieved with the like sorrow that himself was: with whom he (as with a friend) plainly discoursed of all things as his grief desired. <hi>Asanes</hi> spake also hardly of Emperour and Nephew; but hating him before for his ambition, and displeased that he was enemy to <hi>Catacuzene</hi> his son in-law, noted whatever he said, telling all to the old Emperour; and that unless <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> were (in time) laid hold of, he should short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him (affecting the Empire) be brought to his end. <hi>Syrgiannes</hi> was forthwith imprisoned; the common people spoyling him of his house and wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it, and the adjoyning Vineyards to a feeding place for sheep and goats. The Prince was shortly Crowned as fellow in the Empire, unto which the old Emperour tiding, was, by his horses stumbling, foulely bemired in the Streets, which many took as portending ill Fortune. During this peace, 70 <hi>Turks</hi> were driven on shoare at <hi>Chersonesus</hi> the Prince hunting there, who before they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:130480-02:78"/>
would yield, slew divers of his men; himself long after being tormented by a wound (there) in the foot. Who not long so contenred, longed for the whole Goverment: and weary to see his Grand father live so long, resolved to thrust him out of Government; or to dispatch him of life and State together. And (by his Mothers counsel) sent for <hi>Michael</hi> Prince of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> his wife, and his Sister to <hi>Dydimethicum,</hi> in colour of a desire to see them, as before to him unknown. But the secret conclusion was, that the <hi>Bulgarian</hi> should aid the young Emperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Grand-father, and he him against the <hi>Servian,</hi> as need should be: and if he recovered the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, then to give him a great sum of money with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining places. So <hi>Michael</hi> loaded with rewards and promises returned home.</p>
               <p>The young Emperour encouraged; and knowing the <hi>Constantinopolitans</hi> and other <hi>Thracian</hi> Cities to favour him, thought best to depose his Grand-father with as little stir as might be. But needing money, he took all from the Collectors in <hi>Thracia,</hi> telling them, he was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour also, and that the common charge was by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon purse to be discharged. Then he took his way with a great power towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> pretending he was there to take order for a ship to transport Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours to the Sultan of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> having thrust the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected out of Office in <hi>Thracia,</hi> placing in others.

Then first he sent to his Nephew, forbidding him entring the City; and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

were unknown; rehearsing unto him how many occasions he had given for breaking the league with his Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

But these Letters (written in Paper) were intercepted on the Straits of <hi>Christopolis</hi> and other passages; yet others in fine linnen (secretly sowed) escaped, and were delivered. Nothing was done, but the young Emperour (for all inclined unto him) was advertised thereof: but he understood not what his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew did, or intended. <hi>Theodore</hi> his own son among others (who honourably married in <hi>Italy,</hi> and by prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality far in debt, whose debts (very great) he paid, &amp;c. living now at <hi>Constantinople)</hi> went about to betray his own Father. For he (especially being become a Latine in Religion and manners) being rejected, thought he could not do him greater despight, than by revolting. <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Despot,</hi> calling to him his Nephews, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and joyning with them, spoiled the young Emperour's friends there, confiscating the estates, and exiling all with-standers. Young <hi>Andronicus</hi> was not Idle, but secretly sent out edicts into all parts, proclaiming releasement from all tributes and payments: promising in the Souldiers the augmenting their pay, &amp;c. which bruited, most were moved, inviting him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to hasten into the City: who by Embassadours srom <hi>Rhegium,</hi> requested leave of the Emperour to come in, or to send him some of the chief, and better sort to whom he might speak his mind. Which requests being both dangerous, he chose the easier, sending forth two Noble Senatours, two Bishops, and two other Prelates, and four chief Burgesses of the City: to whom he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydelivered this crafty speech. <hi>It is not unknown, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Let any tell me how I came by these wounds, but in fight with the enemies of my Country.

But at night some busie heads gave him knowledge, that about mid-night they would be ready with ropes to draw him to the top of the Bulwarks. But he, approaching, found no such matter: the watchmen carefully watching and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:130480-02:80"/>
calling one to another. Wherefore with <hi>Catacuzene</hi> and <hi>Synadenus,</hi> he rowed softly along the wall towards the Sea, but there the watchmen calling and receiving no answer, began to cast stones at them: so they departed as they came. But this ill successe was shortly better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed; for he had secret letters sent from <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> to come speedily thither, assuring him, with a general good liking, to open the Gates to him: who setting forward with a part of his Army entred the City in a Country man's habit, and casting off that simple at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire (and being known) the people with joyful acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions received him as their Soveraigne: yet a few stood on their guard in the Castle; which was at length taken.</p>
               <p>The old Emperours chief Captaines now fled, most of whose Souldiers went to the young one: who came to <hi>Serre</hi> which was delivered him by composition: but the Castle was by <hi>Bafilicus Nicephorus</hi> (whom the old Emperour had made Captaine rather for his fincerity, than wit or Capacity) strongly fortified in these trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times, and kept till the old Emperous death, then reconciling himself to the young: who, in reward of his fidelity, gave it to him to hold as amply as before from his Grand-father: for wise men (as did King <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Demosthenes)</hi> honour virtue even in their enemies. The young Emperour soon took all strong Townes and Cities in <hi>Macedonia</hi> unresisted with the <hi>Despots</hi> wife and Children and tteasure, his Nephews and following Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours wives also: after whom their Husbands were most cast in prison, and some perishing in exile. The old Emperour was about to send to his Nephew for peace, but at the same time <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Bulgarian</hi> (in hope of great profit) secretly offered him aid: whereof he gladly accepting, Embassadours were sent to conclude it; but two or three trusty Counsellours being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:130480-02:80"/>
he was over thrown, and taken prisoner; the rest flying head-long to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Now the young Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour returned thither to prevent the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> coming: lest they killing the old Emperour, should seize the City themselves, or at least keep him out. There was also great want of Victuals in the City, his Army shutting it up by Land, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> (being at Odds with the <hi>Genowaies</hi> of <hi>Pera)</hi> by Sea. The young Emperour at first attempted to enter, but being repulsed, he gat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off. About this time came also the 3000 <hi>Bulgarian</hi> horse-men, but remembring the harms by forraign aid, he suffered but their General and some few Commanders to come into the City. The young one, least some harm to their utter subversion should betide them, offered to do what his Grand-father should command. But he trusting to this <hi>Bulgarian</hi> aid, listened little to him: (and how could he trust him that had so often deceived him?) Who, almost despairing of successe, sent great gifts to the General and chief Commanders, promising far greater if they would return home: whereunto they easily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Two watch-men, <hi>Camaris</hi> and <hi>Castellanus</hi> fleeing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to the young Emperour, offered to betray the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, for assurance of such money and possessions they required, returning again (for fear of suspition) without stay. (The Emperour four dayes made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladders of ropes). And the night being come, they gave such store of good wine by way of courtesie to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low watch-men, that they fell into a sound sleep: The traytours about mid-night receiving 18 men by the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fastned to the top of the wall; who breaking open the Roman gate, the Army entered. The same night, just after Sun-set, a Country man in hast knocked at the gate of <hi>Gerolimna,</hi> telling the Souldiers he saw many of the young Emperours men marching towards the City, by the way of the Roman gate: The old Emperour

(troubled) thought to send scouts to see if all were cleart but <hi>Metochita</hi> his great Counsell our letted, saying, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the rumour was false, or the endeavour of so few, vain; it beseemeth not a couragious mind to be so leightly moved.</hi> Again, divers others came running telling the watch-men, A great number were at the Roman gate: the Emperour (more troubled) sharply said to <hi>Metochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta: Thou seemest to be strangely Metamorphosed into a man of iron, which hast no feeling of our danger, &amp;c. for the noise of my Nephew soundeth in mine cars, &amp;c.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, he rose to go to bed, accounting them but as false alarmes. But the Emperour (alone) say tumbling to and fro on a pallat, as ttoubled with heavy thoughts. The mean time he hearing a great noise at the Court-gate (for above 800 were entred with his Nephew, and they of the City joyfully saluted him) rose (destitute of all but his ordinary waiters) beseeching not God to forsake, but defend him from their fury: Who heard him. For the young Emperour straightly charged all his Captaines, &amp;c. on pain of death, not to violate his Grand-father, or any about him: For (said he) this victory God hath given us, and not our selves, &amp;c. which peradventure he will give to others, who (as we have been to them) will shew themselves to us: wherefore if nighnesse of blood or being of one Country, move us not; yet let's use mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that we feel not Gods hand in like case. A Courtier then opened a wicket with this message to him,</p>

&amp;c. Young <hi>Andronicus</hi> moved herewith, entred the pallace, humbly saluting, embracing, and comforting his Grand-father: Straight way carrying away the <hi>Patriarch Esaius</hi> (kept in the Monastery) in a Chariot, restoring him to his Dignity; who spared not fully to revenge himself of the old Emperour's friends. One might have seen all the Nobles wealth that took his part, carried away, and their houses overthrown, especially of <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chita,</hi> whose wealth not onely in his house, but layd up with friends (by notes in his study) was a prey to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the rest confiscate, being brought with wife and children, to extream beggery in one day: many (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his grief) saying, All that treasure was the blood and tears of the poor subjects, brought to him by them he made rulers of provinces, &amp;c. that he might stop them (cruelly dealt with by them) from complaining to the old Emperour: and that the Revenger's eye was now awaked, &amp;c. He was confined to <hi>Didymoticum;</hi> whence (after a while) he was sent back to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where, having nothing to relieve him, he went to the <hi>Monastery</hi> of <hi>Chora,</hi> repaired by him in his prosperity, therein shrowding himself, and not long after dying.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Niphon</hi> (sometime <hi>Patriarch)</hi> meeting the young Emperour (the same day) asked, How they would deal with his Grand-father? Who answering Emperour-like, was by him inflamed; for <hi>Niphon</hi> bare a special grudge against the old man, for that he being by the Clergy outed of his Patriarchship, for his shameful extortion, was not defended, as he looked for: and dreaming his taking out of the way, was a step to the same Dignity. Wherefore he said, If thou desirest to Reign without fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cast haire cloath on him, and clap him in prison, or exile him: to which ungracious counsel, other Nobles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, much changed the young Emperour's minde: that he could not endure his Grand-father a Companion in the Empire. Whereupon it was decreed, the old man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:130480-02:82"/>
should retain the name and ornaments; but meddle with nothing, nor come abroad; with 10000 duckets yearly for his maintenance. Of which shameful decree <hi>

                  </hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> was a furtherer rejoycingly, wresting this Scripture; <hi>The just shall rejoyce when he seeth the Vengeance:</hi> But the old Emperour thus shut up, humours distilling, (through grief) first lost one eye, and shortly the other, being often mocked not by his guarding enemies onely, but by his own servants. The young Emperour not long after falling very sick, <hi>Catacuzene</hi> and the rest yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the old blind man, put him to choice, either to put on him the habit of a Monk, or to take dear exile, or perpetual imprisonment. At which hard choice he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with woes, lay on bed a great while speechlesse; for being encompassed with barbarous Souldiers, none was left to direct him where to go or stand, But would he or not, they shaving and polling him, cast a Monks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite on him; changing (after the manner) his name to <hi>Anthony</hi> the Monk; of which <hi>Esaeias</hi> was glad, as now no hope to recover the Empire, nor cause for himself to fear. Yet (seeming to be very sorry, but indeed deriding him) he sent two Bishops to know of him how he would be remembred in Church-prayers. To which fetching a great sigh he answered: As in poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> appeared a double miracle, that (dead) he rose, and (bound) wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; so in me, in a contrary manner, who (alive) am dead, and (loose) bound, my tongue also wherewith I might (at least) bewaile my woes and wrongs to the Aire, &amp;c. But shame hath closed my mouth, my brethren ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre me, and the light of mine eyes is not with me, &amp;c. As for him that sent you, I chose and preferred him to the Patriarchship, before many worthy men, never before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, or famous, &amp;c. But in my Calamity he joyned with mine enemies, more cruel than any other: feigning him to be (much like the <hi>Crocodile</hi> of <hi>Nile)</hi> ignorant and sorry for me. But if I should answer to his catching
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:130480-02:82"/>
question, to be remembred in the Church as an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; I shall forthwith be slain. If I say, as <hi>Anthony</hi> the Monk; it will be taken, that of mine own free will I put on this habite, which was never in my thought. Thus he sent them away: and sitting down said, <hi>My soul return to thy rest,</hi> &amp;c. neither spake he one word more in declaring his grief, and so against his will passing over his sorrow in silence, as astonished before the humorus (gathered into the brain) could be difsolved into tears. But the <hi>Patriarch</hi> decreed, he should be remembred before his Nephew in Church prayers, as the most Religious and Zealous Monk <hi>Anthony,</hi> the better to colour the matter, as if weary of the world, he voluntary took it on him. Yet in four daies, <hi>Synadenus,</hi> understanding the people secretly to mutter at the hard dealing with him, Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Laws enforcing none against will to enter Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous orders, sent to exact an oath of him in writing, that he should never seek after, accept of, or substitute any other in the Empire; and to fear him of his life upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal, setting barbarous Souldiers over him: so yielding, he signed the Oath with a red and black crosse, another guiding his hand. Thus living two years, on <hi>Feb.</hi> 12th, towards night, a day dedicated to St. <hi>Anthonies Vigil,</hi> certain friends had accesse to him (amongst whom was the Prince of <hi>Servia</hi>'s widow, his daughter, and <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor as Gregoras,</hi> Authour of this History) with whom he entred discourse till past mid-night, then bidding them farewell; pleasantly saying, <hi>To morrow they would end their discourse,</hi> no signe of sicknesse appearing. They gone, he eat of a shell-fish, after which, (as his manner was when he felt inward heat) he drank cold water, then feeling a great pain in his Stomach, and afterwards very sick. fell into a loosenesse; and going often to a house of Office in an inner Chamber, not able to recover his own bed, and none to help him, he dyed before day, sitting on a homely bed fast by, having Reigned 43 years, whose
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:130480-02:83"/>
death was by strange signs and accidents foretold, a great Eclipse of the Sun, just 43 daies before, and after of the Moon, an earthquake the day before, the Sea rising above the bounds made breaches in the Citie-Walls, &amp;c. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crosses and Pinacles, with a great Pillar before the Church of the 40 Martyrs, (he having wished to live so long as it stood) were overthrown. He was honourably buried in the Monastery of <hi>Libe,</hi> whose Obsequies 9 daies yearly were solemnly kept.</p>

The <hi>Bassa</hi> thanking him, &amp;c. and returning, declared he had seen him, and reported all he willed him; and published his courtesie: who besides liberty, had given him a fair furnished horse, though he were to serve against him. <hi>Bajazet</hi> answered, he would shortly try him, hoping ere the march ended, to make him acknowledge his folly. Next day the 2 Armies encamped within a League: where the <hi>Scythians</hi> (greedy and needy) talked (all night) of the spoile, the <hi>Parthians</hi> of honour, the Christians of their deliverance, &amp;c. All which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> hearing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to see his Souldiers hope of Victory: who after the 2 watch, thought to sleep a while in his pavilion. But his cares not suffering, he then read (as ordinary) in a book of his Ancessours lives, not to deceive time, but to imitate and decline what they worthily did, or by rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c. fell into. After slumbring, he sent for <hi>Axal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> who came with divers great Captaines, with whom consulting a while, he mounting, sent every one to their Charges to make ready. At which, he heard, the enemy came to take his ground; whose Order he desired to see, to marshal his own by.

Seeing the <hi>Janizaries</hi> in a square battle in midst, on the 2 fronts 2 squadrons of horse, seeming 30000, and another cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Janizaries</hi> battalion, he thinking this order hard to be broken, said to <hi>Axalla,</hi> I thought to have fought a foot,

but now I see it behooves me to fight on horse-back, to encourage my Souldiers, to open the enemies great batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. And my will is, that my men come so soon as they may, for I will advance with a 100000 foot-men, &amp;c. <hi>Ciarcan</hi> commanded the first 40000 horse, Lord <hi>Synopes</hi> a <hi>Genovois,</hi> the foremost foot: <hi>Axalla</hi> over 5 squadrons of horse. <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Army came bravely on towards their enemies, who stirred not from their place; except some light horse-men (as loose) skirmishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Armies. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had notice that <hi>Bajazet</hi> meant to fight on foot in midst of 30000 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> in whom he most hoped. His horse were 14000 old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.

               <p>This bloody battle, in 1397, was fought from 7 in the morning till 4 in the after-noon. <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s politique tiring of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s strong forces, was the safeguard of his own. The number slain is diversly reported: the <hi>Turks</hi> say that <hi>Bajazet</hi> lost his Son <hi>Mustapha,</hi> with 200000 men, <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> not many fewer; others, that there were 60000 <hi>Turks</hi> slain, of <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s 20000. It was three daies (as they report) before <hi>Bajazet</hi> could be pacified, but still seeking and calling for death: neither did <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> afterwards courteously use him, but, as of a proud man, made small account of him, and shackling him in golden fetters, made him be shut up in an iron Cage, to be seen on every side, so carrying him up and down in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> to be derided of his own people, used him for a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool when he took horse; and at other times sed him, like a dog, with his crums. All which he did, not so much for hatred, as to shew God's Judgment against the arrogant folly of the proud.</p>
               <p>This great overthrow so feared all <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Countries in <hi>Asia,</hi> that <hi>Axalla</hi> sent to prosecute with 40000 horse &amp; 100000 foot came unresisted to <hi>Prusa,</hi> whither the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies remainders were retired, the Country still yielding as he went.

                  <hi>Emmanuel</hi> the Emperor sent his Embassadours to <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> whom <hi>Axalla</hi> stayed till <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s coming; who receiving them honourably, shewed them his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and order of his Camp, to their great admiration. By these, the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour submitted all to <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> as his Vassal, bound so to do (he said) being delivered from the cruellest of Tyrants, by the long journey, discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, losse of his People, and danger of his person; besides his many virtues and accomplishments. And therefore he would attend him in his chief City, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, with all the Empire, into his hands. The Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours, looking for nought but bondage, thought <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>'s acceptance thereof in friendship was the best bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that they could make. But he, mildly beholding them, answered, He was not come from so far to enlarge his dominions, already large enough; but rather to win honour: And it should appear that he was come to aid him, as his ally, being requested: that his upright meaning was the greatest cause that God (by his power) had brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the fiercest enemy of mankind, under heaven: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired no more, but that his service for the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor might be ingraven in the memory of his posterity, that they might for ever wish well to him and his Successors: Long might the noble Emperour live happily, to govern: And that he (before his returne) would so consider, that he should not lightly fall into the like jeopardy. Few Princes (I suppose) would perform such a part; but there be but few <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> in the World. One of these joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Embassadours, being sent to carry this unexpected news, filled the Emperour (with all <hi>Constantinople)</hi> with exceeding joy and gladnesse; who shortly after passed to <hi>Prusa</hi> to see <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and, in person, to give him thanks: who, being very glad, sent <hi>Axalla</hi> to meet and conduct him to <hi>Prusa,</hi> where these great Princes met with the greatest magnificence, spending a whole day to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had a desire to see <hi>Constantinople;</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:130480-02:105"/>
yet he would go thither as a private person, which by <hi>Axalla</hi> was accomplished, where he was with all possible familiarity received by the Emperour, who shewed him all the rare things to be seen, all the fair Gardens, a league or 2 off, along the Sea coast, spending 5 or 6 daies with all mirth possible: <hi>Tamerlane</hi> often saying in his private conduct, he never saw a fairer City, which (for its fair and rich scituation) was worthy to command all the World. He wondring at the costly buildings of the Temples <hi>&amp;c.</hi> said, it repented not him of his so long dangerous voyage, if it had been but to preserve so noble a City from fire and sword. The Emperour gave him 30 of the best horses possible to be gotten, richly furnished: knowing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to take pleasure in them; sending fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to all his great Commanders, and bountifully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all necessaries for the Army. So a streight bond of friendship being made, &amp; by Oath confirmed between them, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> returned to <hi>Prusa,</hi> wasting and spoyling all <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Dominion in <hi>Asia</hi> without resistance.</p>
               <p>The year being well spent, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dispersed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into divers provinces of lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> expecting when some of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s sons or friends should make means to him for his deliverance, but none came. Whereupon passing by, he said unto him: <hi>I marvail that none of thy Sons or friends come to see thee or intreat for thee, thou must needs have ill deserved of them, as of others: Yet, if I should set thee at liberty, would they receive thee as their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign? Bajazet</hi> answered, <hi>Were I at liberty, thou shouldst see that I want neither courage nor means to revenge my wrongs, and to make those disobedient and forgetfull know their duties better.</hi> Which made <hi>Tamerlan</hi> keep a strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hand over him. Then restoring to the Mahometan Princes, <hi>Tachretin, Isfendiar, Germian,</hi> and others, all their inheritance with something more; as he did divers Cities and Countreys of <hi>Natolia</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, for 400000 Duckats of Gold, and 800000 Franks of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

yearly tribute; and enriching his Army with Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man spoiles in <hi>Asia,</hi> he turned against the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who had aided <hi>Bajazet;</hi> and entring into <hi>Syria,</hi> near <hi>Aleppo</hi> (before yielded to him) was fought a mortal bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the Sultan having an 100000 foot and 74000 horse, whereof 30000 were <hi>Mamalukes. Axalla</hi> with the Vant-guard, hardly distressed, was taken, but rescued forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by <hi>Tamerlane;</hi> who, if he had not come on with fresh forces, that day might have ended his good fortune: After long fight, (80000 being slain) the Sultan fled, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> pursuing him 3 leagues, and sending <hi>Axalla</hi> with 40000 horse and 50000 foot, to pursue along <hi>Arabia</hi>'s coast: himself, the while, with 60000 horse and 100000 foot, had all Cities by the Sea coast as he went yielded to him, as <hi>Magata, Aman, &amp;c.</hi> onely <hi>Damasco</hi> refused, Prince <hi>Zamadzen</hi> strongly defending the same: but <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane,</hi> overthrowing part of the Wall by battery, won it by assault, the Castle (almost impregnable) yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the retired multitude soon pinched with hunger, and many dead, the rest, for their lives, offered to yield, to whom he would not shew mercy: so that most dying, the rest yielded without condition, and were almost all slain. Which severity made them bring the keys of their Cities to him 30 leagues off, and contribution to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Thence he turned towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the City driving out the Sultan's Garrison. <hi>Chorazin</hi> at first stood on their guard, but afterwards dismayed, and submitting they found mercy, where leaving certain men in garrison, for repressing the troublesome <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> he rode to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to visit the Sepulchre, and make his oblations: where (joyfully received) seeking out all antiquities, and conducted to all places thereabouts as Pilgrims, gave to the Sepulchre and devout there many rich gifts, to the contentment of all but the <hi>Jews,</hi> who blamed him, whom he called the accursed of God. He heard the Sultan (ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his forces) was in <hi>Aegypt</hi> fortifying, especially
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:130480-02:106"/>
                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Caire. Tamerlane</hi>'s Army the while came towards <hi>Damiata:</hi> which he would not leav behind him, though perswaded by some (as thought impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) so commanding <hi>Axalla</hi> to set on it, himself follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after. <hi>Axalla</hi> declaring to the Inhabitants (most Christians) <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s courtesy; and what Religion him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self held, and made many <hi>Greek</hi> Captains tell them of their misery under the Moors and <hi>Mamalukes:</hi> which so prevailed, that (by night) they mastering a quarter of the City delivered a Gate to <hi>Axalla:</hi> who entring slew or took all the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> gaining the City. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> (yet on his march) hearing of this, was in good hope of a happy end in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for he knew this haven, might serve him with victuals out of all <hi>Greece.</hi> He left there two thousand of the Emperour's Souldiers, taking Oath for obedience. His Vant-guard marched towards <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and passing the River, turned even instantly to <hi>Cair,</hi> to the Sultan's great astonishment. But using diligence, (as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> approached) he entredthe City to defend it, with 40000 horse and 60000 foot: whereby the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ready to revolt, was again confirmed: <hi>Tamerlan</hi> could not stay long before it for want of victuals, yet making a great trench to cover his horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he drew near it giving divers on-sets, to try the enemies confidence, and to see the affection of the Citizens (especially of the slaves) to whom he promised liberty. One day he shewed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in battle array before it, to seek occasion to fight; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping also, if the Sultan came forth, some revolt might happen within, he having made known to the Citizens, he came not to hurt them, but to destroy the <hi>Mamalukes.</hi> But none came forth, neither was any stir raised in the City: for the Sultan resolved to weary him out with lying still. Who resolved to force him even in his greatest Cities heart, though not to be done without great adventure. He purposing first to take one City (for it's divided into 3) advanced by little and little, still fighting: Having brought
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:130480-02:107"/>
his foot to the place of onset (for twas fortifyed onely with ditches and trenches) he commanded the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to begin with 50000, and there began a most terrible fight. <hi>Axalla</hi> setching a compasse, passed the trenches on another quarter of the City with small resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; leaving 30000 to fill the ditches, and make way for the horse to enter: advancing himself against 20000 sent by the Sultan to stop him, <hi>Thanais</hi> being almost beat back by the <hi>Mamalukes.</hi> But the way being made plain, and 10000 horse entred (who charged on their backs where the Sultan was) and seconded by 10000 moe, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> following with all his power: the Sultan retired into the next City. The fight was 7 hours, above 16000 of the Sultan's being slain, and betwixt 7 &amp; 8000 of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi>'s: who now sounded a retrait, hoping next day to win the rest, as he did. For <hi>Thanais</hi> forcing their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in one place, and <hi>Axalla</hi> in another, the Sultan (after a great fight) abandoned the City, encamping by <hi>Nilus,</hi> purposing to passe it, and flee to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> followed with his horse, and a few foot, (whose service he had promised to reward) hardly drawn from their fellows spoiling the City, against whom the Sultan opposed (on a narrow cawsey) 12 or 15000 slaves, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his passage, who stood fast, but at length forced by their enemies increasing (not without great losse) they took the River, with a weapon in one hand and swimming with the other to the bank. The Sultan fleeing with 18000 horse (not fled or drowned) is reported to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forchis men, saying tha they were not men but Gods that vanquished them. Divers <hi>Mamalukes</hi> being taken and brought to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> he demanded if they would serve him now their Master was fled, which they refused, yet he freed them for their fidelity; every man after 24 hours spoyl, was commanded to his quarters. He set all the Citizens at liberty, &amp; leaving 10000 good souldiers with many others, (whereof he caried great multitudes) &amp;<hi>c.</hi>

to keep the City: his Army passed the river to follow the Sultan. <hi>Axalla</hi> before with the avauntguard, and <hi>Chanais</hi> with the rest; himself going by water, greatly pleased to see the river's sometimes swist course, and (in an instant) scarce moving.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> (hearing of his coming) besought the Sultan to withdraw into <hi>Lybia,</hi> whither (for barrenness) he could not greatly follow; they resolving no more to resist so great a force; promising to remain his in heart, and to make it (on the first occasion) appear. Wherefore he (hoping time would bring some change) determined to retire: and departing with standing tears, often said, God was angry, &amp;c. That he must needs suffer the overthrow of his Estate, &amp;c. Yet he hoped to return and deliver his pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from bondage, &amp;c. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> staying long here, sent <hi>Axalla</hi> to pursue him, grieved he could not get him. This bruite passing with <hi>Axalla</hi> into <hi>Lybia,</hi> so feared all <hi>Africa,</hi> that 22 Moores Kings sent (thinking he followed) to offer obedience: the Sultan still flying off, the nearest <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> took hostages; the rest, faith given, contented him.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> desired to see his native Country, the rather moved by his Wive's request; his Father in-laws sicknesse; his Own age; and his wearied Souldiers desires.

The Bassaes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, He was yet but little recovered, and the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would not suffer him to look abroad. Then said they, (ready to force in) We `will our selves see his Majesty. <hi>Eivases</hi> desired them not then to trouble him, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Physick; but to morrow, said he, we will request (if

Being brought accordingly, suddenly a Physitian came in fuming and raging, &amp;c. asking the Bassaes, if they meant to kill the King by bringing him into the open air, &amp;c. Pardon us good Doctor, said <hi>Eivases,</hi> for these (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Pensioners) were so importunate to see him, that he was content to be led forth, &amp;c. They supposing him to be alive, held themselves contented. The Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, carried him in again, as an extream sick man. His death was thus concealed 41 daies.

greater part, when they could not perswade him with those few, to yield, they delivered him and them bound to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and so yielded up the City. Wherefore fearing to return to <hi>Amurath,</hi> some remained with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> others provided for, or rewarded, departed whither they would. All other weaker places, in short time yielded themselves on like condition: onely <hi>Sfeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> in <hi>Epirus</hi> frontiers, placed as it were an Eagles nest, remained in the <hi>Turks</hi> possession. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> coming hither, began to assay it by composition, causing his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to declare, all that happened at <hi>Croia, Petrella,</hi> &amp;c. how courteously he used the Garrison of <hi>Stellusa</hi> which yielded to him; and having the Governour with his partakers in bonds, whom they should see executed, if they forthwith delivered it not. This troubled the Garrison, chiefly the Governour, seeing thereby what might happen to himself. Wherefore first entertaining the Embassadovrs honourably, he said to the Citizens and Souldiers: Worthy and faithful men, what is your pleasure, we shall answer to our enemies demands? A rough and bold spirited Souldier, drawing his sword, and shaking it on high, answered. Most Valiant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this and the like shall answer for us. Nothing was to lesse purpose, than to seek to terrifie Valiant minds, with the fortune of <hi>Croia,</hi> and <hi>Stellusa,</hi> &amp;c. we prescribe them of <hi>Petrella,</hi> or <hi>Stellusa,</hi> no laws, neither let them us: brave mindes disdain to imitate others in honest actions, much lesse in cowardise. Let <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> kill the Governour, and our fellow Souldiers before our faces, do ye therefore think we shall die in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? &amp;c. But oh happy bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. Wherefore carry back this answer from a common Souldier: If thy Master seek to impose these conditions on us, let him once more bare his Arme, which men of courage fear not so much as he

Then the Suoldiers thronging about him beating their swords and targets, gave a shout, as approving his speech. So the Governour, returning the common Souliders answer, appointed every man to his charge, ordering all things for defence of the City. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> smiling at the common Souldiers answer, said.

                  <hi>Amurath</hi> (about the time of the <hi>Venetians</hi> making peace with <hi>Scanderbeg)</hi> sent him presents, with 25000 Ducats for <hi>Mustapha</hi> and the others ransome, which he divided amongst his Souldiers: and leading his Army again into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he made his Souldiers better pay with the spoyl; and for the more harm, divided it into 3 parts, putting all the <hi>Turks</hi> coming in his way to the sword, leaving the Christians no more than their lives: utterly consuming the buildings with fire, in all that part borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon <hi>Epirus:</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> should find no relief to lay in Garrison, or invade it; it was thought there was not enough left to relieve the <hi>Turks</hi> Army for a day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> herewith exceedingly vexed, resolved to go in person with an Army, not to conquer <hi>Epirus,</hi> but if need were to fill every corner of it. None but the Bassa's of the Councel knew whither he imployed the same: which made the bordering Christian Princes prepare for their own assurance.

Then he sent <hi>Moses</hi> and others, to take the Souldiers and all provision possible, himself not resting till he left nothing in the Countrey for the enemies cruelty. Most of the people with their substance, were received into the strong Cities: the rest into the <hi>Venetian</hi> and other Princes Countreys, till this sury was overpast; all able to bear Arms, were commanded to <hi>Croia,</hi> out of which multitude <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> those only 1000 old Souldiers, with whom he purposed

In the midst of these passions commandement came from <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> That they must now depart, that the Souldiers might take their charge. Then began sorrows afresh, with pitious screeching and tears, and departing set their feet (many times) they wist not where, for desire of looking back upon the City; who were conveighed into <hi>Venetian</hi> Cities, and other places, whither all, not before received into strong Cities, resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their substance, and nothing left in all <hi>Epirus</hi> but the ground.

Continuing the assault all that day, and no hope appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he left the assault, in which he lost 7000, and many dying afterwards: of the Garrison, but 70 were slain, and 90 hurt. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hoped <hi>Amurath</hi> would at length begone: yet with 2000 he would oft shew himself on the Mountaines sides to draw the <hi>Turks</hi> out, and take them at advantage: But the King commanding none to goe out, or speak of battell or assault on paine of death, lay certain daies more like one besieged himself: which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> the more distrusted, fearing he was hatching some mischiefe, who thought good againe to prove if twere possible to overcome the Garrison Souldiers with gifts; wherefore he sent, offering to the besieged condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with such large rewards, as had not been heard offered to any. All which being leightly rejected by common consent, one base-minded fellow, corrupted herewith, secretly promised the <hi>Turks</hi> espialls, that on as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the profered reward, the City should be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

In the morning, the Garrison being drawn out of the Well, the report was, it was poysoned: all were in an uproar to find out the Traitour.

would rather perish with thirst, than drink thereof: Some desiring to fire the City, and break thorough the enemies, or die. They that thought best, that it might be yielded up, as ready to sue to <hi>Amurath</hi> for peace, though on harder termes than the former. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour troubled and astonied, the better to pacifie the matter, exhorted them in the Market place to continue faithfull, and make small reckoning to use the water, which would soon be brought to its wonted purity: drinking in their sight a great draught, whose example the Citizens followed.

               <p>The <hi>Turkish</hi> King, almost despairing to win the City, (which he could but on one side assault) a Christian in his Camp shewed him how to bring a great part of his Fleet by Land into the Haven, to assault the City by water: by which device, and mens strength, <hi>Zoganus</hi> Bassa, brought 70 lesser Ships and Galliots, with sails abroad, up a great hill, 8 miles, into <hi>Constantinople</hi>'s Haven.

               <p>Shortly after, <hi>Mahomet</hi> made a wonderful bridge, more than half a mile long, over the Haven, built with timber planks, &amp;c. whereby his Army came over to assault the City on that side also.</p>

                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:130480-02:162"/>There was among the Captive Virgins, one <hi>Irene</hi> a Greek, of incomparable beauty, and rare perfection: which Paragon being presented to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he was on the first view not a little moved. Yet for the present, committed her to his Eunuch to be safely kept untill his better leisure. But his new conquests well assured, he began to think of the faire <hi>Irene:</hi> taking in her such delight, that she soon became commander of so great a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and he in nothing more delighted than in doing her the greatest honour and service. All the day he spent with her in discourse, and the night in dalliance: his wonted care of Armes was quite neglected: Yea the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Empire, seemed in comparison of her, little or not at all regarded. But he thus spending a whole yeare or two in pleasure: the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and other Court Souldiers first secretly murmured: at length openly said: It were well done to deprive him, and set up one of his Sons in his stead; so that it was feared by some Bassaes, whereunto this their insolency would grow. But who should tell the Tyrant thereof; whose frowne was death? or, who durst take in hand to cure his sick minde? There was one <hi>Mustapha Bassa,</hi> for his good service, and brought up with him of a Child, highly favoured and promoted by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and he by him no lesse honoured and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: who espying a convenient leisure, and presuming of his former Credit with him, adventured to give him warning; that if it were not for the loyalty owed to his greatnesse, dearer to him than his own life, he would not adventure now, the hazard of his doubtfull acceptance of his faithfull speech and meaning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the life he led since the taking of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had given occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not onely to the Vulgar, and Souldiers of the Court, but to his greatest Commanders, to mutmur and grudge, he dared not say, conspire against him.

That all those famous conquests of his noble progenitours, should awake him out of his heavie Lethargie, wherein he had too long slept: and let it never be said, he could with the sword overcome his greatest enemies, and not with reason subdue his inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. What availeth it him to have won <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and to have lost himself? That he should shake off those Golden Chaines, wherein the wilie Greek had so fast bound him: which, though at first, it seem hard, yet time shall digest it, and make him think it good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for his estate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That from the want of marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all discipline proceedeth disloyall speeches in his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that if he will not lead them forth, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> they will set up one of his own Children which shall.

               <p>Falling at his feet to receive the doome of his free speech, if not well taken: the Sultan having attentively and sternly hearkened to all, knew it to be true, and that he discharged but the part of a faithfull servant. Yet he was at war with himself, as in his often changed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appeared. Thus tossed too and fro, he resolved considering the danger, at once to cut off all his troubled passions: and to strike a errour into them that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, as unable to governe his affections: saying to the Bassa yet at his feet; that, although he as a slave,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:130480-02:163"/>
presuming to enter into his Soveraign's greatest secrets, deserved to die; yet, being brought up with him of a Child, and ever faithfull, he now pardoned him: and would make known to morrow, to him and others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were able to bridle his affections; that he should not faile to assemble all the Bassaes and chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to know his farther pleasure.</p>
               <p>The Bassa departing, he made more of the Greek than ever, dining with her: then (sumptuously apparelling her, and with inestimable Jewells deckt) he entred the Pallace Hall, where <hi>Mustapha</hi> had assembled the Nobles and Commanders, marvelling at his meaning, who had not shewed himself publiquely so long, leading the faire Greek by the hand. After reverence done them by all, he furiously looking about him, said, He understood of their great discontent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he overcomn, could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from this <hi>Paragons</hi> presence: But he would know which of them, if he possessed so rare a thing, would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it without thrice advising? they should freely say what they thought: They with incredible admiration, all said, He had with greater reason passed the time with her, than any had to find fault: whereto he answered, But I will make you understand, there is no earthly thing can so blind me, as not to see what beseemeth my high place: that nothing but death can put out of my remembrance the honour and conquests of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Kings: with a desire to exceed the same. Then catching the Greek by the haire, he struck off her head with his Falchion at one blow: saying they should judge whether he could bridle his affections or not. A while after he greatly prepared for conquest of <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> and <hi>Belgrades</hi> siege.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Turks</hi> took <hi>Constantinople, Thomas</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> the Emperours brethren, governed a great part of <hi>Peloponesus:</hi> which in form of a plane Leafe, is almost environed with the <hi>Ionian</hi> and <hi>Aegean</hi> Seas, leaving but a

of <hi>Trapezond,</hi> being forced to pay <hi>Mahomet</hi> a tribute by his <hi>Asian</hi> Lieutenant, he should not now look for it: seeing that Empire, after <hi>Davids</hi> death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him in his Wives right, <hi>Davids</hi> elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Daughter, requiring him not to molest him, so should he be his faithful confederate, otherwise his mighty enemy. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> envying the <hi>Persian</hi> rising, and now disdaining his peremptory requests, dismissed them with this answer, He would ere long be personally in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> to teach <hi>Usun</hi> what to request of a greater than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

Governour of <hi>Bidina, &amp;c.</hi> to do his utmost for entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>Uladus,</hi> promising him great rewards. <hi>Chamuzes</hi> devised, the Secretary to give him notice of the day of his return from the Prince: when 'twas like, <hi>Uladus</hi> would bring him on his way of himself, or at least being by the Secretary requested; the <hi>Bassa,</hi> passing with Troops over <hi>Danubius,</hi> should lay close in ambush on the way. The Secretary forced his wit, to perswade the Prince to go to Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he obtained no more from him wary, than good words, and in courtesie to conduct him unto <hi>Danubius</hi> side. The Secretary giving <hi>Chamuzes</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he lay where the Secretary must needs passe: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the prefixed time to the place, <hi>Chamuzes</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly assailing the Prince, slew divers. But <hi>Uladus</hi> being of great courage, and better appointed than the <hi>Bassa</hi> supposed, slew many <hi>Turks,</hi> and at length took <hi>Chamuzes</hi> with the rest: whose hands and feet he cutting off, thrust their bodies on sharp stakes fastned in the ground, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Bassa</hi> and Secretary on a Gibbet, much higher than the other. And gathering his forces, passed <hi>Danubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> burning along the River side, killing man, woman, and Child, so returning into <hi>Valachia.</hi> This newes set <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> into such a rage, that he commanded <hi>Bassa Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes</hi> telling him of it, to be cruelly whipt. But when he surely understood, rather worse than the <hi>Bassa</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not to be expressed into what a rage he fell. Wherefore assembling speedily his Souldiers to <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> he soon raised such an Army, as had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Constantinople:</hi> sending also 25.

The King taking refuge of <hi>Clyssa,</hi> was so hardly laid to, that he yielded himself on the Bassaes solemne oath conceived in writing, that he being honourably used, should not be hurt by the Emperour.

within him, he might bring him to confusion, wherefore he sent rich Presents and Letters to this purport; that He thought no acquaintance greater, or friendship firmer, than that which grew from long and mutual converse, and living together, as he knew it had been betwixt them. Wherefore remembring all those things, and also what he often did for advancement of his Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he could not but embrace him with a singular affection, that nothing could be more welcom to him than to enjoy his company a while.

               <p>Hereupon, a peace was concluded betwixt them, and solemnly proclaimed to the great joy of many.

gave the Souldiers knowledge thereof, by singing a Song like a procession: the Army answering with a short, but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful noise, bowed to the Moon with great superstition. Then beginning to draw nigh the City, a mile round was thick covered with them: The Christians were ready to repulse them, chiefly at the great Gate, where <hi>Moneta</hi> and his Brother <hi>Moncinus</hi> undertook to receive the first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, commonly the terriblest of the three which they give. <hi>Mahomet</hi> going to the top of the Mount before day, and the Signall given by 11 Cannons, and 12 lesser Pieces, the <hi>Turks</hi> assailing the City round, with a most hideous outcry and nimbleness, had in a trice set up an Ensign on the Gate's rampiers, which was pluckt down by <hi>Moneta,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> driven down, with great slaughter, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault thus continuing till day: <hi>Moneta</hi> received divers wounds, being twice beaten down, yet still recovered himself, <hi>&amp;c.

Mahomet</hi> now comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his forces to be drawn to the Gate, there to renew the assault. Whereupon the greatest part being brought to the place, they so furiously assaulted the breach, that soon slaying most of the defendants, they had advanced divers Ensignes; but new supplies comming to the place of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, drave them back, clearing the breach, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Ensigns: which turning <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s joy into choler, he discharging all his great Artillery at once into the breach, many of his own were slain with the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>

shrouded themselves in Cellars and Caves for the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the shot. At length, a fair breach being made, the <hi>Turks</hi> so desperatly assaulted it, that they suddenly set some Ensigns on the top of the walls; but they being soon repulsed into the ditches, most never rose again. Then also in another place, they both advanced their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and 500 of them entred comming into <hi>Jew</hi>-street, where being all slain by <hi>Damboyse,</hi> their Ensigns were thrown down, the rest yet scaling, being with wondrous slaughter rejected. So the Bassa sounded a retreat, about 5000 being lost, with small losse of the Christians: <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyse</hi> himself receiving 5 wounds, one whereof, under his right pap, was thought deadly, but was cured.</p>

Wherefore early in the morning they braved their Enemyes: which the <hi>Turks</hi> disdayning, set foreward with displayed Ensignes: there beginning such a desperately resolved fight, that one might have said, the former was but a play in comparison; none being seen to give ground, or look back: the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaryes</hi> and <hi>Mamalukes</hi> Foot to Foot, spending their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most force upon each other; <hi>Usbeg</hi> the while freshly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Turks</hi> with 15000 valiant Horse as a reserve, so that they began to give ground: which being made good

               <p>The Bassaes finding scarce a third part of 100000 men, left, and most of them hurt, doubting to be set upon againe, fled away the same Night, leaving all behind them.

or abandon that City, and the French King approach <hi>Naples,</hi> he should against reason and equity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act his Subjects fidelity.

                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> setting forth a greater Fleet than any of his Predecessors, marched himself with a great Army, along the Sea-coast of <hi>Morea;</hi> so that what they could, they kept in sight of each other: the <hi>Venetians</hi> also setting sorth a Fleet under <hi>Grimani</hi> their Admiral, for strength, skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> superiour, though in number inferiour: whom the <hi>Turks</hi> braving, yet durst not (at first) joyn battel, but crept along the Coast: the <hi>Venetians</hi> troubling them, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, accounting it good service, if they could but keep them from landing in any place of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. The longer they thus sailed, the more was the State of <hi>Venice</hi> offended with their Admiral, delaying to fight, suffering them to draw nearer and nearer to their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: while all expected some great exployt to be done, news came, that the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet had put into <hi>Sapientia</hi> Haven, in <hi>Sphraga</hi> Island, to water, and were there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayed by the <hi>Venetians:</hi> most were joyful, as of an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Victory; but others said, the place was such, that the enemy might depart at pleasure; yet they all thought, the Admiral would set upon them in their comming out: which he attending to do, it hapned that <hi>Lauredanus</hi> and <hi>Armenius</hi> comming from <hi>Corcira</hi> to the battel, first began the fight, and with two nimble Ships boarded a tall <hi>Turkish</hi> Ship, like a Castle, whereof one <hi>Baruch,</hi> a <hi>Smyrna</hi> Pyrate was Captain, who perceiving,

after long fight, he must either yield or be taken, fired his ship, whereby the <hi>Venetians,</hi> grapled to her, were all 3 burnt, some leaping over board were taken up, and some perished.

The Viceroy placed his foot in the middle, and his Horse in the Wings, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe-in his enemy; but <hi>Techellis</hi> set all his Foot in a square battel, and the Horse for a reserve, who with their red Hats, as if bloody, terrified the Viceroy's fresh-water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Souldiers, fleeing in half an houre. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Horse, although they had slain many, and somewhat disordered the battel; yet <hi>Techellis</hi> his men beginning to kill their Horses with their Pikes and lay hard at them, they fled also: then the <hi>Persian</hi> horse, as yet lookers on, following the chase, slew many, enclosing the Viceroy stayinghis Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who for the dust could not well discern them, so that he had bin taken, if not rescued by his Guard; 7000 <hi>Turks</hi> Foot were slain, all their Ensigns, with store of provision taken. <hi>Chasan</hi> &amp; <hi>Techellis</hi> resting a day, marched to <hi>Cutaie,</hi>

as it were in the midst of lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> the Viceroy's seat, who fled thither, the Countrey also, having for fear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed thither most of their wealth. <hi>Techellis</hi> placing such Field pieces, he had before taken in battel, and his Archers in fit places for annoying the Defendants, caused scaling-ladders to be set up, proclaiming the Citie's spoil to his Souldiers, if they could take it, with greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to them that first recovered the wall's top. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fearing nothing, they strove who first should get up the Ladders, &amp;c. the Defendants, casting down on them Stones, Timber, Fire, Scalding-water, Lime, Sand, &amp;c. wherewith, though many were killed and spoiled, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stept up in their place, none shrinking back; for the Viceroy on one side, and <hi>Techellis</hi> on the other, were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses of every mans valour; the Viceroy, all being in danger, personally performing all parts of a couragious Souldier; but, the Defendants at last wearied and most wounded, <hi>Techellis</hi> brake into the City in two places, over heaps of dead bodies, bringing in his Army at one of the Gates: the Souldiers and Citizens being miserably slaughtered: the Viceroy with his Wives and Children, being taken, and the stately Marble Pallace consumed with fire. <hi>Techellis,</hi> thought it was now no hard matter to take <hi>Prusa</hi> so to indanger the <hi>Turks</hi> whole Empire in <hi>Asia:</hi> wherefore, appointing when to set forward, he prepared (if he delayed not) all necessaries for its taking, being neither strongly walled, nor garrisoned.

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:130480-02:225"/>
it was thought madness or extream necessity, to joyn bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with an enemy better knowing the Countrey than he, and farre exceeding him in number and expertness of Souldiers. So trussing up his prey, he speedily returned thorow <hi>Galatia;</hi> but the Bassa having almost daily intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence thereof, and of his way; passing <hi>Sangarius,</hi> came and encamped between <hi>Cutaie</hi> and <hi>Ancyra,</hi> supposing it the enemie's passage.

with great silence, fled over the Mountains into <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kingdom; which, when the Bassa by some wounded Souldiers taken by his Scouts, when it was day-light, understood, he chafed, that he had not presently beset the Wood, and sending his Horse-men in vain to pursue them, they brought back some few strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to the Bassa.</p>

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:130480-02:228"/>
and peaceable one, which his Father had given him, that he was not to be daunted, for danger of the <hi>Hungarians;</hi> yet thinking the ancient prowels of that Nation to be much changed, with the change of their Kings, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was resolved for his own honour, which <hi>Bajazet</hi> had some way blemished, by his brethrens advancement, to dye in field against the enemies of <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> or to extend the bounds of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire: who though one of the youngest, yet would not be accounted inferiour to any brother in prowesse.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> (now the rather moved) said he would appoint his Successout, who in his stead, should be fit to'govern so great an Empire; but the 4 Bassaes propounding it to the Court Soldiers, they cryed aloud, No Emperour but <hi>Bajazet,</hi> under whose fortunate conduct they had served above 30 years &amp;c. saying. There was in him yet strength enough, if he would retain the aged majesty of his place, &amp;c. and that such a one of his children, should in due time succeed him, as of right ought, wishing the old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to live in health with a long and happy reign, he needing not to fear any controversie after his death; for the <hi>Othoman</hi> Progeny used to attain the Empire by right and not by faction; but if upon his own liking, he would choose such a one as the people so well liked not of, it might perhaps bring in that confusion, which he thought

thereby to eschew; for the other brethren would never endure so notable an injury, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>He scarce having don speaking, the other Baslaes, as before agreed, perswaded <hi>Bajazet</hi> to call home <hi>Selimus,</hi> and make him Generall, saying, It was like, he, now corrected, would contain himself within compasse: whereas <hi>Acho mates</hi> was not like to be brought to conformity, till by force pluckt down, as was <hi>Selimus.

                  <hi>Corcutus</hi> the while, advertised of these things, sailed to <hi>Constantinople</hi> in his Gallies, where entring the Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chamber with many friends, humbling himself, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Father's hand after much talk betwixt them, is reported to have said, that he above 30 years past, being by a general consent chosen and proclaimed Emperour, had chearfully and willingly delivered that glorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire unto him, &amp;c. Neither did it ever repent him of that his singular kindness and duty done, when as being contented, with what he assigned him, as with a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he thought, that his Father's great Estate, &amp;c. not comparable to the quiet of his pleasing studies, those worldly things working no full contentment to the insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable desire of man, and that surmounting vertue, and most sweet meditation of heavenly things promised to his contemplative and ravished minde, of farre more worth and Majesty, than all the Monarchies of the World; but whilest he was for devotion and desire of knowledge, travelling to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Altar, and so to the <hi>Indians,</hi> as more knowing and sincere men, he drew him
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:130480-02:234"/>
out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by that <hi>Sultan,</hi> into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> &amp;c. as if he thought, the time would come, when for the ill dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some, an innocent man, devoted to study, might be a stay to him and the <hi>Othoman</hi> Family. Since which, he had with all possible integrity discharged his charge: and in the late <hi>Persian</hi> Warre, defended his Frontiers from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion. But they being vanquished, his unnatural Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren having one assailed <hi>Bajazets</hi> person and Empire, the other, setting all that part in <hi>Asia</hi> on a broil, he thought himself in duty bound to repair to his Majesty, &amp;c. who having had too great proof of his Brethrens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity &amp;c. he humbly besought him before the coming of <hi>Selimus,</hi> he hearing, that his Father's Guard and chief Commanders, did but expect a time when they might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him Emperour, whom he sore against their wills o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew infidels, to restore him the Empire due to him, whilest it was yet in his power, in that so momentary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion then presented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> moved with a Fatherly affection towards <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutus,</hi> whose teares stood in his eyes, bad him be of good cheere, discovering his ground of calling home <hi>Selimus,</hi> and that he could be content to resign to him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but it was not at present in his power, for fear of the Court-Souldiers, &amp;c. But by the plot now laid, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus</hi> should, under the Title of Honour, with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, be drawn into <hi>Asia,</hi> whither as soon as they were passed, he promised to resign unto him: which done, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they wholly liked not, yet he feared not, that, they who had lately defended him against <hi>Selimus,</hi> should for his sake dislike <hi>Corcutus,</hi> &amp;c. hoping rather, that if <hi>Achomates</hi> and <hi>Selimus</hi> should joyn battel, either one or both should justly perish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corcutus,</hi> not much misliking his Fathers purpose &amp;c. returned to his Lodging not without hope, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many dayes at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he as a plain upright

               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> his friends the while advertising him of <hi>Corcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his comming to Court, advised him with all speed, to come to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp;c. whereupon, he with certain Troops commanding the rest to follow, came thither with wondrous speed: <hi>Corcutus,</hi> the Bassaes Courtiers, and most of the Souldiers receiving him, as their manner is, (at the Gates entrance) with a kisse, bringing him thorow the City, the people running to see him, who was welcomed with much thundring shot, and joyful acclamation of all Ages and Sexes: and next day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Court, humbly in shew, kissed <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s feet, craving pardon: who smiling on this Crocodile, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously took him up, saying, His faults were so much lesse, as finding speedy repentance; therefore he the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier pardoned him, henceforth to endeavour, that God may be thought to have endued him with a good minde, as with a notable courage: which, with his forwardness, he might manifest by a martial matter, worthy his hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>A Councel of Warre being called, <hi>Selimus</hi> dissembled the Generalship; not to be preferred before <hi>Corcutus,</hi> for his years and discretion; that he having his Fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, could be now content with never so little corner of the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corcutus</hi> and his friends, whose hope was in <hi>Selymus</hi> his departure with the Souldiers, instantly requested him, not to refuse that Honour, without disgrace to <hi>Corcutus,</hi> he being more experienced in Warre. So he was no sooner chosen Generall against <hi>Achomates,</hi> but the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and Court-Souldiers especially before instructed, saluted him their Emperour also, arming to defend their act: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus</hi> at first, shewed a half unwillingness, as to reverence of his alive-Father; but afterwards promised, besides particular favours owing to the Men of Warre, to bestow
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:130480-02:235"/>
a great and general largess amongst them, which he did. Then he requested the Bassaes and chief Commanders, to go and take Orders since twas their minde, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire might be transferred on him by his Fathers good will, without farther trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mustapha,</hi> whether on a new fineness of his own, or that <hi>Selimus</hi> threatned to kill him, if he did not; coming as dismayed to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who hearing the Souldiers cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was come into the open rooms, most unwelcomly said, Emperour, the Men of Warre have saluted <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> &amp;c. requiring thy ratification, ready to break in and kill us both, if thou refuse to resign: they request that of thee, which they have already put into his hand.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> troubled, and perceiving the treachery, after pausing, furiously brake out: <hi>False and forsworn, do you thus betray me?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>why not also take away my life, who could not a while expect my dissolution? but must in post-hast set up a most wicked man. But much good may do you with him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to whom ere long, you shall dearly pay for this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</hi> And he, beginning his Empire with unnatural trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and blood-shed, shall not, I hope, escape Gods heavy hand.</p>

Wherefore passing the Mountains <hi>Scodrisci,</hi> in 8 dayes, to the great Mountains <hi>Moschii,</hi> which famous <hi>Euphrates</hi> separates from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurus;</hi> and running into <hi>Iberia</hi> and <hi>Colchis,</hi> discovereth <hi>Armenia</hi> the greater, on the right hand here; <hi>Selimus,</hi> least he should lack water, departed not from <hi>Euphrates</hi> his banks. So holding on Eastward, till he came to the Mountain <hi>Periardo,</hi> for its fertility, there called <hi>Leprus,</hi> that is, fruitful; for <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Araxis</hi> there running forth of contrary marishes, water that Champian drie Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus,</hi> not yet hearing where <hi>Hysmael</hi> with his great Army was, as half afraid, encamped at the head of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> sending his Scouts every way, to intercept some that might inform him therein. But the <hi>Armenians,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear of <hi>Hysmael</hi>'s command, were fled out of that part, whereby <hi>Selimus</hi> was to passe, carrying away, or burning whatever was for mans use.</p>
               <p>The Scouts after two dayes, returned to <hi>Selimus,</hi> not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one man, shewing him how it was, and thinking ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Armenian</hi> Guides mistaking, or on purpose, had

brought them into such desart places, where Horses and men must perish together: the weak Kings increasing their fear, chiefly <hi>Aladeules,</hi> who for a few dayes, helped them with Victuals; but being gone farre thereinto, <hi>Armenia</hi> performed not his promise, thinking <hi>Hysmael</hi> would vanquish the <hi>Turks,</hi> as he had most of the East. <hi>Selimus,</hi> perplexed, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> with grief remembred what <hi>Chendemus</hi> had before told him, yet seeming chearful to his Souldiers, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and calling his Guides, he understood, that on the right hand beyond <hi>Periardo,</hi> lay the fruitful Countrey of <hi>Armenia;</hi> so, compassing the Hill North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he turn'd down toward <hi>Araxis,</hi> passing it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City <hi>Coy;</hi> for it is foordable, till it receive Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers out of <hi>Periardo.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> were glad, that now they should by Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, turn their toyl and famine, &amp;c. into ease and plenty, or honourably end their miseries at once; for the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, especially the <hi>Europeans,</hi> whose Horses were star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Foot spent with travel, and a great flux, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mostly on Crabs, &amp;c. with a supping of meal and Vinegar, began to die in every corner. <hi>Hysmael,</hi> to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rific them the more, sent a Herald to <hi>Selimus,</hi> with some
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:130480-02:242"/>
skilful Souldiers, to view what they could; his number, Artillery, and how encamped; telling him, seeing the <hi>Turks</hi> had no Title to <hi>Armenia,</hi> &amp;c. he marvelled why he entred his Dominion; but if, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, he should think so much his own as by the Sword he could win, he should next day prove his fortune, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers forces not inferior to his. <hi>Selimus</hi> answered, the manifold injuries done to the <hi>Turks</hi> by the <hi>Persians</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and also in his Warres against <hi>Achomates,</hi> might give him just cause, yet he esteemed them not sufficient causes of Warre, only seeking after <hi>Amurat,</hi> lately spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whom if he would friendly deliver to him, as mutual Laws of amity required, he would peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly return: else he threatned to destroy with fire and Sword, even the heart of <hi>Persia.</hi>

               <p>Next day, <hi>Selimus</hi> set forward in order of battel against the enemies laying about two miles off, thinking, so great a Prince would fight without delay, yet what strength, &amp;c. the <hi>Persian</hi> was of, he certainly knew not; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Persians,</hi> generally so loved <hi>Hysmael,</hi> that not one went to the <hi>Turks:</hi> whereas many revolted from <hi>Selimus</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> having 80000 Horse, placed <hi>Casan Bassa</hi> with his <hi>Europeans</hi> in the right Wing, <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> with his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> in the left; before them both, the <hi>Acanzii;</hi> in the middle, the <hi>Asapi;</hi> behind them, the Artillery guarded with 4000 Horse: lastly following himself with his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> compassed with his small Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces and Carriages, commanding his Vant-guard Foot, upon the enemies approach, speedily to divide, that the great Ordnance might play betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hysmael</hi> understanding by fugitives, his enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, said to his chief Commanders, there was no doubt of Victory, if they could shun the Artillery: wherefore, when the <hi>Turks</hi> Foot divided, they should likewise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into two parts, causing two great Ensigns to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:130480-02:242"/>
whither then to retire, one for himself, the other for <hi>Usta Ogli,</hi> and the rest. He had about 30000 Horse, no Foot; among whom were 10000 men at Arms, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, experienced, mounted on couragious barbed Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and bravely armed; no Guns; in which, and number, they were inferior to the <hi>Turks:</hi> yet contemning about 300000 <hi>Turks,</hi> and little reckoning of their Artillery, they doubted not to give them battel: being also exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Hysmael,</hi> to remember their former Honour, &amp;c. telling them, they had to do with such whose Weapons were but weak Staves, and light Targets: their Horses lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poor jades, almost dead with hunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> gave notice, that the long-wished for battel, was come, wherein if they would worthily acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they should to their immortal fame, extend the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire from the <hi>Persian</hi> Sea, to Mount <hi>Caucasus;</hi> but if otherwise, they must not think to escape by flight, through those desolate Countries, where they either should perish, or being taken, be forced alwayes to serve the <hi>Persian</hi> Women: also, <hi>Euphrates, Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deules,</hi> who had shut up the passages, did cut off all such hope.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Asapi</hi> making place for the Artillery to play, <hi>Hysmael</hi> also dividing, charged the <hi>Turk</hi>'s right wing so forcibly, that <hi>Casan Bassa,</hi> after a terrible fight with the foremost being slain, and many after them, that wing was forced to retire unto <hi>Selimus;</hi> but <hi>Usta Ogli,</hi> who had no small harm by the Ordnance, as not clearing his men so speedily as <hi>Hysmael,</hi> charged their left wing, making great slaughter, and in his couragious assail was slain with a small shot. Wherewith the <hi>Turks</hi> encouraged, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave ground, renewed the battel, and with their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Harque-busiers, drave the <hi>Persians</hi> upon the <hi>Turk</hi>'s common foot: who serring together, brake thorow them, bearing them down with a mighty slaughter, and slaying the Cannoniers, who discharging at all adventure, slew
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:130480-02:243"/>
many of their own, as of enemies, so making way till they came to the right wing, where <hi>Hysmael</hi> still hardly charging the <hi>European</hi> Horses, they were forced to retire; but now charged afresh, scarce able to endure it, cryed to <hi>Selimus</hi> for help: who opening his carriages, sent out part of his Horsemen, and said to his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> that dayes Victory was reserved to their valour: therefore as fresh men, they should assail their wearied enemies, whose Horses were all on a water, and the men faint under their Armour: yet <hi>Selimus</hi> could say, they were not very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and whilest they leisurely set forward, the <hi>Persians</hi> slew the <hi>European</hi> Horsemen down right, and were ready to assail <hi>Selimus</hi> himself on every side; but <hi>Sinan Bassa,</hi> though his wing was sore rent, came in in good time, and with some fresh Troops, restored the battel almost lost; but chiefly by the courage of <hi>Alisbeg,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mahomet</hi> resembling their warlike Father <hi>Malcozzius. Selimus</hi> still in hope, commanded all the Ordnance about him to be discharged: whereby such slaughter was made of his own, as well as of his enemies, that for dust, smoak, &amp; noise of the Artillery, both sides almost losing sight, and hearing their Horses terrified with the Ordnance, not now to be ruled, the battel brake off, the Victory yet doubtful. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Histories tearm this, the onely day of doom.</p>

                  <hi>Hysmael</hi> being wounded under his left shoulder with a small shot, and withdrawing through perswasion to have it searched, was the safeguard of <hi>Selimus</hi> and his Army: for they following their King, left the Victory, thought by all to be almost gotten; but <hi>Hysmael</hi> perceiving the wound was not deep, he was about to charge a fresh; but hearing of <hi>Usta Oglie</hi>'s death, in whom was his greatest confidence, his Captains also perswading him not to set light by his wound, whose grief he yet felt not, being warm, he softly marched away, as not resembling flight: and passing by <hi>Tauris,</hi> willed the Citizens to open the

Gates to <hi>Selimus,</hi> if he came, rather than to fall into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, himself marching in <hi>Media</hi>'s confines.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> having no hearts nor strength to pursue them, yet took their Tents, where besides much rich fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, were many Ladies and Gentlewomen, who, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>-like, had followed their Husbands in those Warres, whom <hi>Selimus</hi> safely freed, except a Wife of <hi>Hysmael,</hi> whom he gave in marriage to a Bassa. Some there present, reported that divers <hi>Persian</hi> women were found among the dead, armed, whom <hi>Selimus</hi> honestly buried. This notable battel in the <hi>Galderan</hi> fields nigh <hi>Coy,</hi> was fought <hi>August</hi> 7th, 1514. <hi>Selimus</hi> losing above 30000 men, <hi>Cusun,</hi> Lievetenant of <hi>Europe,</hi> being one, <hi>Seven Sanzacks,</hi> two being the <hi>Malcozzian</hi> Brethren, who were slain res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing each other: most of his <hi>European</hi> Horse; the flower of his Army, being almost all slain, or grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: yet he having the Victory, by his enemies confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having Embassadors from <hi>Coy</hi> and other Cities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from <hi>Tauris,</hi> promising to relieve him, and do what he commanded, he marched thither to see and possess himself of that chief City, two dayes journey from <hi>Coy.</hi> The Citizens being ready, brought them store of Victuals into the Suburbs, <hi>Selimus</hi> not holding it safe to lodge within that populous City, only kept the Gates with a strong Guard: Some say <hi>Selimus</hi> went not into <hi>Tauris,</hi> but in a common Souldiers habit: others that he banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Kings Pallace, discoursing with the <hi>Taurisians,</hi> about his Victory. And purposing to winter in <hi>Armenia,</hi> he asked his great Captains, how they liked of it, who for fear, referred themselves to him.</p>
               <p>Only <hi>Musthapha,</hi> chief Bassa said, twere good to know the mindes of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> &amp; Court-Souldiers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Selimus,</hi> commanded him out of his sight, and degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, sending a Jester after him in disgrace, who cut off part of his Tulipant that hung down; but the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> much offended with the indignity, rose in arms, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:130480-02:244"/>
                  <hi>Selimus,</hi> they would not winter so farre from home, in the enemie's Countrey: therefore he were best betime consider of it, they being resolved to forsake him, if he did not speedily return. <hi>Selimus</hi> much troubled, and hearing <hi>Hysmael</hi> was comming upon him with a greater power, and considering with what difficulty and danger he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the last battel, &amp;c. and suspecting the fidelity of the <hi>Taurisians,</hi> he resolved to return into <hi>Cappadocia:</hi> wherefore exacting from them a great Masse of money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his promise, he speedily retired towards <hi>Euphrates,</hi> a longer way than he came, carrying away 3000 Families, the best artificers, chiefly those skilled in making Armour and Weapons: fearing to return by the head of <hi>Araxis,</hi> &amp;c. for meeting the <hi>Albanian</hi> and <hi>Iberian</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hysmael</hi> followed him with such speed, that he left his Carriages, and such as could not endure such a march, behind him; yet he overtook no part of his Army, till come to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where he was transporting his Foot in divers small Boats made, many swimming over for haste upon bladders; some on broken pieces of their Carriages burst in sunder to that end. <hi>Selimus</hi> got over in a little Boat, causing the Horsemen at once, to take the River, to break the streams force, whereby his Foot and burthened Cammels got over, lesse dangerously, and some Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces also with lesse difficulty: yet the <hi>Georgian</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men coming in sight before all got over, raised such a fear, that 2000 <hi>Turks</hi> were in their haste drowned, divers Ordnance sticking in the mud, and much baggage carried away with the River. The <hi>Georgians</hi> drew out the <hi>Turkish</hi> trash, pursuing them no farther. <hi>Hysmael</hi> rejoycing, that chasing away his enemies, he recovered much of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that did him such hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> his passage was much more dangerous at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titaurus,</hi> than he thought of; for <hi>Aladeules</hi> waiting for his prey, had taken all strait passages of that Mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Countrey,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:130480-02:244"/>
whose savage people assailing them every night, robbed their Carriages: so fleeing into the thick Woods, rocky aud Mountainous: <hi>Aladeules</hi> fraudulently excusing him self, as if done by the people used to such robberies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, yet saying he would chastise the Authours, so soon as found. And sending a little provision for some dayes, he spoiled the <hi>Turks</hi> by night, by his Souldiers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advantage, which <hi>Selimus</hi> could not prevent: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purposing to be in time revenged, he with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, came to <hi>Trapezond,</hi> thence to <hi>Amosia,</hi> repairing his sore weakened Army that winter.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jovius</hi> reports the said Warres, whom others since have mostly followed; yet <hi>Manavinus</hi> a <hi>Genoway,</hi> who served therein, doth much otherwise report the same. <hi>Selimus,</hi> saith he, with about 300000 coming to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the Bridge was broken down by <hi>Amurat;</hi> and his enemies encamped on the farther side, having new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from <hi>Hysmael:</hi> so that the <hi>Persians</hi> were about 90000 Horse and Foot, most having two serviceable Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses apiece: neither could <hi>Selimus,</hi> any way learn whether <hi>Hysmael</hi> were there, of, which he most feared, raising greater forces. Wherefore, repairing the Bridge, he sent over <hi>Casan</hi> and <hi>Sinan,</hi> Bassa's, who encamped as they thought convenient: next morning, <hi>Amurat,</hi> two houres before Sun-rising, suddenly assailed <hi>Casan</hi> in his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, discomfiting them, and taking their Tents: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon such a terror came on <hi>Sinan,</hi> that his men swam over with great danger to the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> troubled hereat, placed his Artillery along the hither most bank of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and to hide them, ranged some Souldiers before them, as if presently to passe over; but upon a signall, should withdraw from the Ordnance, bent upon the enemy; many of whom being over-char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, burst in sunder, slaying divers <hi>Turks,</hi> also many Horses and Mules, terrified with the noyse, leapt into the River, and were drowned with their Riders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:130480-02:245"/>The <hi>Porsians</hi> also having great losse, retired farther off for fear: So <hi>Selimus</hi> passing over, marched toward the enemy, whom the <hi>Persians</hi> notably encountred: The Fight was long doubtful, and much blood shed on both fides; and had not the nights approach broke it off, the <hi>Persians</hi> through multitude, rather then valour, had been greatly overthrown; but now they escaped the <hi>Turk</hi>'s pursuit. <hi>Selimus</hi> leaving his Carriages, &amp;c. with his Foot, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Horse, suddenly to surprise <hi>Tauris,</hi> before the fame of the battel: the <hi>Persians</hi> being as careful of their affaires. The day before, 10000 fresh Horsemen were comming to <hi>Hysmael,</hi> who placing them in the <hi>Turks</hi> way, commanded them, upon their approach, to flee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> in the morning, descrying them, supposing they were such as could not follow the rest, exhorted them couragiously to pursue them; of which, being about mid day; weary, they stayed at a little River to refresh: then again pursuing, leaving those who could not follow, hoping before night to ransack rich <hi>Tauris.</hi> The <hi>Persian</hi> Horsemen in ambush, set the while on the <hi>Turks</hi> Foot, thought to be secure, greatly slaughtering them, taking all <hi>Selimus</hi> his Treasure and Artillery. Which being by Posts made known to him about two at night, and that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was following him, he, wonderfully abashed, began to retire. The 10000 <hi>Persians</hi> now turning on the <hi>Turks,</hi> charged them hardly: who being enclosed before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, received a great overthrow; and losing their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, brake out sidewayes and fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> also fleeing, and passing <hi>Euphrates,</hi> brake down the Bridge, fearing further pursuit, and coming to <hi>Amasia</hi> with trouble and danger, assembled the reliques of his discomfited Army: such as could not follow in flight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all slain by the <hi>Persians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoway</hi> concludeth, that <hi>Hysmael</hi> did not more rejoyce hereat than himself, hoping now to free himself of thraldom, as he did. For, fleeing into <hi>Trapezond,</hi> he
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:130480-02:245"/>
thence had passage to <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> thence by Land to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica;</hi> thence transported into <hi>Chios,</hi> whence he returned to <hi>Genua,</hi> after ten years captivity, part as a page in <hi>Ba ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi>'s privy Chamber, the rest a Court-Souldier under <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus</hi>

                  <hi>Jonius</hi> compares these two great Princes together, <hi>Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> and <hi>Selimus,</hi> who for royal discent, strength of body, courage of mind, riches &amp; power, were equall, thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining like fame and renown; but in conditions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of minde, and Martial Discipline, much differing: for <hi>Hysmael</hi> was Majestical, <hi>Selimus</hi> tyrannical; <hi>Hysmael</hi> courteous, <hi>Selimus</hi> churlish in devotion and gravity: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffered he his Wives to come to Court, nor using their Company, but for procreation sake, and that, as was thought, without any great countenance; for he being more delighted with unnatural pleasure, thought a mans minde and body to be not a little weakned with the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Women: scoffing also many times at his Father <hi>Ba jazet,</hi> who, he said, was so drowned in the study of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verroes,</hi> determining nothing certainly of the souls nature, and the Heavens motions, that he desired rather the name of a sharp disputer, amongst the idle professors of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, than of a renowned Chiefetain, amongst his vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldiers.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassador finding him pleasant, asked him, Why he wore not his beard long as <hi>Ba jazet</hi> and others, to seem of greater Majesty; who answered, He liked not to carry such an unnecessary handful, whereby his Bassaes might at pleasure, lead him up and down the Court, as they did his Father; for <hi>Selimus</hi> followed no advice but his own, in what ever he undertook.</p>
               <p>The cause why <hi>Hysmael,</hi> out of so many large Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for he had under his Dominion, <hi>Armenia</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Sulthania, Persia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Media,</hi> and <hi>Parthia: Armenia</hi> being the chiefest which yields the <hi>Persian</hi> his best foot, <hi>Persia</hi> his choyce Horsemen, chiefly
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:130480-02:246"/>
from <hi>Scyras;</hi> next to them, from <hi>Assyria,</hi> whose chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon:</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Parthians</hi> being the best Archers next to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> brought now so small an Army against <hi>Selimus,</hi> was, because to win his peoples hearts, he had remitted a great part of his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Tributes; so that he wanting money, could not raise such an Army, as otherwise he might, out of those populous Countries, yielding plentifully all necessaries for mans use.</p>
               <p>But in 1515, <hi>Selimus</hi> wintring at <hi>Amasia,</hi> raised such a power in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> that at first of the Spring, he entred again into the <hi>Persian</hi> Confines with a greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that sooner than either that part of <hi>Armenia</hi>'s cold would suffer; or the enemy thought he could have done: who thought in any case to be Master of strong <hi>Ciamassum,</hi> standing on the first entrance into <hi>Armenia;</hi> thereby, as of some holds thereabouts, to open a fair way into his enemies Countrey. <hi>Hysmael</hi> being then gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rebellious <hi>Hyrcanians, Bactrians,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Selimus</hi> making a Bridge over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> laid hard siege to <hi>Ciamas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> before they were well aware, driving the Defendants from the Walls, with their Harquebusiers and Archers, and still bringing on fresh men; others then also breaking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Gates, and scaling the walls in divers places, the Defendants retired into the Market-place; where though spent and wounded, they resolutely fought it out to the last man. Having taken and ransacked the Town, with two small Castles, for fear abandoned, he thought good to enter no farther, till he had chased out <hi>Aladeules:</hi> who, fearing his own estate, hearing <hi>Selimus</hi> was come, soon raised a great Army for his defence, purposing to do as formerly. Wherefore <hi>Selimus</hi> leaving a Garrison at <hi>Cia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>massum,</hi> retired to <hi>Antitaurus,</hi> where his enemies were reported to lay. <hi>Aladeule</hi>'s people were fierce and warlike, who could profit little by Husbandry, yet bred Horses and Cammels in Pasture-bearing places; but most of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:130480-02:246"/>
their living stood in hunting and stealing. His chief City was <hi>Maras,</hi> which may be thought so called from the fair River <hi>Marsias,</hi> running thorow it out of the Mountain <hi>

                     </gap>;</hi> who seeing <hi>Selimus</hi> enter his frontiers, brought down about 15000 Horsemen into a large Valley, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his great store of Foot to keep the Mountains on the right and left, there advantagiously expecting his coming. <hi>Selimus</hi> considered the places disadvantage, yet presuming on his strength and multitude, commanded <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Generall of his <hi>European</hi> Horse, in stead of <hi>Casan,</hi> to charge the enemy afront, with a square battel, because of the places straightness, himself with the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Asian</hi> Horse, following after. <hi>Aladeule</hi>'s Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers also, fought valiantly in the head of the battel; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spent their Arrows, stood close, keeping the grounds advantage, so repulsing the <hi>Turks</hi> old Souldiers, that they seemed little or nought to prevail; for they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close them on either side, and the Foot grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Turks</hi> from the sides of the Hills, with darts and Arrows. <hi>Selimus</hi> seeing such strong resistance, contrary to expectation, sent some Harquebusiers to relieve their Fellows, and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> at that instant, to mount the Hill. The <hi>Aladeulians</hi> terrified with the shot, fled into the Mountains and Woods fast by; yet the most slaughter was of the Foot, who, the Horse being fled, and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> coming up the Hills, did with much difficulty by steep and broken wayes, clamber up the Mountains, as surprized with sudden fear: the <hi>Turks</hi> killed them to the going down of the Sun: the swift Horsemen retiring into fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and stronger places, with little losse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aladeules,</hi> thinking it now best to protract the Warre, as the <hi>Turks</hi> pursued him, burning the Cottages, he fled from Mountain to Mountain, not offering battel, but in advantagious places; wherefore <hi>Selimus</hi> fearing want of Victual, or intrapping, on the 7th day left off the pursuit: and himself conveniently encamping, sent <hi>Sinan,</hi> carrying Victuals with him, with all speed and policy to hunt after

the King himself. And the while inquiring of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, of <hi>Aladeules</hi> strength, &amp;c. found, he had taken with him his best Horse and Foot, commanding the people to forsake the Villages to leave all desolate; and intrenching himself on a strong Rock, with store of Provision, resolved not to give battel, till he had drawn them where their multitude should little avail, but to increase their Iosse: also they said, he feared to be betrayed by <hi>Alisbeg,</hi> General of his Horse, who first fled; for <hi>Aladeules</hi> had treacherously murdered his Father, upon a suspition of his aspiring the Kingdom. <hi>Selimus</hi> striking off their Irons, laded them with gifts and promises, and sent them to <hi>Alis,</hi> to perswade him in so fit a time, to revenge his Fathers death, which if he should perform by some notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, he should have both credit with him and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: these imparting the matter to <hi>Sinan,</hi> he soon wrought with <hi>Alis,</hi> pricked on with desire of a Kingdom and <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his rewards, that he went over to <hi>Sinan,</hi> with a great part of the best Horsemen; whereby the rest, for rewards, came all by degrees, over to the Bassa. <hi>Aladeules,</hi> thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly circumvented, reposed his hope in secret flight; but they pursuing him as he fled, hiding himself, at last drew him out of a Cave, betrayed by the Peasants: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Selimus,</hi> was in few dayes put to death, and his head in derision carried about afterwards thorow les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Asia,</hi> then sent to the <hi>Venetians</hi> as a witness of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. <hi>Selimus</hi> reduced all his Kingdom into a Province of 3 parts, to every part a <hi>Sanzack. Alisbeg</hi> to be chief o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rest, wanting nothing of a King, but the name only. And leaving <hi>Sinan</hi> there, commanded him, after he had set all things in good order, to winter in <hi>Iconium,</hi> himself, with a few, returning to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for he heard, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> had made incursions into <hi>Servia,</hi> and spoiled it. Wherefore least he should lose <hi>Samandria,</hi> reputed the Bulwark of <hi>Servia</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> he sent <hi>Jonuses,</hi> Bassa of <hi>Bosnia,</hi> with 8000 Horse into <hi>Croatia,</hi> as far as <hi>Catinum,</hi> transporting another Army over <hi>Dannbius,</hi> into <hi>Hungary,</hi>

that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> at once; doubly beset, might fear their estate: and to shew the World of what power the <hi>Othomur</hi> Emperors were, &amp;c. Having thus pressed the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> he at <hi>Hadrianople,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the following win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more prepared for Warre than ever, as being adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, with the <hi>Germ:</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Uladislaus</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Sigismund</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> had combined to war on him; but learning by his intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers sent into all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that their meetings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but great words and Banquets, he turned himself with all his preparations again toward the <hi>East,</hi> to the great qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of <hi>Christendom.</hi> Yet he strengthned his frontiers, with most strong Garisons, leaving his Son to <hi>Solyman</hi> at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus Bassa</hi> his Tutor, which was strange, a native <hi>Turk,</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> then he sent <hi>Cherseogles,</hi> whom he was most trusted, with his Army into <hi>Bythinia,</hi> making <hi>Zafferus</hi> an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> Admiral of his Navy lately built, and with wondrous charge rigged forth, and staying a little at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to see the young Souldiers then choosing <hi>Janizaries,</hi> he departed to his Army at <hi>Iconium,</hi> intending again to invade the <hi>Persian,</hi> Being come thither, he heard that <hi>Campson Gaurus, Sultan</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was come into <hi>Syria</hi> with a great Army, giving out, he wou'd ayd the <hi>Persian</hi> King his Confederate, entring into <hi>Cilicia</hi> with all Hostility, if <hi>Selimus</hi> proceeded to invade him: he, perplexed, and fearing if he should passe <hi>Euphrates, Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> should break in by Mount <hi>Amanus,</hi> and indanger that part of his Dominion, stayed at <hi>Iconium,</hi> sending the <hi>Cadalescher,</hi> who wrote the Commentaries of this Warre, and <hi>Jachis</hi> a great Captain, with great presents to pacifie him, if possible, not to hinder or disturb <hi>Selimus,</hi> from war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon <hi>Hysmael,</hi> who had so invaded his Dominions in <hi>Asia;</hi> and by a new form of superstition, had corrupted and altered the most sure grounds of <hi>Mahometanism:</hi> and if <hi>Campson</hi> would by no conditions be removed, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to learn his strength and designs, and speedily to return.</p>

                  <hi>Campson,</hi> though spent with age and living in worldly blisse; yet for sundry causes thought this expedition good and needful; for he hated <hi>Selimus</hi> for his cruelty, and would never renew the League with him made with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet;</hi> desiring also to represse and abate his insolency, grown by success, beyond reasons bounds, &amp;c. especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fearing the losse of <hi>Syria,</hi> and so of all his Kingdom: for <hi>Aegypt, Judea,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> intollerably oppressed with the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> were in danger to revolt, if the <hi>Persians</hi> should chance to be vanquished, with whom he h dmade a firm League: also moved with <hi>Aladin</hi>'s misery, he was perswaded, <hi>Selimus</hi> might by his and <hi>Hysmael</hi>'s forces be thrust out of all; for <hi>Aladin</hi> living three years in his Court, had by all means possible incited the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> to revenge.

               <p>The <hi>Mamalukes</hi> were scarce 12000, yet every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his place, had more servants well furnished.

But many of the middle sort, and far moe of the basest vulgar, having little or nought to lose, hoped to gain by others losses, and remembring their about three hundred years slavery under the proud Mamalukes, kept close, expecting the last event, secretly rejoycing, that their cruel Masters should now be justly punished; and the more, that the revenge should be by the hazard of others lives, with which, they hoped shortly to fill their eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tomombeius</hi> with much labour and care fortified all the gates and entrances of that great and ancient City (for it was not compassed with any walls) appointing to every street a Captain, in every publike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> encouraging the people, and omitting nothing that could be done or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised: making cheerful shew of greatest hope in so great a danger. The Mamalukes also, strivingly, according to every ones devise, caused great ditches, or Timber-logs to be cast along the streets, some setting up sharp Stakes in covert Trenches, that the enemy falling on them unawares, might be engaged; others furnished the windows and fronts of their Houses in the greatest streets, with Harquebusiers, and all (with many moe) with such speed, that none refused to put his hand to any labour. The broadest street came strait from the East gate to the Castle and middle of the City (the rest, were so narrow and crooked, that no great Artillery could be brought by them, or Souldiers enter without great danger): into this, especially, <hi>Tomombeius</hi> conveighed his chiefest strength, for the enemy must needs come in that way; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost part, where the Castle stood, was kept with
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:130480-02:258"/>
very great, strong and valiant Garrison: thence, on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to come for relief; for why, that greatest City, could not with his then so small power, be in every place sufficiently defended. <hi>Selimus</hi> certainly understanding hereof, drew nearer to the City with his Army, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, now a little to force themselves for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rewards due to their former labours and Victories, which he said, would be more and greater than they had imagined: telling them, there was but few good Souldiers left with the desolate Sultan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> making them believe, he was sent for by the Aegyptians, promising to assail the Mamalukes whose name they hated, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, out of their houses; yet saying, they were not to be accounted quite overcome, which lived in hope, with Weapons in their hands, possessed of the chief City; therefore to think, that in that day's fortune rested the good or bad estate of their lives, honour and fortunes: assuring them it would be but small labour to bring it to an end, if in that new kind of fight as in other Battels, they would but resolve to overcome.</p>
               <p>This speech enflamed the Souldiers, but hope of such prey, much more; So that <hi>Selimus</hi> entring by the gate, <hi>Bassuela</hi> thrust in his Horse at divers places at once, but brought in his Janizaries by the largest street. At first, Horsmen with Horsmen bloodily fought in the narrow streets, but the Foot discharging their Culverings and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons before them among the thickest enemies, cleared the street; but coming to the Bàracadoes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and to remove Timber-logs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by force, they fought with force and obstinacy on both parts, never in mans memory more cruel: for they were not ignorant, that 'twas as well as for their lives and Empire, as for honour. Here the Turks received great losse, for running on, the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most on the formost, they tumbled by heaps into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Trenches, and were impailed upon the sharp stakes. The women and children also throwing down stones,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:130480-02:258"/>
tyles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from house-tops and windows, upon them: they, as they could spie them, fetching them off with their Harquebusies, or breaking into their Houses and fighting with diverse successe; but most of the Aegyptians accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to either fortune, assailed sometimes the Turks, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Mamalukes, Many cruel encounters were at once, in divers places; for, crossing from street to street, they both happened on new enemies, and the Victors pursuing a-front, were by others following them slain downright. The lanes and streets so flowed with blood of the slain heaps; that the dust at first, very thick, was laid as with a plentiful showr, the ayr was darkned with smoak and arrows, and through clamour, noise of Armour, and Artillary, the earth seemed to tremble, and the houses to fall down.</p>
               <p>It thus continued two whole dayes and nights without ceasing, yet the Mamalukes few, and through such labour and watching, giving ground by degrees, retired further into the City. The third day beset with the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they so resolutely fought that the Turks retiring a great way, left some Field-pieces behind them: whereat, <hi>Selimus</hi> despairing commanded to fire the Houses, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for that <hi>Jonuses Bassa,</hi> was in his sight dangerously wounded by a stone out of a window. The Houses burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Egyptians cryed for mercy: the Turks fighting, but faintly expecting a retreat: but they had sudden news, that <hi>Mustapha</hi> on their side had forced the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to retire and flee; for he being by some directed to a broad street, where the Mamalukes had left their Horses ready that on the worst chance, they might retire, and so haste to their appointed Refuges, took them all away, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put to flight the weak Garrison of most part Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boies and Muletors.</p>
               <p>This accident, daunted the Mamalukes: who now, hardly beset, and in their own judgement overcome, fled, most with <hi>Tomombeius</hi> to <hi>Nile,</hi> where being transported
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:130480-02:259"/>
in boats, they fled into the Country <hi>Sigesta:</hi> others hiding in Egyptians Houses and loathsome corners of the City: 1500. of the better sort fled into <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Temple, long defending themselves, to yield on honourable conditions; at last, through thirst, wearinesse, and wounds, with the fury of the Ordnance, they yielded to their pleasure; part being slain in the porch, the rest, sent down the River to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be afterwards there murdered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> now, sent part of his Army, to quench the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire, proclaiming thorow the City, that all Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes yielding themselves within twelve hours, should have mercy, otherwise, no hope of life; proposing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Egyptians revealing them, but concealing them, to impail them, selling their wives and children, and to burn their Houses; whereupon, many Mamalukes came forth, and being cast into Irons, were soon after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously murdered, it being given out, they sought to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape: and many Egyptians not breaking their faith with the Mamalukes, their neighbours appeaching them, most constantly died for their friends.</p>
               <p>The insolent Turks ransacked all the City, drawing out, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

There (as if come from the main) the Turks bought their fruit greedily: which they having sold and now ready to depart; certain Turks, disliking the hard beginning of the Siege, earnestly requested to be taken with them into the maine; who with much ado (in shew) were entreated to take in 7 or 8, (whom they could master) bringing them prisoners to the <hi>Rhodes:</hi> Where being brought up by <hi>Preianes</hi> to the top a Tower, where they might descry all the Turks Camp, discovered unto him all he demanded: and confessing, that the Souldiers discontented with the Siege, were ready to mutiny, hardly to be commanded forth, saying, all was but lost labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore, if they were wise, they should in time depart: which appeared afterwards true, for <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> Bassa glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to please the Souldiers than to punish, wrote to <hi>Solyman:</hi> if he would have the Siege go forward, he should speedily come in person to the Camp, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be commanded.</p>

So pardoning all their former offences, he sware them all again to his obedience: all things being afterwards done with better success and more care.

               <p>The Turks planted also 40 great battering Pieces, 12 being Basilisks: (the Basilisk killing man and beast with his sight) with these they battered continually; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat far off, did little harm.

Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a more cruel fight than ever before, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Christians, for the Turks much shot; but in that extremity none regarded, either danger or life; it continued three hours: at length <hi>Mustapha,</hi> losing two thousand with three Noble men, whom <hi>Solyman</hi> specially favoured (the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beating them out of their Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) retired.

Notwithstanding, <hi>Villerius,</hi> making shew of greater courage than his present State required, after thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing most of the night, commanded every man to his charge, answering only, He would be careful of all their well-doing.

                  <hi>Solyman</hi> advertized of their treachery, and the Captains fidelity, in detestation, gave them all to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> to be slain; but offered <hi>Nadastus</hi>'s honourable entertainment, which he refusing, he courteously sent him away, holpen by King <hi>Johns</hi> commendation, though his Sister was married to <hi>Stephen Malat,</hi> his deadly enemy.

liberties, charging them to wish the Defendants in his name, to yield the City: which it was impossible for them long to defend against his mighty power, &amp;c. and to accept before too late, of safe departure with bag and baggage; for he was resolved not to depart before he had taken it. So he sent them away with three <hi>Hungarian</hi> Duckats a man. They being received into the City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the threatnings and proud speeches of the <hi>Turk,</hi> which they so disdamed, as to send him no answer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at he displeased, deridingly sent them word, if they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help, he would send them the 300 <hi>Bohemians</hi> taken in <hi>Altenburge</hi> Castle: who answered, they needed none from him, therefore, he might dispose of his prisoners, as he saw good: wherefore he began to batter the walls with such Ordnance as he brought with him: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not great, did not much harm, more than to beat down the battlements of Timber, hanging over the walls for small shot to play out of.</p>
               <p>His great Artillery was coming up <hi>Danubius;</hi> but <hi>Wolfgangus Hoder</hi> going out of <hi>Possonium,</hi> with certain small Vessels, set upon the <hi>Turks</hi> with such resolution, that slaying many of them, he sunk amongst other Vessels, those battering-pieces with the Boats that brought them; so losing a few men, he returned with Victory: the City hereby, being delivered of a great danger; yet another part of the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet, at the first coming up to <hi>Vienna,</hi> brake down all the Bridges, which joyned divers Islands together, made by <hi>Danubius;</hi> over which is the way from <hi>Austria,</hi> unto <hi>Vienna:</hi> and so kept the passage, that none by land or water could go in or out without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:130480-02:290"/>
and 8000 <hi>Turks</hi> slain or buried quick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Solyman,</hi> that they might not so perfectly discover his Mines, appointed his Army, divided into four parts, in order to give the Defendants a continual Alarum: whereby his works went forward with all possible speed: and one Mine was suddenly blown up, shaking and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing much of the wall nigh the Gate, leading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Carinthia:</hi> whereat, the <hi>Turks</hi> greatly shouting, pressed in on all sides by the ruines of the wall, charging the Defendants with shot and Arrowes very thick: who resolutely standing in the face of the breach, so received them with shot and push of Pike, that they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: whereupon, <hi>Solyman</hi> sent in new supplies; but these also receiving a great overthrow, retired without any sign of retreat.</p>
               <p>The ground nigh the Town lay covered, and the ditches filled with dead <hi>Turks.</hi> Ere long, the wall was blown up in two other places, by which breach not very great, they sought so desperately to enter, that they thrust one another upon the point of their enemies Weapons: who slew them without number, being mostly, without Armour, enforcing them again disorderly to retire, filling the breaches with their dead Carkasses.</p>
               <p>Three dayes after, another piece of the Wall, not farre from the first breach, was so suddenly overthrown, that for eagerness on both sides, throwing away Guns and Bowes, they came to handy-blowes in midst of the breach, the <hi>Turks</hi> with Scimitars, the <hi>Germanes</hi> with long Swords: as their Captains encouraged (them) with chearful perswasions; so the <hi>Turks</hi> Captains forced (them) forward with words and wounds: twas thought, a more fierce and deadly fight was never seen; for many <hi>Turks</hi> Horsemen, thrust in on foot amongst the rest, and fought most desperately. At the last, after three houres furious fight, the <hi>Turks</hi> seeing no hope, retired to their Camp, many of their best Captains and Souldiers lying dead by heaps.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="574" facs="tcp:130480-02:291"/>It were tedious to recount every assault in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; yet Lord <hi>Rogendorff</hi> is not to be forgotten, who one day sallyed out (with some Troops) upon many stragling Turks, with such violence, that overthrowing them at first on-set, and chasing them, scarce 140, of 5300 escaped: after which his name was terrible to the Turks. <hi>Solyman</hi> exceedingly grieved with his vain assaults, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to prove the utmost of his forces, and calling his chief Commanders, at first, sharply reproved them as of no courage, who had turned their backs in the breaches half won: wherefore (he counting it a great dishonour to forsake the siege) they should resolve next day as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, to take the City, or as cowards, to end their dayes. Next day, <hi>Octob.</hi> 15. they with all their sorces as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed the City, thrusting their men by heaps into the breaches, as if they would with very multitude, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verborn the Christians; being at handy blowes, the fight was most terrible, the Christians still repulsing them: whose Ordnance also fitly mounted, made such slaughter among the thickest of them, that they shrunk back, and chose rather to be slain of their own Captains, as some were, then to be rent in sunder by the murthering shot; so that the Captains, seeing no remedy, retired, leaving many thousands dead in the Town-ditches.</p>
               <p>Next day <hi>Solyman</hi> despairing, and fearing <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> their coming, winter also coming fast on, determined to raise the siege: to colour which disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he sent certain chief prisoners, richly appareld, and full of money, to tell them of the City, he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to besiege or take <hi>Vienna;</hi> but to revenge wrongs done him by <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and to fight with him for the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kingdom: whom, since he could not draw to <hi>Vienna,</hi> he would remove to seek for him: wherefore they should yield, promising not to enter their City, but to receive them all into his protection, reserving them their lives, goods and freedom: which they scornfully
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:130480-02:291"/>
refused, as proceeding of desperation. Next night, he slew all the prisoners in his Army: which pittiful out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, they heard into the City, not knowing what it should be, till, after his departure, they found men women and Children wallowed in their own blood. <hi>Solyman</hi> causing <hi>Abraham,</hi> to shew himself in order, as if to give a fresh assault, rose himself the while, with the rest, returningin such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Few or none of name, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants were lost; but of the country, above 60000 were thought to be slain and carried captive: all about <hi>Vienna</hi> being miserably spoiled. <hi>Solyman</hi> restored <hi>Buda</hi> to King <hi>John,</hi> who by writing, acknowledged himself his Vassall, to whom he joyned <hi>Grittus</hi> as his legat, to help him in providing for that Kingdoms defence.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Solyman</hi> lay at <hi>Buda,</hi> he was one day earnest with King <hi>John,</hi> to receive the Bishop of <hi>Strigonium</hi> and <hi>Perenus,</hi> who had taken part with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer favour, who shewing himself unwilling to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, said, their mutable mindes would never contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within the bounds of loyalty, but find occasion to commit some fowler treason: whereto, <hi>Solyman</hi> straining his voice a little as somewhat moved, replyed, <hi>Can any thing happen better to thee in this life, than for thy enemies by thy kindness to be accounted by all ungrateful, &amp;c.</hi> when as in thee the commendation of a courteous Prince shall for ever remain?

But such a sudden clamour was make by the Women and Children, and other fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people; that the Turks on the Walls, thinking the Town full of Souldiers, stood as men dismayed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Defendants began again to shew themselves, at whose sight they forsook the Wall, and could by no means be brought on again. The Town was then defended in all judgement, by Gods power, not mans strength: <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> exceedingly grieved to see so base a Town hold out so long, oft (in his rage) threatned to leave no signe thereof remaining: but <hi>Abraham</hi> Bassa waited a fit time when his choler was past; told him, it was not worth his name and greatness, to spend his time and Forces upon so smal a Town of no importance, by razing whereof he should get neither honour nor profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore 'twere more honourable to raise his Siege, and, calling the Governour, to give him the Town as of bounty, than to spend so many good men in winning it by force.

                  <hi>Josuphus,</hi> an old Captain of a 1000, being one, to whom <hi>Auria</hi> at <hi>Corone,</hi> gave a fair Suit, and Chain of Gold, freeing him without ransom, to provoke the <hi>Turks</hi> to the like.

               <p>The besiegers by Land, upon <hi>Auria</hi>'s approach, fled, <hi>Mendoza</hi> taking great store of Victual and Warlique provision, left behind them. So <hi>Auria</hi> furnishing the City with store of necessaries, committed its defence to <hi>Macicaus,</hi> and his mutinous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> comforting and exhorting the <hi>Greeks</hi> to patience, in the calamities of war, telling them, the Emperour next Spring, would free them from <hi>Turkish</hi> bondage, by warring in <hi>Peloponesus</hi> by Sea and Land. So embarking the old <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison, he came even braving the <hi>Turks</hi> Admiral before <hi>Modon;</hi> but seeing he could not be allured out, or assailed as he lay, he departed to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and so to <hi>Messana</hi> in <hi>Sicilie.</hi> Few dayes after which, <hi>Assambeg,</hi> waiting for <hi>Venetian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships from <hi>Syria,</hi> met with <hi>Canalis</hi> on <hi>Creet</hi> Coast, and fighting a cruel battel by night; of the Moors 13 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, 4 were sunk, 3 taken, the rest fleeing to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> having lost most of their rowers: 300 <hi>Janizaries</hi> going

               <p>In winter, they of <hi>Corone,</hi> beginning to want Victuals, chiefly Wine and flesh, the <hi>Turks</hi> having blocked up the City by Land, the Souldiers requested <hi>Macicaus,</hi> they not hoping for relief elsewhere, before <hi>April,</hi> to lead them forth to some service against the enemy; but <hi>Macićaus;</hi> mindful of his charge, sought by many reasons to disswade them, &amp;c. yet the matter was so urged by <hi>Touarres</hi> and <hi>Hermosilla,</hi> great Captains, and by a general importunity, that they yielded to their desire, protesting he did it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will.

               <p>So <hi>Macicaus</hi> charging <hi>Liscanius</hi> and <hi>Mendosius,</hi> not to suffer any to go out of the City, lest the enemy should know, set forward about 10 at night, towards <hi>Andrussa:</hi> &amp; resting all next day in a secret wooddy valley, they set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again at night, and came to <hi>Andrussa</hi> before day; in which Town, of no great strength, lay one <hi>Caranus</hi> with 3000 Foot, half <hi>Janizaries;</hi> and in the Suburbs, <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> with 1000 choise Horsemen. <hi>Macicaus</hi> went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Town to surprize it: <hi>Hermosilla</hi> the while, standing still with some <hi>Spaniards,</hi> over against the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, discovered them by their light matches, who awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <hi>Lascus</hi> was present, but ignorant of the murther: to whom <hi>Grittus</hi> said, <hi>Lascus,</hi> dost thou know this shaven pate: 'tis a great mans head; but of one very ambitious, rebellious, and proud: who replyed, though I loved him not, yet I thought it not so, whilest it stood on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, disallowing therein, the fact: whereupon, <hi>Grittus</hi>
                  <pb n="596" facs="tcp:130480-02:302"/>
began to repent it, saying, Though he was worthily slain, yet he had rather he had been taken. The Bishops friends, and almost all <hi>Transilvania</hi> rose in Arms to revenge his death, whom they loved and feared: 4000 Horse and Foot under <hi>Stephen Malat,</hi> being assembled in few dayes. <hi>Grittus</hi> perplexed, and doubting what to do, speedily got with his followers, to the strong Town <hi>Mege,</hi> till either the peoples rage were appeased, or he were relieved by King <hi>John,</hi> or the <hi>Sanzacks</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> frontiers. They of <hi>Mege</hi> seeing so many <hi>Turks</hi> with him, shut the Gates; yet by <hi>Docia</hi>'s and <hi>Batianus</hi>'s perswasion, they received him into the base Town, having retired with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance into the higher, commanding the lower. While <hi>Grittus</hi> was fortifying, and sending for ayd, the people with hideous noyse, approaching, attempted to scale the Walls and Rampiers: which they doing, with more fury than discretion, were easily repulsed, and many slain. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, by <hi>Malat</hi>'s direction, they encamped on every side of the Town, hoping, that unprovided of Victuals, they could not long hold out: <hi>Grittus</hi> the while, fell sick, and the rather, not hearing of any expected ayd; for <hi>John,</hi> glad in mind of the distress of his Kingdoms Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer, yet sent for fashions sake, some Troops: who not wholly ignorant thereof, purposed not to come timely for his good. The <hi>Sanzacks</hi> refused, envying his honour, to depart from their charge without <hi>Solymans</hi> own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: and <hi>Lascus,</hi> departing to procure some relief, did in this extremity, forsake him also. The Citizens in the upper Town, perceiving their Countreymens full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Turks</hi> difficulties, assailed them thence also. <hi>Grittus</hi> offered them a masse of money, to let him passe forward into <hi>Hungary;</hi> but they were not to be mooved from revenge, by Gold. At last, he sent rich Jewels to the Governour of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> to be ready to receive him with some Troops, when he sallied out of the Town. And sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying out at the time appointed, with his Commission in

his hand, missing the <hi>Moldavian,</hi> fell upon <hi>Schenden,</hi> the Bishops Kinsman, and <hi>Maylat,</hi> his familiar friend: who running on him with tumultuous speech, caught from his head his rich Cap, and took him, weak and not resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: all his followers, chiefly <hi>Turks,</hi> being slain or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. <hi>Grittus</hi> beset round, and examined in the Generals Tent, why he commanded the <hi>Vayuod</hi> to be slain? pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested he never commanded any such thing; but all the people cryed, that he should be sacrificed to the <hi>Vayuods</hi> Ghost: whereupon, <hi>Maylat</hi> delivering him to <hi>Schenden,</hi> his Head was presently struck off. The Nobles and the <hi>Vayuods</hi> Kinsmen, dipping some part of their Garments in his blood, the longer to keep in mind the revenge. This was the shameful end of <hi>Aloysius Grittus,</hi> a Christian, (who was in such credit with <hi>Solyman)</hi> while he climbed too fast up the ill-staved ladder of ambition.</p>
               <p>The Executioner, found about him, Jewels, valued at 40 Millions of Duckets: ere long, <hi>Lascus</hi> was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Buda</hi> by <hi>John,</hi> upon torture, concerning <hi>Grittus</hi>'s Commission and purposes, and in great danger of life; but by <hi>Sigismund</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi>'s intercession, he was freed, so fleeing to <hi>Sigismund</hi>'s Court. <hi>Docia</hi> was rent in pieces by the people.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Grittus</hi> came into <hi>Hungary, Solyman</hi> undertook two great expeditions at once: one by Land, against the <hi>Persians,</hi> the other against the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> by Sea, but we will first declare what his Lievtenants did against the <hi>Moors.

               <p>It was commonly reported, and justly feared that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barussa</hi> would the next Summer, with all his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Sicily, Italics</hi> Garnerie; and then attempt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> To represse which, and for safety of the Christian's Frontiers (much subject to the Rapines of Turkish Pirates) <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour whilst <hi>Solyman</hi> was busied yet in the <hi>Persian</hi> wars, resolved in person with a puissant Army to passe into <hi>Africk,</hi> and to dispossesse the Pirate of his new-got Kingdom of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> Wherefore he levying 8000 foot and 7000 Horse in <hi>Spain,</hi> came to <hi>Barcelona</hi> before expectation: Among many Nobles, there was chiefly <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> whose forwardnesse, with desire to revenge his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garcias</hi>'s death, slain by the <hi>Moors</hi> at <hi>Girapolis,</hi> made his Countrey-men hope he would prove a worthy Chieftain, as he did.</p>

                  <hi>Auria</hi> the while, alone knowing the Emperours full purpose, had with speed rigged up a great Fleet of Ships and Galleys very well furnished, joyning also 17 Galleys, and 3 Galleasses of his own, and embarquing therein the

Flower of <hi>Genna</hi> and <hi>Liguria</hi> (they cheerfully offering themselves) and coming to <hi>Barcelona:</hi> whither came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Lewis,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Brother (whose sister <hi>Charls</hi> had married) with 25 Caravels (ships used in their <hi>Indian</hi> Voyages) one being a huge Galleon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were 2000 <hi>Portugals,</hi> besides Marrinets: also 60 sayl of tall Ships out of the Low-countries, with a number of condemned men, spared to serve in the Galleys. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. sent 10 Galleys under <hi>Sursinus:</hi> and the Master of <hi>Malta</hi> sent his Fleet also. Then did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valus Vastius</hi> the Emperour's Land-General, take up 5000 new Souldiers in <hi>Italy,</hi> led by the Count of <hi>Sarne,</hi> and other famous Captains. The old Spanish Garrisons in <hi>Lombardie</hi> were there left under <hi>Leva,</hi> though the Emperour's best Commander, he not daring so well to trust the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swissers,</hi> who were so near that Countrey. Then also came old <hi>Eberstern</hi> to <hi>Vastius,</hi> with 8000 <hi>Germans,</hi> to <hi>Genua;</hi> divers serving volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily of their own charges. With these and the <hi>Italians, Vastius</hi> embarquing at <hi>Portus Veneris</hi> in <hi>Liguria,</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them patiently to endure the Sea, and to comfort themselves with the hope of Victory in <hi>Africa,</hi> &amp;c. So coming to <hi>Naples</hi> the Viceroy and divers Nobles had of their own charges built or furnished, some one Galley, some more, for that service, accounted sacred: both the old Souldiers and lusty youths of that Kingdom, won by <hi>Vastius</hi>'s courtesie, most cheerfully offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but some mutinous Souldiers found fault with their wages and (weary of the Sea) fearing dangers in so long a Voyage, perswaded the multitude to run away: the Authors of which mutiny, <hi>Vastius</hi> thrust into sacks, and cast into the sea, in their sight. So from <hi>Naples</hi> he came to <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Emperour also came from <hi>Barcelona</hi> to <hi>Mago</hi> port in <hi>Minorca</hi> Isle, thence to <hi>Caralis</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> whither <hi>Vastius</hi> was a little before come. <hi>Charls</hi> (ere long) passed with a Westerly wind

into the Port <hi>Utica</hi> or <hi>Farina</hi> in <hi>Africk:</hi> in entring whereof the Emperours Galley struck on the sand stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast (which troubled him the more, seeing his Father <hi>Philip</hi> was so like to be cast away on <hi>Englands</hi> coast, sayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Low countries into <hi>Spain)</hi> yet by <hi>Aurias</hi>'s direction, they quickly got off, to all their great joy; So departing from <hi>Utica,</hi> he doubled the Promontorie of <hi>Carthage,</hi> anchoring before <hi>Aquaria</hi> or the Water-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, so called of a Well beneath it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moors,</hi> who from Hills and Watch Towers had viewed the Fleet and its course, advertised <hi>Barbarussa,</hi> that the Christians were coming against him with an innumerable Fleet, for they were almost seven hundred sayl, 82 being great Galleys: but he was most troubled, hearing often, that the most mighty Christian Emperour was personally there with such a world of people, that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> seemed to be left bare of able men: which, certain <hi>Mahometans</hi> slaves, swimming ashoare in the night, reported; for the proud Turks, never thought the Emperour would have so adventnred, especially in an unknown, barren, and scorching Countrey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was confirmed by <hi>Prefenda</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> who was a prisoner (at large) in <hi>Tunis:</hi> of whom <hi>Barbarussa</hi>

               <p>Then forthwith casting about how to withstand his puissant enemy: he first of all calling to Council his Sea-Captains, in whom he most confided; shewed them that they as valiant men, and acquainted with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerns, were not to doubt of the Victory, since he saw it as good as already gotten; having before for the same reasons perswaded himself, that if <hi>Charls</hi> had not be in half mad, he would not have undertaken so desperate and
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:130480-02:312"/>
doubtful a Warre: and encouraging them in a short speech, most earnestly required this one thing, that they should most valiantly defend the strong Castle of <hi>Guletta,</hi> as the most assured defence both of the City &amp; the whole Kingdom, and especially their Navy, which lay there in safe harbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They all answered, they would most chearfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what ever he pleased to command; nor to do any thing unbeseeming most valiant men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guletta</hi> Castle stands in the bottom of <hi>Carthage-Bay,</hi> on a point of Land, where the Sea on the side by a narrow strait, runneth into <hi>Tunis</hi>-Lake; but now the Castle is parted on the West side also by the Sea, begun by <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russa,</hi> but perfected by others, commanding both sides: He now put into it strongly fortified, <hi>Sinan</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> a Jew, of greatest account, <hi>Haidinus</hi> for his fury surnamed <hi>Caccia Diabolo, Salec</hi> of <hi>Ionia, Tabacches</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and <hi>Giaffer</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> most expert and resolute Captains. The Emperour commanded his men to be landed with all speed, which was so done, that the <hi>Moores</hi> terrified with their cry, and not able to abide their shot, were beaten from shoare, suffering them to land quietly: first the <hi>Spanish,</hi> then the <hi>Italians,</hi> and last the <hi>Germanes</hi> whom <hi>Vastius</hi> caused presently to encamp, strictly charging none to straggle, till the Horse and Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were landed: the Emperour chearfully landing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>Vastius</hi> the while, sent out some to view the neer places, and se k out the Cisterns and Fountains of waters, once serving <hi>Carthage;</hi> with whom, the <hi>Moores</hi> (chiefly, the swift, subtile, and painful <hi>Numidian</hi> Horsemen) oft skirmished; and though but naked, yet on all advantages, furiously assailed them with Arrows and Darts unawares, and overloaded with Armour, sparing none that fell into their hands: two of whom, were <hi>Spinnula,</hi> a <hi>Ligurian</hi> Captain, and Noble <hi>Carectus,</hi> slain by <hi>Vastius</hi>'s side, as they viewed; notwithstanding, <hi>Charls</hi> himself would
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:130480-02:313"/>
needs with a small Troop, view the places, even in sight of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> every where pricking up and down, though he was often perswaded not to expose himself to endanger his person and the common safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vastius</hi> brought the Army nigh the Castle, casting up a rolling trench as he came to defend his men: which was done by all sorts, yea many Captains set to their hands; for the Emperour was a beholder, and chearful commender of labour and forwardness, and the busie enemy ever ready to take advantage, oft sallying out and defying them, even at their very Trenches. When all Commanders were to be appointed to their several charges, the Count of <hi>Sarne,</hi> requested <hi>Vastius</hi> to have the Mount neerest the Castle, a place of most danger, but of greatest honour: whereat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> much repined, he set up his rich Tent on the top of the Mount, in the enemie's sight, there laying with his <hi>Italians.</hi> Ere long, <hi>Salec</hi> with some Companies, salsied forth upon that Mount, as if he would have assailed it, raising a great Alarm; yet after Vollies of shot on both sides, he retired, as if constrained: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Count bitterly in rage, reproving some Captains not so forward to pursue them; ran furiously down, the rest for shame following him, slaying divers ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salec</hi> now turning about, said to his Souldiers, The wished advantage is now offered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore, shew your selves valiant, not letting one of these proud fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water Souldiers, escape alive or unwounded; which said, they making a stand, so hardly charged the <hi>Italians,</hi> that they fled. The Count fighting valiantly with his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was slain, with many others, and others slain in flight: the <hi>Turks</hi> entring so far into the Trenches, that they carried away the riches of the Count's Tent: No <hi>Spaniard</hi> once stirring out of their places to help the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians.</hi> His Head and right hand <hi>Salec</hi> sent to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russa.</hi>

                  <hi>Vastius</hi> comforted the grieved <hi>Italians,</hi> imputing that losse onely to the Count's rashness, for which he had worthily payd the price; but he sharply reproved the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as merciless men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> by often great shot, shewed joy for this Victory; but <hi>Tabacches,</hi> soon after, sallying out in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawning, got to the top of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Trenches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were aware, slaying some sleeping, some idly sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, others arming themselves: who with their sudden cry, made the rest which lay near, to flee out of their Trenches: where the <hi>Turks</hi> taking their trash, slaying and wounding many with <hi>Mendosa</hi> a Captain, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Sarmentus</hi>'s Ensign, on the top of the Trench. The Alarm caused the Emperour to come running in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, sharply reproving them who forsook the place, and greatly offended with those who kept such negligent watch, against such an enemy.</p>
               <p>This disgrace of the old <hi>Spaniards,</hi> well comforted the <hi>Italians:</hi> The tumult appeased, <hi>Vastius</hi> calling their chief Captains into his Tent, said, He was sory and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to say it, They who elsewhere alwayes valiant, were grown wholly out of order, and heartless, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> worthily laughing at their negligence, who yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day smiled at their unskilful forwardness. Wherefore he exhorted and straightly commanded them, speedily to prepare their Minds and Weapons for atchieving some new honour, &amp;c. They all answered, they would so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves, that he should not desire greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in men desirous of honour and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>'Twas not long, but <hi>Giaffer</hi> of exceeding courage and strength, issued forth with <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Moorish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers about noon, assailing the utmost Trenches, hoping in that broyling heat, to find them unprepared. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> then kept such negligent Watch, that they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their shot and Arrows on them, from the rampiers

top, before they were well aware; but the Drum stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up, some Harquebusiers brake out in two places at once, as <hi>Vastius</hi> had commanded, seconding them with Halbardiers, keeping his Squadrons to rescue his Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers, if they were forced to retire.</p>
               <p>The Skirmish was valiantly maintained on both sides, till <hi>Giaffer</hi> desperately fighting among the foremost <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi> was slain with two Bullets at once; for whole body, the <hi>Janizaries</hi> most cruelly fought, many being slain on both sides, upon the carcase: at length, being forced to flee, they were so fiercely followed, that they of <hi>Guletta,</hi> shut out almost a fourth part of their own men, lest the Christians should enter with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abila,</hi> an Ensign-bearer, advanced his Ensign to the top of a Rampier, and was slain; but his Ensign was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a Souldier. Upon their retreat, they lost most; for the <hi>Turks</hi> discharged their shot on them very fast, which they could not before for their own men. This abated the <hi>Turk</hi>'s pride, and gave hope, the Castle would be gained without great losse; perceiving being nigh it, 'twas not so strong as they supposed.</p>
               <p>The Emperour after few dayes, consulting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things, resolved without delay to assault it with all his forces, for many reasons, chiefly, for that his men began to grow sickly: scorched as it were, all the day, and almost starved with cold by night, and exceeding dewes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wetting them to the skin: neither was there good water, or fresh Victual to be had in that sandy and barren Soil, other than out of the Fleet; for the water was so unpleasant and brackish, that sick and whole were glad of a Crab to quench extream thirst; yet much relief was timely sent from <hi>Sicilie</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> the Bisket also chiefly in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gallies, was grown hoary and unwholsom: about <hi>July</hi> 15th, he began to place his battery defended with <hi>Gabions</hi> and Caske of Sand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurias</hi> divided his Gallies into three Squadrons, which
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:130480-02:314"/>
should by turns beat on the Castle, his great Ships at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor thundred from their fore-Castles with great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>Vastius</hi> divided <hi>Spaniards, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for assault. There was never strong place since Guns were invented, assailed with greater force, preparation, or industry. The Earth seeming not onely to quake, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by and by to swallow them up: the Sea beginning to rage and foam as in a great storm: the Air became thick and dark with smoak: from day-break till noon, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Culvering never ceased; so that the Vamures were beat down, the Castle saultable, and many <hi>Turkish</hi> Cannoniers and Cannons, buried in the Walls ruines: which being perceived, upon a Signal given, the Artillery ceasing, the breach was assailed, and the Walls scaled, and with such resolution, that the <hi>Turks</hi> having done what was possible, by casting down Darts, Wild-fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them climbing up, at length as despairing, fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinan</hi> and the other Captains fled forth at the further side by a Woodden Bridge, and so by Land to <hi>Tunis:</hi> which way most of his men followed him. The rest were slain or driven into the Lake, where they were slain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Land by Horsemen; or in swiming, shot by the Harquebusiers: the Lake being even covered with dead bodies.</p>
               <p>This Castle, with all its Warlike Provision, and all <hi>Barbarussa</hi>'s great Fleet, his and his Pyrates greatest grief, <hi>Charls</hi> gained with small losse. <hi>Barbarussa</hi> troubled and terrified, sternly and scornfully received <hi>Sinan</hi> and the rest, reviling and calling them faint-hearted Cowards, so soon giving over so strong a place. <hi>Sinan</hi> answered, when they were to withstand the Devil and his furies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ought not to seem strange, if they sought to escape. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they count it a disgrace, as men that minded again to fight: from which danger, if himself had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, he would have accounted it very good discretion to escape.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Hairadin</hi> now began more temperately to request eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them couragiously to stand fast to him, well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that the great supply of <hi>Moorish</hi> foot, and <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse at hand, once come, the enemy should not long joy in taking <hi>Guletta.</hi> Then he wholly indeavoured, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare things needful for Warre, bountifully bestowing his Treasures among the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Numidians,</hi> to confirm the well-affected, and to win the doubtful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muleasses</hi> the while, with a small retinue, came into the Emperour's Camp, he sitting royally in his Pavilion, who being admitted, with a Myter, and a green and blew silk Garment, he tall and manly, tawny (so squint-eyed, that he seemed to look spitefully) kissing <hi>Charls</hi> his hand, sat down with his legs close under him upon a Carpet, on the ground, after his Countries fashion, speaking unto him by an Interpreter, that he was come thither, not by any desert of his, their different Religion so requiring, yet, he verily thought, not but by the appointment of the most high God, whom both did with like devotion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to take revenge of the most perfidious, cruel Tyrant and Pyrate, whom he saw as good as vanquished, <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> and his Navy being taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would be the more to his comfort, hoping thereby to be restored by him, into his Fathers Kingdom, which he most humbly requested of his justice and honour: not refusing to pay him tribute, and to acknowledge himself his Vassal: of which the remembrance of so great a benefit never to be forgotten of him and his Posterity, was a most great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he abhorring the name of unthankful, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally finding how much his State and People might be assured to him, by his near Garrisons in <hi>Sicilie</hi> and <hi>Sardinia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour answered, he was come into <hi>Africk</hi> to revenge the injuries done oft, by <hi>Barbarussa</hi> upon his Frontiers, and to root out the most mischievous Pirates: which, by his Saviour's goodness, had taken such effect,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:130480-02:315"/>
that he doubted not soon to obtain a perfect Victory; and then he would grant him what should stand with the convenience of his affaires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so he would not falsifie his faith, which he might well suspect, if he specially trusted not, that such a benefit would alway remain in his heroical mind; being assured, that that power which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored him his Kingdom, could take it from him, if his unthankfulness deserved it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muleasses</hi> before the Emperour used a full gravity and grace in his Speech; but exceeding courteous to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and other Captains: riding up and down with them, and shewing himself a very good Horseman, and of great activity. He would also reason with learned men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Averroes,</hi> of the nature of things, the Heavens moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Starres power: he had a Tent appointed him, and honourable allowance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vastius</hi> courteously brought him, when desirous, into all places of the Camp, to see all things and orders there, demanding of him, whether that puissant Army brought to his great good, he judged sufficient to subdue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? <hi>Muleasses</hi> chiefly wondered at the number and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the great Ordnance; next, at the wondrous plenty of things, and the Souldiers quietness in buying them. Ere long they learned of him many things, well serving for their better proceeding: which things, orderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Emperour, confirmed his former hope of the desired Victory; so that carefully forecasting, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved forthwith to besiege <hi>Tunis.</hi> But whilest he was preparing, they daily skirmished with the <hi>Numidians:</hi> once like to come to a Battel; for the <hi>Moores</hi> planting Field-pieces among the Olive Gardens, shot continually into the Camp: wherefore the Emperour leaving enough to keep his Camp and Trenches, went forth with his Horsemen and the rest, sending <hi>Montegius</hi> General of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horsmen before, who were most, but raw Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. These skirmished a while with the enemy; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:130480-02:316"/>
themselves hardly charged, and <hi>Montegius</hi> greatly wounded, they fled in the Emperour's sight, to the men at Arms coming after them. The enemy at first, would des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately charge, then retire to avoid their enemies force, and by and by turn again with a fresh charge, the light Horsemen fleeing, <hi>Charls</hi> came on couragiously with his men at Arms, whereby they were put to flight, and their Field-pieces taken. Here the Emperour standing formost, gave the Signal, crying aloud, St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Patron. He rescued with his own hand <hi>Pontius</hi> of <hi>Granado,</hi> who, unhorsed and sore wounded, was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be slain. Also 30000 <hi>Moores</hi> came suddenly to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise a small Tower, on a Hill near <hi>Carthages</hi> ruines, wherein Souldiers were placed; for it was near the Camp. Before these went a <hi>Numidian</hi> Priest, bellowing out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Charms, and casting abroad scroles of paper, wherein he cursed the Christians: they brought those in the Tower with fire and smoak, to great extremity; but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour coming to their rescue, flew the Priest with others, and put the rest to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

then also, the <hi>Turks</hi> had fired the Magnificent Houses of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchants in every place; but in so great a publique danger, all was accounted lightly of, in respect of lives and liberty, since they might with new charge, be soon recovered. The two Governours fearing a long Siege, and not Victuals enough for such a multitude as were there, turned a number of weak people and Children out of the City; many, chiefly Children, dying in the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ditches, in their Mothers Arms, not daring to go further for fear of the enemy, who had fast by planted his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on Mounts against the City: onely S. <hi>Angelo</hi> Castle in midst of the Isle, about 15 miles from <hi>Corfu,</hi> being valiantly defended against assaults, saved above 3000, which fled thither; all being made desolate else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.

The Bassa in revenge, planted a battery against the City, soon opening the walls in divers places: then assaulting the breaches, took it, which he rifling, and burning to the ground, razed the walls, killing all the men, and giving the women to the lust of his men: whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the Children, he shipped away into servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: raging with much like cruelty on them of <hi>Paros,</hi> and Islands thereabouts: killing the old men, and such as resisted, thrusting the rest into his Gallies. And coming to <hi>Naxos,</hi> all the Island people fled into the City for fear: where he made havock of all in his way: sending a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger to the Duke, to yield himself and City to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s obedience: who in blunt termes said, If he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, yield to <hi>Solyman,</hi> he might save himself with what he had; but otherwise, he should never have the like offer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there was present a most mighty Fleet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To be warned by them of <hi>Aegina, Paros,</hi> and other Neighbour Princes: That his hap was good, if he were not misadvised, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Solyman</hi> to entangle the <hi>Venetians</hi> in divers places at once, commanded his Lieutenants, bordering on their Seigniory, to vex them with all hostility. In <hi>Peloponesus, Cassumes</hi> besieged <hi>Mauplium</hi> and <hi>Epidaurus.</hi>

of <hi>Mohathz,</hi> the Turks kept <hi>Possega</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> to themselves, having thereby, a fit passage from <hi>Belgrade,</hi> further into <hi>Hungary:</hi> The Rivers <hi>Savus</hi> and <hi>Dravus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing this rich plentiful and populous Country on both sides.

Yet was there then a certain League betwixt <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> which notwithstanding, did bear with taking of booty, and light skirmishes, without a great power or Field-pieces: which <hi>Matthias</hi> and his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had long used with the Turks, doing a like harm with their nimble light Horse; but the <hi>Germanes,</hi> now serving upon great Horses, with heavy Armour, received great hurt by those light skirmishes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not well brooking these injuries, and finding his League with <hi>Solyman,</hi> at his going into <hi>Persia,</hi> to be hurtful to him, determined to take up Arms, that if he could drive the Turks out of <hi>Possega,</hi> then to go to <hi>Buda</hi> against <hi>John.</hi> There were some, who wished him not rashly to take up Arms against so mighty an enemy: fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that <hi>Solyman,</hi> so provoked, would do as he had of late done against the <hi>Venetians</hi> upon a light occasion; but all <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Subjects were so earnest therein, that they said, they would never bear Arms more against the Turks, if he omitted that occasion; for they of <hi>Carinthia, Stiria, Croatia</hi> and <hi>Noricum,</hi> receiving great harms, thought they might easily be expulsed from <hi>Possega,</hi> since <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metes</hi>

               <p>So <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with the exceeding joy of his Subjects, very soon raised a good Army, yet supposed more strong than numerous most being select men: they were 8000 Horse, &amp; 16000 Foot, with store of all sorts of Artillery: <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> (as one of great experience, and famous for the defence of <hi>Vienna) Ferdinand</hi> made his General; for he (advised by his best friends) never adventured his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in any battel, chiefly against the Turks, by whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christian Kings had been formerly vanquished and slain.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>The young Souldiers having no proof of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s manner of fight, thought two dayes staying a long delay of so ready a Victory: wherefore the Army was muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and 10000 Horsemen found (for divers Germane Troops were come to the Camp): a more gallant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany seldom seen, so suddenly raised; but the Foot were scarce 8000, many being sick, and others weary, who lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gringly stole away: and generally those left, moyled with dirt, wet with rain, almost starved with cold, and pinched with hunger, were thought scarce able to endure the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Warre.

Which <hi>Mahometes</hi> perceiving, sent forth a 1000 light Horsemen, and some Companies of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> to trouble them, suddenly charging the reare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> (the first quickly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the other hardly endured the charge;) but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by men at Arms, they put the Turks to flight: so the Army with small losse, came to the place desired: where, after placing all things in order for the siege, they offered the enemy battel; But he, reported not above 16000 strong, kept within the Town, shooting at them with his Ordnance: they also, with two great Pieces on the Hill, shot thorow both Walls and Bulwark, to the Defendants great terrour. Having stood almost all day vainly expecting their coming forth to fight, returned at night into their Camp; for <hi>Mahometes,</hi> kept in his earnest Souldiers, knowing the Christians want of Victual: the fugitives reporting also, that <hi>Solyman</hi> charged him upon pain of a most shameful death, to defend it to the last.</p>
               <p>The Christians, in few dayes, began to feel a general want: neither saw they plainly how to be relieved, so that they began to fear some general mischief. <hi>Baltazar Pamphilus,</hi> a Noble <hi>Hungarian,</hi> sitting in Counsel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised them for relief of the Army, presently to remove to <hi>Hermande</hi> Castle, about ten miles from <hi>Exek,</hi> with whose provision (not like to be small) they might refresh their whole Army, and so proceed further, as occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Fast by the Castle, was a prety little walled Town, without flankers, easily (he said) with the Castle, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:130480-02:326"/>
who was sent with some Companies thither: which at his first coming, was surrendred to him, but no such store of Victual as he hoped for therein; yet were there some Vessels of Wine, to the great relief of the weak men: Hereupon, the Camp removed from <hi>Exek,</hi> about 10 at night; but very disorderly: yet the Turks stirred not out, misdoubting some deceit. The Army being come, the Victual was equally divided, and next morning, battery laid against the Castle: which, but 20 Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended half a day, then yielding on composition; but there was found in it, but two Barrels of meal, and two of Millet. Then the very Captains hung their heads, as struck with fear, who found nought but a few Women and Children there, and scarce Victual enough in Town and Castle to serve two dayes; yet they fed the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with better hope, after the Bridge over <hi>Bodrog</hi> running by the Town, was repaired: which the Turks had broken: so, Carpenters, and every man helping, it was in 3 dayes repaired. Next day, the Bridge overcharged with the wondrous weight of the 7th Battering-piece, began to break; so that they brake it, carrying it away by pieces. All things being passed over, the Bridge was again broken, that the enemy should not pursue them, that (much the nearest) way. <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> himself, upon debate, thought the great Ordnance were best be broken, promising to new cast them of his own charge. As for scaling-ladders, &amp;c. they burnt them; but most thought it not best to break those goodly Pieces; but to march on thorow <hi>Possega</hi> to <hi>Juvancha,</hi> which Town with <hi>Gara</hi> Castle, fast by, stored with provision, they said, would easily be taken before the Turks could come so far about the Lake: and a great shame it were, to return doing nothing. <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> with great toil, came by night to <hi>Juvancha,</hi> but 3 miles off: where the Turks with exceeding speed, at the same time arrived. The Turks fleeing out of a small Town nigh the Castle, the Christians received in the Souldiers, who
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:130480-02:327"/>
so filled themselves with Wine, that they were hardly driven out to the Camp: which Town, the Turks that night burnt, with what the Christians had there left; and in the dawning of the day, began hotly to skirmish with the Christians, especially in the <hi>Bohemians</hi> quarter: whom, <hi>Rascinius</hi> (grieved) with a Troop of his best Horse, forced to flee; but they soon returning, and being relieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and slew many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rascinius</hi> with his followers, being slain, <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> purposing to retire home, placed 4 ranks of Waggons on each side for defence, the weak and sick in the <hi>Vangard;</hi> yet in the front were some lusty Companies, but in the rear the greatest strength. They met oft with wooddy Hills hindring their way; yet the Turks could not so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently assail them thereby: wherefore <hi>Mahometes</hi> sent <hi>Janizaries</hi> and nimble Footmen before, (knowing well the passages) with some small Pieces to take the Straits, and to gall them in their passage: and when they could keep a place no longer, to flee back to another: and in the open places, were light Horsemen busie with them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they received much harm: which grieved them the more, for that the Turks were but in stragling Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. At a strait bigger than the rest, <hi>Bachitius</hi> a <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Captain (in whom they generally reposed their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test trust) was slain with a Faulcon-shot, with divers vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Hungarians:</hi> who seeing there more than in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thought to do some good service on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bachitius</hi>'s death, brought a fear on the whole Army; yet in revenge, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> did so repulse them, that losing many men, they ran away, leaving their small Pieces behind them; but the nimble Turks, with shot out of the Woods, stayed the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horse from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, recovering their Pieces, before the Christian Foot could carry them away; so still troubling them as before: who thus beset, and almost spent for want, did generally fear some extream calamity: and the more, hearing that
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:130480-02:327"/>
                  <hi>Mahometes</hi> expected supplies from <hi>Belgrade, Samandria</hi> and <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> and many <hi>Hungarian</hi> light Horsemen, stealing away from them: neither saw they any comfort now, in their dismayd Captains; but being come into a fair Field near the Town <hi>Gara,</hi> they heard, the Enemy had in the Woods before them, cut down great Trees acrosse the wayes, so that neither their Ordnance, Wagons, or Horse, could passe without breaking their order. This fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with despair; and the more, for that, <hi>Moreus</hi> and others, said, there was but two wayes to escape: one through those Woods to <hi>Walpo,</hi> about 10 miles: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards <hi>Zenthner-Zebeth</hi> Castle, in <hi>Moreus</hi> his Countrey, some miles from <hi>Gara,</hi> by taking whereof, the enemy (through the straitness of the passag) must needs give over his pursuit; yet it was resolved in Councel, to take the way through the Woods, there being in the Castle Victual enough, and money from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to pay the Souldiers for all that winter. So leaving the great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance behind, and burning the Powder, with what could not well be carried, upon the sound of a Hoboy to set forward. Many much disliked this resolution: saying, (amongst other things) that to run away, would be a dishonour to the Captains, and also dangerous to them, who respected nothing but life: wherefore they thought better to fight a Battel with them, and not believe the false reports of new supplies come unto them, and that God would undoubtedly ayd them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this, they consulted and determined, that the sick and wounded should be carried on the Wagon and Cart-horses, (before carried in the Wagons or amongst other baggage) and that such as could not stay themselves should be holden by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers riding behind them. Those who were so desirous to go, said, This their departure was not a shameful flight, but a right honest &amp; necessary manner of retiring, seeing they were stronger than their enemies in Horse, and equall (if not stronger) in foot, though they were sore weakened
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:130480-02:328"/>
with sickness. Every Captain the while, not regarding shame, bethought how to betake himself to flight, the uncertain hope of desired life. <hi>Mahometes</hi> using most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain spies, did by most diligent watch, and Troops of Horse, (besetting all passages) most vigilantly attend their motion, having shut them up as in a toil. It was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most midnight, and the Army expecting the sign of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward, many great Captains upon a cowardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, departed before the rest without leave. The <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Horsemen are reported to begin it, who knowing the wayes, made haste to <hi>Walpo. Moreus</hi> going the other way to his Castle, after whom followed in great hast, <hi>Hugonot</hi> with his <hi>Stirian</hi> Horsemen: the Bishop fled also, known by his great Lanthorn, wandring in the Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> hearing hereof, and that all the rest were upon fleeing, presently got to Horse, forgetting the Signal, thinking (as he said afterwards) they were all gone before; and unarmed, fled, leaving rich furnished Tents behind for hast. In this tumult, famous <hi>Lodronius,</hi> was called up, and told by his Servants, that the General was fled: who answered, without doubt not so, that I should be so perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously betrayed of him; and so as megered with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labour, laid down again to sleep. <hi>Mahometes</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the stir in the Camp, rose to assail his enemies; yet for better assurance of the enemies action, he stayed for day-light in order of battel, his men very silently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the sign of setting forward: which was by the soft sound of a Horsemans Drum, passing through each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The day appearing, <hi>Lodronius</hi> awaking, heard a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused noyse of the Turks; and being forsaken by most of the Horsemen, complained, he was betrayed; yet as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing discouraged, he cheared up the Footmen, exhorting them to remember their former valour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> himself who had been their happy General in many battels, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved (by repulsing the enemy) to bring them into a safe place, or valiantly fighting with them, to end his dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="645" facs="tcp:130480-02:328"/>The <hi>Carinthian, Saxonian, Austrian,</hi> and <hi>Bohemian</hi> Horse, came the while, to <hi>Lodronius,</hi> beseeching him, to take on him their treacherous General's place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who modestly protested himself unworthy thereof; yet as a man of courage, and moved with the Armies hard estate: he solemnly promised to execute the place in best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he could. It's reported, as <hi>Lodronius</hi> was inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to his foot) against shameful flight, an old <hi>German</hi> said, <hi>Worthy Lodronius, thou canst never be thought to flee shamefully, with a Horse of such a price under thee:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he alighting, hoxed his Horse, saying aloud, <hi>That, that day, they should have him fighting on foot, as one of themselves: See</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye deceive me not,</hi> &amp;c. All his other Horses, he gave away to sick and wounded Souldiers he best knew. The first Troops and Bands were scarce out of the Camp, but the <hi>Turks</hi> with a hideous cry assayled them on every side: the Christian Horsmen repulsing the proud enemy, still busie with them. In these skirmishes as they marched, <hi>Fuchstat</hi> General of the <hi>Carinthians</hi> was slain, supposed for his brave Armor to have been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the field: 24 Horsmen of great name being slain also (and their Guidon taken) 3 being Noble men. In another place was a most cruel skirmish with the <hi>Saxon</hi> Horsmen, and those who followed their Ensignes: above 36 worthy Captains, Lievtenants or Antients being slain: and <hi>Chuenricus</hi> a principal Captain taken, who died af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in bonds: Likewise the <hi>Austrian</hi> Horse, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously resisting a while, were overthrown: 2 Noble men being slain with others of great place and reputation: But the greatest slaughter was of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> by the breaking in of old Garrison Troops with their Scimitars and iron Mazes. The Foot being sore gauled by <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and Archers of the <hi>Asapi</hi> (discharging on them in their march from a Woody Bank) were on tother side so charged by <hi>Amurathes,</hi> troops of <hi>Bosna,</hi> that they were at last broken, and slain without mercy. <hi>Lodronius</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:130480-02:329"/>
into a marsh, where, after sore wounding, and almost fast in the mud, having done his utmost, by the <hi>Turks</hi> fair intreaty, yielded himself, with 3 Companies, and were all saved; for now the <hi>Turks</hi> seeking after spoyl, hunted after them who dispersedly fled, taking and leading away a great number for slaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahometes</hi> having thus obtained so great a Victory, almost without the bloud of his Souldiers, and taking the spoyl, pitched his Tents in a little Medow cleansed of dead bodies: and after feasting with his Captains, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the chief prisoners, spoyls, and Ensignes to be brought; and commending the Captains that had done any good service, He rewarded the Souldiers, some with Gold, some Silver, as they deserved; and diligently view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all prisoners, not common Souldiers, He caused every ones name and Office to be enrolled: giving one reward or other to such as brought in the Heads, Ears, or Hands of Christians with Rings upon them. <hi>Lodronius,</hi> being for his deadly wounds thought unable to endure travel, was slain by his keepers, and his Head sent afterward to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for many (who were afterwards ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) have reported, that amongst the Prisoners, fair En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, guilt Armour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> presented to <hi>Solyman; Bachiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Macer,</hi> and <hi>Lodronius</hi> their Heads were seen &amp; known, in a silver Bason: which after he had looked asquint upon, he sternly commanded all the prisoners to be slain: but the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> interceding for them as valiant, and to whom they had given their Faith, and might do him good service, he saved many of them; but <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> fleeing to his own Castle, was of all men accused, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly railed upon; so that it was reported, he durst nor shew his face for shame: Infamous Libels being sung in the Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> of him and the other runaway Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: Whereat he was so grieved, that he requested <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> safely to come to Court, to answer what could be laid against him; the King receiving him there with
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:130480-02:329"/>
doubtful countenance. Bnt his hearing being somewhat protracted, and he the while (half doubtful whether to be quitted or condemned) kept in safe custody; feigning himself sick, by degrees brake thorow a brick Pavement under his bed, with his knife, and by his sheetes escaped, Post-Horses being ready without the Castle. Not long after, he fled to the <hi>Turks: Mahometes</hi> gladly received him and promising him the Government of <hi>Croatia,</hi> as a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butarie King, if he would faithfully serve <hi>Solyman,</hi> and help him subdue the Cities of <hi>Austria:</hi> after this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his more credit, he dealt with <hi>Sirenus</hi> a <hi>Croatian</hi> Noble; and his supposed dear Friend, to revolt with him, assuring him of <hi>Solymans</hi> kind dealing with them: who promised to go over with him to the <hi>Turk,</hi> with a troop of his best and most trusty Horsmen, but changing his purpose, after he had well feasted <hi>Cazzianzer</hi> at his House, he caused him to be slain, sending his Head to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand:</hi> of whom he received in reward, his Castle, with all his substance.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Venetians</hi> provoked, resolved without delay to War upon the <hi>Turk</hi> also, being anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Emperour and Pope <hi>Pauls</hi> who lately warned, thought it more safe to keep the <hi>Turks</hi> busied farther off, than to suffer them to be too much acquainted with the Ports of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Cicilia:</hi> Wherefore, their Embassadors consulting all the following Winter; at last agreed (at <hi>Rome)</hi> the Emperour to set forth 82 Galleys, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> as many, and the Pope 36; in all 200. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were to lend the Pope as many rigged Galleys as he would furnish with men: and the Emperour and State of <hi>Genna</hi> to find shipping, to transport the Land Forces and Victual. <hi>Auria</hi> was <hi>Charls</hi> his General: <hi>Grimmanus</hi> a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> the Popes: <hi>Capellus</hi> for the <hi>Venetians:</hi> to whom was joyned, <hi>Justinianus,</hi> a chief Senatour very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in Sea-matters. <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Sicily</hi> was to command the Land-Forces: and what ever was gotten

from the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> the Islands or <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> was to be the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had been so injured by them. <hi>Charls</hi> also promising the Confederates, to have what wheat they would out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> for reasonable price, and without Custom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> understanding this, commanded <hi>Barbarussa</hi> to make ready his Fleet, and do all harm he could to the <hi>Venetian</hi>'s Islands: who with 130 Warlike Galleys with the first of the Spring (in 1538) departed to <hi>Creete,</hi> where he unadvisedly landed most of his men, to surprize the City <hi>Canea.</hi> For <hi>Grittus</hi> with a strong Garrison, so vexed the <hi>Turks</hi> with great and small shot, and the sallying out of two <hi>Italian</hi> Companies, that he (having lost many) retired in such haste, that he left a 1000 <hi>Turks</hi> behind him, gone after booty; who were all slain by them of <hi>Creet.</hi> Then attempting divers other places, he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably repulsed, with the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> not daring to meddle; but sayling almost round, took little <hi>Sicilia</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken by the Inhabitants, which he firing, departed from <hi>Creet:</hi> for he heard, that <hi>Capellus,</hi> (come to <hi>Corcyra)</hi> would soon come to relieve it. <hi>Auria,</hi> came to <hi>Corcyra</hi> also, joyning with <hi>Capellus. Barbarussa</hi> then lay in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> expecting the Christians entrance of its Strait, that he might sink them, with his Ordnance pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on both sides; for <hi>Grimmanus</hi> had (a little before) begun to besiege <hi>Prevesa</hi> upon the <hi>Promontorie</hi> of <hi>Actium,</hi> fast by that strait, so battering the Castle, that had not the <hi>Turks</hi> from <hi>Aetolia</hi> come to relieve it with a strong power he had probably taken it; wherefore, the Patriarch, returned to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> having well viewed the Straits of that <hi>Bay,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet at Anchor therein: upon whose Relation, the great Commanders consulted what course best to take, for their better proceeding: <hi>Gonzaga</hi> was of opinion, <hi>Prevesa</hi>'s Castle was with all their Force to be assaulted, which taken, all passages might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be taken from the enemies Fleet in the <hi>Bay,</hi> by sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </hi> Counsel was in shew glorious; but most dangerous to execute, both for the peril of landing Souldiers and Ordnance: it being to be thought, the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolian</hi> Horse, would (as before) speedily come for relief, whose force their Foot could scarce abide. And if the Fleet (<hi>Autumn</hi> approaching) should by force of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forsake that coast: whence should the Landed men get any Victual in the enemie's Country? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he thought best, if the enemy could not be drawn out to Battel, to go into <hi>Naupactum</hi>-<hi>Bay,</hi> taking that Town, not greatly fortified, so to ransack all Towns to the bottom of <hi>Corynth Bay,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Fleet said, might easily be done; whereby it might happen, that <hi>Barbarussa,</hi> would for shame come out and joyn Battel.

In the close of the evening, <hi>Salec</hi> took 2 Galleys stragling behind: After which, was taken the ship of <hi>Figaroa</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> (though his men fought most valiantly for a time) whose son taken with him (beautified with nature's gifts) was afterwards presented to <hi>Solyman,</hi> turning <hi>Turk,</hi> and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in credit, obtaining his Fathers liberty after 3 years miserable imprisonment, sending him home well rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Whilst both Fleets lay expecting their most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, a great tempest os Thunder, Lightning &amp; Rain, with a fresh Easterly gale, arose. The Christians seeing the <hi>Turks</hi> hoysing up their small sayls, hoysed up both small and great, sparing no Oar, to clear themselves of the enemy, and that disorderly and in great haste: So that <hi>Auria,</hi> (called a second <hi>Neptune)</hi> was that day accounted no Captain. <hi>Barbarussa</hi> is reported, to have pursued them a while, till through the night's darkness, he stayed his course; for the Admirals had put out their Lights in the poupes: whereat he laughing, said oft in <hi>Spanish, Auria hath therefore put out his Light, The better in the dark to hide his flight.</hi> Being come to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> they generally thought, by that sudden storm, they had avoided a great danger. The Emperials (to excuse <hi>Auria)</hi> imputed it to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> who would never take any <hi>Spaniards</hi> into their Galleys: wherefore <hi>Auria</hi> doubting of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained battel: and the rather, because they had hoysed their sayls tyed to their Yards with lines: which they cutting, might flye which way they would. Shortly after, came <hi>Barbarussa</hi> to the Isle <hi>Naxus,</hi> about 4 leagues from <hi>Corcyra</hi> Eastward braving the Christians: <hi>Gonzaga</hi> grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, requested the 3 great Commanders, for the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Honour, to represse their insolence; at last (the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>

taking in some <hi>Spanish</hi> Companies) they were to give battel in 4 squadrons; but it was so long protracted, that <hi>Barbarussa</hi> fearing Tempests, returned about <hi>Octob.</hi> 7. into the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Ambracia:</hi> After which, the Generals went to befiege <hi>Newcastle,</hi> a strong Turkish Town in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Sinus Rizonicus:</hi> the people were <hi>Dalmatians; Epirots</hi> who had renounced their Religion, and some <hi>Turks:</hi> which they soon won, with a great prey, and a number of captives: and 3 dayes after the Castle was also yielded, the <hi>Turks</hi> covenanting in vain to depart with life and liberty.</p>
               <p>This Town (for all the Covenants of the League) was reserved for the Emperour: and <hi>Sarmentus</hi> with 4000 old <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldlers left in Garrison: <hi>Capellus</hi> urging in vain the <hi>Venetians</hi> right: Wherefore the grieved Senate (now assured of an ill neighbour to their Town <hi>Castrum)</hi> decreed to sue to <hi>Solyman</hi> for peace: which they easily obtained a little while, by <hi>Grittus</hi> their Duke's son, and <hi>Ryncus</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour, who told the <hi>Bassaes,</hi> that the <hi>Venetians</hi> League with <hi>Charls,</hi> was made without most of the Senates consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barbarussa</hi> putting to sea to relieve <hi>Newcastle,</hi> many of his Galleys were by a Tempest, cast away on the <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceraunian</hi> Rocks: 20000 men being reported to be lost. <hi>Capellus</hi> would have perswaded <hi>Auria</hi> to pursue <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russa</hi> so distressed: which, <hi>Gonzaga</hi> well liked, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the former disgrace; but <hi>Auria</hi> not liking the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, presently hoysed sayl for <hi>Italy,</hi> leaving <hi>Capellus</hi> in such a rage, that he detested himself for submitting to another man, wishing the Captains present, never to be subject to a'stranger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Auria</hi> referring all he said, and did, to the Emperour's profit, so far, that <hi>Ursinus</hi> (then serving the <hi>Venetian)</hi> merrily said, <hi>Auria had done nothing, but politiquly to set the</hi> Venetians <hi>and</hi> Turks <hi>together by the ears: opening a gate for a long War,</hi> &amp;c. without his losing one Galley; for many thought that would sort

to <hi>Charls</hi>'s great good: when the <hi>Venetians,</hi> spent with long and chargable wars, should be stripped by force, or wrung by necessity, from Lands and Territories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> grieved, determined to besiege <hi>Newcastle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by sea and land, caufing also <hi>Nauplium</hi> and <hi>Epidaurus</hi> in <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> (<hi>Venetian.</hi> Cities) to be besieged; yet he took singular pleasure, that <hi>Barbarussa</hi> (the worst fu. ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed) had driven the great Christian Fleet out of the sea. Wherefore at Spring, 1539. <hi>Barbarussa</hi> repaired his Fleet, notably furnishing it, and manning his Galleys most with select Souldiers; and, Summer well come on, He came to <hi>Rizonicus Bay;</hi> when <hi>Ulames</hi> Governour of <hi>Bosna,</hi> appeared with his Forces on the Mountains, as he had in charge. <hi>Barbarussa</hi> sent before him <hi>Dragut</hi> and <hi>Corsetus</hi> with 30 Galliots who landing their men at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronovum</hi> or <hi>Newcastle,</hi> were encountred by <hi>Sarmentus,</hi> and forced to their Galliots, many being slain and taken: After which, came <hi>Barbarussa</hi> with 60 Galleys, and 3 tall ships, which carried all warlike provisions: spending 3 dayes in landing his Ordnance, and casting up Trenches, done but by night, for the Town-shot, which slew in that space about 1000 <hi>Turks: Agis Hariadexus,</hi> as it were a King at <hi>Taiorea</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> being one, to <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russas</hi>'s great grief: who gave a fourth part of his 54 bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering pieces to <hi>Ulames</hi> on the North side, himself bat er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the East side in 3 places; and <hi>Salec</hi> from sea battering another part. <hi>Sarmentus</hi> thus assayled, did what he could to repair the breaches: the <hi>Turks</hi> the while taking a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whence (having displayed their Ensignes) they sore troubled the <hi>Spaniards: Ulames</hi> also had made a breach, and was ready to enter. Whereupon <hi>Sarmentus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the hurt Souldiers to get into the Castle below, and the rest with him to take the Market-place: where the <hi>Turks</hi> (breaking in) made a most bloudy fight: the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being almost every man slain. <hi>Sarmentus</hi> (wounded in the face with 3 arrows, and wearied) seeing <hi>Fria</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:130480-02:333"/>
ready to flee, sharply reproving him, caught him by the hand, making him tarry, till, both slain, many valiant Captains were there lost. <hi>Arius</hi> with the wounded Soldiers in the Castle, now yielded: whose lives <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russa</hi> (as he promised) spared, but carried them into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and desirous to send <hi>Sarmentus</hi>'s Head to <hi>Solyman,</hi> he offered money and liberty for his body, but it could not be known among so many dead heaps. <hi>Barbarussa</hi> proud of this Victory, wrote threats to <hi>Bembus</hi> a <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Senatour, Governour of <hi>Cattarus</hi> in the bottom of that <hi>Bay,</hi> to deliver the City, else he would assault it. <hi>Bembus</hi> answered, in so doing, he should violate the late League, and that he should find him ready to repel his Forces: He displeased, sent some Galleys, discharging great pieces at <hi>Cattarus,</hi> as if come to besiege it: <hi>Bembus</hi> discharging as many more at them, shewed his men on the Walls; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Barbarussa</hi> returned to <hi>Castronovum,</hi> and (appeased with Presents from <hi>Bembus)</hi> he departed out of the <hi>Bay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The long wars between the Emperour and <hi>French</hi> King were now well pacified, and such shew of Friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that most men thought they would (as one) go against the <hi>Turk:</hi> which opinion (not wholly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the wiser sort) this also confirmed, that <hi>Vastius</hi> and <hi>Hanebald</hi> (2 of their most famous Captains) were sent Embassadours to draw the <hi>Venetians</hi> into the confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that War: who gallantly coming to <hi>Venice,</hi> were by Duke <hi>Laudus</hi> and the State, magnificently received, the people flocking together to behold them, especially <hi>Vastius</hi> with his tall and comely person. They having audience in the Senate, <hi>Vastius</hi> arising from the Dukes side, made an oration, shewing, That by Gods great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, two of the mightiest Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> having had long mortal wars, were (being touched with zeal of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) become great friends, to revenge so many calamities received from the Infidel: that they were sent to kindle in
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:130480-02:333"/>
them the like zeal, who being of such power at sea, were wished for (of all other) as their Confederates in that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred war, and hoped Victory. As for Land Forces, unto those lately brought into the field at <hi>Vienna,</hi> should be joined all the horse &amp; Infantry of <hi>France</hi> &amp; all the forces of <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Polonia.</hi> Wherefore the Victorious Emperour, and most Christian King <hi>Francis</hi> did most instantly request them to enter into the like godly cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it might worthily seem a most shameful thing unto them to have renewed their League, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it beseem that most wealthy State, to be terrified, with any charges, from what was good and right; for by the profit of one sea or land-Victory, they should to their incomparable praise recompence all former losses.</p>
               <p>The Duke answered in the name of the State; Never any thing happened to them more honourable, or more desirable, than the hope of such a peace, wholsome to the endangered <hi>Venetian</hi> State, and wondrously to be desired of all Christian Princes; if those two (most mighty) would sincerely, religiously, and unitedly resolve upon that sacred War: for then would the <hi>Venetians</hi> not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but end their League with the <hi>Turk:</hi> wherefore it was to be requested of the Almighty God, that they would speedily and seriously fulfil that hope of Peace, which they had in shew promised.</p>
               <p>Few dayes after, some select Senatours sitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, calling the Embassadours, asked them, if they knew any thing of the Capitulation of that League: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thought, <hi>Charls</hi> in regard thereof, would give <hi>Francis</hi> his son the Dukedome of <hi>Millane,</hi> as was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>Hanebald</hi> was silent: <hi>Vastius</hi> said, He knew no more but that they had agreed betwixt themselves, and that the Emperour's desired peace, to help the afflicted <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not be effected without yielding in many things to the requests of the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Nobility and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Embassage, more moved the Senate, than,
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:130480-02:334"/>
he former Embassadours, <hi>Mendoza</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerius</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> then present; yet they much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, because containing no certain resolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all seemed to rest in this point, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> in hope of this League, should neglect the renewing of last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years League with <hi>Solyman,</hi> now almost expired. On which uncertainty the grave Senatours thought it too dangerous to depend: yet the Senate was wonderfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. Some inveighed against the renewing of that shameful League with the Infidels, urging with many reasons the Christian Confederation: Others of deeper reach, considering their exceeding harms by falling out with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and suspecting the Emperours drift, with the great dearth then in the City; not to be relieved but out of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece: Charls</hi> having then impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Custome on all Corn (coming out of <hi>Sicily)</hi> amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the price of the Corn and fraight: which mischiefs, they said, were to be prevented by renewing of the league: They speut almost whole Winter-nights in the Court, consulting what best to do, but all there said, or decreed, was made known; not only to the Embassadours, but in Provinces far off, never before in that State known. <hi>Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carus,</hi> an old Senatour perceiving it, said, The State was betrayed by multitude and corruption of Voyces, and must shortly perish, if not speedily committed to some few (for there were almost 200 Voyces) reducing them to 50, who were holden for men of greatest gravity &amp; secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but <hi>Foscarus,</hi> soon after fell into such hatred, that he was by the Voyces of the multitude thrust out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil himself, and kept a great while from all City-prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: which disgrace turned afterwards to his great honour and credit (as one foreseeing much) when they were found out and condemned, who had traiterously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the secrets of the State.</p>
               <p>The result was, That they doubting of the union of <hi>Charls</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> yet expecting the event, they sent two
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:130480-02:334"/>
Embassadours to them to discover their designes, and a third <hi>Badoerius,</hi> a wise man to <hi>Solyman,</hi> to prevent the fame of the distrust of their agreement, and to spare no cost to save <hi>Nauplium</hi> and <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> which he required of them before he would grant a peace: And if it could not be obtained, to conclude a peace on any conditions: which the Decemviri thought to be most expedient; yet gave him secret instructions for yielding up the Cities, fearing the force and tumult of the multitude; for if they had sought for peace too late, <hi>Solyman</hi> would have encreased his insatiable desire, not granting peace except they (low and forsaken) would deliver the Islands <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia, Zante</hi> and <hi>Corcyra,</hi> as grievous as the destruction of <hi>Venice</hi> it self. So <hi>Vastius</hi> and <hi>Hanebald,</hi> comming to hinder the League, wrought no more by their great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, than for the <hi>Venetians</hi> foreseeing the danger, to hasten to conclude the same: and undoubtedly <hi>Hane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> was sent but for fashion, and secretly, by <hi>Pellice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> perswaded them to hasten the peace with <hi>Solyman:</hi> which <hi>Badoerius</hi> carefully soliciting, and loath to yield the Cities, offered <hi>Solyman</hi> a great sum instead of them: who threatningly took him up as a shameless dissembler: protesting, he would never grant him peace without it, rehearsing the most secret points of his Embassage, which <hi>Badoerius</hi> little thought he had known: wherefore (he also doubting of his life) accepted of peace, yielding those <hi>Peloponesian</hi> Cities, and with them 2 Cities of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> to the Senates great grief. The common people thinking he of himself had done it, were so enraged at him, that with much ado he was saved from exile, and his goods from confiscating, though the Traitours who had discovered the secrets were known: These were <hi>Leonius</hi> a Senatour and <hi>Cabatius</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Decemviri</hi> (who fled into <hi>France)</hi> and <hi>Valerius</hi> a Senatour's base son, the disperser of the <hi>Turks</hi> money: who with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices were hanged in the Market-place. About which
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:130480-02:335"/>
time, in 1540. <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> died, after which great wars ensued, and the subvertion of that flourishing Kingdom; for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had made a League profitable to them both, and most welcome to the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> who divided into factions, yet enjoyed their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states hereby, the strong Holds being kept by them who possessed them at the making of the peace: in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations whereof, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was thenceforth to call <hi>John</hi> a King, who before called him but the Vayuod; also if <hi>John</hi> died, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> should succeed him in the whole Kingdom, which divers of the Nobles subscribed to: which condition was kept very secret for fear of <hi>Solyman,</hi> who accounted of that Kingdom as of his own. This matter is reported, to have been revealed by <hi>Lascus</hi> unto <hi>Solyman,</hi> to bring <hi>John</hi> into hatred. Whereupon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> exceedingly angry, called <hi>John</hi> unthankful Churl, saying to <hi>Lutzis Bassa:</hi> How unworthily do these two Christian Kings wear their Crowns? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid for shame, or fear of God, for profit, to falsifie their Faith; but <hi>John</hi> greatly afraid, did by Friends and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents pacifie <hi>Solyman,</hi> laying the blame upon <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as better able to bear it. Not long after, <hi>John</hi> having set all in good order, and fortified <hi>Buda,</hi> being far in years, at the earnest request of most of his Nobility and other Friends, married <hi>Isabel Sigismund</hi>'s Daughter of <hi>Polonia,</hi> begotten of the Lady <hi>Bonasfortia</hi> Daughter to <hi>Galeasias</hi> Duke of <hi>Millane:</hi> which <hi>Solyman</hi> liked well of, having often condemned his single life; but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> disliked it, foreseeking if he should have a son, himself should be rejected as a Stranger. <hi>Isabel</hi> soon conceived with child, and was very big: when <hi>John</hi> was forced personally to go against <hi>Maylat</hi> and <hi>Balas,</hi> Governours of <hi>Transilvania: Maylat</hi> seeking to make himself King. But <hi>Solyman</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resting his arrogancy, and hating him for the death of <hi>Grittus</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> then slain, wished <hi>John</hi> to be more circumspect, whom he trusted with such a Country; So
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:130480-02:335"/>
                  <hi>Maylat</hi> fearing to be thrust quite out of Government by <hi>John,</hi> thought best to raise up all the Province into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, taking part with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who secretly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered it to the utmost: (for these two Kings in heart envied each other). <hi>John</hi> then exacting (chiefly of the <hi>Transilvanians)</hi> a great summe to pay the <hi>Turk</hi> his two years Tribute, was a fit occasion to raise the people: to appease which dangerous troubles, <hi>John</hi> sent a great power into <hi>Transilvania,</hi> following after in his Chariot, not well recovered of his sickness. The Noble men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring it in two places, the tumult was by force and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy well pacified, and some chief offenders executed: <hi>Maylat</hi> retiring with all his wealth, into strong <hi>Foga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> which they shortly after, hardly besieged: <hi>John</hi> himself laying sick of an Ague at <hi>Sibynium</hi> about a mile from <hi>Fogaras</hi> (into which he relapsed through too much care and pains in travelling in that hot season). News was brought (the while) that his Queen was delivered of a son: which once bruited, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, came to the Court, discharging their pieces in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, with all signs of joy possible: the Noblemen came from the Camp to rejoyce with the King, and all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was filled with gladnesse: and a royal Feast was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, which they would have the King honour with his presence (though unwilling) as but a little recovered; yet he yielding to their importunity, he forgot himself, eating and drinking more liberally, than was for the health of his weak Body: whereby his Feavour was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; Wherefore feeling his end draw fast on, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his son his Heir, committing his Tuition to <hi>George</hi> Bishop of <hi>Veradium</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter Vicche</hi> his nigh kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, requesting the nobles to prefer his son before a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; saying, <hi>Solyman</hi> would surely protect the Kingdom and his Son, if they in time sending Presents, promised he should reign as his Tributary; so presently after dying.</p>
               <p>This King, besides his vigilant, courteous, gentle and
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:130480-02:336"/>
bountiful Nature and Learning, used oft to say, that the love of valiant men got by bounty and courtesie was the best Treasures of a Prince: for that the thankful did oft in some worthy service, fully repay what had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed: the unthankful shamefully bearing the witness of anothers Vertue. His death was concealed till the Nobles had agreed with <hi>Maylat</hi> to take the oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King and his Son, and to enjoy his former Government.</p>
               <p>Then they decreed in Council to send the appointed Embassage to <hi>Solyman:</hi> so <hi>Exechius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Quinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ecclesiae,</hi> and <hi>Verbetius</hi> the aged Chancellour, were dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ten curious wrought Bowls of Gold, 600 of Silver-guilt, and engraven: 50 pieces of Purple silk and gold-cloath, and 30 pound of coyned Gold, as two years tribute, who came to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings dead body was the while with much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinesse, and most of the Army, solemnly buried at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Regalis:</hi> After which the young child (was Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called <hi>Steven,</hi> and Crowned with the Ancient Crown of King <hi>Steven,</hi> who first erected that Kingdom; yet the Royal Dignity was given given to the Queen, so as in all publique Writings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Bishop was Treasurer, and commanded the strong Holds: yet the Souldiers were at the devotion of <hi>Thuraccus:</hi> and <hi>Vicche</hi> (as a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle man) was named High Constable.</p>
               <p>This Bishop was born in <hi>Croatia,</hi> and brought up from his youth in the House of King <hi>John,</hi> where Vertue and Industry never wanted relief. Having forsaken his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick Prof ssion, as weary of its straitnesse; he still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>John</hi> driven out of his Kingdom, winning such credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he obtained the Bishoprick of <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> after <hi>Sibbachus</hi> slain by <hi>Grittus</hi>'s treachery: He was such a notable man in his religious service, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that <hi>John</hi> would confesse himself to raign by his special industry: and King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would oft say,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:130480-02:336"/>
he envied at <hi>John</hi> for nothing he had, but for one hooded fellow, better for defence of a Kingdom, than 10000 with Helmets on their heads. Taking on him the tuition of the young King, he was busied in all weighty causes, civil and martiall: carefully labouring for the <hi>Hungarians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in love and unity, and that no tumult or rebellion should arise. But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> now thought it a fit time to recover that so long desired Kingdom: being prickt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by 7 men of great account in <hi>Hungary,</hi> who having taken <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s part, lived in exile, concluding their motives to him: What could be more dishonour to him, so great a King and Emperour Elect, than by shameful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, to forsake them, being noble and valiant, who had followed his part, and were then ready with strong Troops, to do him their best service.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germane</hi> Captains also perswaded him, who, as martial men, desired honour, pay and prey. But <hi>Lascus</hi> (who in matters of Peace and War saw more than they) was of a contrary opinion, telling <hi>Ferdinand</hi> plainly in a Speech, that the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> was to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather by policy than force, by craving it of <hi>Solyman,</hi> to hold it of him by tribute, as King <hi>John</hi> did: saying, that if he should once joyn battel with the Turks, if the best did happen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he should have endless Warre with such an enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>His Speech so moved <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that though purposing to proceed, yet he thought good to prove <hi>Solymans</hi> minde also: none being thought fitter for that Embassage, than <hi>Lascus</hi> himself, who being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all necessaries, departed from <hi>Vienna,</hi> to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi> yet <hi>Ferdinand</hi> withall, prepared for Warres, trusting to the Emperour's Brother, and the coming over of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> for present profit; but before open Warre, he sent the Count of <hi>Salma</hi> to the Queen, to shew her the Instruments of the last League betwixt her late Husband and him, exhorting her to yield up the
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:130480-02:337"/>
Kingdom, and not by delay to hurt herself and Son; for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> offered to give the Child the Province of <hi>Sepn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> as was before agreed in the League, and to the Queen a great Revenue, beside her Dowry; but if she would forget that League, he threatned, Neither <hi>Charls</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor he, wanted force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Count hardly obtained admittance to the Queens presence; for <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Vicche</hi> mistrusting her courage, said, she was not to be spoken with, for sorrow; and that they were of Authority to give him audience and answer: which opinion of her weakness, She of an Heroical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, took so in disgrace, that she said, She would kill her self, if the Embassadors were not suffered to come into her Chamber, (dark and hung with black) she sitting on a low Pallet, negligently attired, pale-coloured, yet then shedding no teares; yet her voice and countenance such as might shew her sorrow was nothing abated; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all dangers, she resolved for defence of her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, to call in the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Counts admittance, and delivery of his Message, she answered, Such was the fortune of her Sex and years, and griess of body and minde, that she could neither take nor give counsel: wherefore she requested a convenient time to ask Counsel of her Father <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> to whose just judgement she would stand, as she thought the Nobility would also; but if they would needs forthwith make Warre upon her, she said, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> should win no great honour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne a Widow consumed with teares, and a young Child yet crying in his Cradle.</p>
               <p>The Count returning, told <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he had heard and seen, that the Queen was wholly in the power of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the rest shifted among them the honours and preferments of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherefore all the hope was in speedy Warre, the Queen (with her Sonne) to be driven out of <hi>Buda,</hi> before they could take Arms, or well
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:130480-02:337"/>
advise what to do: She delaying but to make her self stronger, and the while, to call in the Turk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> furnished with money from <hi>Charls,</hi> soon raised a great Army, which he sent down <hi>Danubius</hi> to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> alwayes faithful to him. <hi>Velsius</hi> a Noble <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> was General: who to open first, the way to <hi>Buda,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nine dayes siege, took <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> (but not the Castle) with the losse of about two hundred men. Then passing <hi>Danubius,</hi> he took <hi>Pesth,</hi> forsaken by the enemy: also the City <hi>Vacia,</hi> without losse: whence crossing the River, he came before <hi>Buda,</hi> to terrifie the Citizens, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what he could, the Queens purpose, where <hi>Perenus, Rascaius,</hi> and <hi>Francopanes,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Agria,</hi> revolted to <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> the Bishop was reputed to go upon meere conscience: yet <hi>George</hi> challenged him by Letters, in hope to be made a Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Velsius</hi> lay as if he would rather besiege than assault the City. the <hi>Germans</hi> fetching in great booty round about, burning and carrying away prisoners: wherefore the <hi>Hungarians</hi> fell oft together by the eares, with them; they of <hi>Buda</hi> also, with their Troops, skirmished with them, if they did but stir out of the Camp, well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Villages; for <hi>Thuraccus</hi> had taken into the City, a multitude of light Horsmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balthasar Pamphilus</hi> coming to the Gates, desired the Warders to give him leave to talk with his old Friend <hi>Thuraccus,</hi> and confer with him concerning the good of the State, which the General granting, he was let in with his Troop: and soon returning to the Camp, he report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that viewing the strength of the City, he perceived, it was not to be taken without greater power, and a better season of the year. Wherefore <hi>Velsius,</hi> doubtful of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> his fidelity, in anger bid him void the Camp: who without his leave, had private conference with the enemy, and discouraging the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="664" facs="tcp:130480-02:338"/>Wherefore <hi>Velsius</hi> returned to <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> taking the Castle (wherein the ancient Crown was kept) with lesse losse than he had the lower Town. Ere long, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> through <hi>Perenus,</hi> it was delivered him garrisoning it for <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he retired to <hi>Strigonium;</hi> and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the rough <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together; so that <hi>Velfius</hi> parting them, was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Thigh, and <hi>Perenus</hi> hurt with a stone: Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was also come far on, and the Souldiers crying out for pay.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he also sick of the stone, billited his men that Winter, about the Countrey, having new fortified <hi>Pesth;</hi> because 'twas reported, the <hi>Turks</hi> on their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were preparing to ayd <hi>Buda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was levying his forces, the Queen had craved ayd of the Turk's bordering-Lievtenants: who answered, they might in no case, without expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from <hi>Solyman,</hi> depart from their charges: besides, <hi>Mahometes</hi> was overcome by rewards from <hi>Lascus</hi> (in his passage) not to stir: wherefore she certified <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi> what danger they were in, craving his speedy ayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lascus</hi> falling sick by the way, sent his Physician be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the great Bassaes, chiefly to <hi>Lutzis,</hi> by whom he hoped to obtain his desire: but in vain; for <hi>Solyman,</hi> besides defending his own right, thought it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his great profit and glory, if he undertook the protection of the Widow and Fatherless Child in so great distress: wherefore he said to the Embassadours, that to declare his constancy, inseparable from his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he would take such course, that the <hi>Germans</hi> should not long rejoyce of the Warres begun: and in token of friendship, gave them a royal Robe, a Buckler with a curious Bosse, a Horsemans Mace, with a golden

handle, and a Scimiter with a Scabbard richly set with Stones, writing to <hi>Ustref</hi> and <hi>Mahometes,</hi> speedily to ayd the Queen: who, if harmed through their cefault, it should cost them their heads.</p>
               <p>The Embassadors were scarce gone, when <hi>Lascus</hi> came to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> whose success he understanding, yet he proceeded in his business, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But when he often mentioned the Emperour, as if he would ayd his Brother with all the power of <hi>Germany, Solyman</hi> was so moved, that he was presently impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned: young <hi>Rustan</hi> Bassa especially, chiding him as worthy of death, for offending by his liberal speech, so courteous a Prince, and as it were, mocking the King of Kings, requiring friendship, while his Master most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently warred in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ustreff</hi> and <hi>Mahometes,</hi> assembling their dispersed forces, by shipping brought them down <hi>Savus</hi> and <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> into <hi>Danubius;</hi> (for tis hard to perform any great matter by Warre in <hi>Hungary,</hi> without the help of a great Fleet); but <hi>Danubius</hi> was then so frozen on both sides, that the middle was scarce open: so that the Turks not daring to return, were enforced to abide the Winters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible hardness in their Tents, to shew their readinesse: their most dear Horses starving for cold, and want of meat.</p>
               <p>The Spring coming on (in the year of Christ 1541) they entred <hi>Hungary:</hi> with whom, <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raccus</hi> the Queens General, joyned also: the Queen, sending presents to the Turks Generalls, victualling the Camp, and furnishing them with Ordnance, for besieging of Cities holden by <hi>Ferdinand:</hi> who took <hi>Vacia,</hi> but badly defended, putting many to the Sword, and burning the City: thence removing to <hi>Pesth,</hi> a <hi>Hungarian</hi> and a <hi>German,</hi> so vallantly defended the City, (and the <hi>Turks</hi> not well relieved with Victuall) that they passing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubius,</hi>

and restoring the Ordnance, returned home; but in their retiring the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> led by <hi>Gnarus,</hi> slew many, <hi>Achomates</hi> one of their best Captains being one.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> gone, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> perswading the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour not to give over the War so fortunately begun, the late supplies for <hi>Velsius,</hi> were sent into <hi>Hungary,</hi> under Lord <hi>Regendorffe;</hi> then gone as farre as <hi>Possonium,</hi> to relieve <hi>Pesth:</hi> unto whom <hi>Velsius</hi> gave place, who joyning with the old Army, marched to <hi>Buda,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging it.</p>
               <p>Upon a great Hill called <hi>Gerard</hi>'s Mount (whose middle was equal with the top of the Castle over against it (a great Valley and deep Ditch laying betwixt) <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendorffe</hi> planted his Battery, so shaking a new Tower thereof, that it was thought it would fall: if it had, yet supposed dangerous to assault it, having a treble Wall; but he sparing the sumptuous Turrets and Galleries of the King's Pallace therein, sent to the Queen: wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Bishop answered in her behalf, she was not such a fool, to exchange the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for the principality of <hi>Sepusia:</hi> scornfully answering him, as a very doting and mad old man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And above all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing him of private courtesie, to discharge his Pieces with a little lesse noyse, lest his Sow at home, great with Pig, terrified, should farrow before her time, to the great grief of his Guests; for he was of a sharp and taunting spirit: so contemning the <hi>Germans,</hi> that two being taken burning Houses in the Kings Orchard,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:130480-02:339"/>
he hanged two Hoggs on the Gallowes with them.</p>
               <p>Ere long, <hi>Regendorffe</hi> removed to a place called the <hi>JEWES GRAVES,</hi> near <hi>Jewes</hi> Gate: the Bishop quipping him now, as a proper wise man: who had pitched his Tents in a most fit place, among the dead, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But he battering the Walls in two places, a great part thereof was beaten down; another part overcharged with Earth (cast up within side, for strengthening it) then fell down also, to the exceeding dismaying of them in the City: which opportunity, <hi>Regendorffe</hi> let slip, either (through the smoak and dust) not well aware, or doing all things leasurely and suspiciously, and the <hi>Germans</hi> not so easily brought to a sudden assault, as <hi>Spaniards, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> so that it was deferred, (night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast on) till the next morning: the <hi>Budians</hi> the while, with incredible diligence, rating a rampier instead thereof.</p>
               <p>In the morning they fiercely assaulted it, so that <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiscus,</hi> with some Companies, entering a shattered ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning House, had almost recovered the top of the Rampier; but they of <hi>Buda,</hi> wondrously withstanding (the Bishop encouraging and fighting amongst them) the <hi>Germans</hi> were forced to retire, above 800 men being lost: <hi>Perenus</hi> being also repulsed, (but with lesse losse) at the breach at the Gate <hi>Sabatina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he began to undermine the City; but, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, was disappointed: yet, the common people in the City, pinched with hunger, mutinously cryed out, 'twas time to yield, and end those common miseries; but the Bishop shewing but himself in the Market-place, as if he would have preached, could turn the peevish people which way he pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:130480-02:340"/>After this, the City had almost by the treason of one <hi>Bornemissa</hi> a Lawyer been lost; who hating the Bishop, for taking part with a Banckrupt <hi>Jew</hi> against him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Revalius</hi> the Enemies Marshal, to open a blind Postern in St. <hi>Maries</hi> yard, whereby he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regendorffe</hi> so liked thereof, that he thought not good to use the service of the <hi>Hungarians</hi> therein: against the request of <hi>Bornemissa,</hi> that many guiltless people might not be slaughtered by the <hi>Germans;</hi> but he hoping by excluding the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to have all the glory of the Victory to himself, made as if he would use the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> glosing with <hi>Revalius,</hi> whose Sonne he took as a pledge.</p>
               <p>About midnight, he sent four Select Companies of <hi>Germanes,</hi> with great silence to the Postern: his Sonne <hi>Condi</hi> standing ready to enter with a strong Troop, when the <hi>Germans</hi> let in, should break open the great Gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bornemissa</hi> opening the Postern, had silently received in most of them; but still asking softly for <hi>Revalius,</hi> and they answering in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, he was so surprized with fear, that as amazed, he forgot to conduct the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> who knew not which way first to go, stealing on softly for fear of treason, still asking for their Guide; but by their matches and noyse of Armour, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And the passage being much letted by the Weapons of the first, cast acrosse the way to run the lighter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bacianus</hi> who had charge of the watch, first set upon them: then <hi>Vicche</hi> from the Market place came thither,

with a strong company: many of the valiantest <hi>Germans</hi> were slain or taken, some being <hi>Bornemissa</hi>'s Friends (himself being got out with the foremost) whom the Bishop by torture wrung the plot out of, then executing them; <hi>Revalius Bornemissa</hi> lamenting, that besides the name of a Traitour, he had lost all and undone his Friends and Kindred. <hi>Regendorff</hi> (condemned even of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers for his foolish pride, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> from that time set him down (by long siege) to win the City.</p>

On the right hand, on a small rising ground, he placed the lesser Camp of <hi>Hungarians:</hi> making also a bridge from his Camp, into a small Island in the River, and, with a Fort, commanded both the River and Plain; to beat their Fleet coming up, and themselves marching in the Plain. The <hi>Turks</hi> being come nigh the City, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus Thuraccus</hi> met them with 2000 Horse, instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, what the Christians did, what their strength, and the most conveniently to encamp. Wherefore, the <hi>Bassa</hi> boldly came within half a Mile of the Christian Camp; strongly intrenching himself round: but <hi>Mahometes</hi> of <hi>Belgrade</hi> politiquely took the higher ground next the <hi>Hungarians</hi> Tents. The Christian Fleet had 24 Galleots, about 80 small Pinnaces, and little lesse than 100 ships of burden, and other small boats; the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleetnot thought above half so great. Near the little Island aforesaid, had the <hi>Turks</hi> taken the Island <hi>Sepelia,</hi> over against their own Camp, where casting up a great Bulwark, they thence shot at the Fort, in the little Island, and at their vessels in the River as the Christians did at them. <hi>Cepelia,</hi> layeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 miles long in <hi>Danubius</hi> full of Villages: so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously, that if <hi>Regendorff</hi> had at first fortified it, as he was perswaded, the <hi>Turks</hi> could not have encamped in the Plain, to their great disadvantage; but he was not willing to divide his Forces, till he had some new supply from <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The Armies thus laying, there were light skirmishes every day, and sometime one brave man
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:130480-02:341"/>
challenging forth another hand to hand: which was so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to behold, that both Armies many times would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to shoot to see those prove their manhood on each other with spears and swords only. In which skirmishes the <hi>Germans</hi> were oft put to the worst, by reason of their heavy Horses, fitter for a set-battel: but the <hi>Hungarians</hi> acquainted with the <hi>Turks</hi> manner of fight, and better Armed, did foyl them, though more in number. Noble <hi>Rayschachius</hi> (a <hi>German)</hi> his valiant son, going forth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his Father, bare himself so galiantly against the enemy in his Father's and Armie's sight, that he was highly commended (chiefly of his Father); yet was he encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed and slain. <hi>Rayschachius</hi> moved with his death, said to the other Captains: This worthy Gentleman, whoever he be, deserves eternal commendation, and to be most honourably buried by the whole Army. As the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captains were approving his speech, the dead body was presented to the Father, all there present shedding tears: but <hi>Rayschachius</hi> was so struck at heart, that stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while speechlesse, with his eyes set, he suddenly fell down dead: After which, the General commanded none on pain of death, to skirmish without leave, hanging one or two for so doing. So that the enemy would sometimes brave them, on the top of their own Trenches.</p>
               <p>Many dayes having now passed: the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Budi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> daily encreased in strength and courage: when on the other side, the contrary. Only the often Letters of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and the firm opinion, that <hi>Charls</hi> would not in so great danger, fail to ayd his brother, and the General's firm resolution, upheld their fainting minds. The <hi>Turks</hi> from the higher ground, and out of <hi>Cepelia,</hi> perceiving the <hi>Germans</hi> in the little Island as carelesse, agreed, at once to assayl divers of their Forts: landing at break of day, so closely and suddenly, that they slew 600, ere well awake or armed: the rest fleeing to the Camp in such haste, that many fell beside the bridge &amp; were drowned. The whole Camp

was wondrously troubled, the <hi>Turks</hi> with hideous cries raising the Alarm in divers places at once; yet <hi>Herbes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulfe</hi> the Camp master perswading some <hi>German</hi>-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Souldiers in the Fleet, not to suffer the Ensignes and Ordnance to be so shamefully carried away: and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> then landing divers Companies in the Island, they drave the <hi>Turks</hi> again to their boats, receiving no lesse losse themselves, than had the <hi>Germans</hi> before; It was said, the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet might have been quite overthrown, if the Christians had couragiously pursued them and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them; yet 4 <hi>Turks</hi> Pinnaces were sunk, 3 taken, and many <hi>Turks</hi> slain, or drowned in the River. Shortly after, the <hi>Turks</hi> did so assayl the Camp on every side, that they left them almost no time of rest; so that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most despaired long to defend it; for the <hi>Bassa</hi> at <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> taking to him the sick and wounded, sent fresh men still, in their stead: and <hi>Valentinus</hi> with <hi>Harquebusse Janizaries</hi> had driven <hi>Perenus</hi> with the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horse out of the upper Camp, so that the nether Camp was hardly beset; yet the great Artillary from <hi>Pesth</hi> much troubled <hi>Valentinus,</hi> assayling it on that side. Some say, <hi>Valentinus</hi> did privately wish <hi>Perenus</hi> speedily to provide for himself and his <hi>Hungarians:</hi> for there was a great Beast coming, which (at one morsel) would devour them all: This was <hi>Solyman</hi> coming in haste with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Wherefore <hi>Perenus</hi> told <hi>Regendorff.</hi> Except they would presently depart with the Army, he would in time shift for himself &amp; Country-men: at last they agreed, it was best, next night, to pass the River to <hi>Pesth</hi> only the General said, he would not depart from <hi>Buda</hi> without <hi>Ferdinands</hi> command; so sending the Count of <hi>Salma</hi> swiftly up the River to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to know his pleasure (<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi> fretting at their long stay) 'twas resolved, next night when the Moon was down, to passe over in 4 Convoys: for 'twas not so easy to make a bridge over <hi>Danubius</hi> as was supposed: which being almost planked, such a wind
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:130480-02:342"/>
and tempest arose, and the River was so rough, that the bridge was loosed and broken, many of its boats being carried away with the streams force. The 2 first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys passed well over; for though the <hi>Budians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> (seeing by day the Fleet drawing into one place) might suspect, yet could they foresee nothing of their sudden departure; but the vigilant eye was not long deceived, and the less, for that 2 Fugitives then discovered to the Bishop their flight: who presently certifying the <hi>Bassaes</hi> thereof, they eame to assault the Christians in their Camp with a horrible cry assayling their Trenches: The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> began to quaile, yet, with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> a while, notably resisted: All the Camp was filled with confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every man at the River-side striving to get aboard dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly: <hi>Regendorff</hi>'s Authority (through the nights dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so great noise of people, and Ordnance) being as nothing: who then lay in bed wounded in the shoulder by a Faulkon-shot falling in his Tent (as he was writing Letters to <hi>Fordinand)</hi> striking a chest in sunder. The Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Captains envying at the Horsmen so well escaped, faintly resisted the enemy: the upmost Tents were first taken, and the <hi>German</hi>-Foot chased all over <hi>Gerrards</hi> Mount. They of <hi>Buda</hi> also entred the Camp on the Cities side, burning the Tents, a little before forsaken, and the Bishop firing a great stack of straw nigh the Rivers side, it gave such a light, that one might plainly see over <hi>Danubius</hi> to the Walls of <hi>Pesth:</hi> whereby, their flight by water, and confusion by land was discovered. Then was the Ordnance from every place, discharged upon the Fleet: <hi>Cason</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> Admiral with his light-boats, setting on the ships crossing the River, taking divers boats laden with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, sinking others with his Ordnance. After the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> brake into the lower Camp: the <hi>Germans,</hi> fleeing over the bridge into the little Island, were slain without mercy by the pursuers, many leaping into the River and perishing: 300 sayl of all sorts were mingled together,
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:130480-02:343"/>
covering the River as with a Bridge, but the Christian Fleet, cleering themselves, and beating the <hi>Turks</hi> back with their Ordnance, got up to <hi>Comara.</hi> The other Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Forces enduring the same fortune in the Camp; the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> died there in fight. Many were slain or saved by the <hi>Budians,</hi> as they fell into the hands of a merciful or mercilesse man. But the Sun rising, plainly discovered the slaughter and the Victory. About 3000 taking a little Hill by <hi>Gerards</hi> Temple, stood on their guard till above 2000 were slain: the rest yielding in hope of life, were reserved for a grievous spectacle. <hi>Cason</hi> coming to the shoar of <hi>Pesth,</hi> so feared those escaped thither only with the cry of his Souldiers and noyse of the Artillery, that the Horsmen for haste to get out, were like to over-run each other, leaving behind them whatever good thing they had; yet some <hi>Hungarians</hi> stayed behind, rifling the Merchants shops: for <hi>Pesth</hi> was now become a notable Mart-Town, as of more safety than other Cities; but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> entring it, slew some of those greedy <hi>Hungarians:</hi> sparing neither man woman or child, except some few reserved for the <hi>Turks</hi> lust or slavish labour: Above 20000 Christians being one way or other reported to be slain in this War. There was taken 36 great battering pieces; Field-pieces 150, and wondrous store of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Victual. <hi>Regendorff</hi> was against his will carried aboard a Pinnace by his Physitian and Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and so was conveighed to the Island <hi>Comara;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shortly after, partly for his Wounds, but more through grief, died in the Village <hi>Samarium. Solyman</hi> still doubting the coming of <hi>Charls</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> was coming in such haste, that he caused his <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to march as fast as his Horsmen: but hearing of the Victory he came more leisurely to <hi>Buda,</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping on tother side of the City (the dead bodies lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet unburied) and making one huge Camp of both Armies. He especially commended the two <hi>Mahometes:</hi>
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:130480-02:343"/>
making him of <hi>Belgrade</hi> General of all his <hi>European</hi> Horse, the Victory being gotten chiefly by his means; rewarding the other Captains as they deserved, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting their pay. After which, he commanded the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners about 800 to be brought forth, and led in long ropes all along the raunged Army in derision, then to be slain by his young Souldiers: sternly saying, they were worthy of such death who had waged war, while entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peace. There was one <hi>Bavarian</hi> exceeding tall: whom (in despight of the <hi>German</hi> Nation) he delivered to a little dwarf to be slain, his head being scarce so high as the Captives knees, who being long mangled about the legs with his little Scimitar fell down, and was with many feeble blows hardly at last slain: others heartning the Dwarf on, to satisfie the eyes of the disporting Princes. This done, <hi>Solyman</hi> sent Embassadours with Presents to the young King: 3 fair Horses with Golden-bridles, their trappings set with precious stones: 3 Robes of cloth of Gold, and to the chief Nobles, rich Gowns and Gold Chains: courteously requesting the Queen to send the young King attended with his Nobility, into the Camp, and without all fear to hope that all should go well both with her, and her son, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> That <hi>Solyman</hi> would alwayes account of her as of his Daughter; but he came not to see her, as in courtesie he desired, because, by antient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, the <hi>Othoman</hi> Kings were forbidden to visit other mens Wives in their Houses, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> The Queen answered very doubtfully; but the Bishop perswading and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requesting her, not to give the <hi>Turks</hi> occasion to suspect her distrust of them, by her delay; She sent him in Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swathing cloaths in a rich Chariot with his Nurse, and certain great Ladies, with almost all the Nobility, to whom <hi>Solyman</hi> had sent presents, who was met on the way by Troops of the <hi>Turks</hi> brave Horsmen: and as he passed in the Camp, orderly stood the <hi>Janizaries</hi> of <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> guard: Being brought into the Pavillion, <hi>Solyman</hi>
                  <pb n="676" facs="tcp:130480-02:344"/>
looked on him familiarly, talking with the Nurse &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Sons, <hi>Selimus</hi> and <hi>Bajazet,</hi> begotten of <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana,</hi> to take him in their arms &amp; kiss him, in sure token of the love they would bear to him, whom they were in time to have their Friend &amp; Tributary: But <hi>Solyman,</hi> while the Nobles were dining with the <hi>Bassaes,</hi> had commanded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Companies under colour of seeing the City, to take the Gare <hi>Sabatina,</hi> and chief streets: which was so quietly and cunningly done, that a wary watchman beholding the manner of the <hi>Turks</hi> going to and fro, could scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the gate was taken, till it was too late. The Gate, Market-place, and chief streets so finely taken: the Captains of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> made Proclamations, That the Citizens should without fear keep in their Houses, and forthwith to deliver all their Weapons: which they did, receiving the <hi>Turks</hi> into their Houses, as their unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guests; but such was the severity of their Martial Discipline, that none was wronged by them in word or deed. <hi>Solyman</hi> hearing of the City thus taken, sent the child back unto the Queen; but the chief Nobles he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with him, to wit, <hi>George</hi> the Bishop: <hi>Vicche, Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raccus, Verbetius</hi> the Chancellour, <hi>Urbanus</hi> Governour of <hi>Buda;</hi> whose minds, this sudden and unexpected change troubled the more, because the great <hi>Bassaes</hi> began to pick quarrels with them, and as it were to call them to account for all they had done. The Queen fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grieving, by humble Letters, requested <hi>Solyman</hi> not to forget the Faith given, and of late confirmed; but to send back the Noble men, who for their fidelity and valour had well deserved both of him and her: This she did by <hi>Rustemes Bassa,</hi> whom she had loaded with gifts, sending him a fair <hi>Coronet</hi> of her own, of Orient Pearl, and a goodly Jewel set with rich stones, a present for his wife, <hi>Solymans</hi> Daughter. After which, <hi>Solyman</hi> consulted 4 dayes what order to take with that Kingdom. <hi>Mahometes</hi> advised him, to carry the child and all the Nobles to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi>
                  <pb n="677" facs="tcp:130480-02:344"/>
and to leave such a Governour in <hi>Buda,</hi> as might put the people out of fear of servitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: yet by degrees to lay on them the Yoke of the <hi>Turks</hi> Governmeut; but <hi>Rustemes</hi> (before corrupted) stood wholly upon terms of Honour; saying, Nothing could be more dishonourable to so mighty a Monarch, who had never blemished the glory of his Name, than after Victory, to break his Faith with a weak Woman and silly Infant, whom he had taken upon him to defend; but <hi>Mahometes</hi> of <hi>Belgrade</hi> then extraordinarily admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Council among the great <hi>Bassaes,</hi> disliked of both the former opinions, as too full of Lenity: and being asked his opinion, delivered it in a mischievous speech: saying towards the latter end thereof: Every year to take in hand so long and laboursome an expedition of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Horse, Foot, Artillery, and a Fleet of Ships for defence of another man (as commonly we do) seemeth to be meer madnesse: Neither do I think it to stand with the Majesty of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Emperours, thus to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved every year at the request of a puling Woman, crying for help; except you think it more profitable and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to maintain a defensive than an invasive War: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it best to turn this Kingdom (so oft conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and defended by Law of Arms) like thy Ancestours, into form of a Province: the Queen I would have sent to her Father, and her son brought up in thy Court, and instructed in our Religion: the Nobility I wish to be slain; their Castles razed, and all their notablest Families to be carried away into <hi>Asia:</hi> the multitude kept under with good Garrisons, to till the ground and inhabit the Cities: so shall the <hi>Hungarians</hi> perceive themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and the <hi>Germans</hi> forbear coming into <hi>Hungary,</hi> unless they will hazard both <hi>Stiria</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Solyman,</hi> before he would resolve of so great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, entred <hi>Buda</hi> with his two sons, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. 1541. and in the Cathedral (before purified by his Priest) offered
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:130480-02:345"/>
the first <hi>Mahometan</hi>-sacrifice in <hi>Buda.</hi> Shortly after, he (for his own security and Honour) as it were moderated their opinions, publishing a Decree, That <hi>Buda</hi> should thenceforth be kept with a Garrison of <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Kingdom turned into a Turkish Province; the Queen with her son forthwith to depart and live in <hi>Lippa,</hi> a quiet and fertile Countrey beyond the River <hi>Tybiscus,</hi> and near her Fathers borders: safely to be conducted thither by <hi>Janizaries</hi> with all her wealth: Wherefore she and her son, with mourning and tears (detesting inwardly his perfidious dealing) departed from <hi>Buda.</hi> The Nobles went with her also, who though sorrowful for this unexpected change, yet very glad of liberty and safety, whereof they had for 3 dayes despaired: only <hi>Thuraccus</hi> was kept in safe custody, because he was a martial man; and much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hated by the <hi>Turks,</hi> for the hard pursuit of <hi>Cason</hi> in <hi>Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> hearing of this shameful overthrow, and that <hi>Solyman</hi> was coming towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> sent <hi>Velsius</hi> (who never liked of <hi>Buda</hi> siege) to <hi>Comara,</hi> to stay their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flight, and gather together the dispersed Reliques of the Army, and to comfort the men with hope of new supplies. And somewhat to stay <hi>Solyman,</hi> he sent Count <hi>Salma</hi> and <hi>Lithestaine</hi> Embassadours with Presents and new conditions of peace: The Presents were, a high standing Cup of Gold, curiously set with rich stones: and a wondrous Globe of Silver, daily expressing the passing of the Houres: the Planets motions, the change and full of the Moon, the motion of the upper Orbs: and that exactly, by certain wheels and weights within, devised and perfected by the most cunning Astronomers, for <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour.</p>
               <p>They at their landing, were first received by <hi>Cason,</hi> and brought into a rich Tent, the ground being covered with rich Carpets: to whom <hi>Rustan Bassa</hi> sent such chear as the Camp afforded, especially most excellent Wine;
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:130480-02:345"/>
Next day the <hi>Bassaes</hi> feasted them: not sitting with their legs under them on the ground, as their manner was, but in Chairs at a Table; only <hi>Mahometes</hi> of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> an extraordinary guest, sat down upon a Cushion beneath the <hi>Bassaes.</hi> Their chear was but Rice and Mutton, as if noting thereby the Christians excesse: and the <hi>Bassaes</hi> drink, fair water out of <hi>Danubius.</hi> After dinner, they were brought in to <hi>Solyman,</hi> each of them led betwixt 2 <hi>Bassaes,</hi> holding them fast by the arms: so to kiss his hand; yet hath the Turkish Emperour sitting in his Throne, for fear of violence, laying by him, a Target, Scimitar, Iron Mace, with Bow and Arrows. The great Globe being brought in, filled <hi>Solyman</hi> and his <hi>Bassaes</hi> with Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>Solyman</hi> had curionsly studied Astronomy, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Cosmography, as his leasure served.</p>
               <p>The Embassadours desired him to give the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> almost on the same conditions that <hi>Lascus</hi> had required it for him, paying him such Tribute as <hi>John</hi> had done; promising to draw <hi>Charls</hi> into the same League; so that he might then at pleasure, turn his Forces upon the <hi>Persian:</hi> and urging <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s League with <hi>John,</hi> and so excusing him of the late war, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, Nothing could be to him more commendable, profitable or Honourable, than to call such a King as <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> and also Emperour Elect, and brother of the great Emperour, his Tributary. <hi>Solyman</hi> 2 dayes after, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Rustan,</hi> that this was his resolute condition of peace: If <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would restore all places before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and for ever abstain from <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and for his often provocations, great travel and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he could be content to impose an easie Tribute upon <hi>Austria.</hi> But if those conditions seemed too heavy, he would cause by continual War, that such things as were taken from <hi>Hungary,</hi> should be requited with the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of <hi>Austria.</hi> Though the Embassadours were much moved at the latter demand, yet they, to win some time,
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:130480-02:346"/>
required a truce till <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Emperour might be made acquainted with the matter: which the <hi>Turk,</hi> winter coming fast on, would in no case grant. And being rewarded and sent away, <hi>Solyman</hi> commanded <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> of <hi>Belgrade</hi> to spoyl the borders of <hi>Austria</hi> all along <hi>Danubius: Cason</hi> also General of <hi>Acanzii,</hi> he sent into <hi>Moravia,</hi> but neither did any great harm: the Rivers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and abundance of Rain falling. <hi>Solyman</hi> made one <hi>Solyman</hi> a <hi>Mahometan Hungarian,</hi> Governour of <hi>Buda:</hi> who by justice and courtesie (with <hi>Verbetius</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour) should endeavour to put the people in hope of long peace; which done, after about 20 dayes stay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the rain and cold, and fearing to be shut in with the rising of the great Rivers, he determined to return: setting <hi>Lascus</hi> (in prison at <hi>Belgrade)</hi> at liberty, who soon dyed of the Flux in <hi>Polonia,</hi> supposed to be poysoned by the <hi>Turks,</hi> whose death the King himself much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman</hi> being come to the River <hi>Dravus,</hi> it was told him that <hi>Maylat</hi> was taken by the cunning of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and that <hi>Transilvania</hi> was well pacified, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his obedience; whereof he was passing glad, for he hated <hi>Maylat</hi> for <hi>Grittus</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> by him slain, and knew that the <hi>Transilvanians</hi> an invincible people was by him stirred up. This <hi>Peter</hi> uniting with <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> against <hi>Maylat,</hi> they were 50000 Horse besides Foot, which (after the manner of those Countries) were not many: <hi>Maylat</hi> finding himself too weak, and despairing of ayd from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> fled again into <hi>Foga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:</hi> where, as in a most strong place, he had laid up his greatest substance and warlique provision, especially the rich spoyl taken from <hi>Grittus: Acho mates</hi> coming and perceiving, it was not to be taken but with much labour and time, craftily sent a Messenger to him, perswading him to yield to <hi>Solyman:</hi> choosing rather to be called his Friend than his Enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> promising he would
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:130480-02:346"/>
labour for him as his Friend; that he might still enjoy the Government of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> paying him some small yearly Tribute, as he had before requested, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying, <hi>Solyman</hi> was coming with his Victorious Army, who would with assured death revenge his vain hope of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out. <hi>Maylat</hi> foreseeing it better to make a certain peace, than to endure an uncertain War, answered, He could be content to conclude a peace, so it were not on any hard conditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore, he demanded <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomates</hi>'s valiant son in Hostage for his coming into the Camp: <hi>Achomates</hi> said, he had given him to <hi>Solyman,</hi> and so had over him no power, but he promised him 4 of his best Captains: which <hi>Maylat</hi> accepting, came with a gallant retinue, and was honourably received.</p>
               <p>The Parley was deferred till next day, that the <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davian</hi> might take him, whom he invited to a Banquet; about mid-dinner, <hi>Maylat</hi> (of a very proud and cholerick nature) was by some insolent speech (of purpose) so fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that with his hand on his sword, he in a rage flung from the Table: the other guests starting up also, took him fuming, and crying out, he was shamefully betrayed (his followers being stript of all): Incame <hi>Achomates</hi> the while, with deep dissimulation sharply reproving the <hi>Moldavian:</hi> whereto he scornfully (as if in contempt) answered, He had upon good cause taken <hi>Maylat</hi> prisoner, and would safely keep him for <hi>Solyman,</hi> to whom it only belonged to judge; Ere long, <hi>Fogaras</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with the Hostages, through fear or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Town surrendred, almost all <hi>Transilvania</hi> was by <hi>Solyman</hi> given to the young King; to whom all the people most willingly submitted, swearing obedience, his Father having almost thirty yeares with justice and quietnesse Governed that Province: honouring him, the Queen, and his two Tutours, laying in <hi>Leppa,</hi> with many Presents:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="682" facs="tcp:130480-02:347"/>At the same time, <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour at the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> greatly prepared for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of <hi>Algiers:</hi> whose Pirates so insested all the Coast from <hi>Gades</hi> to the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, that (all Merchandize set apart) they were glad to keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual watch and ward: wherefore though he knew how hardly he was spoken of (for leaving his brother so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestead) yet he departed out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italy:</hi> where, nigh <hi>Verona,</hi> he was met by <hi>Farnesius</hi> his son in law, <hi>Vastius,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassadours, and brought to <hi>Millane:</hi> where he was with great solemnity joyfully received, and, under a Canopy of Gold, brought to the Pallace, in a plain black Cloak and Cap, mourning-wise; when as the vulgar expected him in his Royal Robes, and the Imperial Crown on his Head: his heavy countenance presaging the wofull overthrow the day before at <hi>Buda,</hi> not yet known in <hi>Italy:</hi> Thence departing to <hi>Genua;</hi> he was advertised thereof from <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s coming; Whereupon, <hi>Vastius</hi> and <hi>Auria</hi> perswaded him to defer his <hi>African</hi> expedition till Spring: and with his present power to stay in <hi>Italy,</hi> making shew of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to help his brother; and the while, to assure his State in <hi>Italy</hi> against the <hi>French:</hi> but he answered them sitting in Council; If he should then stay in <hi>Italy,</hi> 'twould be thought, he was for fear of the <hi>Turks</hi> fled out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> &amp;c. hoping that <hi>Algiers</hi> might be won before the seas should grow rough and dangerous; which if so fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, he would not much care what the <hi>French</hi> could do.

who sent them to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where <hi>Solyman</hi> by most exquisite torments, drew from them all the secret devices of his son <hi>Bajazet:</hi> causing them to be drowned in the sea, at mid-night, that his domestique, yea bleeding wounds, might not be laid open to his Neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Yet being greatly offended with <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he cast in his mind how to be revenged on him; which <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana</hi> not ignorant of, when his fury was over-past, fell into talk with him about it, alledging in her sons behalf, the undiscreetnesse of youth, the necessity of the fact, and example of his Ancestours in like case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it was reason he should forgive him this first fault; but if he should again relapse, time would be to punish him for both faults: that if he would not pardon him for his own sake, yet for hers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> requesting him to preferre Clemency before just Indignation: since God himself did deal with finners for most part in mercy, else all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would not suffice his wrath: And would mercy in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place be more fit, than in the Father towards his child? promising, he should thenceforth remain in most dutiful obedience toward his Majesty; the remembrance of which Fatherly forgivenesse, should be a stay to him for ever doing the like: which, and such like words, with tears and other gestures, so wrought, that <hi>Solyman</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to forgive the fault: but he should come and submit, and receive from him his charge. Wherefore, she spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and secretly advertised <hi>Bajazet,</hi> not to fear coming to his Father when sent for: assuring him, she had made his peace. <hi>Bajazet</hi> comforted, resolved to go when sent for: yet full of fear, oft looking back to his brother <hi>Mustapha.</hi> Yet he came to a common Inne at <hi>Carestan,</hi> a few miles from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the place appointed; for the <hi>Turk</hi> in these times suffers no son, when a man, to come into <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople: Bajazet</hi> alighting, his Fathers guard were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive him, commanding him to lay aside his

But his kind mother (foreseeing in what perplexity he would come) called unto him (in passing by) out of a little Casement, covered with a thin linnen-cloth: saying, <hi>Corcoma Oglon, Corcoma:</hi> that is, Fear not my son, fear not; not a little comforting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging him. But having done his duty to <hi>Solyman,</hi> he bid him sit down by him, reproving him of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So <hi>Ba jazet</hi> returned to his former charge, behaving himself with all dutiful and brotherly kindness from that time, 1555. while his mother lived, rather to keep her favour, than for any confidence in his Father, or love to his brother; but she dying about 2 years after, he, by secret practises to make away his brother, and by open force entred his Province not far off, evil entreating some of his followers: omitting nothing tending to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, whom he wished (of all other) dead. He sought also to gain the Souldiers love by some favorites at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> passing thither himself upon occasion, secretly there lurking with those of his faction: Of all which (chiefly by <hi>Selimus,</hi> his Letters, wherein he also advised him to have a care of his safety, <hi>&amp;c.)

his duty, promise, and his courtesie towards him: that there would not be alwayes place for forgiveness; and that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, God would assign them both their Fortunes: But <hi>Ba jazet</hi> was fully set down to hazard all, rather than to be slain by his brother: yet answered his Father not impertinently, but his deeds agreed not with his saying; Wherefore <hi>Solyman</hi> gave his sons to understand, that both of them within a prefixed time should remove their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments farther off, <hi>Ba jazet</hi> from <hi>

               <p>But when he saw this contrary to his expectation, and that <hi>Selimus</hi> should be Heir of the Empire: He wrote unto his Father, accusing his Brother that he thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how maliciously he affected him, only to aspire to the Empire; and have a short cut over to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> if his Father dyed, which he gaped after: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, by secret Ministers of his Treason, to dispatch him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this man, as a most dutiful son, to be much made of: whereas he, meaning well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not

However he was ready to go whither he should command: It's the manner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> of the smallest things to divine upon the greatest; but <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> not ignorant of his sons teares, knew he sought but for a more fit place to raise new stirs in, nearer <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> So <hi>Bajazet</hi> the while, augmented his strength, and whatever else served for his own defence, and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Brother: which <hi>Solyman</hi> took as intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself; but would not, by taking notice thereof, drive his too hasty-son head long; knowing also, the eyes of all Nations were bent upon this discord: Wherefore, he answered <hi>Bajazet</hi> courteously, they should both do well to go to their appointed places, which he could not alter. For the rest he would so order it, that neither of them should justly complain: <hi>Partau Bassa</hi> was sent with this Message to him; and <hi>Mehement</hi> with the like, to <hi>Selimus:</hi> who were commanded not to depart from them, till come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

reasons, moderated. <hi>Bajazet,</hi> as he went, wrote on gates and doors, he would give double pay to those who would follow him: Wherefore the Captains distrusted their Souldiers, who also heard their often speeches of great love towards him. Being come to the River <hi>Araxis,</hi> he left certain followers upon the Bank to keep the <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zacks,</hi> who still pursued him, from passing over, whom they repulsing, passed the River, entring far into the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Kingdom: till some <hi>Persian</hi> Nobles with great Troops, met with them, demanding what they meant and sought for in another Kingdom? who answered, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued their Kings-fugitive son: they replyed, they did not well, against the League to come Armed beyond their bounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for <hi>Bajazet,</hi> their King would consider what was meet for him to do; in the mean time to be gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> retired. King <hi>Tamas</hi> sent Messengers to salute <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to know why he came, and see his strength, which some reckon about 20000: who declared, through his Brothers injuries and Fathers hard dealing, he was fled to the <hi>Persian</hi>-King, as his most assured Refuge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but otherwise wholly destitute. The <hi>Persian</hi> replyed, He had done very unwisely, in respect of his and his Fathers League: being, to account the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemies of one, the enemies of the other, and on the contrary: yet since it was so, he was welcome as to his Friend, who would leave nothing unattempted to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile him to his Father, which he despaired not of.</p>
               <p>At their first meeting there was friendly countenance, often conference, and great Feasting each other: Also there was a motion, one of the Kings Daughters to be promised to <hi>Orchanes Bajazets</hi> son, and he put in hope that <hi>Tamas</hi> would never be quiet till <hi>Solyman</hi> made him Governour of <hi>Mesopotamia, Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Erzirum</hi> far off from both Brother and Father: where his Brother the <hi>Persian</hi>-King might be his sure Refuge from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> seemed by these speeches, so assured of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s love, that when his Embassadour went to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> for a reconciliation (as was supposed); He bid him tell <hi>Solyman,</hi> he had lost a Father at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and found another at <hi>Persia;</hi> but (the while) all things were plotted tending to his destruction: which being ripe, a motion was made, that it was more convenient to have <hi>Bajazets</hi> multitude, billeted thereabouts farther asunder, both for the better Victualling them, and other purposes also. And indeed <hi>Tamas</hi> (unlike his Father <hi>Hysmaell)</hi> was in fear of <hi>Bajazet;</hi> yet many thought he was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to destroy him (not at first so minded) by reason of some of his followers: who perswaded him to thrust him out of his Kingdom, whereof there was many tokens: <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> hearing also, that a chief Captain said, <hi>Why stay we to kill this Haeretical King, and possess his Kingdom, by whose treachery we shall surely be all destroyed,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> might not (then) well gainsay the dispersing of his Forces: though many of his wise followers did shrewdly suspect the sequel; They so being bestowed in Countrey-Villages where the <hi>Persians</hi> saw good: ere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, they few and scattered, were enclosed and slain: and whatever they had, became a prey. Then was <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> and his sons cast into bonds; and that (as many say) while merrily at dinner, at the Kings Table: who seemed to foresee, that it stood far better with the safety of his estate, that <hi>Selimus</hi> should raign, than <hi>Bajazet</hi> a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince, and much better Souldier than his Brother.</p>

as a private man in a solitary life, whereto he had certain years before retired himself. He died <hi>Sept.</hi> 21 after, living 58. and raigning 39 years: About which time also died <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queen, his Sisters.</p>
               <p>The Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> had at length so prevailed with the Pope and King of <hi>Spain</hi> for recovery of <hi>Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> in <hi>Barbary:</hi> and the Island <hi>Zerbi</hi> betwixt <hi>Tripolis</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> (then also surprized by the <hi>Turks)</hi> whence they much troubled the Christians; that the King made ready a great Fleet in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1559. unto which, the Pope, Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the said Knights, and others, joyned their Forces, there being 100 Galleys and ships met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Sicily, Gonzaga</hi> being General; but whilst they wintred in the Haven of <hi>Marza-Moxet</hi> in <hi>Malta,</hi> many Souldiers died.</p>
               <p>Spring being come, the Captains consulted, whether first to set upon <hi>Tripolis,</hi> or <hi>Zerbi,</hi> otherwise <hi>Mening.</hi> The Knights thought best to besiege <hi>Tripolis</hi> speedily, before <hi>Dragut</hi> should come to furnish it. Others rather, first to invade <hi>Zerbi</hi> Island, where the Army might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with plenty, and whence they might, in danger, safely retire, &amp; thence go to <hi>Tripolis</hi> as time should serve: Which most agreeing to, in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1560. they sailed to <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi. Dragut</hi> the while being come to <hi>Tripolis</hi> with 800 <hi>Janizaries</hi> had also notably sortified the City, certifying <hi>Solyman</hi> of the Christians Fleets arrival: who at their first landing on <hi>Zerbi,</hi> were encounted by the <hi>Moors,</hi> whom they repulsed, and landed at pleasure. It is not far from the main, no River in it but boggs ond Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and somewhat Hilly in the middle. About 30000 men inhabited it, dwelling in low Cottages, yet is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, reasonable fertile. The Christians sent for <hi>Carvanus</hi> thither, a poor King, from whom <hi>Dragut</hi> had taken it, to use his Counsel: &amp; going with 8000 to besiege the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Castle in the Island, they lighted on 10000 <hi>Moors;</hi>

which lay in ambush in a Wood: 700 of whom being slain in skirmish by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who went foremost) the rest fled; so laying hard siege to the Castle, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fled secretly with his <hi>Turks,</hi> leaving it for the <hi>Moores</hi> to defend: who (to depart in safety) yielded the Castle: three <hi>Spanish</hi> Companies being there left, <hi>Caravanus</hi> the <hi>Moor</hi>-King (with the King of <hi>Tunis</hi>'s Sonne) came the while, to the Camp, sitting on the ground, and wisely discoursing with the Generall, how the <hi>Turks</hi> were to be removed out of <hi>Africk;</hi> but sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, a Pinnace brought newes, that <hi>Piall</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, was coming with 85 Galleys (more repairing to him daily) with a number of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s best and most approved Souldiers (for the <hi>Turks</hi> had a great opinion of the valour of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> they were doubtful also of the long journey; so many of them before setting forth, making their wills; so that all <hi>Constantinople</hi> was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused fear). The Christians were not a little troubled hereat: yet they new fortified the Castle, agreeing with the chief <hi>Moore</hi> in the Island (who had set up the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ensigns, instead of <hi>Draguts)</hi> to pay yearly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the King (as before to <hi>Dragut)</hi> 6000 Crowns, 1 <hi>Cammell,</hi> 4 <hi>Ostriches,</hi> 4 <hi>Sparrow-Hawks,</hi> and 4 blew <hi>Faulcons.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>May</hi> 9th, the Master of <hi>Malta</hi> gave those at <hi>Zerbi</hi> to understand, that the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Fleet was even at hand, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising them to get them to some more safe place, or come to him for fear of being by so great a power oppressed: whereupon, <hi>Auria</hi> the Admirall requested the Generall presently to come aboard; but he for all that, stayed at the Castle, where they had built four strong Bulwarks, not yet all perfectly finished; but whilest he is thus busie, next day, descrying the <hi>Turks</hi> from far, he hasted to be gone, with the Admiral, and was twice by a contrary wind, driven again into the Haven; so that with much adoe, they got into the Castle; for the wind brought the <hi>Turks</hi> so

fast on, that the Christians dismayed, knew not well which way to turn; but most of the Ships and 14 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, were gone the night before, and the Master of <hi>Malta</hi> had called home his, in <hi>April:</hi> of the rest, some few Galleys escaped, others ran aground, 10 whereof, were taken by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the rest that were left, though they (awhile) did what they might to save themselves. The night following, the Viceroy and Admiral, secretly got away to <hi>Malta.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auria</hi> gathered together the remainder of the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Fleer, having lost 17 Galleys, and a good part of the Ships. <hi>Don de Sandes</hi> was left as General in the Castle, with 5000 Foot, some <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> but most <hi>Spaniards:</hi> besides 1000, no Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> besieging it May 17. were notably encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and repulsed in their assaults. <hi>Dragut</hi> came at length to the siege, encreasing the battery with 15 great Pieces. The Christians also with 40 great Pieces, slew a number of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> and sallying out, fought with them, slaying and wounding many. Thus the siege continued three moneths; but in the Castle was but one great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern, which though yielding some store of water, yet was not enough to suffice so great a multitude in that hot Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and season; but was sparingly measured our to the Souldiers, as far as it would go: which some augmented by distilling Sea-water, mingling it with their allowance, till they had spent all their Wood. Many half dead lying on the ground, gaping and crying, water, water, into whose mouthes, if any one powred a little they as revived, would sit up, till for thirst they fell down again, at length giving up the Ghost.</p>
               <p>The Governour considering the great extremity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with <hi>Doude Leyva,</hi> the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Admiral, and <hi>Bellingerius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Admiral, and others to escape by night, into a Galley under the Castle; but, in so doing, were all taken: whereupon, the Souldiers, covenanting
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:130480-02:386"/>
onely for life, yielded themselves into captivity. In this expedition, about 18000 Christians one way or other, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psall</hi> sent newes hereof, by a Galley, to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> dragging (as a token) at its Poup, a great Christian En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, having the Picture of <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, the <hi>Turks</hi> exceedingly rejoysing for so great a Victory; yea, many came by heaps to the Emperours Embassador his Gate, deridingly asking his servants, if they had any Brethren, Kinsmen or friends, in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet at <hi>Zebri,</hi> saying, if they had, they should shortly see them there: bragging also of their own valour, and scorning the Christians cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, asking, Who could withstand them, now the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> also were overcome.</p>
               <p>In <hi>September,</hi> the Victorious Fleet returned, with the prisoners, spoils, and Christians Galleys, anchoring that night near the Rocks in the face of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solyman,</hi> from a Gallery near the Havens mouth, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Garden, beheld the coming in of the Fleet, <hi>De Sandes, De Leyna,</hi> and <hi>Don Bellingerus,</hi> being on the Poup of the Admiral Galley, to shew; the Christian Galleys difarmed and unrigid, were towed at the tail of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Galleys: no man perceiving in <hi>Solyman</hi>'s countenance, any sign at all of insolent joy: so capable was the great heart of that old Sire of any fortune.</p>
               <p>Few dayes after, the Captives (almost starved) were brought to Court: many could scarce stand, some fell down and fainted, others died: they were scornfully led in triumph, with Arms disorderly put upon them: the <hi>Turks</hi> insulting about them, promising themselves the Empire of the whole World, and asking, What enemy they were to fear, now the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was overcome: <hi>De Sandes</hi> was brought into the <hi>Divano,</hi> and demanded by <hi>Rustan Bassa,</hi> What his Master meant, being not able to defend his own, to invade other mens? Who answered, that it beseemed not him to judge of it: himself to have
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:130480-02:387"/>
done but his duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he had no good fortune therein. Then he besought the <hi>Bassa</hi> on his knee, to speak to <hi>Solyman</hi> to spare him, for his poor Wife &amp; small Children's sake at home. <hi>Rustan</hi> answered courteously, his Soveraign was of a mild nature, and that he was in good hope of his pardon: So he was sent to <hi>Caradines</hi> Castle; but not gone far, he was sent for back again; for the great Chamberlain had not seen him: whereat, he was much troubled, fearing the Bassaes would have put him to death. The rest, of the bettersort, were committed to <hi>Pera</hi> Castle; yet the three chief aforesaid, were with much adoe, at the Emperour's request, and his Embassadors dexterity set at liberty, though <hi>Solyman</hi> had denied them to the <hi>French</hi> Embassador, an earnest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour; yet the <hi>Mufties</hi> opinion was first asked: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many <hi>Turks</hi> might be changed for a few Christians? (for 40 common <hi>Turks</hi> were to be freed for them) who answered: some of their Doctors said it was lawful, and some, not; yet himself then resolved on the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable part. There were two other noble persons taken at <hi>Zebri, Don John Bellingerius</hi>'s Son in Law, and <hi>Don Gasto,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi>'s Son, yet a youth. <hi>Don John</hi> had ordered a great sum to be left in <hi>Chios,</hi> as the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Fleet went by, whence he got into <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Gasto</hi> was by <hi>Piall</hi> (in hope of a great Ransom) hidden; but <hi>Solyman</hi> having an inkling thereof by <hi>Rustan,</hi> laboured to have <hi>Casto</hi> sought out, to have a more just occasion to put <hi>Piall</hi> to death; but <hi>Gasto</hi> was dead, either through the Plague or <hi>Piall</hi>'s meanes, lest the truth should be found out: whose Fathers servants seeking for him with great care, he could never be heard of: yet <hi>Piall</hi> took occasion with a few Galleys, to wander among the Isles of <hi>Aegeum,</hi> as if he had something to do; but indeed, shunning the sight of his angry Lord, lest he should have answered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in bonds: till at the request of his Son <hi>Selimus,</hi> and <hi>Suleiman Bassa,</hi> the Eunuch and Chamberlain, he was

               <p>In 1561, the <hi>Turks</hi> robbed and spoiled upon the Coasts of <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> against whom <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> sending his Galleys, lost 25 by Tempest, with <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Admiral, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 18. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperour, having with long suit, and much intreaty, obtained peace of <hi>Solyman;</hi> and being well stricken in years, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Princes Elector, his Son <hi>Maximilian,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to be chose King of <hi>Romans:</hi> whereupon, an Assembly of them met at <hi>Frankford;</hi> and <hi>November</hi> 24, they chose <hi>Maximilian</hi> accordingly, solemnly crowning him: who <hi>Sept.</hi> 8th, 1562. was crowned King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> at <hi>Presburg.</hi> Unto this Assembly, came <hi>Ibraim Bassa,</hi> or <hi>Abraham Strotzza</hi> (a <hi>Polonian</hi> born) Embassador from <hi>Solyman,</hi> with Presents and Letters to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the aforesaid peace for 8 years: where having audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after much speech in setting forth his Masters great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:130480-02:388"/>
with his love towards the Emperour, and his Sonne the new chosen King, he delivered his Letters of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Emperour, notably shewing <hi>Solyman</hi>'s most insolent pride and presumption, and miserable Estate of <hi>Hungary,</hi> divided as it were at his pleasure, betwixt him and the Emperour: laying down the several conditions of the peace to be observed: promising toward the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that he should give unto that new-made friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so great Honour, Reverence, and Authority, that what might even in the least things be had, should not on his part, be wanting: in token whereof, (saith he) we have suffered certain Christian Captives, to return unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The gifts presented, were two naturall Crystall Cups, curious, and set with pretious stones: a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Horse, with a golden wrought Saddle, and Trappings set with pretious stones, and chains of pure Gold, and 4 very fair Cammels: the Bassa making excuse, that the Horse and Cammels had lost their beauty, being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lean and weary, with 4 moneths Travel. This peace held firm till the death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who about two years after <hi>July</hi> 25. died, (being 60 years old) in 1564. In whose place succeeded <hi>Maximilian</hi> his son.

But in <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Transilvanians</hi> besieged <hi>Erden,</hi> before taken by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls, and after two moneths, had it yielded to them: <hi>Chernovich</hi> also, the Emperour's Embassadour, returning from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> assured him, that the <hi>Turks</hi> meant nothing indeed, but Warres, greatly preparing by Sea and Land: Whereupon, he raised new forces, divers Nobles coming to him with their followers; and <hi>Romerus,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> and divers of his Brethren, sent by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenheim</hi> (their grand Prior in <hi>Germany,</hi> and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed a Prince of the Empire).</p>

The <hi>Turks</hi> shortly after took <hi>Neostat,</hi> which was ere long, recovered again. At the same time, a <hi>Turkish</hi> Spie was taken at <hi>Zigeth,</hi> who was sent from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to view its strength and scituarion: who said (before the Arch-Duke) that <hi>Solyman</hi> would personally come at Spring, to besiege the Castles of <hi>Zigeth</hi> and <hi>Jula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Count <hi>Serinus</hi> took also other spies, by whom he was advertized of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s coming: besides, the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Contributors to both parties, were straightly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pay no more Contribution to the Imperials: whereupon, what <hi>Suendi</hi> had often written, was easily gathered to be true: Also the <hi>Turks</hi> made daily incursions into the Emperours Territories: wherefore (being also warned by many letters) put strong Garrisons into his Frontier-Towns, chiefly <hi>Rab</hi> and <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth;</hi> but he likewise resolved to call (against the next year) a general Assembly of the Princes of the Empire at <hi>Augusta,</hi> for the better withstanding of the common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. <hi>Solyman</hi> at that time, in revenge of the manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to his Subjects, by the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> made great preparation by Sea and Land: whereunto he was much incited by <hi>Cassanes Barbarussa</hi>'s Son, King of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> and <hi>Dragut</hi> of <hi>Tripolis;</hi> and having understood in what forwardness things were, he called a great Assembly of his chief men, making known his minde in a speech for the invasion of <hi>Malta:</hi> calling the Knights crossed Pirats, whom utterly to root, he thought by God and his Prophets favour, he had now obtained leisure, which he wished for alwayes, 40 years: neither could any thing happen more pleasing or honourable, than before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to win <hi>Malta,</hi> and leave all things in order, in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> and <hi>Polonia.</hi> But some will say, (saith he), <hi>Malta</hi>

               <p>After the matter well considered, and they which best knew the strong Holds, and manners of the <hi>Malteses,</hi> had declared what they thought most expedient, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed speedily to set forward.</p>

                  <hi>John Valetta</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Grand Master, being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized hereof, by his fit Intelligencers at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was not afraid; but assembling his Knights, briefly said, The enemy, with his insatiable ambition, strength, and mortal hate against them and the Christians name was known: wherefore they should by amendment of life, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worshipping of God, first reconcile themselves to Him, by which meanes, their Ancestors obtained many Victories against the Infidels in the East; but since God usually helped not the negligent and sloathful, they must joyn those helps which their profession and the course of War required, consisting in themselves and other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes: saying, The cruel Tyrant should feel the sting of the Crosse, which he so much contemned, even in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and his Houses of pleasure; for, (saith he) we shall not have to do with him now in the Island of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> far from help of friends', inclosed with enemies by Sea and Land; but in the eyes of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in strong places, whence the enemy may be easily circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; for which, let us not cease to pray unto Almighty God. This said, all present promised rather to lose their lives, than to fail the cause, or come into <hi>Solyman</hi>'s pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> filling up the Ditch under the Bulwark, with Sacks of Tow and Earth, gave a fresh assault, 800 <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spachi</hi> being slain, and many wounded, most of whom remained in the Ditch, where they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished: 45 Christians were lost, 5 being Knights of the Order.</p>
               <p>That night, <hi>Valetta</hi> sent 200 Knights, and as many Souldiers into the Castle: who, if they had been more, with the 400 there before, might perhaps have driven the <hi>Turks</hi> from the Rampiers and Flankers, and kept the place longer.

Assoon as the <hi>Turks</hi> heard the Army was landed, there arose a wondrous confusion among them: some crying Arm, arm, and others To be gone; the greatest number, burning the Engines and Fortifications, with all speed embarqued their Ordnance and baggage: which they in St. <hi>Angelo</hi> perceiving, sallyed out (without command) to <hi>Burmola:</hi> where some <hi>Turks</hi> fleeing from a huge piece of Ordnance which they kept, they drew it within their Walls: and, had the new-come Forces charged the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as they disorderly ran to their Galleys, perhaps they had found occasion of Victory, or taken most of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery:

                  <hi>Mustapha</hi> being landed from <hi>Marza Moxet</hi> at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Port (with 7000 men) by the Fleet; and being falsly informed, the Christians were not above 3000, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched toward <hi>Melita,</hi> and at the rising of a Hill, both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies meeting, gave a great shout, the formost beginning Battel, a few being slain on both sides: but the Christians growing on them in number and strength, they fled, the Christians killing of them to their Galleys, where, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who to get in first, about 400 were drowned, besides 1800 slain. The <hi>Turks</hi> lay in the Haven all next day, and most of the night following: and upon shooting of a great piece, hoysed sayl, leaving <hi>Malta</hi> sore wasted, losing in all about 24000, most being their best Souldiers, About 5000 Christians were slain, besides 240 Knights, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably buried.

               <p>While the Christians slowly proceed, <hi>Mustapha</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding his Army into 4 parts, assaulted 4 Bulwarks of the City with greater force than before: the presence of the General, besides their natural fiercenesse, carrying the <hi>Turks</hi> head-long without peril, and the fear of life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with hope of relief, encouraging the Defendants to dare any thing: many <hi>Turks</hi> were slain and their Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

               <p>After this, some thought good (whilst they had some reasonable strength) to salley forth upon the enemy, which <hi>Dandulus</hi> in no case liked, as loath to diminish the number of the Defendants, yet he yielded to the desire of the Captains: so in the hottest time of the day, some <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> Companies under <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Albertus,</hi> issued forth, and suddenly brake into the enemies Trenches, where the <hi>Turks</hi> were playing and sleeping.

               <p>All hope of long holding out now almost lost, the Defendants scarcely shewing their Heads without danger, They sent out skilful Scouts to the Country people (who in great multitudes had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The <hi>Bassa</hi> did this, doubting the coming of the Christian Fleet, and his Army being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled with diseases; but the Souldiers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, they yet doubted not of their own strength, being ready to endure any thing, rather than prefer the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain friendship of an unknown prince, before the favour of such worthy Princes as they had so good experience of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bassa</hi> grieved and enraged, made ready for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, promising great things to those who should first or second mount the Walls: encouraging them with the small number and feeblenesse of their enemies, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of hoped rewards and end of their labours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some he reproved in that general assault; some mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of promises, others of disgrace, with their thick shot and Ordnance suffered none to stand safely on the walls: by whose ruines, and in other places they attempted with scaling-Ladders to enter, which they maintained for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dayes without intermission, fresh men still coming on: yet the Defendants performed what was possible for so few to do: still in hope that relief might come by the approach of the Christian Fleet.

These getting up, others followed, so taking the Bulwarks, and presently other Companies standing ready in divers places with Ladders, recovered the top of the Walls.

Upon the Alarm, some Captains came speedily with their Companies to the Walls, as <hi>Eugenius</hi> who crying out to some he met, not so cowardly to flee, and staying others, was slain with a small shot: Other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains also in other places labouring in vain, to stay the fleeing Souldiers. The Defendants now gathered into the Market place, but the Citizens stood in the entrance of their Houses, fearfully expecting their own and their Countries destruction.

After this, he came down into the City, and seeing those in the Market-place fight as despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, in a Ring, he bent murdering-pieces upon them: Whereupon they laid down their Weapons,, yielding to mercy. By and by all the Gates were strongly guarded, that none should go in or out. <hi>Dandulus</hi> with the Bishop of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and the other Nobles, and better sort of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, stood on their guard in the Town-Hall: to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Babes were taken from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Virgins ravished: women before their Husbands faces abused, Temples spoiled, and all places filled with mourning and dead bodies, for in the City was slain that day 14866 persons.

               <p>Ere long, <hi>Mustapha</hi> leaving a strong Garrison in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosia,</hi> marched to besiege <hi>Famagusta:</hi> for terrours-sake, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them by a Country fellow in a Basket <hi>Dandulus</hi>'s Head, sending before him divers Horsmen, who upon their staves, carried the Heads of many slain Nobles: so riding in triumph about the Walls: but they of <hi>Fama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusta</hi> not terrified thereby to yield, he encamped about 3 miles off: and casting up divers Mounts, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced battery against the Tower defending the Haven.

               <p>
                  <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Piall,</hi> in doubt of the Fleets coming, then at <hi>Creet,</hi> sent out 6 Galliots to discover the Christians do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who returning with some prisoners taken in <hi>Creet,</hi> declared what they heard, and that the Christian Fleet was on their way to <hi>Cyprus:</hi> Whereupon, the <hi>Bassaes</hi> set forward from before <hi>Famagusta</hi> towards <hi>Limisso</hi> to meet them: who were coming between the Isles <hi>Caprathos</hi> and <hi>Rhodes:</hi> but there hearing that <hi>Nicosia</hi> was lost, and
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:130480-02:418"/>
that the <hi>Turks</hi> were come to besiege <hi>Famagusta,</hi> they called a Council, to consult what best to do. <hi>Columnus</hi> then chief Commander, and <hi>Zanius,</hi> thought it best to hold on and relieve <hi>Famagusta,</hi> because it was like, that the <hi>Turks</hi> proud of Victory, for desire of prey, had left their Fleet but slenderly manned: alledging also, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates express decree, to give The <hi>Turks</hi> battel; but <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> thinking of the matter as it was: said, <hi>He marvelled how the</hi> Venetian <hi>Senatours, sitting at ease in Counsel, before knowledge of their own and enemies strength, the nature of the Countrey, and purpose of their foes, could determine what were fit for martial men to do, to whose actions no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule could be prescribed: and besides, divers difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wants alleadged; he said, he had express command from the King of</hi> Spain <hi>to return to</hi> Messana <hi>before Winter: Wherefore, when the month was out he would depart. Zanius</hi> urged <hi>Auria</hi> to proceed: saying, <hi>So great ayd was not sent from the Pope and King only for reliefe of</hi> Nicosia, <hi>but to deliver the whole Island from the danger of the</hi> Turk. Divers great Captains were of <hi>Aurias</hi>'s opinion, as <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> who said, <hi>Nothing was to be done as might rashly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose unto casualty or power of the enemy; the Fortune &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of the Christian Common weal, greatly hazarded in that Fleet: that longer stay might bring further danger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Upon which so fowl a disagreement, the Fleet began to return back, every Admiral now by himself leading his own Fleet: <hi>Auria</hi> after 2 dayes wondrous tossing at sea, came to <hi>Caprathos:</hi> thence with much ado arriving in <hi>Creet:</hi> whence by a Messenger, he requested leave of <hi>Columnus,</hi> presently to return home: who answered, He would give him none, charging him to keep company with the rest of the Fleet till it were past <hi>Zant;</hi> for if they should not passe safely by their enemies Countrey, it should be imputed to his dishonor, who had forsaken his friends, and not to them; but <hi>Auria</hi> answered, The wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> consisted in that Fleet's safety,
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:130480-02:419"/>
and therefore he could not stay to go with their heavy Galleasses and other ships, which must oft be towed. Yet it was deemed he sought occasion (accounting himself the better man at sea) to withdraw from the command of <hi>Columnus.</hi> After a while thus reasoning the matter, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> without leave came to <hi>Messana</hi> in <hi>Sicily:</hi> the other two not staying long after him, but with much trouble at sea, <hi>Columnus</hi> arrived in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Zanius</hi> at <hi>Corcyra.</hi> In this idle expedition many thousands of valiant men lost their lives of divers diseases, from change of diet, and the weathers unseasonablenesse in that hot Climate: <hi>Marte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningus</hi> with most of his 3000 Souldiers, sent for defence of <hi>Famagusta</hi> perishing also. <hi>Barbaricus</hi> was sent to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra</hi> to discharge <hi>Zanius</hi> of his Admiralship, and send him prisoner to <hi>Venice; Venerius</hi> Governour of the Isle being put in his room.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bassaes</hi> at sea, were not a little proud of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Fleet's departure; yet the seas growing rough, and no enemy appearing, they left 7 Galleys before <hi>Famagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta</hi> to hinder it from relief that way, departing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <hi>Piall</hi> with the greatest part to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Haly</hi> with the rest to the <hi>Rhodes:</hi> fraughting a great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and 2 tall ships, with the richest of the spoil of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosia,</hi> and choise of the prisoners for a present to <hi>Selimus;</hi> but being ready to hoyse sail, as they were carrying out of the Gallion, some barrels of Gunpowder, which <hi>Mustapha</hi> had commanded to be landed, a Noble Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Captive fired the powder, which rent the Gallion with the other two ships in pieces, blowing up all that was therein, none escaping with life but the Master of the Gallion and 2 captives; but the <hi>Bassaes</hi> following their resolution, <hi>Piall</hi> came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was then, and all winter making, as if <hi>Selimus</hi> (next year) purposed some greater matter,</p>
               <p>While <hi>Venerius</hi> yet lay at <hi>Corcyra,</hi> the theevish and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Acroceraunians,</hi> promised to deliver to him the

strong Castle of <hi>Caymera</hi> kept by 300 <hi>Turks,</hi> if with a few Galleys and fit number of foot, he would come into the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> offering him good Hostages for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: who forthwith went thither, landing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Horsmen and 3000 Foot, and presently 1000 of those Mountain-people coming to them, they took the Hill, repulsing the <hi>Turks</hi> coming for relief of the Castle: they therein next night let themselves down with Ropes, but were all taken or slain: a strong Christian Garrison being put into it. Ere long, Couragious <hi>Quirinus</hi> the Vice-Admiral besieged a strong Castle in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> by sea and Land, which the <hi>Turks</hi> had built 2 years before to trouble the Christian passage. He took it in 5 hours, putting 500 <hi>Turks</hi> to the sword, and razing it, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 25 great Ordnance into <hi>Zant.</hi>

               <p>While <hi>Mustapha</hi> lay before <hi>Famagusta, Bragadine</hi> the Governour, and <hi>Balcone</hi> a most expert Captain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>Turks</hi> great Army, with-their cunning Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, were much moved: Wherefore, they entreated <hi>Ragazonius</hi> Bishop of the City to go to the Senate, in so great danger to crave their ayd (joyning to him <hi>Donatus</hi> a noble <hi>Cypriot);</hi> he was at first loath, in such danger, to leave his Flock, but was at length overcome by entreaty and tears: and loosing out of the Haven about Sun-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a fair gale, passed thorow the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet laying at Anchor. Being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> he declared to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate (as before to <hi>Zanius</hi> at <hi>Creet)</hi> the danger of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Enemie's strength, and Defendants weaknesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such a multitude, and want of necessaries to hold out <hi>&amp;c. Zanius</hi> then Admiral, sent 4 tall ships (laden with Victual and Gunpowder, with 1700 choise Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) from <hi>Creet</hi> to <hi>Famagusta,</hi> appointing <hi>Quirinus</hi> with 12 of the best Galleys to conduct them thither. <hi>Zanius</hi> at his departure to <hi>Venice,</hi> though he knew it required haste, yet left it to his discretion when and how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that service, who (the seas being then full of the
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:130480-02:420"/>
                  <hi>Turks</hi> Galleys) stayed till Winter was well spent, and so setting forward, <hi>Jan.</hi> 17. 1571. He kept aloof from the ships, who came directly before <hi>Famagusta,</hi> hoping, the <hi>Turks</hi> Galleys might be drawn further into the sea in hope of booty, himself fitly staying out of sight. The <hi>Turks</hi> upon Day-dawning, made hastily toward them from the Harbours mouth; but <hi>Quirinus</hi> desirous to fight with them, shewed himself before the enemy came nigh the ships: who presently with all speed retired. But <hi>Quirinus</hi> following them faster, they were glad to run 3 Galleys aground, and get ashoar, which 3 he beat to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his Ordnance, sore gauling the other 4. The Haven cleared, he brought the ships with the supply to <hi>Famagusta,</hi> for which there was great joy. <hi>Quirinus</hi> coming forth again, and roaming up and down at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, took 2 enemies ships coming to the Camp, richly laden; enriching his Souldiers therewith, doing great harm in divers places along the coast of <hi>Pamphylia:</hi> so returning to <hi>Famagusta,</hi> he perswaded the Garrison to remember their wonted valour, that the Christian Fleet would be with them next summer to raise the siege. So having in 20 dayes dispatched that he came for he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Creet</hi> in 5 dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> having knowledge hereof, was so highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, that he beheaded the Governour of <hi>Chios,</hi> disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Governour of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> who should have kept those seas: He displaced also <hi>Piall Bassa.</hi> making <hi>Partau</hi> Admiral, because it was supposed he might have (the year before) discomfited the Christian Fleet at <hi>Creet.</hi>

<pb n="827" facs="tcp:130480-02:420"/>
joyned divers Cardinals, to compose such differences as should arise betwixt the Commissioners for the King and the <hi>Venetians:</hi> but so soon as they were set together in Consultation, They began to jarre about the capitulation of the said League. The ostner they sate, the farther off: if one difficulty were by the discretion of some appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, at the next meeting arose 3 others; but the chief dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was about the proportioning of the charge, the <hi>Spanish</hi> seeking to turn the greatest part thereof on the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and they on them: and with such earnestness, as if they had met for bettering their particular states, rather than for the common good; for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (the War being risen between the <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Turk,</hi> and, through the Popes indulgence, raising vast summs of mony upon his Clergy) cared not for entring into any further League with the <hi>Venetians:</hi> but as it were in courtesie to send them a yearly ayd for a defensive lingting War: and so to keep the <hi>Turk</hi>'s busied upon them farther off from his Territories: but the <hi>Venetians</hi> were even for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons moved to shorten the War, whose Customs also were greatly impaired, and their Traffique almost quite cut off. Thus was all the last year, and a great part of this, spent in turbulent conferences, but uothing concluded, which troubled the <hi>Venetians</hi> not a little, being of themselves too weak for so mighty an enemy as <hi>Selimus;</hi> but on a sudden and unexpected, they might choose either to joyn in League with the Pope and the King, or agree with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus:</hi> for <hi>Muhamet</hi> the chief <hi>Bassa</hi> devised how to cross the rising of <hi>Mustapha</hi> the Competitour of his Honor, and to help the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to whom he was much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

                  <hi>Bragadine</hi> and <hi>Theupolus</hi> were oft commanded to lay down their Heads: yet was their execution deferred for a more exquisite punishment and torture; for next day, <hi>Bragadine</hi> having his eares cut off, was brought forth to be wondred at, and dispoiled of Jewels and Attire, he was forced to carry baskets of earth to repair the Rampiers; as he passed by, the proud <hi>Bassa</hi> insulting to have him kisse the ground at his feet. And so, buffeted with their fists, and spurned with their feet; he was asked, Whether he hoped Christ would come to help or not? whose comly countenance and long beard, even in that extream misery, added to him a certain grace. The Christians could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this well stay tears, nor let them fall, fearing the <hi>Turks</hi> displeasure; but the cruel and foresworn <hi>Bassa,</hi> caused that noble and worthy <hi>Bragadine</hi> to be set in a Chair, and his skin to be flain off quick, in which horrible torture, he was not heard to let fall any unbeseeming word, but calling on Gods mercy, and detesting the <hi>Turks</hi> perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treachery, he breathed out his life: the Tyrant set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

The <hi>Venetian</hi> and Pope's Admiral went to meet him, all the heaviness of his long-staying being turned into triumph and joy; with a most assured hope of Victory. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet consisted of 108 Galleys, 6 Galleasses, 2 tall Ships, and a great number of small Galliots: 12 Galleys of the Pope being joyned to them under <hi>Columnius. Don John</hi> and <hi>Auria</hi> had 81 Galleys, 3 being from the Knights of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> In the Fleet besides Marriners were reckoned 10000 fighting men, old beaten-Souldiers being almost through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Army intermixed: divers coming as voluntary men; who being noble persons, had many favorites and followers, strong, and of their own charge bravely armed; and seeking for no pay, but honour of Victory, or to spend their lives for defence of the Christian faith. Of these honourable and resolute men, <hi>Fernesius</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> (whose untimely death in the Low-countries, even his honourable Enemies lamented), <hi>Maria</hi> Prince of <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ursinus</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Ursini</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> were of greatest mark. A Councel was now called, to which was admitted only <hi>Don John</hi> (the General) <hi>Rechizenes</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quizenius</hi> the Generals Lievtenant, or rather Directour: <hi>Venerius, Barbadicus</hi> General proveditour to him, and one Secretary, <hi>Columna</hi> the Pope's Admiral, with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi> his kinsman: the chief point to resolve on (being) Whether they should adventure a battel against so strong an enemy, or only seek to defend their own Frontiers? <hi>Requisenius</hi> speaking first, said, The Enemies strength was before battel necessarily to be known, wherefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay was to be used, lest improvident care overthrew all, highly commending the advice of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> who counselled great Commanders not to sight with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:130480-02:428"/>
but upon some great advantage, or forced by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shewing they had neither: and propounding to them the uncertain events of things, and the enemies strength by sea and Land much exceeding theirs, and what a heap of miseries was like to overwhelm the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, if they should miscarry in any thing; he said, Safe advice was to be preferred before that attended with greater danger.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Venetians, Venerius</hi> and <hi>Barbadicus,</hi> most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly requested the General and the rest, so soon, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity served, to commit the matter to triall of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; saying, If desire of honour moved them not, should not the spoiling of their Frontiers; the insolency of their enemies which they encreased by delay, move them? So urging battel from many Arguments: then they began to entreat &amp; beseech them not to suffer the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale to receive loss upon loss, but to repose their only hope in the good success of one worthy battel, and never look for the like opportunity, if they let slip the present: After a thorow-debate, They heard the opinion of other notable Captains in the Fleet: Whereof <hi>Cornea</hi> and <hi>Sebellio Spaniards</hi> being asked, With most substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reasons declared the necessity of giving battel; and that it was not so dangerous as to be shunned or delayed: since the violent enemy must not fight at sea (as at Land) with his huge multitude of men: which their opinion, generally well liked of, was soon after by the General and the rest approved, and a resolution taken to give battel; which known, every day seemed to the rejoycing Army nothing but a delay of a most assured Victory.</p>
               <p>Next day, the Admirals brought forth their Fleets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the open sea: <hi>Auria</hi> was placed in the right-wing with 53 Galleys, <hi>Barbadicus</hi> with so many in the left: in the middle stood the General with 70 Galleys, on his right hand <hi>Columnius,</hi> on his left <hi>Venerius,</hi> betwixt the Wings and middle-Battel, was space but for 3 Galleys to row
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:130480-02:429"/>
in the rear followed <hi>Requisenius,</hi> great Commander of <hi>Castile; Fernesius</hi> followed <hi>Columnius</hi> with the Admiral Galley of <hi>Genua:</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Urbin</hi> with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Galley of <hi>Savoy. Jordanus</hi> was betwixt the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-Battel and left-wing. <hi>Justinian</hi> betwixt that and the right with the <hi>Malta</hi> Galleys. About half a mile behind, followed <hi>Bacianus</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Neopolitane</hi> Fleet with 30 Galleys, to be at all times ready for relief of this or that part: the 6 Galleasses like Castles, conducted by most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert <hi>Dodus</hi> were before the Fleet about a mile, 2 before each Wing, and 2 before the middle-Battel, with equal space, answering the whole breadth of the front of the Fleet, almost 5 miles: serving it instead of Bulwarks.</p>
               <p>All the Galleys kept a convenient space one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the Wings, as in the main Battel, were the Pope's, Kings, and <hi>Venetian</hi>-Galleys indifferently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, for the more mutual care of reliefs-sake. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> with 8 <hi>Sicily</hi> Galleys, and 2 Galliots was to go 10 miles before to descry what he could, and returning to joyn his Galleys equally to the wings. In this sort they ere long came to <hi>Paxo:</hi> and next day <hi>Don John</hi> finding (upon view) the <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleys to be but weakly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ordered 4000 <hi>Spaniards</hi> and 1000 <hi>Italians</hi> to be put aboord them where most need was. There was one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany under <hi>Mutius</hi> their Captain, an unquiet and furious man, who aboord the Galley of <hi>Galergus,</hi> first fell to words with the Captain, and after much stir to plain fight, as well Souldiers as Captains, <hi>Mutius</hi> being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all the stir: <hi>Venerius</hi> hearing hereof, sent his own Captain to appease the tumult, who in the midst of the furious multitude, was fouly entreated by <hi>Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and divers that came with him shrewdly beaten: which <hi>Venerius</hi> (of a hot nature) taking, as done in disgrace of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having hung up <hi>Mutius</hi> and his Ensign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer at the Yards-arm, to the great offence of all the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> The General also full of choler and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:130480-02:429"/>
complained, that himself was not a little wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; that it became every Commander to know what belonged to his place, and not to encroach upon his betters: so would the conditions of the League be the better kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> threatning (if he had not a publike and honourable amends) by force of Arms to redresse his wrong; and, the League being broken, to carry away with him the Kings Galleys: Some also laying more coals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fire. <hi>Venerius</hi> sent him word, He should do well to moderate his anger, and advise at leisure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so should he plainly see, never was more just or wholsome executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done on any than on those mutinous: but if through the heat of youth, he should attempt any more violent course than stood with the common quiet, no marvel if he afterward repented, he being also in Arms, and ready to shew himself a man. The matter was not far only from breaking the League, but even at the point to have set all on a broil; but <hi>Columnius</hi> with all his power laboured to cure the wounded mind of <hi>Don John,</hi> and by divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to appease his anger, using also this Similitude; King <hi>Philip</hi> had many Kingdoms: Now, if any <hi>Milla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> had committed any capital crime in <hi>Naples,</hi> should the Judgement thereof be of right referred to the King himself, or to the Governour of <hi>Millane?</hi> or rather to the Magistrate of <hi>Naples,</hi> in whose jurisdiction the fact was committed, and so of, right there to be executed? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> then, but that <hi>Mutius</hi> might seem justly to be punished by <hi>Venerius,</hi> who though a <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain, had yet raised a mutiny in the <hi>Venetian</hi>-Galley under his command; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the discipline of War (he said) sometimes required a severe and exemplary kind of punishment. Wherefore <hi>Clearchus</hi> notably and truly said, A General ought to be more feared of his Souldiers, than the enemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, he had discharged his own duty in dealing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully, only he would pray to God, with merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye to behold the troubled Christian Common-weale
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:130480-02:430"/>
in such a most dangerous time. Thus was the mutiny hardly appeased: yet, <hi>Don John</hi> not enduring so much as to come into <hi>Venerius</hi>'s company; all things of Counsel was done by <hi>Barbadicus,</hi> not beneath <hi>Venerius</hi> in valour, but far beyond him in discretion: of a tall and goodly perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and of temperate speech, being greatly honoured and beloved of all; He also chiefly endeavoured to further the attonement between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Venetians;</hi> so they came from <hi>Paxo</hi> to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> thence to <hi>Cephalenia,</hi> where, by Letters from <hi>Contarenus</hi> Governour of <hi>Zant,</hi> they heard, that the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet (333 sail of all sorts) lay in the gulf of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> Whereupon, purposing to go to <hi>Petala</hi> a Haven opposite to the Rock, <hi>Corzulares,</hi> and so to <hi>Lepanto,</hi> they (by contrary winds) put back again into another Port of the Island <hi>Cephalenia)</hi> heard (by the way) from <hi>Creet,</hi> that <hi>Famagusta</hi> was lost, whereat they were rather enflamed with desire of revenge; so staying at the good Harbour of <hi>Galanga</hi> one night, they purposed next day to go to the mouth of the gulf of <hi>Lepanto</hi> to dare the <hi>Turks</hi> to battel. <hi>Partau</hi> &amp; <hi>Haly,</hi> upon the approach of the Christian Fleet, consulted with their Captains, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give battel, or keep still within their safe Harbour, who were of divers opinions. <hi>Chiroche</hi> a most Noble and ancient Captain, exhorted the <hi>Bassaes,</hi> in no case, when no need was, upon vain glory to adventure all to the fortune of battel, and that on divers considerations: not to go out (he said) at the enemies pleasure, but when they saw good themselves, when the enemy was not so well provided; so should they without great labour or danger, attain to the full of their own desires. <hi>Partau</hi> thought, the Christians would not at all offer him battel, and as one indifferent, and loath to incurre blame, appeared ready to stay or set forward, as the most part should think best; but <hi>Haly</hi> of a hotter spirit, could not endure to hear but of present battel: the pleasure of <hi>Selimus,</hi> hope of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. the displeasure <hi>Piall Bassa</hi> had incurred, inducing him
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:130480-02:430"/>
to accept thereof, if offered; <hi>Caracoza</hi> also a famous Pirate, in a swift Galliot viewing the Christian Fleet, had reported it to be much less than it was, deceived ('twas thought) by not fully viewing it through his posting haste, or blinded by the Island laying behind the Fleet; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the <hi>Turks</hi> greatly rejoyced, dreaming now onely of Victory; so that <hi>Haly</hi> would needs fight, hoping the Christians at first sight of them, would retire or flee, or fighting at so great odds, receive a notable overthrow: which opinion was also confirmed by the perswasion of <hi>Cassanes Barbarussa</hi>'s son, <hi>Uluzales</hi> and <hi>Chais Beg</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> all of great experience, chiefly in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters; So that though <hi>Partau</hi> stood wavering, and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roche</hi> with the Governours of <hi>Cicilia</hi> and <hi>Euboea</hi> were against it, yet <hi>Haly</hi>'s Authority or rather importunity, prevailed, although 2 other espials returning, told the <hi>Bassaes</hi> (as it was) that the Christian Fleet, with much more number than was supposed, were coming with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes displayed, to fight: whereat, they exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, demanded, whether the formost galleys were all <hi>Venetians</hi> or not? who answering, they were intermixt with <hi>Spanish</hi> and others, they became exceeding pensive; yet being well furnished and Victualled, taking in 12000 <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahies</hi> in the <hi>Bay</hi> out of divers garrisons, and 4000 other Souldiers, and that they could not with honour shrink back, they held their former resolution; So <hi>Partau</hi> calling together the chief Commanders and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by a speech encouraged them: concluding, they should so set forward, as if they saw the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self encouraging them, and giving them the signal of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, of his bounty, and the present Victory, expecting all felicity and bliss; which comfortable speech so encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Turks,</hi> that with one voyce and mind (and still possessed with the first report of <hi>Caracoza)</hi> they seemed to desire nothing more than battel, and thinking only of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Victory; and coming out of the gulf with great cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:130480-02:431"/>

Likewise <hi>Auria</hi> and <hi>Barbadicus</hi> ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by all comfortable speeches to encourage their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: concluding, to make (they said) the enemies (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for the Conquest of <hi>Cyprus)</hi> short, before they had well tasted the pleasure thereof: and all the Captains left nothing unsaid that might hearten their men on; or undone, that might further the Victory. The <hi>Turks</hi> also (though it was fallen out much contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) encouraged with former Victories, with a fair gale, came orderly and gallantly on in form of a half-Moon; their fortunate Ensigne: yet the Sun shining full in their faces, so dazled their eyes, that they could not well see to direct their galleys to their most advantage; They had 250 galleys, 50 galliots, 20 Brigandines, and other small Vessels: the middle battel was conducted by <hi>Haly</hi> and <hi>Partau;</hi> attended on by many of great account and place, and for experience at sea, the chief strength of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Empire. <hi>Mahomet Bey</hi> commanded the right wing with 56 galleys, and <hi>Uluzales</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Algiers,</hi> an old Arch-Pirate, the left, with 95 galleys.

The Instruments of War had scarce well sounded, but all shook with confused cries &amp; noise, flames of fire, thundering of Artillery, many being so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonied, that on a sudden, they almost lost the use of sight and hearing: even showers of Arrowes and Darts being mixt with shot: the Masts broken, Sail-yards struck down, Tackle rent, and all confused with horrour and fear. <hi>Haly</hi> ran upon the Admiral-galley with such violence, as if he would have presently stemmed her; but being with like force opposed, they met so violently, that, both their beakes fell into the sea with the feaze. In the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galley of the Christians were 400 select men, most Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Antients, who forcing the furious enemies to shrink back, entred their galley even to the main-Mast, who by new supply repulsed the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> clearing their galley again, many on both sides being wounded and slain, <hi>Don John</hi> sending in new supply, the other more lustily than before charged the <hi>Turks,</hi> who with like hope and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The enemy having slain many, pressing on more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and fighting close together, entred the prow of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerius</hi>'s galley, now bared of Defendants: who had been overcome, had not <hi>Lauretanus</hi> and <hi>Malipetra</hi> speedily come to their relief: whereby they which fiercely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed the <hi>Venetian</hi> galleys, were now glad to defend their own: but in process of this indifferent battel, these 2 worthy Captains, were slain with small shot, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enraged than discouraged their Souldiers; so that they desperately pressed in upon the <hi>Turks:</hi> the terrour of the batrel being turned upon the Victours: 2 of their galleys being taken after their great slaughter, and <hi>Partau</hi> in a Long boat escaping out of the battel. <hi>Columnius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hardly assailed other <hi>Turks</hi> galleys, and made great slaughter, taking one, and disordering the other: <hi>Lignius</hi> also in the thickest of his enemies made a notable fight; many an enemy falling about: <hi>Fernesius, Rueres, Ursinus, Cornea,</hi> and <hi>Justinian</hi> most couragiously fighting. <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roche</hi> or <hi>Mahomet Bey,</hi> coming forward against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's left-wing, was (ere aware) beaten with the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Some in all places bewailing their Parents, Children, Husbands, Friends, or Kinsmen, lost: but <hi>Selimus</hi>'s greatest grief, was for losse of so many expert Captains, skilful Masters, and notable Souldiers; besides, the perpetual disgrace of him and his Posterity: Wherefore, full of wrath, he was about to put to death the multitude of Christians in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: doubting indeed, that they weary of <hi>Turkish</hi> thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would rise up armed against him, and take part with
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:130480-02:436"/>
the other Christians; but whilest the other Bassaes (as dismayed) stood silent: <hi>Muhamet,</hi> for his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts in great favour, thought good to prove if his fury might by reasonable perswasion, be mitigated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet knowing the danger of an open contradiction of him, he, leaning as it were to his opinion and pleasure, by little and little, to draw him from himself, cunningly disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him by a speech from so rigorous a resolution, by filling his head with most necessary considerations: whose grace and Authority was such, that the Tyrants wrath was well asswaged; but by <hi>Uluzales</hi>'s coming, he was fully quieted; who after excuse of himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what himself had done in the Battel, presenting an Ensign of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> told him also, the Christian Fleet was so torn, that it could not possible be made serviceable against the next year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> the while, placing <hi>Uluzales</hi> in the stead of <hi>Haly Bassa,</hi> straightly commanded new shipping to be built night and day, and enjoyned every Governour to have a Galley or two ready by next Spring, out of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: many of his great men, putting to their helping hands; new supplies of Souldiers, Ordnance cast, and all necessaries were put into his frontier Towns, &amp; provided. So the <hi>Turks</hi> had reason and industry, but the Christians, (some note) wanted discretion to use the Victory.</p>
               <p>The three great Commanders consulted, what further course to take; but Winter beginning to approach, and the Fleet wanting Furniture and Men, <hi>Don John,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnius</hi> returned to <hi>Messana;</hi> and thence departing, the <hi>Don</hi> came to <hi>Naples,</hi> the other to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were with great joy and triumph received, having resolved with <hi>Venerius,</hi> to meet next April at <hi>Corcyra:</hi> yet the <hi>Venetians</hi> grieved with the losse of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> added to their Navy 30 Galleys, with 6000 Souldiers, winning <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> Castle in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and recovering <hi>Suppato,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> now upon their approach forsook, <hi>Canalis</hi> also

with the Galleys of <hi>Creet,</hi> took many Vessels passing from <hi>Famagusta</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> laden with the spoils and Captives. An inward heartburning stil remaining between <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Venerius,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> requested the <hi>Venetians</hi> for another Admirall: who were wonderful loath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to gratifie the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> yet not forgetting what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity came by Concord, and what evils of discord, they chose one <hi>Fuscarinus,</hi> their chief Governour in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> (who for 14 moneths, had notably repressed the furious incursions of the <hi>Turks):</hi> which honourable place, with the belonging Ceremonies, he received not at <hi>Venice,</hi> as the manner was, but at <hi>Jadera:</hi> whence, sailing in the Admiral Galley to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> he found old <hi>Venerius,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for all things, as if himself should still have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Admiral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuscarinus,</hi> preparing at <hi>Corcyra</hi> against Spring, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinengus,</hi> who had the Charge of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> by the counsel of <hi>Venerius,</hi> (now returned to <hi>Venice)</hi> landed his men, befieging <hi>Castronovum</hi> on <hi>Istria</hi>'s borders: where he took the Suburbs, and soon brought the Town to great extremity; but the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a great power, he with all speed returned to the Sea. The <hi>Turks</hi> likewise, built a great strong Fort, to hinder the strong Town <hi>Cataro,</hi> from any relief by Sea; for by Land it was already environed by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superantius</hi> hereupon, with 20 Galleys, manned with the most choise Souldiers, and some other Galleys which met him by the way, came by night before the Bay of <hi>Cataro,</hi> leaving one part at Anchor before the Fort; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with the other, passing further into the Bay: the <hi>Turks</hi> shooting at them from the Fort, to small purpose in the dark, after viewing of the Fort; he battered it on that side, as did the Galleys on the other side, and landing their men on both sides, by plain force entred it, putting every one of that <hi>Turkish</hi> Garrison to the sword: the Fort was five hundred paces long, not strong towards

Land, whence was no such fear: they took seventeen great Ordnance, much Armour, and abundance of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and seven Galleys under the Fort; so <hi>Superantius</hi> returned to <hi>

                  <hi>Fuscarinus,</hi> in 1572, (all things being ready) sent <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantius</hi> the Providetor, to <hi>Messana</hi> with 25 Galleys, to hasten <hi>Don John</hi>'s coming, and attend him; but he there found such small preparation, as well shewed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> small care for repressing the <hi>Turks:</hi> who with grief and indignation, complaining to himself of their unfaithfulness, bewailing his Countrey and the Christian Commonwealth; for the <hi>Don</hi> had solemnly promised, all should be in readiness, but much of the Summer was past, when scarce a few Companies, and 50 Galleys were met at <hi>Messana.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Selimus</hi> fearing to be driven quite out of the Sea, had built and repaired 200 Galleys, charging <hi>Uluzales,</hi> to beware of the like danger, not to go out of the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi> or fight but upon advantage, or even hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uluzales</hi> now Admiral, threatned revenge upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with fire and sword: which much troubled them at <hi>Venice,</hi> as well acquainted with his fury; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>Barbarus</hi> their Embassador, in safe custody at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> certified them, that he told 250 Galleys, when they set forward, besides some others to meet them: therefore to beware of encountring, but on equall strength.</p>
               <p>It was also reported, that King <hi>Philip,</hi> careless of the other Warres, was about to turn his forces upon <hi>Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Algiers,</hi> (as he did the year following.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> were even at their wits end, the Senate sitting and consulting from Sun-rising to Sun-setting, daily: commanding <hi>Fuscarinus,</hi> whether the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates came in or not, to set forward, and not refuse Battel with the hovering Enemy, if he saw any good hope of Victory: calling also earnestly on the Pope and King, to
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:130480-02:437"/>
hasten their forces to encounter their Enemy, before he should come out of his own Seas. They put also <hi>Don John</hi> often in minde of his place, the time, and danger of the time; entreating him, if possible, to add something to that haste, which so important a cause required: who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, delayed from day to day, telling them, he would by and by come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was so far from his thought, that he called back <hi>Requisenius</hi> also, whom he had sent with 20 Galleys to <hi>Corcyra. Superantius,</hi> (two moneths, fittest for Warre, vainly spent) with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, importuned him to hasten: who answered, The <hi>Venetians</hi> requested but reason, <hi/> but he was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that the <hi>French</hi> King pretending the suppressing of Pirates, had a great Fleet at <hi>Rochel,</hi> intending to invade <hi>Spain,</hi> now they were busied against the <hi>Turk,</hi> he being commanded from the King, not to depart from <hi>Messana</hi> till he had other order: The <hi>Venetians</hi> much doubted of this excuse; for the <hi>French</hi> King hearing hereof, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly offended, protesting, if troubles at home would permit him, he would gladly give them ayd in that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous War: many thought, also, that had a great power in this delay. <hi>Superantius</hi> weary, and almost out of hope of any help in time from the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> yet would not give him occasion in so dangerous a time to fall quite off: however, he spake not flatteringly of the matter, but gravely declared, he thought Heaven would sooner have fallen, than <hi>Don John,</hi> not at the appointed time have come to <hi>Corcyra:</hi> beseeching and wishing him to beware, he brought not the common State into some great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, pressing him with divers reasons drawn from the common good and truth it self; but the Kings pleasure was to be preferred before all reasons and dangers. Yet hearing the resolute command of the Senate to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, he fearing, if without his help, he should gain the Victory, he wou'd take all the glory to himself; but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, it would turn to his utter reproach, who had

They were hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, nor did they consent, till 'twas decreed not to joyn Battel, but with their Galleons and Galleasses in the front; so sailing to <hi>Commentitia, Don John</hi> wrote to them, He was commanded by the King, to come and joyn with them, which he promised, so soon as possible to do, being first to be provided of all necessaries; they the while, to be careful of all things.</p>

Hereat, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commanders were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly troubled and grieved; for it seemed not credible, that they which were but a little before come from the most fertile Country of <hi>Sicily,</hi> could so soon want Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; so murmuring by divers expressions against the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> they said, Verily, they by the infamy of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary return, shewed themselves not so willing to have the <hi>Turks</hi> power abated, as the strength of the <hi>Venetians</hi> not encreased. Sometimes they fretted at these things among themselves: and other whiles, <hi>Fuscarinus</hi> expostulated the same with <hi>Don John</hi> and <hi>Columnius,</hi> in the presence of the greatest Councellours: shewing, not only how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but how necessary perseverance was in Martial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: perswading the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for many reasons, in no case to return from the Enemy; and promising, that till the ships laden with Victuals at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> were (being first sent for) come, himself would supply their wants out of his own store. <hi>Don John</hi> replied, among many things in answer, That the action in hand, no less concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and that he had in his life, desired nothing more, than to stand the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale in stead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither desired any thing more, than indeed to be a most constant upholder of the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian League, and that beyond expectation, even in the judgement of the <hi>Venetians</hi> themselves: who yet, must now pardon him, if he gave place to the necessity of the time. As for their offer of Victuals, that would not be a help, but the destruction of both Fleet's: Wherefore, 'twere much better to preserve the Fleet which they might use next year, than to cast it away by famine &amp; rage of the sea; saying, What an indignity should the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans sustain, if themselves should be overthrown, by that

But when the Instrument should have been made, one of the <hi>Dons</hi> Secreraries, advising him of the great dishonour to be to the King and himself, that the Fleet coming out of fruitful <hi>Sicily,</hi> should (in a months space want Victuals) changed his mind, only requesting <hi>Fuscarinus</hi> to credit him and <hi>Columnius</hi> concerning that want: promising, if he met with the Victuals sent for on the way, he would forthwith return; but the while, to proceed by common consent to what was most needful; so returning at <hi>Corcyra,</hi> they met the ship with Victuals: Whereupon, <hi>Fuscarinus</hi> put <hi>Don John</hi> in mind of his promise: telling him, 'twas not unlike, but the enemy upon their departure, would come out of the <hi>Bay</hi> for <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who might easily be overtaken and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; but he was not to be perswaded, pretending the Kings command forthwith to return; so the expectation of great matters this year (through jealousy of self-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Envy) came to nought.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Don</hi> departed to <hi>Messana, Columnius</hi> to <hi>Rome, Fuscarinus</hi> with more honour than success, to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was with great joy received, with the good like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all, giving up his charge in few years after, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a greater.</p>

till now wearied with the solicitation of such as might do most with him, he had yielded thereto.

               <p>To appease the murmuring of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the spoil of the Christians and Jewes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the usual largesse, augmented their wages; and granted their Sons at 20 years old to be enrolled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the younger <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and partake of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities: whereby he won their favours exceedingly.

At first, he established di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wholsom Lawes, altered the Coyn, and relieved the poor; and because he would not seem to degenerate from his Progenitors, he prosecuted his Fathers Warres by the <hi>Tartars Praecopenses,</hi> in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1575, entring <hi>Russia,</hi> of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Kingdom, burning and destroying two hundred Noblemens Houses, with a multitude of Towns and Villages, making great slaughter of the people, and carrying away great numbers of Cattel, and prisoners bound in thongs of raw Hides; but whilest they divided the spoil with <hi>Peter, Vayuod</hi> of <hi>Valachia,</hi> who had promised to give the <hi>Tartars</hi> no passage that way, the <hi>Cossacks</hi> brake into their Countrey, requiting them with like harm, and bringing back a number of old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
               <p>At this time, the <hi>Polonians</hi> were at variance, about the Election of their King <hi>(Henry Valois</hi> after <hi>Charls</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, stealing away from them, into <hi>France,</hi> to take on him the Kingdom) some making choyce of <hi>

yet so as to marry <hi>Stephen</hi> the said <hi>Vayuod,</hi> who, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards elected King, worthily governed that Kingdom all his life, and enlarging it with Territories by force of Arms gotten from his Neighbours, especially the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite; Amurath</hi> would often boast and say, he had given the <hi>Polonians</hi> their King.</p>
               <p>The year following 1576, great and sore shaking troubles arising in <hi>Persia, Amurath</hi> took opportunity to invade the same to the long quiet of the Christian Commonwealth. Old <hi>Tamas</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King, after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 50 years glorious Reign, died <hi>May</hi> 11th, 1576, leaving 11 Sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> the eldest (of an infirmity in his eyes, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Codabanda)</hi> being of a peaceable disposition, was most delighted with a contented life. <hi>Ismael</hi> the second Son was of a more fierce and troublesom nature: whom his Father (outwardly seeming to mislike of his youthful pranks aforesaid, tending to the breach of the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the <hi>Turk)</hi> sent to the Castle of <hi>Cahaca,</hi> where he remained at the time of his death: <hi>Aidere</hi> the third Son, was as ambitious as <hi>Ismahel,</hi> but not so valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tamas</hi> had by his last will appointed <hi>Ismahel</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, as of all his Sons, the fittest for so great a charge: which <hi>Mahomet</hi> seemed not much to dislike, as contented with the honours bestowed on him by his Father. <hi>Ismahel</hi> being sent for by the <hi>Sultans</hi> to take on him the Kingdom at <hi>Casbin,</hi> there arose a great tumult in the City and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; for <hi>Aidere</hi> (who, in his Fathers sight, when he lay drawing toward his end, had presumptuously set the Crown on his head; for which he was reproved) now supported by <hi>Zalchan,</hi> and other mighty favourites, had so dealt with <hi>Periaconcona</hi> his eldest Sister, and the other <hi>Sultans</hi> Counsellors of State, that the succession could not be any longer kept from him, but by some fine deceit:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="882" facs="tcp:130480-02:453"/>Wherefore this Lady <hi>Periaconcona</hi> of great Spirit and deep conceit, left in trust by her Father with the <hi>Sultans;</hi> resolved with them upon a thorow-debate, that <hi>Aidere</hi> in Royal Apparel, in the great Gallery, should attend the acclamation of the people, and be there open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enthronized as the very elected King: which done, she by their advice ordered the Gates of the Pallace to be presently locked, and surely guarded with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wholly devoted to <hi>Tamas</hi> and <hi>Ismahel:</hi> to suffer every man to enter in at the open Wicket, save the known Friends of <hi>Aidere,</hi> who is now in conceit a King; but perceiving the prohibition of his best friends, and moved with the great stir of <hi>Zalcan,</hi> who discovered the deceit; and crying upon King <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> threatened the Lady: the <hi>Sultans</hi> and the rest (that waited on the feigned succession) through fear and sorrow, withdrew closely among certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Court, hoping to find some way to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, the cries and threatnings of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere</hi>'s Friends so encreased, that the Counsellours with the Ladie's consent were enforced to take order, that <hi>Aidere</hi> should be deprived of life: Whereupon, <hi>Saha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> his Uncle by the mothers-side, after long search found him hidden amongst the Women, who taking him by the Locks, struck off his head, and among the thickest press, where <hi>Zalchan</hi> and the rest stood crying and threatning, flung the Head all bloudy, crying aloud unto them: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there your King! enjoy him at your pleasure;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, every man burned in rage and anger: and many vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatened most cruel revenge: but at last, perceiving <hi>Ismahel</hi>'s succession inevitable, and <hi>Aidere</hi>'s death irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, every man departed scattering themselves as they thought best for their own safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="893" facs="tcp:130480-02:453"/>Shortly after, <hi>Ismahel</hi> arrived at <hi>Casbin,</hi> where he was joyfully received and saluted King: whose power being answerable to his desires, he beheaded his eight younger Brethren, and bereaved not onely those rear him in blood and affinity, but all the favourites of <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> of their lives; so that <hi>Casbin</hi> was defiled with blood, and filled with mourning and complaints: which unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected cruelty, so altered the mindes of his Subjects, that their hopes were turned into new feares, and their joy into mourning; but much greater did the miseries grow, when 'twas given out, that he would change the Religion of the <hi>Persians,</hi> into the superstition of the <hi>Turks;</hi> for hereby, and by force of an edict by him published, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Priests and Governours of his friendly and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-Cities, were some exiled, some imprisoned, some (as the Caliph of <hi>Casbin)</hi> had their eyes pluckt out, and not a few, sundry wayes slain, yea, many Ladies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of <hi>Ismahel</hi>'s Kinsfolks, endured sundry tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and strange calamities.</p>
               <p>There went abroad withall, a general rumour; even as far as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that <hi>Ismahel,</hi> with a puissant Army of such as favoured this new proclaimed vanity, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go to <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to receive the Crown of the Empire, from him who should be the Successor of their great <hi>Caliph,</hi> as <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings had of old done.</p>
               <p>The fear of further miseries incresing rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, he was by the help of the aforesaid <hi>Periacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona</hi> (whether through poyson, strangling, or otherwise) taken out of this World <hi>November</hi> 24, 1577, to the exceeding joy of all those Nations, having reigned one year, seven moneths, and six dayes.</p>
               <p>The Lady forthwith perswaded the <hi>Sultans,</hi> that as they had for the good of all <hi>Persia,</hi> contrived the death of <hi>Ismahel,</hi> so they would take on them that Kingdom's
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:130480-02:454"/>
Protection, till 'twere known, who should worthily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emir Chan</hi> was in hope, by meanes of a match with a Sister of <hi>Periaconcona,</hi> greatly enclining unto him, to be exalted to the Soveraignty: <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> chief <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> hoped to advance, either <hi>Mahomet Codabanda,</hi> or else <hi>Hamze</hi> his eldest Sonne, and by bestowing on him his Daughter in Marriage (as he did) to increase the glory of his House: others thought they could draw <hi>Abas Mirize, Mahomets</hi> middle Sonne, out of <hi>Heri,</hi> and make him King: neither wanted the Infant <hi>Tamas</hi> his aspiring friends, whose Tutor waited for some opportunity to settle him in the Kingdom: many others waiting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly on every occasion, for their preferment: howbeit, the <hi>Sultans</hi> promised the Lady all the protection their forces could afford; and yet did every one, both in word and action, clearly dissemble their severall Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath,</hi> by these things awakened, thought hereby a fair occasion to be ministred unto him, to take up Arms against the <hi>Persians;</hi> for 'tis an ancient custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Othoman</hi> Kings, that they may not challenge their due honours in their life-time, nor their proud Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents after death, unless they perform some exploit conformable to their Majesty.</p>
               <p>As soon as <hi>Ismahel</hi> was dead, <hi>Mirize Salmas,</hi> after many Letters to and fro, at last assured <hi>Mahomet Coda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda,</hi> that with all quietness and security, he might come and possess the Kingdom: advertising him also of the whole conspiracy against his Brother, and how the fraudulent Lady (with the <hi>Sultans)</hi> had capitally consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against himself, and how she favouring <hi>Emir Chan,</hi> and <hi>Abas Mirize</hi> his Sonne, more than became her, little regarded the rightful succession of him.</p>

so loaded with spoiles, and weary with slaughter, they returned merrily towards <hi>Sirvan.</hi> And at the higher side of <hi>Eres</hi> in low Champains invironed with Hills, they pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their Tents without fear, to sleep and rest their weary bodies.</p>

Whereupon, the Prince sent the 200 pieces of Ordnance left in the Fort by <hi>Mustapha</hi> to <hi>Casbin</hi> to his Father; and now encouraged, leaving his Mother at <hi>Eres,</hi> went on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sumachia,</hi> but descending the Hills he discovered the <hi>Tartars</hi> Camp. Whereupon, he greatly doubted whether to adventure on so mighty an Enemy, or content himself with the Victory already gotten: but thinking it too great a shame to return into <hi>Persia,</hi> he defended the Hill, perceiving the Army was all laid down to rest, and their Horses all unsaddled; Whereupon, he pricking forward. most terribly assaulted the <hi>Tartars:</hi> and slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

their first and second Watch, though with some loss, put some to slight, killing others, and taking divers of them Captives; <hi>Abdill Cherai</hi> being one, who was sent alive to the King.</p>
               <p>After this, the Prince encompassed <hi>Sumachia,</hi> wherein <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> sat as Governour to the reproach of <hi>Persia:</hi> to whom he sent word, If he would yield, he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with life and goods; otherwise he should be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to surrender the City and his life withall. <hi>Osman</hi> knowing nothing of the <hi>Tartars</hi> overthrow, but hoping of their return, gave him a courteous answer, that he was ready to yield, but entreated him to stay but three dayes, to put all things in readiness for his free departure. The Prince glad, expected of the <hi>Turk</hi> the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but <hi>Osman,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> not appearing, resolved secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to flee, doubting, if he should longer stay to be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Citizens: Wherefore, before the 3 dayes end, he by the help of a dark night, and the cover of High &amp; rough Crags, silently withdrew out of <hi>Sumachia,</hi> carrying away all his substance and safely arriving at <hi>Derbent:</hi> Next morning the Inhabitants opened the Gates to the Prince; Who seeing their infidelity, first, by entertaining <hi>Osman,</hi> &amp; now helping him to escape without giving him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, with great cruelty did punish them, razing their Houses with the Walls of the City. The strength of <hi>Derbent,</hi> Winters approach and his long Journey home, perswaded him to lay aside his enterprize for that City, and to return to <hi>Casbin;</hi> Yet first repairing to <hi>Eres</hi> and <hi>Sechi;</hi> he spared neither Sex, Age, nor condition. Which done, he with his said Mother &amp; Victorious Army, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diminished, returned to <hi>Casbin.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Abdill Cherai</hi> was kept safe at the Kings Pallace at <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> but with very easie Imprisonment: which was daily so inlarged, that he seemed rather as a Companion of those of the Court then a prisoner; Whereby, insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the love of Queen <hi>Begum,</hi> he spent his time in

courting of her, and she in all secret entertainment of him: yet was it a rife report in Court and City, that the shameless Lady had participated her bed and self with the <hi>Tartarian</hi> prisoner. Howbeit, the King and Prince knew nothing of it, but the King perceiving the young Gentleman to be generally commended, valiant, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and comely, also nobly born; for he said, he was the Brother of <hi>Tartar Chan,</hi> was perswaded, it would stand with the great good of his State, of a Captive to give him his Daughter in marriage: whereby, he hoped the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Praecopenses,</hi> would thenceforth both refuse to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>Amurath,</hi> and in favour of <hi>Persia</hi> turn their Armes against him; which his purpose so displeased the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s of <hi>Casbin,</hi> that they sought by all means possible to avert the King from so strange a policy: but he, fully resolved, and upon the point to conclude the Marriage; the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s entring the Pallace with their followers, ran the <hi>Tartar</hi> through the body, and cutting off his Privities, flapped them about his mouth. Its reported, the Queen was also then murdered by them: However it was, the Lady after that day never saw the Sun, Upon these murders sprung up much civil dissention to the singular benefit of <hi>Amurath.</hi> All which disorders, the King by bridling of his own affections, and the motions of his Son well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, procured at last a perfect Unity.</p>

                  <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> being in <hi>Derbent,</hi> devised with all care possible to assure <hi>Sirvan,</hi> now again almost lost, under <hi>Amurath</hi>'s Government.

<pb n="913" facs="tcp:130480-02:463"/>
confirmed by the speeches of his Wife, who frankly told him, that her Father being secretly reconciled to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> King, Letters went between them of great matters, and particularly of the affairs of <hi>Sirvan.</hi> The <hi>Bassa</hi> kept this in store, to his own safety and the destruction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamall:</hi> and inviting him, according to the custom, to a Feast, he enjoyned certain Companies of his Souldiers, that as soon as <hi>Sahamall</hi> was entred into his Court, even in his very dismounting, to fall upon him, cut off his head, and put all his retinue to the sword: which being done accordingly, he forthwith sent 2000 Horsmen to spoyl and sack all his Country, to the great marvel both of far and near. The <hi>Persian</hi> King took this most grievously, foreseeing, that the recovery of that Province would prove very difficult, and fearing it would still remain as it doth in the <hi>Turks</hi> possession: This was the end of the <hi>Turks</hi> attempts against the <hi>Persians</hi> in <hi>Sirvan,</hi> this year 1578, wherein one way or other they lost above 70000 men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> advertised from <hi>Mustapha,</hi> who, for the advancing of his own credit, had described these successes to be far greater than they were, began to devise touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next years attempts: and upon his better conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ceased further to think of sending Forces again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sirvan</hi> for the recovery of the lost places there, because <hi>Tartar Chan,</hi> had faithfully assured both him and <hi>Osman</hi> to over-run that Province anew, and do great matters: which for all that, fell out to be but windy words.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Amurath</hi> devised for sending his Army to <hi>Tauris,</hi> to erect a Fortress there, which, being also strongly Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned should never be again subdued: And, hereby to keep under all those Countries between <hi>Tauris</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zirum,</hi> which important conceit was much encreased by others: who almost thought it was very easie for so great an Host, both to perform that service, and pass whithersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he would desire; yet, having with more indifferent

               <p>But how to protect the <hi>Georgian</hi> Country was thought a matter of greater importance, because most thought some great Turkish power would be sent thither to assure the Conquest begun, and to succour the Fortress of <hi>Tef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which must else fall again into the <hi>Georgians</hi> hands.</p>
               <p>

The <hi>Persian</hi> King with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent consented to his request, naming him <hi>Chan</hi> of all that Kingdom, which he possessed whilst he was a Christian, and sent with him <hi>Aliculi Chan</hi> with five thousand Horsmen, and certain Ordnance taken at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mustapha</hi> resolved to send succour to <hi>Teflis,</hi> but how to relieve it he was doubtfull; yet to preserve his credit with <hi>Amurath,</hi> he sent <hi>Nassan Bassa,</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masco, Mahamet</hi> the Visier his Sonne of great valour with between eighteen and twenty thousand Souldiers, with one <hi>Resvan</hi> Captain of certain Adventurers, who freely offered themselves, assigning also to him forty thousand Duckats, and many loades of Corn with other necessaries.</p>

                  <hi>Nassan,</hi> resolving to put these succours into <hi>Teflis,</hi> or to lose all, came to the Strait of <hi>Tomanis,</hi> where the over grown Woods on one side, and deep Valleys and craggy Rocks on the other, would astonish a constant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Aliculi Chan,</hi> on the third day, imagining this their stay was for fear, gave a fresh onset upon the Flank of <hi>Nassan</hi>'s squadrons, who giving <hi>Resvan</hi> a signe speedily compassed in his Enemies, taking some alive, cutting in pieces others, and put the rest to flight. <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi> rashly charging upon the face of <hi>Nassan,</hi> was taken. Next day the 11th. after his departure from <hi>Chars,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Teflis,</hi> where he found some besieged <hi>Turks</hi> dead, some sick; for, through Famine, they devoured even the very skins of Horses, sheep, and dogs, whom <hi>Nassan</hi> comforted with gifts and good words, exhorting them to constancy in the service of their King, whose honour was never more then there to be respected: and because the Souldiers did all mislike <hi>Mahomet Bassa</hi> whom <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha</hi> had left Governour of that Fort, he put <hi>Amet Bassa</hi> in his place; and so having filled up the Garrison and set all things in order, he returned, and being come to the Strait of <hi>Tomanis,</hi> was advertised by Scouts, that it was so strongly possessed by the Enemy as not to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thorow.</p>
               <p>

himself, <hi>Aliculi Chan,</hi> to purchase his liberty, which he covenanted for before hand, offered to shew him a safe and short cut; whereby he might without danger pass with his Army: so bending on the right-hand, he guided him through strange and uncouth places, not meeting so much as one Enemy; but when the <hi>Persian</hi> Duke put the <hi>Turk</hi> in mind of his promised liberty, he with deep and fained sighs protested, he was sorry he could not perform what he had promised, since it lay not in his power to free any man taken in battel by the Souldiers of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; yet gave him his Faith to use all the most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest means he could with <hi>Mustapha</hi> to procure his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon</hi> imagined, that the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken this new way, but being certified by his spies, that it was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he, enflamed with rage for their great fortune, fell upon the rear, which he wholly destroyed, leading away all the People, Horses, and all the Treasure of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> and <hi>Nassan Bassaes;</hi> As for <hi>Aliculi,</hi> he was sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the Front, and so not to be rescued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nassan</hi> came from <hi>Teflis</hi> to <hi>Chars</hi> in 8 dayes, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aliculi</hi> to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and recounting unto him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever had happened in that expedition. <hi>Allouli</hi> was sent prisoner by <hi>Mustapha</hi> to <hi>Erzirum</hi> Castle: and ere long himself returned to the said <hi>Erzirum</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my sore weakened and discontented, which he presently discharged.</p>
               <p>About the time that these things were doing, <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> to make a safer and easier passage for his Forces into <hi>Georgia,</hi> sent <hi>Uluzales</hi> with a great Fléet to <hi>Mengrelia</hi> (of old, <hi>Colchis)</hi> who fortifying in the River <hi>Fassa,</hi> laid such a beginning, that it is now one of the <hi>Turks Beglerbeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</hi> Though those Fortifications were soon after his departure for the present demolished by the <hi>Mengreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and here ended the stirs of this Year, 1579.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="719" facs="tcp:130480-02:466"/>Of all these successes, <hi>Mustapha</hi> sent advertisement to <hi>Amurath,</hi> and because he had the yeer before perswaded him that <hi>Georgia</hi> and its people were brought under his Obedience, that he should not marvel at so many losses and Battels; declared unto him, that all these troubles were not raised by the home-bred <hi>Georgians,</hi> but by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liculi</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> sent out of <hi>Persia. Amurath</hi> reading all that <hi>Mustapha</hi> had written with great delight, sent to <hi>Nassan</hi> a Battel-Axe all gilt and full of Stones: A Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get of Gold and Pearl, and a rich Garment of Cloth of Gold in reward of his good service; and ordered <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi</hi> to be kept where he was, in diligent and safe custody.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Kings care for Turkish Invasions, which much troubled him, was doubled with domestical fears. <hi>Mirik Salmas</hi> his chief Visier still filling his Head with jealousie, that <hi>Abas Miriz</hi> his son, Governour of <hi>Iteri,</hi> was about, in these troubles, to proclaim himself King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to the great Ignominy of his Father, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of <hi>Emerhanze</hi> his eldest Brother, to whom <hi>Salmas</hi> had married a Daughter of his; who, the better to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King to commit <hi>Abaz</hi> to prison, or bereave him of all Authority, discovered unto him, how little <hi>Abaz</hi> had respected him in divers occasions, not having sent forth one man in these late Wars: but forbad those of his Jurisdiction to come to <hi>Casbin,</hi> when summoned to have passed with <hi>Emer Namke</hi> into <hi>Sirvan;</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Abaz</hi> their Lord, who enjoyned them not to stir, was not only called King of <hi>Iteri,</hi> but had given out he meant to claim the succession in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The King, carried away with leight belief of these complaints, made more effectual by means of divers great Ladies, and other usual devices continually, thought to repress the boldness of his disobedient Son; yet not forgetting to prepare against the <hi>Turks,</hi> as might stay their passage to <hi>Tauris,</hi> if they purposed so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="920" facs="tcp:130480-02:467"/>But <hi>Mustapha</hi> laying at <hi>Erzirum,</hi> many grievous complaints were made of him to <hi>Amurath,</hi> whereby he took from him his General-ship, calling him to Court to give accompt of his actions: who sending such a strong power to succour <hi>Teflis, Amurath</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured the affaires of <hi>Georgia</hi> not to be so secure as he had informed him, whose Souldiers also in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar accused him of improvidence and prodigality: because now this second year he had with so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, gathered such a number of Souldiers together, to the vast charge of their Lord, and yet performed nothing worthy the glory of <hi>Amurath,</hi> or answerable to so great a charge.</p>
               <p>The Emperour for the great favours he bare unto him, his antient Tutour, would never have construed these complaints so hardly, as to have deprived him of his place, if the inveterate envy of <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> had not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred force to these hard accusations.: for he was a most ancient enemy to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> and in all things thought himself his match both in courage and years; yea, and did not stick to think himself his better to: for in the enterprize of <hi>Glamen</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> he did that which <hi>Mustapha</hi> neither durst, nor knew how to put in execution: for which, ever after one envying at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory both in word and deed, opposed each other upon occasion. At last <hi>Sinan</hi> taking this occasion of so many complaints against <hi>Mustapha,</hi> caused a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to supplicate <hi>Amurath,</hi> which himself did most malignantly exaggerate against him, accusing him, that this second year he had most manifestly shewed, he went not to the Wars as a worthy Generall, desirous of noble enterprizes, but as one that would make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of bloud, his Souldiers, Pages, Corn, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and the like complaints, with the hard opinion conceived against him by <hi>Amurath,</hi> occasioned his resolution. Besides, he deemed it not so much for
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:130480-02:467"/>
his honour, still to employ one man as to shew that he had choice of Subjects, worthy of so great a Charge: Wherefore, he sent the chief of his Gentlemen Porters with fifteen others, to bring him with his Chancellour and Treasurer to the Court, to give accompt of money received; and of their whole Office; he delivered three Letters to this Messenger, which he should warily shew: One was so written, that <hi>Mustapha,</hi> in receiving it, might by them be strangled: In the second, was their warrant to do what they were commanded: The third contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Mustapha</hi> should forthwith send his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Treasurer to the Court by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mustapha,</hi> by divers means, especially guilt, suspecting his life was by those Messengers sought after: When the Captain-Porter came to the Camp, put him off with delayes, and would not be spoken withall: but when he would endure no longer delay, he was admitted to his presence, having a Circle appointed him, out of which, he and his Companions might not stir: the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> being guarded round about: Whereupon, the Porter plucked forth the third Letter about the sending of his Chancellour and Treasurer, which the <hi>Bassa</hi> found many excuses to delay: but being hardly pressed, he delivered them both: agreeing with the Messenger to have their lives spared, who at <hi>Constantinople</hi> were clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Tower <hi>Jadicula,</hi> to have been severely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of all the <hi>Bassaes</hi> doings: but <hi>Mustapha</hi> comming at length to <hi>Constantinople, April.</hi> 9. through the potent mediation of divers great Ladies, and other friends was again at length received into <hi>Amuraths</hi> favour without any further proceeding: his Chancellour and Treasurer being afterwards also enlarged.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Mustapha</hi> lay at <hi>Erzirum, Muhamet</hi> the Visier was slain at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> after whom, shortly after died also <hi>Achmet Bassa,</hi> who succeeded in his place;
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:130480-02:468"/>
the death of <hi>Muhamet,</hi> is worthy to be registred as a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for all that administer Justice in so great a place: he had for some leight causes, deprived a Souldier of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> of his yearly pension, bestowing it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that the other poor soul remained in misery; who not guilty to himself of any fault worthy of so great pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment, determined to bereave him of life, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft him of living: which because he could not fitly do, by reason of the Guard of slaves that keep the Person of the <hi>Vissier,</hi> he taking upon him the Habit of those Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, called <hi>Dervis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The murderer being bound fast, the Emperour suspecting, that some other great Bassa desiring that high Dignity had provoked him to do this, would needs understand what had moved him so treacherously to kill his <hi>Vissier;</hi> who answered, he did it to free the City from the tyranny of him, by whom he was undeservedly deprived of his Pension: when he could get no other answer, he delivered him to the <hi>Vissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> slaves, who with most exquisite torments, put him to death.</p>

                  <hi>Sinan,</hi> being nominated Generall against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and full power given him in 1580, determined to build a Fort at <hi>Tomanis,</hi> to assure the passage thither from <hi>Chars,</hi> and by all meanes, to induce the <hi>Persian</hi> King to send Embassadors for peace, with conditions acceptable to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath.</hi> Of these changes and alterations, the <hi>Persian</hi> King being advertised, and being perswaded by <hi>Levento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli,</hi> the <hi>Georgian,</hi> and <hi>Miriz Salmas,</hi> he dispatched <hi>Maxut Chan,</hi> or <hi>Maxudes</hi> his Embassador, to demand peace of <hi>Amurath;</hi> and by Letters to him, to labour for pacifying all those troubles. <hi>Maxut</hi> in any case to conclude a peace, so <hi>Amurath</hi> would be content with <hi>Chars</hi> and <hi>Teflis.</hi> He coming to <hi>Erzirium,</hi> was thence conducted towards <hi>Amasia;</hi> but at <hi>Sivas,</hi> he found <hi>Sinan</hi> there, collecting his Army, for execution of his designs.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sinan,</hi> thinking the very fame of his valour to have wrought this demand of peace, granted him a safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, writing to <hi>Amurath,</hi> what he thought was fit to be

               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Persian</hi> King laying at <hi>Tauris,</hi> and hearing that the <hi>Turks</hi> had changed their purpose from <hi>Nasivan</hi> to <hi>Georgia,</hi> licensed his Souldiers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and applyed himself to more private revenges: for he required of <hi>Emer-chan,</hi> why he had not endeavored to hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> Fabrick at <hi>Reivan?</hi> and why he went not out with other Souldiers, and namely those of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koma,</hi> as he had promised, to revenge what he could, so great an injury. <hi>Emer</hi> alledged sundry excuses for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but none sufficient to clear him of the Crimes obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Wherefore, the King adjudging him, to have his Eyes burnt out with a hot Iron, and to be dispoyled of all his goods and shut up in close prison, in a few monthes space he miserably died thereof; yet a famous Souldier: who being in great esteem with the <hi>Turkoman</hi> Nation, he absolutely denied their defences for the Crown of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the more, when they heard the King had bestowed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> place upon <hi>Aliculi,</hi> who being an ancient Enemy to some of their Captains, though he was very deserving, would in no case endure he should be so exalted.

               <p>For all the League between <hi>Amurath</hi> and the Christian Emperor, the <hi>Turks</hi> made often incursions into the upper part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> burning the Villages &amp; carrying the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple captive, but in their return were often cut off by the Emperors Souldiers, which report much moved the <hi>Turk,</hi>

                  <hi>Ferat</hi> advertised <hi>Amurath</hi> of all that happened in his late Expedition, defiring him to command what he would have taken in hand the next Spring; but many others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so informed him, and that in an odious sort of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, of all such actions as had not altogether so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably bin performed by him that year, and with his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out with <hi>Vies Bassa,</hi> a man well regarded of <hi>Amurath</hi> himself; with the disorder of his whole Camp for want of discretion. <hi>Amurath</hi> also ever since the last depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Ferat</hi> from <hi>Erzirum,</hi> had thoughts the next year to attempt the enterprize of <hi>Tauris,</hi> to stir up through the world a famous report; bethinking himself of <hi>Osman Bassa,</hi> to whom he might commit so great a trust, who, having remained at <hi>Sumachia</hi> in <hi>Sirvan,</hi> since the first year of this War, had without any help of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> brought that large Country into a reasonable Obedience, and at so far a distance maintained his Army without any expences to his King; having levyed a good while his Souldiers stipends upon that Region: still exercising a kind of Soveraignty over it, of all which he had from time to time sent intelligence to the Court: Where, by help of other favourers which he had about the King, he had a wondrous good Opinion of him: wherefore, he had dispatched some <hi>Chapigi</hi> and <hi>Chiaous</hi> to call this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Warriour unto him: yet some, and those not of the meanest sort, went about to hinder his comming to Court; and also these important designs; for <hi>

reposed much confidence in the conspiracy, now plotted against the Princes life, with the privity of <hi>Aliculi,</hi> the Protector of <hi>Heri,</hi> who under colour of assisting the Prince, had concluded with himself, and promised <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> having given notice thereof also to <hi>Ferat,</hi> to rid Prince <hi>Hamsey</hi> of his life; or, at least, in the variable chances of Battel, at some time or other, to make him fall into <hi>Ferats</hi> hands, and so settle his Lord <hi>Abas</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: hereupon, <hi>Ferat</hi> more confidently disposed his designments, and somewhat lesse feared the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Persia:</hi> which preparations in truth, were by most wicked devices and conspiracies, turned from the end whereto the Prince had appointed them: and since Rebellion and Discord have for the utter undoing of the glory of <hi>Persia,</hi> alwayes favoured the Turks Army, its no marvel, that our Writers cannot chuse but write of the undoubted Victories of the Turks, and the bare shadows of the <hi>Persian</hi> exploits, which yet many Christians vainly believe, because they most earnestly desire them to be true, although they do see the contrary manifest.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Prince, about the latter end of July, arrived at <hi>Tauris</hi> with most of his Army, where he, contrary to all mens opinion, stayed not; the cause is uncertain; but hearing that <hi>Zinel Bassa</hi> of <hi>Salmas,</hi> who of a <hi>Persian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Turk,</hi> and had done great harm, encamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City, he with 12000 Souldiers, road to <hi>Salmas,</hi> and gave him the assault, who with the Souldiers, fled presently, and fell before the <hi>Persians,</hi> so that <hi>Zinell</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with a few others, had much adoe to escape, leaving his City unto the angry Enemy, who sacked and spoiled it, exercising all such cruelties, as partly the desire of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers use to do, and partly such as the Turks shewed unto them, in sacking of <hi>Tauris</hi> the last year: the like spoils did they in all those Quarters, and perhaps had returned to <hi>Tauris,</hi> but that some spies advertized them, that the Bassa of <hi>Reivan,</hi> with 1500 Harquebusiers, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>At the same time, <hi>Manogli</hi> the valiant <hi>Drusian,</hi> in revenge of the injuries done him and his people, by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain Bassa,</hi> and to recompence himself of all those bribes and presents, which he wrung from him, had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and sacked all the Territory of <hi>Ebner Mansor,</hi> and of his other Enemies, who had yielded their obedience to the Turks without let, doing exceeding harm, by sudden inroads, even very near unto <hi>Balbeck</hi> and <hi>Tripolis;</hi> so that <hi>Amurath</hi> was glad to dispatch away <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now the <hi>Persian</hi> Prince, retired toward his Fathers Camp, where the rest of his Army was arrived, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40000, of whom he dispatched away 8000 Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Heri,</hi> under the conduct of traiterous <hi>Aliculi,</hi> and part also of the <hi>Turkomans,</hi> under <hi>Emanguli Chan,</hi> with special charge, that they should, in places of most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, meet the Enemy, and do him what mischief they could, thinking hereby to weaken his forces, and so at their arrival at <hi>Tauris,</hi> with all his power utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ferat</hi> having thus relieved the Fort, returned towards <hi>Erzirum,</hi> having first erected a Fort at <hi>Curchive-Tauris,</hi> near to <hi>Tauris,</hi> and two others at <hi>Coy</hi> and <hi>Cum,</hi> leaving in them all convenient Garrisons, with all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: he sent also succours to <hi>Teflis,</hi> which they had long expected, and now most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Next night, a great fire arose in the City: to quench which, the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> were commanded to help, which they both refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do, and kept back others that brought water, to that end; and with the other Court Souldiers, did what they might, to make it burn faster: the fire consumed seven Temples, 25 great Inns, 1500 Houses, with many Shops and Ware-houses. Commandment was given to a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbegge</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Passi</hi> a Jew, the first Authours of this new Imposition, either to gather the said Tribute, or by some other meanes, to content the Souldiers; but the Priests publickly perswaded the people from paying of this new Tribute, or any other such like: whereupon, the Temples were shut up by the Priests Prayers, for the <hi>Sultans</hi> health intermitted, the Bassaes Houses assaulted, and all the City in a new hurliburly; so that <hi>Amurath</hi> was glad to pay the Souldiers out of his own Treasury, to revoke his <hi>Mandates</hi> for the new Tribute, and to deliver the <hi>Beglerbegge</hi> and the <hi>Jew,</hi> to the will of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> who drew them up and down at Horses Tails, then cut off their Heads, tossing them from one to another, like Tennice-Balls.</p>

Sundry reasons were alleaged by the Bassaes, for every one of
<pb n="999" facs="tcp:130480-02:508"/>
these Opinions, too large here to relate particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p>But the Reasons for the eighth Opinion of making Warre upon the Christian Emperour, whom the <hi>Turks</hi> call King of <hi>Vienna,</hi> were, for that <hi>Uschocci</hi> were grown so insolent, as to make prize of the <hi>Turks,</hi> both by Sea and Land; so that, for both the harms they did, and for the honour of the <hi>Othoman</hi> Empire, they were no longer to be suffered; for hereby, especially the Merchants great hindrance, and the <hi>Sultans</hi> great losse, had removed their Mart from <hi>Narenta,</hi> in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominion to <hi>Spalato,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and yet were not so secure, though there were peace betwixt the Emperour and <hi>Venetians:</hi> because these unruly men troubled all, both by Sea and Land, with their robberies, driving away Cattel, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Villages, and taking away babes out of their Mothers Arms; so that it was no doubt, but if occasion should serve, they would attempt to surprise with all their power, the <hi>Turks</hi> strong Holds upon the Frontiers; nor was it unknown, how little the Emperour esteemed the <hi>Turk,</hi> when he warred with the <hi>Persian</hi> paying Tribute too late, at his pleasure: neither was this Warre to be deemed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult or doubtful, because they might attempt it by <hi>Croatia, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> Countries abounding with all necessaries, they being also to travel almost all the way in the <hi>Turks</hi> own Territories; besides the chief for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with many other strong places they already held, whither their Armies in all cases, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or repair their losses out of the same. They said, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire desired peace more then War, that the Princes were very careful to heap up, and preserve their Treasures; and the <hi>Germans</hi> having had no Warres a long time, were now lesse fit for Arms, and worse to be commanded; alwayes distrusting the <hi>Hungarians, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom they rather hated then loved,
<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:130480-02:509"/>
being divided also amongst themselves, chiefly about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: neither were forraign Princes to be feared, to give the Emperour ayd: the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Transilvanian,</hi> lived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>All those Opinions of the great Bassaes concerning the Warre, proceeded not so much from any sound advice, as commonly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> stood long in doubt in such diversities of Opinions, what to resolve upon; but contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with what he had already done in <hi>Persia,</hi> having as he boasted, by his Servants there performed more than his Predecessors could do in person: wherefore he resolved to turn his forces against the Christian Emperour; for first, it grieved him to see the honour of the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and that he durst make head against him; besides, it would be farre lesse difficult, to make Warre upon a Countrey so near him, then upon <hi>Persia,</hi> where his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were still to be led through his own Countries, whence they were to be at all times plentifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>

               <p>About the end of this moneth, the Bassa of <hi>Ziget,</hi> the <hi>Sanzacks</hi> of <hi>Mohas, Koppan,</hi> and <hi>Quinque Ecclesiae,</hi> and others, encamped with a strong Army betwixt <hi>Ziget</hi> and <hi>Rodesto:</hi> soon after which, the Emperour had newes that <hi>Kainsia.</hi> a City of <hi>Stiria,</hi> was hardly besieged; and that the <hi>Turks</hi> in coming thither, had taken many Captives, whom they had sent to be sold at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and that their Army were about one hundred and sixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; but since the Christian Army, increasing also, was now grown to sixty thousand Men, he hoped well, that their Enemies rage would be stayed: about which time, <hi>Ernest,</hi> appoin ed Generall with the Marquesse, sonne to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the arch-Duke his Lievtenant, came to the Army.</p>

                  <pb n="1005" facs="tcp:130480-02:511"/>About the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> the Emperour had sad news, of 7000 men slain, whom he had sent into <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> men the conduct of <hi>Beane,</hi> and 2 others, to hinder the <hi>Turks</hi> proceeding, encamping between <hi>Wyhitz</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolstat:</hi> and, having <hi>Septemb.</hi> the 12th, discovered from a mountain some Turkish Companies, come thither to view the Army of the Christians; sent out 50 Horsmen to discover where the <hi>Turks</hi> Army lay, with its attempts: who, finding no more <hi>Turks</hi> then those before-seen from the Mountains, returned with such Intelligence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Christians as secure in their Tents, kept but negligent Watch. But a hundred thousand <hi>Turks</hi> suddenly brake into their Trenches; where, those Footmen for 4 hours maintained a notable fight, many being slain on both sides: but the Christians, beset and oppressed with multitude, were slain almost all: yet the Captains speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fled for which their cowardize and negligence, they were afterwards beheaded. Such as fell alive into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hands were cut in pieces. The Enemy also had the spoil of the Tents: wherein, besides abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things found, 60000 Dollars lately brought from <hi>Luitz</hi> for the Souldiers pay. The <hi>Turks</hi> in ostentation, laded 14 Waggons with the Heads of the slain, which they sent to divers of their places thereabouts, yet the Christians flew of their Enemies above 12000.</p>
               <p>The night following, the <hi>Turks</hi> in the dead of the night surprized the Castle of St. <hi>George;</hi> putting to the sword all therein, of any Age or Sexe, except 150, whom they carried Captive: so firing the Castle, departed. At which time, some <hi>Turks</hi> were seen about <hi>Sifeg,</hi> who led away Captive above 600 Christians: and 300 Waggons, loaded with all kind of provisions, for relief of the Garrisons in <hi>Croatia,</hi> were all intercepted by the <hi>Turks</hi> and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The Emperour hereupon gave notice by writing to the Princes and States of the Empire; What incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Turks</hi> had lately made into <hi>Croatia,</hi> the Frontiers
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:130480-02:512"/>
of <hi>Hungary</hi> and other places near them, and that the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeg</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> with the Bassaes of <hi>Bosna, Buda,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesware,</hi> without regard of the League had, by taking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers strong places, extended their bounds above 40 <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> miles, slaying, and carrying away the Inhabitants, and were grown to that height, that except they were repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, they would soon set foot into <hi>Germany</hi> it self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which to hinder, he required their generall help: reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting them at length to open their Coffers, and send out their Forces against the common Enemy: which request, with so great a danger, moved not only them, but others, farther off, liberally to contribute thereunto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> hearing of these great preparations, besides the Christian Army already in Field, and that they had made a strong bridge over <hi>Dravus,</hi> which they had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied also for the safe transporting of their Army; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with furnished the places they had gotten with strong gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, and so withdrew into their own Territories: and the rather, because the plague so raged in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that there dyed a 1000 a day, which had also infected the Turkish Army; which the Christians fearing, forthwith slew every <hi>Turk</hi> they took.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> in the beginning of 1593, began also their wonted incursions into the Christians Frontiers: The Garrison of <hi>Petrinia,</hi> a strong Fort lately built by the <hi>Turks</hi> on the River <hi>Kulp,</hi> for the further invasion of <hi>Croatia,</hi> made daily excursions, spoiling and burning the Town and Castle of <hi>Beck Vochobinam</hi> in the Island <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis,</hi> and after a great slaughter, carried away 400 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners: and, in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> Garrisons to supply their wants, made divers inroades &amp; did exceeding harm: of whom 600 passing over the frozen Lake, were all drowned therein. In another place 3000 of them near <hi>Nutiusa,</hi> dividing themselves in twaine, one part shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in sight of the Townsmen, the other lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Ambush, the Townsmen hereupon sallyed out,
<pb n="1007" facs="tcp:130480-02:512"/>
and causing them to retire, followed them till they were past the place, where the other <hi>Turks</hi> lay: who ran with all speed, and wanted not much to surprize the Town; for there was scarce a hundred <hi>Germans</hi> lelf in Garrison, who had hardly time to draw up the bridges, which done, they with the Ordnance forced them to retire.</p>
               <p>About the same time also they of <hi>Petrinia,</hi> sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saliying out took the Town of <hi>Martenize,</hi> which they spoiled, killing about seven hundred setting it on fire, and so returning, having lost not past a hundred and fifty men. Ere long, the said Garrison took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Castle three miles from the River <hi>Kulp:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, the Christians round about, had for fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed all their Wealth, with great store of Victuall, and slaying six hundred men in the Castle, returned with a very rich booty, yet with the losse of five hundred <hi>Turks</hi> slain in that enterprize; So also did the other Turkish Garrisons, rage in all other parts of <hi>Hungary:</hi> About <hi>Sasobia</hi> in upper-<hi>Hungary,</hi> they carried away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hundred Captives, and in the nether, they took the strong Castle of <hi>Hedwigg</hi> upon the Lake of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laton,</hi> which they spoiled and burnt; as also the Castle of <hi>Isna;</hi> but attempting the lesser <hi>Comara,</hi> they were valiantly repulsed. They fortified also <hi>Stock</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, which they lately took as a refuge for their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turours, all which declared their desire to begin that bloudy Warre, which presently ensued: and it was the more suspected, because <hi>Crocowitts</hi> the Emperour's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour was shut up close in his House at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> not to speak with any man, nor write or send to the Emperour; Wherefore, he began to raise new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Bohemians</hi> also, seeing these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="1008" facs="tcp:130480-02:513"/>
the Emperor well knew that these outrages could not be done without <hi>Amuraths</hi> knowledge and liking, as before informed thereof by his Embassadour; yet he wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto him, the effect whereof, were, to shew himself willing to have the League on his behalf kept, and also to make a further proof of <hi>Amuraths</hi> resolution for peace or war; desiring him, that since the Honourable Present which was then ready, should be brought unto him at the time, which should be agreed on betwixt his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, He should do well that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers made no Hostile Incursions into his Territories: as he had severely commanded his Subjects to keep the peace upon his Frontiers. He wrote also at the same time, to the same purpose to <hi>Sinan Bassa:</hi> telling him, It should well beseem his uprightness, and good will which he had at other times proved for the high Place and Authority which he held, and which he rejoyced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be restored unto him; to give those things such easie passage before <hi>Amurath,</hi> that he might acknowledge his kindness and favour, and have occasion to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thankful therefore: saying, he assuredly hoped so to prevail with his Emperour, that all places and things as were wrongfully taken away, might be restored: and the Fort of <hi>Petrinia</hi> razed, and the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Bosna,</hi> with who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else guilty of the breach of the League, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deserts punished and displaced. <hi>Sinan</hi> returned answer to those Letters: That, whereas the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour laid the fault of so long deserring the wonted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents upon the insolency of the <hi>Turks</hi> Garrisons in <hi>Bosna,</hi> and breach of the publike Peace, Those Letters being by him read before <hi>Amurath;</hi> He in great choler burst out against his Son the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> who had written to <hi>Amurath</hi> that the Presents would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for all that, the Presents were not yet come, but the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Bosna,</hi> had sent word to Court
<pb n="1009" facs="tcp:130480-02:513"/>
that the Emperour would not send them, and all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be but meer deceit: Wherefore, <hi>Amurath</hi> (said he) hath removed my son from his place in <hi>Buda,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Bosna</hi> with Honourable Garments: and taxing the Emperour with his Souldiers continuall excursions into the <hi>Turks</hi> Territories: Whereas, their Souldiers were kept in as with a bridle. He told him, that his Majesty was to resolve upon 2 points: <hi>Whether he were minded to keep friendship with them as beseemed, and to send the 2 last yeares Presents, or not? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would set at liberty their captive</hi> Zanzacks, <hi>or not, for whom such Christian saptives as he should desire, should be enlarged? Which, if he should refuse to do, within two months next, he should assure himself, That he, who was to go himself in person in this War; putting his confidence in the Highest, with the Army of the right believing</hi> Turks <hi>would come into those parts, and not fail there to encounter him, requesting a speedy answer of those Letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all these fair offers of peace, <hi>Sinan</hi> sought only to draw the 2 years presents from the Emperour, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a great sum; and nevertheles purposed to prosecute the intended War, whereof the Emperour was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, being thereof, as was said before, by his Embassador advertised. At Summer <hi>Hassan Bassa</hi> of <hi>Bosna,</hi> ceased not for the encrease of his credit, to work what mischief he could against the christians bordring uponhim, who mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated the Governour, or, as some call him, <hi>the Abbot of Siseg;</hi> a strong Castle upon the borders of that part of <hi>Croatia,</hi> where <hi>Culp</hi> falls into <hi>Savus,</hi> and was indeed the very Bulwark of that Country: the cause of which hatred is thus reported. Tthe year before, the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> had sent a Messenger to this <hi>Abbot,</hi> to require him to deliver the Castle unto him, whom the <hi>Abbot</hi> honourably entertaining for certain dayes, learned of him, with what power, in what place, and with what Engines he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to besiege the Castle? The mean while, 'twas dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="1010" facs="tcp:130480-02:514"/>
that his Steward had long before plotted with the <hi>Turk</hi> to betray the Castle, receiving of him a yearly Pension: Whereupon, the <hi>Abbot</hi> caused both Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger and Steward to be bound hand and foot, and cast out at a window into the River <hi>Saw.</hi> The Bassa, his Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger not returning, sent another to the <hi>Abbot,</hi> grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatning him, if he did not send him again: who answered, He had dismissed him some dayes before, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling he was not yet returned, yet was he resolved to yield the Monastery to the Bassa, against whose Forces he saw himself unable to hold it: requesting onely, that he would please to send some men of Account; because it would be no small dishonour to him to deliver it up to common Souldiers. The Bassa glad, sent forthwith certain men of great Account: So 3 days after, some turkish troops came to the Monastery, and the Gates being open, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen with about five hundred others entered: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, Portculisses was let fall, and Murdering-pieces, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly placed in the Court, discharged, whereby the <hi>Turks</hi> were rent in pieces, their Heads, Armes, and Leggs fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Ayr, and presently the Souldiers starting out of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Bassa hearing of this slaughter and deceit, swore in great rage by his <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to raze this Monastery down to the ground, and to pluck the <hi>Abbots</hi> skin over his Eares: the which by threatning Letters he gave him to understand. And in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> with 30000 Horse and Foot, he besieged the Fortress of <hi>Trenschiin:</hi> which he by battery and assaults taking, sacked the Town, slew most of the Inhabitants (except about 800 of the younger sort, which he carried away Captives): and removing thence by a Bridge which he made, passed the River; and the 12th. of <hi>June,</hi> came before the Castle of <hi>Siseg,</hi> and after a vain summons, next day planted his Ordnance, so thundring
<pb n="1011" facs="tcp:130480-02:514"/>
against the walls, that in the fall of the new Tower, two Christian Cannoniers perished: This furious battery he maintained ten days without intermission so that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not possible the Monastery long to be defended if not with speed relieved; the Bishop of <hi>Zagrabia</hi> &amp; <hi>Eggenberg</hi> Generall of the Emperours Forces there, craved Ayd and Counsel herein of Lord <hi>Aversberg</hi> Governour of <hi>Charol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat;</hi> who raised a good number of Horse and Foot of his own, calling also the bordering Horsmen of <hi>Carnia</hi> and <hi>Carania;</hi> who, <hi>June</hi> 17. met all, not far from <hi>Justaunitz,</hi> there tarrying that night: next day passing over the River <hi>Savus,</hi> they joyned with the Emperour's Forces: march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 19th day to <hi>Sceline,</hi> expecting rhe comming of Count <hi>Serinus,</hi> The 20th. day, <hi>Herdelius</hi> with his <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Graswien,</hi> came into the Camp with many of those Light-Horsmen, which the <hi>Hungarians</hi> call <hi>Hufchocehi.</hi> The 21 day they lodged at <hi>Gradium,</hi> stil expecting <hi>Serinus</hi> his coming; who, busied, could not come; next day, a Souldier came from the besieged, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captains, except they hastened that day to relieve them, the Castle would be lost, for it was made saultable, and would that night be assaulted; and the Defendants doubting how they should maintain the place, began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure to think of composition: whereupon, the Captains forthwith consulted what course to take. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versberg</hi> was of opinion, it was best to go and give the Enemy battel; so was also the Lord <hi>Rederen;</hi> the rest were of a contrary mind, because the strength of the Christians were too weak: &amp; therefore they thought it better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereat, <hi>Avarsberg</hi> at first much moved, afterwards plainly set before them, a necessity of the cause with lively reasons: chearing up the fearful <hi>Croati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and notably perswading them all in generall to put their whole trust in God; to whom it was as easy to give Victory by a few as by many. With these &amp; other words he so prevailed, that they all resolved to go against the enemy

and to do what they could to relieve their Friends: so the whole Army not above 4000, hasted on with great speed, and being come within a Mile of the Enemies Camp, put themselves in order of Battel: Whereupon, the <hi>Turks</hi> brought all their Horsmen over <hi>Kulp</hi> by a Bridge which they made, and came on in order to joyn Battel with the Christians: the <hi>Croatians</hi> and <hi>Hussars</hi> in the Van-guard, gave the first charge; but having for a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These Invasions caused the Emperour to crave ayd, both of the States of the Empire, and other Princes farther off, by some easily granted, but not so speedily performed.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Peter Lehussar,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Horsmen, whom the <hi>Hungarians</hi> call <hi>Hussars,</hi> Captain of <hi>Pappa,</hi> by the appointment of the Governour of <hi>Rab,</hi> took at advantage the <hi>Turks</hi> Treasurers in <hi>Hungary,</hi> who commanded 5000 <hi>Turks:</hi> as he was mustering, and paying some of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, slaying him with divers of his men, and putting the rest to flight; and so with the spoyl and a few prisoners returned with the dead Treasurer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinan</hi> being come to <hi>Buda</hi> with his Army, resolved to begin with the siege of <hi>Vesprivium:</hi> so, compassing the City round, he continually thundred against this City with his Battery; the Christians perceiving the City was not long to be holden against so great a power, placed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers barrels of gunpowder in Mines they had made under the walls and bulwarks, with traines to take fire at a certain time; then they departed secretly out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the dead of the night; yet were they by the <hi>Turks</hi> descried, and most of them slain. <hi>Samaria</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, having a while defended himself, was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, together with <hi>Hors-kirk</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Captain.

               <p>The Bassa removing to <hi>Palotta,</hi> summoned the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: but receiving no pleasing answer, he besieged it

with all his power; which, at first, <hi>Ornan</hi> the Captain cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received, but being afterwards discouraged: though the Castle was yet but little shaken, but one man slain, and the Souldiers ready to spend their lives in defence, he offered to yield the Castle to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> so they might safely depart with bag and baggage, who granted his request: but they being come forth, and ready to depart, the faithless <hi>Turk</hi> slew them all, except the Captain and 2 others; after which without much labour, he took in all the Country therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, near the Lake <hi>Balaton.</hi>

               <p>Now at last, about the middle of <hi>Octob.</hi> the Christians mustered their Army, of above 18000 of good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers: With which, passing over <hi>Danubius,</hi> at the first encounter with the <hi>Turks,</hi> they slew a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, rescuing a number of Captives: about the end of which Month, Count <hi>Hardeth</hi> Governour of <hi>Rab,</hi> and Generall in that part, came from <hi>Camara,</hi> and besieged <hi>Alba regalis,</hi> which he soon made saultable with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilery, but in the assault was notably repulsed by the <hi>Turks</hi> so perceiving, no good could be done without a long siege for which he was not then provided; after consultation, had, he raised his siege <hi>Novemb.</hi> the second, removing that day but half a mile: but being about to remove next day, newes was brought that the Enemies power was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in sight; the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> by the command of <hi>Sinan</hi> was come forth with 13 <hi>Zanzacks,</hi> twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souldiers, 30 Field-pieces, and 500 Waggons laden with Victuals, and other provision to relieve the City: Whereupon, the Count, assisted by <hi>Serinus,</hi> and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and experienced Captains, with great speed put his Army in order, and couragiously set forward; the <hi>Bassa</hi> seeing them marching towards him, took the upper ground, thence discharging his Field-pieces upon them which mounted too high, did litle or no harm at all.

               <p>The Christians often assaulted this City, but were so received, that in five assaults, they lost five thousand men; among whom, were divers Commanders of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: 23 Cannoniers, were also slain, and ten great Pieces of Ordnance made unserviceable.</p>
               <p>This Garrison consisted most of <hi>Janizaries:</hi> whose notable valour in holding out, was much commended by their friends and enemies. About the same time, some <hi>Turks</hi> lighting on a <hi>Germane</hi> Troop, slew about 50, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rest to flight: which raising an Alarm, many ran, with some small Field-pieces, to rescue them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the <hi>Turks</hi> fleeing, the Christians eagerly pursuing them, were assailed by other <hi>Turks</hi> sallying out of a Fort fast by, and forced to retire, leaving their Field-pieces, which the <hi>Turks</hi> cloyed, breaking their Carriages. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time, <hi>Teuffenbach</hi> requested ayd of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Duke, against <hi>Hatwan;</hi> for that his forces were one way or other so weakened, that he had scarce 600 sound men; who spared him but 1200 Foot, because of too much weakening his own Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath,</hi> seeking by all meanes revenge, besides his own great power now about to come with <hi>Sinan,</hi> had procured 70000 <hi>Tartars</hi> from the grand <hi>Cham</hi> to be sent into <hi>Hungary</hi> to joyn with his Army, who breaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Podolia, Walachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> collected a huge number of Oxen and Kine, that they might be both assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Victualls, and the saflier travel thorow a part of <hi>Polonia;</hi> but being come to those borders, they found <hi>Samoschi</hi> the Chancellour, and the <hi>Cossacks</hi> in Arms:
<pb n="1030" facs="tcp:130480-02:524"/>
wherefore placing those Cattel round about them like a Trench, they marched on; but the <hi>Polanders</hi> with their Ordnance, so terrified the Cattel, that they turning upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and overthrowing all in their way, did exceeding harm: the <hi>Polonians</hi> following them, and hardly charging the confused Army, armed onely with Bowes and Arrowes, after a small fight, put them to flight, gaining an exceeding rich Prey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polonians</hi> lost about 1800: of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> were slain 30000; the rest; retiring into <hi>Polodia,</hi> passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nester</hi> by the way of <hi>Transilvania;</hi> and, doing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding harm, came to <hi>Temesware,</hi> and so further into <hi>Hungary,</hi> being conducted to the Army by 700 <hi>Turkish</hi> Horsemen.</p>
               <p>But <hi>June</hi> 14th, the Christians between 8 and 9 in the morning, furiously assaulted <hi>Strigonium</hi> in three places, which they notably maintained, till almost 3 in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon: yet were they glad (at last) with losse to retire. The arch-Duke from a high place beholding the assault, had one of his Footmen slain fast by him, with a small shot: many Turks were also slain, three being <hi>Sanzacks.</hi> Next night, there arose a most horrible Tempest of wind and rain, so that the arch-Dukes Tent was overthrown; and others, blown down or rent, were carried in the Air, from place to place.

               <p>The Christians took also another Fort, in an Island on the other side of the River, which the Turks lately took from them, cloying the Ordnance: which they again repairing, furnished it with a Garrison and other Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

battered, that one would have thought all should have been beaten down. <hi>June</hi> 17th, a Cannonier so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted a great Piece in the Castle, that the Piece with the Turkish Cannonier, fell down into the Ditch: on which day, a Mason that fled out of the Castle, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many Turks had been slain, and but an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 40 were slain in one Chamber: The Turks now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, when they were at the last cast, desperately to sally out, and to return with Victory, or shift every one for himself, which seemed not wholly feigned; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, 1000 Turks sallying out upon the new Fort, were notably repulsed, and forced to retire, 50 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain, and many more wounded and taken; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evening, eight Turks being taken, confessed, that six dayes before, they saw seven Boats of wounded and dead men, sent down the River to <hi>Buda:</hi> so that it might be easily gathered, how bloody a siege this was to the Turks; for those were bodies of account: those of the common Souldiers slain, being thrown into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>The Turks much troubled with the new-built Fort, on the bank of <hi>Danubius,</hi> sent to the Admirall of the Turk's Galleys, below in the River, to come up with his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, as high as the Fort, and at least to seem as if he would assault it: at which time, the besieged would sallie out, and assail it indeed on the other side.</p>
               <p>The Admirall did accordingly, discharging some great Pieces at the Fort, but was so welcomed, that he was glad with his Galleys rent to fall down out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but the while, they of the Town so desperately as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted the Fort on the other side, that some on the top of the Rampiers for two houres, most cruelly fought, many being slain and wounded, and the rest forced to retire.</p>

               <p>Now fame had brought newes, that <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> was coming to relieve <hi>Strigonium:</hi> of whose power, were divers reports; but most doubting the worst, and weary of the long siege, with its calamities, still added some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make the danger of stay seem greater.</p>
               <p>The besieged were in great wants, the intercepted Letters of the <hi>Sanzack</hi> to the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> declaring their hard Estate, and craving his promised help; or else the City could not be defended for lack of Victualls, above three dayes: which Letters being read in the Camp, great preparations were made for continuing the siege, and withstanding the Enemy, hourly expected: The Ordnance never ceasing on either side, many were slain on both sides, many being Cannoniers.</p>

that present Diet, as for the aforesaid causes, so for the generall peace of the Empire, the pacification of the low Countries, the reforming of Justice, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Coyn; but above all, to make it known, how much it concerned to have the <hi>Turks</hi> pride, timely aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at length, some effectual defence for <hi>Hungary,</hi> it being the strongest Bulwark of that part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and whereas his hereditary Provinces were not sufficient to maintain so chargeable a Warre, he request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Electors Princes and States, not to grudge to help with whatever should be needful against so puissant and dangerous an Enemy: So he caused all his demands to be read and delivered unto them; for answering where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they desired time, which granted after many long consultations, they answered with one consent, It was hard, by reason of the late dearth, and other like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for them to grant such ayd as the Emperour in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting required; yet beholding the great danger wherein the Christian Commonwealth then stood, they had of their own free will, and meere compassion, granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their usuall contribution, such relief for six years, as they thought sufficient to maintain a defensive Warre, both for the present and future.</p>

               <p>All thus met, the Prince, commanded the Gates to be shut, watch to be diligently kept, and none on pain of death to speak of imagined Treason: politiquely also publishing in writing, that the <hi>Germans</hi> had got a notable Victory over the <hi>Turks,</hi> commanding Bon-fires and other signes of Joy to be made; he prepared also a Banquet, whereto, he with others the chief Conspirators were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: who, being at dinner, he apprehended 14, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to prison, executing 5 in the Market-place n xt morning; He, who had undertook to have slain the Prince, after 3 or 4 light cuts in the neck, being drawn in pieces with 4 Horses, the other 4 were beheaded, and left there as a Spectacle: the rest being afterwards executed:

and <hi>Balthazor</hi> his Kinsman, that should have been exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, strangled.

               <p>After this Victory, the Prince besieged <hi>Temesware;</hi> but hearing of the <hi>Tartars</hi> comming towards <hi>Transilvania,</hi> upon their return, he gave off, to look to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit whereof, <hi>Amurath</hi> fell into a grievousfit of the falling sicknesse, vexed 3 dayes and 3 nights therewith; so that the City was filled with heaviness and fear, and the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers even ready to think of a new Lord. This tumult ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny supposed was the cause of <hi>Amurath</hi>'s death, shortly ensuing: whose grief &amp; malady daily encreased by ill news, still brought him, chiefly out of <hi>Transilvania:</hi> where the Prince waiting on every occasion cut the <hi>Turks</hi> short in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place, and took also this Month many of their strong holds. He had then in field 3 Armies: one under <hi>Ferens,</hi> in the Country <hi>Lugaz,</hi> nigh <hi>Temesware:</hi> another under <hi>Horat</hi> on th'other side <hi>Danubius,</hi> to intercept the <hi>Turks</hi> coming

               <p>Which Articles solemnly confirmed, the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were with all bounty sent back; the Prince the while, labouring by all means to draw to him, <hi>Michael</hi> Vayuod of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> both the <hi>Turks</hi> Tributaries, so that they shortly after joyned hands with him for recovery of their lost liberty: which revolt so much concerned the common good, that the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of <hi>Austria,</hi> the remnants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with some good part of <hi>Germany,</hi> is not causelesly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Count having made a notable Fort upon St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Hill, placed therein 5 great Culverins, greatly hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the upper-Town, by a furious Battery; so that none also could go betwixt the upper and lower Towns, but he

was endangered by those, or Musketiers, who, defended by them, lay waiting to that end, on the side of the Hill, in Caves and bushes; but <hi>Gokara</hi> Town and Fort, on the other side of <hi>Danubius,</hi> besieged by <hi>Palfi,</hi> was most sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the great Ordnance: wherefore the Count in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the battery, continuing it till the Counter-scarfe was beaten down, and fair breaches made in the wall. The <hi>Moravians,</hi> July 21, assaulted it in five places, whom <hi>Palfi</hi> seconded with his <hi>Hungarians,</hi> some being appointed, to bring with them things to fire the Town; so that in time of the aslaut, the Town was all on a light fire. The Turks having notably resisted, now being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and the fire so encreasing, that it caught hold of the lower Town on the other side of the River, the rest were all slain by the Christians. The fire being quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they repaired the breaches, and left therein a strong Garrison. A night or two after, 200 Turkish Horse being descryed fast by, an Alarum was raised in the Camp, as if all their Army had been at hand; yet it was afterwards known, they were onely Scouts sent out to view how the Christians lay encamped.</p>
               <p>A young Countrey Fellow, being, the latter end of this moneth, secretly sent out of the City, was taken by <hi>Palfi,</hi> and sent to the Count, who friendly demanded of him, Whence he came, Whither going, and whereabouts? who answered, he was sent by the Governour with Letters to the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> which he presently delivered unto him: the purport whereof were, that if the Bassa did not within 6 or 7 dayes, ayd and relieve him, he should be forced (through want of necessaries) to abandon the City, or yield it up: so the Count causing them to be closed up again, gave the youth a few Crowns, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to carry them to the Bassa, and bring him his answer, promising to reward him bountifully.</p>
               <p>The Bassa returned answer, he would be with him at the time appointed, willing him the while, to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

The <hi>Turks</hi> had often sallied out, to their great losse; yet they adventured out again on the 29 day of this moneth, 80 being left behind them, slaying but five Christians. The <hi>Turks</hi> in great wants, at length, news was brought into the Camp, that the Bassa was coming with 20000 men: who came <hi>Aug.</hi> 2d, encamping within 4 miles of the Christians: some Turkish Horse seeking after booty, out of the Pastures, even under their noses, carried away some few Horses; some Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Hungarian Troops issuing out, had a hot skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish with them; but the Turk retiring, as if overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, had at length drawn them, where divers Troops of Turks lay in ambush, who hardly charged them. The Hungarians acquainted with such dangerous skirmishes, fled, the Germans a while valiantly encountring them, but oppressed with multitude, at last fled: about 100 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all lost, and much wounded.

                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> (although the <hi>Tartar</hi> at first said, he would not send so much as an Asse thereunto) had by great gifts and his own respect with the <hi>Tartar,</hi> made him now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a strong Army, upon the Frontiers of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> to meet him in <hi>Hungary:</hi> to whom, that Vayuod sent Presents, with what Victuals he could possibly provide: <hi>Mahomet</hi> also, entreated with the <hi>Polonian</hi> King for his passage, as also to confirm the ancient League, which he knew the Emperour and other Princes sought (by all means) to withdraw him from.

               <p>The Emperour had, with what care he could, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that his Army might be ready at first of the Spring; but, although his own Forces were in some good time ready, yet was a good part of Summer past, before the ayd from other Princes met together: at length, when some convenient number were assembled at <hi>Vienna:</hi> they were by Lord <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> brought into the field, and encamped in those very Trenches that were cast up last year by count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> there to expect the comming down of their Warlike provision by the River: as also, the rest of the daily expected Forces.

               <p>Many Gentlemen and Commanders, in seeking to stay their flight, were slain; and though the Turks pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them scarce half a mile, yet the Christians fled all over the Countrey, no man pursuing them. <hi>Maximilian,</hi> seeing all desperate, fled to <hi>Cassovia:</hi> the <hi>Transilvanian</hi> retiring the most orderly towards <hi>Tocai,</hi> having lost not above 200, no one being of fame: all which losse, he imputed to the <hi>Hungarian</hi>'s covetousness, and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horse their cowardise: Lord <hi>Berstain</hi> fled also, as did <hi>Palfi;</hi> and in fine, all the rest: yet the night following, the Turks themselves, for fear of the Christian's return, with their best things, fled towards <hi>Agria;</hi> &amp; it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known, that the <hi>Turks</hi> Ordnance, Tents &amp; Baggage, stood 3 days in their Trenches, not at all, or but slenderly guarded; so that they might easily have been taken had

Wherefore he would never afterwards adventure his Person to the like perill in the Field. In this Battel of <hi>Karesta,</hi> and at the siege of <hi>Agria,</hi> were lost about 20000 Christians, and 60000 Turks. <hi>Mahomet</hi> after this Victory, fortifying, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risoning <hi>Agria</hi> with 10000 Souldiers, returned to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</hi>

were heard nigh the Walls, earnestly requesting to be let in, for fear of the Enemies pursuit: which being told the Governour by a Gentinel, he doubting it to be some subtilty of the Enemy, bad them there to tarry till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then being let in, they prostrating themselves before the Governour, pittifully requested him, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them with his charitable relief, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into their own Countrey: answering to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of them, that they were <hi>Italians,</hi> and had even then escaped out of the Turks hands at <hi>Rab:</hi> and though they shewed by their gesture, not to know any newes; yet he would needs know of them, when, and how they were taken by the Turks, and how they escaped out of that cruel servitude: so the younger told him, that when the Christians were overthrown by the Turks, under <hi>Agria,</hi> they having by flight escaped the greatest danger; and travelling towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> were (by a hundred Turks come out of <hi>Rab)</hi> taken and committed to the Chain, where they had almost two years, with great patience, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: telling him also, they had been three moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, carefully devising how to recover their lost liberty, which now seemed to make some offer of it self unto them; for, since the departure of the Emperours Army from the Town, they lay as men not much regarded; so one day, as they were carrying munition from the Pallace of <hi>Giaffar,</hi> for the Souldiers, they secretly conveyed three Pieces of Coard, by night to let themselves down from the Wall, burying the Coard in the ground; but night come, and they roaming in the dark, and still finding one let or other, they were forced to defer it till the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: when as they fastning the Coard above, slid down one after another: the younger, though he could not swim, being by the assistance of the elder, conducted over the broad and deep Ditch; and so, in the great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the night, they were come by chance to <hi>Komara,</hi> thinking to have gone to <hi>Vienna.</hi>

Whereupon, he requested Lord <hi>Palfi,</hi> in all haste and secresie, with 1600 Foot, and what Horse he could make, to come unto him, who presently setting forward by night, <hi>March</hi> 26, before day, with 1400 Foot, and 120 Horse, arrived at <hi>Komara:</hi> where they entring, the Gates were again fast shut, and so kept for fear of the Enemies Spies; so <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> and <hi>Palfi</hi> fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of the intended enterprise, and resolving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they found they had 2600 Foot, and 300 Horse, all couragious men: who staying two dayes, and many of them, confessing, and receiving the Sacrament, now doubted not to encounter a far greater number of Turks than themselves. And the more to incite them, <hi>Palfi</hi> delivered to them, a notable Speech, (yet not telling them whither they were to go) at the end whereof, they all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aloud, They were most ready to do any of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and follow them any whither; and so having well refreshed themselves, about the 11th houre, <hi>March</hi> 27, they in good order set forward towards <hi>Rab:</hi> and least the Enemy should have warning of what was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Palfi</hi> ordered <hi>Stroine</hi> his Maior, to follow softly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, with 1700 Horse and Foot; so upon the break of day, they drew towards <hi>Rab,</hi> lying in close ambush, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7 miles short of the Town; and night being come, in two houres march, they drew near <hi>Rab,</hi> where they stayed about five houres, sending before them a French Engineer, with 13 others, (rewarded with 1500 Duckats) having with them four Petards: where they found the Draw-bridge down because the Turks then secure, houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected some Wagons, with Provision from <hi>Alba Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis,</hi>

whereby they coming to the Gate unperceived, and fastning their forcible Engines thereunto, gave fire to the same; and being not gone far, were descryed, and asked by a Sentinel, What they were; but was presently answered by the Petards, which in a trice, tore in sunder the Gate, with some of the Wall, and adjacent Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Watch now gave the Alarum, &amp; the Christians thrusting in, took the Gate, no Turk yet coming to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their entrance: 200 Turks first appeared with their hideous cry, <hi>Alla, Alla,</hi> but were overcharged by 300 already entred. The Bassa also came on with above one thousand following him, with the greatest Turkish cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and fury: where, after two hours most terrible fight, the Bassa being slain, the Turks a little retired, whereby one thousand Christians more entred; but <hi>Giaffar Bassa</hi> coming with above one thousand tall Souldiers, all the Inhabitants also running after him with great force, they constrained the Christians to retire to the Gate: who there with incredible courage, sustaining the greatest fury of the Enemy; and this Bassa also encountred by Lord <hi>Swartzenburg,</hi> being at length slain also, most of the Turks retired into the City: about 300 crept under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a Bulwark, where were some Barrels of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they firing, blew up with themselves 300 Christians that were above upon the Bulwark, who else, were not supposed to have lost in that Victory, above two hundred men.</p>
               <p>The Turks discomfited, fled in every place before the Christians, they most horribly slaughtering them: the Turkish Women all this while, casting down from on high, Stones, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the heads of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: the bloudy execution, in one secret place or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, continued all that day untill night: who ransacking also every corner, were by their wealth greatly enriched; but they found exceeding store of rich Furniture, at the Pallace of <hi>Giaffor:</hi> also Letters, in Characters of Gold,

from the Bassa of <hi>Buda</hi> to this Bassa: with many things written from the <hi>Sultan</hi> unto him, with great store of Coin, which all fell to the Souldiers share: 60 Pieces of Ordnance were there recovered, sometimes the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and 24 others brought from <hi>Buda,</hi> with great store of Ammunition and small Pieces, and Meal enough to serve four thousand Men for a year and a half; but of Wine, onely four Vessels. In <hi>Giaffars</hi> Palace, was also found great store of Armour and Weapons, abundance of Cloth and Apparel, all given to the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rab</hi> was thus taken, <hi>March</hi> 29, 1598, about six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Turks or more being slain, and scarce six hundred Christians. The Heads of the two Bassaes being sent for a Present, to the Emperour at <hi>Prague,</hi> with all particulars of the whole action. For all this, did not <hi>Mahomet</hi> cease to make greater provision than before, for his Warres in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ordering <hi>Ibrain Bassa,</hi> his Brother in Law, and Generall, with all convenient speed, to take the Field: which yet fell out otherwise; for a great dissention arose betwixt the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> the best footmen; and the <hi>Spahi,</hi> the best Horsemen of the Turkish Empire: the one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, standing upon their strength, and the other upon their honour, do oft in setting forwards toward the Wars, fall at odds, as now they did: insomuch, that the Generall, to appease this tumult, was glad to put to death some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent <hi>Janizaries,</hi> refusing to set forward as their <hi>Aga</hi> commanded them; but he thinking to have executed some others of them also, was by them and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, put in such fear of his life, that to avoid the danger, he was glad to lay all the blame upon his Lievtenant: who was therefore delivered to their fury, who presently slew him, with some others of the Bassa's followers. So <hi>Ibrahim</hi> reviewing his Army at <hi>Sophia,</hi> there stayed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting order from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> whether to begin his Warres in <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Transilvania,</hi> which could not well be before the beginning of July; such scarcity of Victuall then arising in the Camp.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ibraim</hi> Bassa, much troubled with this overthrow, sent news: hereof in Post to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which brought a fear upon the whole City; so that the <hi>Sultan</hi> gave him Commission, to come to some honourable Peace with the Emperour, and to bring it with him, who was shortly to

return to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> his Army, besides the cold sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, greatly wanting bread, and many of his best Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dying of the plague, besides abundance of their cattel also: so, that the Souldiers fell to robbing one another, and at length into mutiny: wherein divers being slain, most of the rest, by divers wayes returned home, not well tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting each other: So, that nothing more was now done with the <hi>Turks</hi> great preparation; neither for relief of those evils, did <hi>Ibraim</hi> bring at his return, any conclusion of peace unto his Lord.</p>
               <p>Besides these troubles, <hi>Cusahin</hi> or <hi>Cassan,</hi> the Son of a Sultaness, brought up in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and having served in the Wars of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and at length made Bassa of <hi>Caramania,</hi> a man of great spirit; upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ill success in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the desire he saw in the <hi>Persians,</hi> to recover their lost Fortress; and grieved also with some particular wrongs to himself, resolved to take up Arms, laying before his Souldiers the Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the present State: and Gallantly perswading them, What an easie thing it were to chase <hi>Mahomet</hi> out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi> And so, having won to him 3000 <hi>Harquebusiers,</hi> and 5000 Horsmen, he took the field.

After which, he besieging <hi>Cogna,</hi> a City in the confines of <hi>Natolia,</hi> it was yielded unto him; He also openly proclaimed, that for reformation of the disordered State, he would ere long go to besiege <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> Wherefore, those that would follow him,

               <p>This dangerous Rebellion, with the troubles of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania</hi> &amp; <hi>Valachia,</hi> caused the <hi>Sultan</hi> to be readier to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to peace; whereto the Emperour was not hasty to hearken, but on honourable conditions, as knowing the <hi>Turks</hi> end in requiring the same: His <hi>Janizaries</hi> also, and other men of War, in this his so weak Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardly to be commanded: threatning in their discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to depose both his chief Officers and Himself, and to banish the Sultaness his mother: saying, <hi>She had bewitched him, that she her self might rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Casahin</hi> grown strong, was come into the field and even ready to give the Bassa battel; who thought it best again to prove, if his followers might by fair means be drawn from him: and so comming nigh him, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a generall pardon to all, who should forthwith forsake the Rebell, and return home, which thing was the ruin of <hi>Cusahin;</hi> for, most of them enriched with great boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, upon this free pardon, returned unto their own Countries, to live of their ill-gotten goods, leaving <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sahin</hi> with some few others: so that in few dayes he was taken, and brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was with most exquisite torments tortured to death.</p>

                  <pb n="1130" facs="tcp:130480-02:574"/>The Emperour with the beginning of the next year, 1600, called <hi>A dyet of the Princes of the Empire,</hi> to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with him, of such helps as were to be given against next Spring; who all promised, to send their Souldiers with their pay, and sufficient contribution to maintain that defensive War.

               <p>At first of the Spring, the <hi>Turks</hi> began to stir: who, although <hi>Ibraim</hi> Bassa, was then in some speech with the Emperour about a peace, yet, ceased they not with their scattering Companies, to do what harm they could upon the Emperour's Frontiers: the cause, why he the more speedily called on his Friends for ayd.

Then also an Imperiall Colonel, inroading about <hi>Alba-regalis,</hi> with 1500 Horse, slew 600 <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and took divers of their Captains: 6000 other <hi>Tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> also, now returning homewards out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> were so set upon by the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> near the Black-sea, that many being slain, the rest ran into the Sea, leaving all their prey to their Enemies.</p>
               <p>In the heat of these broils, Lord <hi>Palfi</hi> died in his Castle of <hi>Biberpurg, March</hi> 23. to the great grief of many, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

24 Horsmen, to disswade them from yielding the Town to the <hi>Turks,</hi> telling them, they should shortly have their pay: who sent them back shamefully derided; so that <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> retired again to <hi>Rab,</hi> till some greater strength were come unto him.

Likewise, 300 of these Rebels, had then laid themselves in Ambush, by a Mill without the Town, &amp; were charged by the <hi>Walloons</hi> and <hi>Haiducks,</hi> discovering them: yet (for the shot from the Town) they could do no good upon them; but retired, having lost 300 men the Lievt.

               <p>About 3 dayes after, 3 of these Rebels, being by chance taken, and brought to <hi>Rab,</hi> were not only apparrelled, but trimmed like <hi>Turks;</hi> their fellows also, imitating the

               <p>Shortly after, they sent Messengers to the Governour of <hi>Alba,</hi> to know his full resolution, who conducted by Turks of great account, were by the way taken by the free <hi>Haiducks,</hi> with 100 Turks more. <hi>Marotti</hi> the while, by Letters, secretly advertised <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> of a place, whereby he might easily enter; and the rather, for that the Rebels were at variance: who <hi>July</hi> 12th, came to <hi>Pappa</hi> with 9000 Horse and Foot, but disappointed of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, yet hardly belayed the Town: on whom, the mutiniers sallying out, valiantly encountred them, but were still, without any notable losse, beaten back again.

               <p>The Imperials at last, came even to the Town-ditches with their Trenches, having let out the water: where

some Townsmen escaping out, declared, that the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous within, laboured day and night to fortifie the Town, but were much letted by continual assaults: also, that now they had no Victuals left, but a little Salt, and sixty Horse, of which they had begun to eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Government of the Army, was now committed to the Lord <hi>Redern,</hi> both valiant and learned, who though very sickly, came to the Camp <hi>Aug.</hi> 8th, where hearing that the Rebels, brought to great extremity, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by night to flee, kept a more vigilant and strong Watch: next night, about two houres before day, they began to issue out, and were suffered to go out as unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but <hi>Nadasti,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Thurne,</hi> and Count <hi>Solmes,</hi> were presently sent after them, who in three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, overtaking them, near the great Wood <hi>Packem,</hi> slew most of them, <hi>Dela Mota</hi> being slain by <hi>Solmes,</hi> because he would not yield; and his Head presented to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>

                  <hi>Basta</hi> assuring his Camp, and not onely sending, but going himself to see how the Enemy lay, and finding no reasonable meanes for him there to attempt any exploit by, thought it best to make a retreat, of about an Italian mile, according to the commodiousness of the place, which his purpose was much disliked by the confederate Captains: to whom it seemed more safe to assault the Enemy in his Trenches, than to retire before the face of an Enemy so strong and adventurous, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> but <hi>Basta,</hi> promised therein to shew them a more cunning kind of

fight, than they yet knew, and the assurance which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and the <hi>Almaines</hi> in the Rear, would give in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; so that they should not lose one man, much lesse, to fall into any disorder, his purpose being onely to give the Enemy the plain, to shew himself openly in; so the morning following, the three Corps <hi>Duguard,</hi> were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, and the baggage sent away: whom the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvanians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> followed, the <hi>Almaines</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing the Ordnance in the Reare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vayuod</hi> hereupon sent a great Troop to view them, and skirmish with them, which were so kept off by Musquetiers in the Reare, that they could not come to do any harm, though they were all the way charged by them, to the great content of <hi>Basta:</hi> who when he saw the Ordnance on Carriages, to come out of the Village, he marched softly, to give the Enemy hope to overtake him, having before thought of a convenient place for his men, with room enough, upon advantage to stay: and when he might (about half a mile off) see the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my march in order of Battel, he began to march towards him: and having placed his men in a fit station and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, according to the scituation of the place, and order of the Enemy, and the manner of his proceeding set down, he put on his Helmet, and chearfully said, he trusted, then to shew the <hi>Vayuod,</hi> that his Trunchion could do more than his Scimitar: So himself setting forward betwixt the Squadron of the <hi>Almaine</hi> Foot, and the Wing of Musquetiers, in the afternoon, he marched fair and softly toward the Enemy: who without moving, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the discharge of their Artillery, whereunto the nearer the Enemy came, the lesse harm it did him.</p>
               <p>The Wing of Musquetiers, went directly to charge the Artillery; and the Squadron towards the Foot of the Hill, where <hi>Basta</hi> desired forcibly to charge, presently came in a Front, just upon the sign given; and so with
<pb n="1145" facs="tcp:130480-02:581"/>
his <hi>Almaine</hi> Foot, and the <hi>Rutters</hi> on the right hand, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in behind most part of the Enemies Foot: at which instant, the <hi>Rutters</hi> on the left hand also, so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously charged upon the three thousand Launces, that better could not have been desired.</p>
               <p>The Launces retiring without hurt, and the first Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley discharged, forced the Infantry, and so disordered the rest: whereupon, the Wings charging, there presently ensued a great slaughter and overthrow: the Enemy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing one hundred thousand, and <hi>Basta</hi> but forty, and as many hurt; and greater had the slaughter been, if the Village and nights approach had not covered many of them that fled, and stayed the pursuit of the Victors; yet was there afterwards found in all (as was by the <hi>Peasants</hi> reported) twenty thousand slain in this Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basta</hi> recovered many Ensigns, and much Armour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent by the Emperour to the <hi>Vayuod,</hi> with all his Tents and Baggage: sending out presently many Troops of Horse every way, with Proclamation to spare the lives of such <hi>Siculi,</hi> as should lay down Arms: many of whom, were sent prisoners to divers places, especially to <hi>Fogaras:</hi> the <hi>Vayuod</hi> himself, with some <hi>Cossacks,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping by flight.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, <hi>Basta</hi> sent away Count <hi>Caurioli,</hi> to inform the Emperour of all particulars, who seemed to be pleased; yet neither rewarded the Count, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Basta</hi> in what he had done, although he had in writing, approved of his resolution and motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basta</hi> ordered the <hi>Chiaki,</hi> or chief man of the rebellious <hi>Transilvanians,</hi> to send out one thousand Horse to pursue the <hi>Vayuod;</hi> who instead thereof, joyning with other consorts, fell to ransacking of <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> pretending, there was the <hi>Vayuods.</hi> Wealth; yet sparing neither MERCHANT nor CITIZEN: which seemed to <hi>Basta,</hi> a great wrong, to see the innocent punished,

and the guilty to escape; and though he made what he could thitherwards, and stayed one day not farre off to have given some redresse unto the spoil, yet he lost his labour, be ause many of the chiefest sort had a hand therein, with whom he thought it more wisdom then to dissemble, than to use any severity, without hope of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: So resolving in haste to march towards <hi>Foga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> whither he heard the <hi>Vayuod</hi> was come with new forces, he in six dayes came to <hi>Cibinium,</hi> where he had certain newes, that the Chancellor of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> were with a strong Army upon the Frontiers of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> having sent before them <hi>Moyses</hi> the <hi>Siculian,</hi> with eight thousand of his <hi>Siculi:</hi> wherefore he thought good now to stay where he was, to provide for all events, as need should be, resolving to send the <hi>Chiaki,</hi> and one <hi>Pithi,</hi> to parley with <hi>Moses,</hi> who made a shew of no great moment, of his good will towards the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates: in the mean time, came two Messengers from the <hi>Vayuod,</hi> offering, that he should do whatsoever were in the Emperour's behalf, to be imposed upon him: To whom it was propounded, first, that he should forever resign all claim in <hi>Transilvania:</hi> then, he with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to sweare fidelity to the Emperour: also, that he should forthwith go with his Army unto the Frontiers of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> to stay the <hi>Polonians</hi> from further entrance; and to give his Wife and little Sonne in Hostage, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these things.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Techelli,</hi> was sent to receive the Oath and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages; for whose keeping, the Castle of <hi>Alba Julia</hi> was appointed.</p>
               <p>This agreement being made, <hi>Basta</hi> kept on towards <hi>Fogaras,</hi> which he found already possessed by the <hi>Chiaki,</hi> thence to <hi>Corona.</hi> After which, the <hi>Vayuod</hi> distrusting the Articles, went into <hi>Valachia,</hi> but not into <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia;</hi> not so much discomfited with the Forces of

               <p>Now, whether it were for distrust of his own followers, or onely for fear of Treason plotted by the <hi>Polonians,</hi> who with so small Forces, were come to fight: he of his own accord, fled into the Mountains, without any great losse, having left his Baggage behind him, which was assailed, and taken by the <hi>Haiducks,</hi> and such other sharkers: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though afterwards in divers skirmishes with the <hi>Turks,</hi> (who, to cause him the rather to turn his back on the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> had scoured up and down the Countrey) he lost many: in the end, giving <hi>Moldavia</hi> for lost, he was now out of hope, how to be able to hold onely <hi>Valachia</hi> his old Government: Even he, which but lately command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above one hundred thousand Souldiers in field; he who was able in despight of any, to command <hi>Valachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia;</hi> and perhaps, the other Countries neare him also, as having received the Command of <hi>

               <p>In the mean time (the Treaty betwixt the Emperour and the <hi>Turk</hi> being frustrated) <hi>Ibraim</hi> Bassa, having made great preparation all last Winter; now at length in the latter end of <hi>Aug.</hi> began to set forward with his Army from <hi>Belgrade,</hi> supposed to be about 200000 men: and sitting down before <hi>Babotsca,</hi> a strong Fortress in lower-<hi>Hungary,</hi> furiously battered it, purposing next day to assault it; but, the Captain of the Castle, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the weakness of his Garrison, and the walls to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sore shaken, delivered up the place upon reasonable composition.

Ibrahim</hi> especially longed for this place, both to free the <hi>Turks</hi> Frontiers, from the often incursions of the Souldiers therein: and hereby also to open a more free &amp; safe passage for the <hi>Turks</hi> into <hi>Austria;</hi> So encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the side of the Marsh, which encompassed the Isle, whereon the Town stood, he began with Faggots &amp; Earth to fill up the Marsh, so to pass over his Army; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged not ceasing with great shot to disturb them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who yet proceeding in their work, had brought it almost close to the Island: where, being about to land, they were by the Garrison-souldiers encountring them, forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with the loss of a number of men, and 2 of their best Captains; but, preparing against next day with a greater force to have assaulted the Isle, they saw the Imperiall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my now at their backs, aud doing them great harm with their Artillery; divers Bands also sometime sallying out of the Camp, discharged great Vollies of shot, even into their Trenches: also from the Town, they received no small hurt.</p>
               <p>The Imperiall Army, were about 42000 Horse and Foot: men of divers Nations, under the leading of Duke <hi>Mercurie;</hi> with whom, were also <hi>Nadasti,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous Captains, come for the relief of <hi>

So, that the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> General taking courage, made an inroad into the Country: and meeting with 200 Waggons laden with
<pb n="1151" facs="tcp:130480-02:585"/>
Victuals, for the Christian Army, slew the Convoy, and carried them away; whereby such want arose among them, that they were glad by night to dislodge and retire, which for all that, being by the <hi>Turks</hi> perceived, they presently following them, cut off above 3000, with some Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and most of the Baggage: the rest (the while) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring farther off into more safe places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> now returning to the siege, the Garrison (a few dayes after) despairing of timely relief, mutined, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing any longer to defend the Town, hardly layed to: and the rather, because divers <hi>Hungarians</hi> were fled out of the Town; having (as was thought) revealed to the Bassa the state of the besieged: yet, <hi>Paradiser</hi> the Governour, and some other Captains, did what they might (as they said afterward) to have perswaded the contrary.

The Christians, besides other rich prey here, took 14 great pieces, with good store of shot and powder.</p>
               <p>The Duke now again summoned the City, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Turks</hi> gave no answer, but by their pieces: whereat the Duke much displeased, sent them word, he would send them other manner of Messengers to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and by Gods help sup with them in the City, though unwelcome.</p>
               <p>So next day, having made two fair Breaches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, he with great slaughter of the Enemy entered the same, though the <hi>Turks</hi> cast downe upon the Christians, Darts, Wild-fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi> breaking by heaps into the richest Houses, both took what themselves lighted on, and stript the <hi>Germans</hi> of what they had gotten: yea, they opened the Tombs of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kings, to spoyl the dead of such things as were, for honours-fake, long before enterred with them: shewing themselves therein more barbarous than the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Bassa of <hi>Buda</hi> (then laying a prisoner at <hi>Vieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> hearing of the taking of this City, fasted with his 2 ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants a whole day, prostrate on his face, and praying to his Prophet <hi>Mahomet)</hi> who had (as he said) <hi>all this year been angry with the</hi> Turks.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Hassan</hi> the Turkish Generall, was comming to relieve <hi>Alba-regalis:</hi> and though he heard by the way, that the City was won; yet, taking with him the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> with the other Commanders thereabouts: and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formed an Army of about 60000, but most raw Souldiers, he held on his way thitherwards, both to give some content to his angry Lord; and hoping to overthow the Christian Army, or at least to regain the City, as yet unrepaired. But the Duke had presently repaired the Breaches, and put therein a strong Garrison of expert Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: and being himself about 20000 strong, set forward to meet the Bassa, beginning a hot and bloudy skirmish with him; yet, the Bassa next day sent away part of his Army, to prove, if the City might be recovered: himself (the mean while) offering the Christians battel, so to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie them. But, the Duke informed of the basenesse of
<pb n="1175" facs="tcp:130480-02:588"/>
the Bassa's Souldiers (although he were in number far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him) went out and encountred him: and, at the first onset disordering his foremost Squadrons, sorced the <hi>Turks</hi> to retire with the loss of 6000 men: among whom were, the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> 6 <hi>Zanzacks,</hi> and divers others of good place and note. The Duke also took from them divers Ordnance, and had not a great squadron of <hi>Tartars</hi> appeared at his back, he had undoubtedly overthrown all the Bassa's Army; but, now contenting himself with the Victory already gotten, he retired orderly into his Trenches, having not lost above 300 men. Whilst both Armies thus lay, supplies repairing unto them, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a day of generall battel; the <hi>Janizaries</hi> still murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that it was now no time of the year to keep the field, enforced the Bassa to retire to <hi>Buda,</hi> and disband his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: in which retreat, many were by the Christians cut off in the Rear, and many taken, 50 being of the <hi>French</hi> mutineers of <hi>Pappa:</hi> whom <hi>Matthias,</hi> at the instance of Duke <hi>Mercurie,</hi> pardoned. They also, who were sent to attempt <hi>Alba-regalis,</hi> were so welcomed with shot, and charged with often sallies; that, despairing to prevail, they returned to the Bassa that sent them.</p>
               <p>About the time that the Duke began to besiege <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regalis, Ferdinand</hi> the Arch-Duke, now 30000 strong, by the advise of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> his Lievt. Gen. resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to besiege <hi>Canisia:</hi> the recovery whereof, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned even <hi>Italy</hi> it self; Whereupon, he came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped before it, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 10. And although the <hi>Turks</hi> in Garrison (not past a 1000) with their often and gallant sallies much troubled the Christians, and that other bands of the <hi>Turks</hi> came many times out of the strong Holds thereabouts to skirmish with them, and to see if they could put any more Souldiers into the Town; yet, both in the one place and the other, The <hi>Turks</hi> were to their cost still repulsed and put to flight, losing also some small Castles and Forts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="1158" facs="tcp:130480-02:589"/>The Christians found means to dry the Marsh a little, that invironed the Town, and to fill it up on one side, and to come so near the Town, that having planted 3 tire of Artillery against it, they began furiously to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. Yea, at length they approached so nigh, that they came with their Trenches even close to the Town-ditch, perswading the <hi>Turks</hi> now, whilst they might, upon good conditions to yield, and so save their Lives. But, they braving the Christians, said, <hi>They would keep the place for the</hi> Sultan, <hi>in despight of all their Forces:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, it was resolved to give a general assault.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the news of the winning of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Regalis,</hi> caused great Joy and Triumph in the Camp; the Christians also by fit men perswaded the Souldiers in <hi>Canisia</hi> to yield, and not cast themselves into such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as had their fellowes at <hi>Alba-regalis,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they (among whom the Renegate <hi>Walloons</hi> were chief) contemptuously answered, <hi>They little feared such weak Assailants, scornfully commanding the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to depart,</hi> and oft-times discharging their great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as had the Christians in triumph the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Now, though the Walls were sore shaken, and the Breaches almost laid open: yet was the assault for a while delayed, till Bridges might be made to be laid over the Ditch; but all things now ready, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> with some other <hi>Italians</hi> (according to Lot) comming forward, the Bridge was found both too short and weak for them to get over by; so that sinking under them, both Souldiers and Commanders (as <hi>

Yet, were not the Christian-Commanders at all discouraged, but began to provide against the violence of the Winter-weather, as also to hinder any Victuals from being brought to

And although already, Horse, flesh was dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chear with the Defendants, yet, they being again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to yield, instead of answering them one word, shook their Swords afar off at them.

Neither failed the <hi>Turks</hi> the while, to trouble them by often sallies, attempting especially to have fired their Tents, but they were still with loss beaten back into the Town. But whilst the <hi>Turks,</hi> as it were with desperate hope thus defend the place: lo, in the latter end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> the raging North-wind, accompanied with a deep Snow, overthrew most of the Tents and Pavillions of the Christians, burying as it were their whole Army in Snow and Ice: so, that in <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Camp, were 1500 men, with 300 Horses, starved and frozen to death.

and confused tumult, that they left behind them their great Ordnance, with Tents and Baggage; a common voice running, they were well if they could but save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: so that the Souldiers, in fear to be pursued, fled; but accompanied with such Winds, Snow, and extream cold, that many of them fell down frozen, and never rose more, not being to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But, <hi>Basta</hi> &amp; the Vayuod followed him with such speed, that they overtook him before he could get thither, so hardly pressing him, that he must needs turn about and fight, or suffer his men to be slain like beasts: wherein, though he, nor his failed to do their utmost, yet such was the Valour of the other, that in a great fight disordering his Foot, they put them to flight, and cut them all in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Whereupon, the Prince fled betime with his Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the uttermost Confines of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> having lost 10000 Souldiers. Hereupon, <hi>Claudiopolis</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Cities and Towns, returned again to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Obeysance.</p>
               <p>The Vayuod, to satisfie his long hatred against the <hi>Transilvanians,</hi> utterly wasted all places whereby he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which <hi>Basta</hi> not liking, <hi>requested him to use his Victory with more modesty, especially toward such places as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily returned to the Emperour's Obeysance;</hi> who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>He would do what he thought good, without his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or the Emperour's either, chiefly in that, which he had now twice Conquered: wherefore,</hi> Basta <hi>might command them, that were to be commanded by him; for, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no Soveraignty of</hi> Basta, <hi>or the Emperour over hims:</hi> Unto which presumptuous speech <hi>Basta</hi> replyed not; but from that time, better observing his proceedings, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he had Intelligence with the <hi>Turks:</hi> that by chasing the Imperials out of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> he might hold it to himself, as Tributary to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> best able to defend him. The truth whereof, he certainly understood by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his to that purpose, intercepted by his Souldiers: Whereupon, he became very pensive for the great power of the Vayuod in those Countries, and also for the great strength he had even then present about him: So, consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with certain of his chief Commanders, what were best to be done in so dangerous a case, A <hi>Walloon</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain offered to go into the Vayuods Camp, and in his own
<pb n="1163" facs="tcp:130480-02:591"/>
Tent to kill him as a Traitor: so he going with some 60 men, boldly stept into his Tent, willing him to yield himself the Emperours prisoner: who being about to lay his hand upon his Scimitar, the <hi>Walloon</hi> with an Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, thrust him into the breast: at which instant, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Sword, at one blow, cleft his Head down to his shoulders. Presently, upon his death, a great tumult was raised in his Camp; but <hi>Basta</hi> forthwith, appearing with all his Souldiers, and producing the treasonable Letters, all was again appeased; but especially, for that his souldiers now saw themselves without a Head, and too weak also for the Imperials there present in Arms.</p>
               <p>In the Vayuods Tent, were also other Letters found, so plainly declaring the same treason, that the <hi>Walachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were at first wonde rously moved, hearing them read, said, he was worthily slain; and had they known any such traiterous purpose by him, they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have taken of him deserved punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basta</hi> offered his Souldiers, either to depart wither they would; or, taking an Oath of obedience to the Emperour, to enter into his pay. His dead body was laid out a whole day for the Souldiers to gaze upon, and afterwards bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basta,</hi> now, what by force, what by agreement, soon took in most of that Countrey: nevertheless, for all that he had done for the assurance thereof unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, (being so much, as most men thought, sufficient) even in the winding up of this year 1601, the <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> understanding, that <hi>Sigismund,</hi> with a great Army of <hi>Polonians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> was coming against the Imperialls, most part of them took up Arms in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, saying, Their first Oath voluntarily given to him as their natural Prince, was more to be respected, than any other afterwards, by force extorted from them by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince; So that <hi>Basta</hi> withdrew himself; with his
<pb n="1164" facs="tcp:130480-02:592"/>
followers unto a strong Town, in a corner of <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi> whence, with all speed, he sent to the Emperour for greater ayd. After whose departure, <hi>Sigismund</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring without resistance, was of the people in generall, joyfully received, and all the honour done unto him, that was by them possible.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Bassa of <hi>Agria</hi> going out with 10000 Turks, in hope to have surprized <hi>Toccay,</hi> in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> was encountred by <hi>Gonzaga</hi> the Lievtenant, there overthrown, and with great slaughter, chased to the Gates of <hi>Agria.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Scrivano</hi> also in <hi>Caramania,</hi> and <hi>Natolia,</hi> came now again this year, with a greater power into the field, to meet with <hi>Mahomet Bassa,</hi> who with 50000 good Souldiers, was ready to encounter him, a great part of whose Army, the <hi>Scrivano</hi> cut asunder in a great fight, and becoming Master of the Field, forraged all the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countries, almost to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> still calling the people to liberty, and proclaiming himself the true defendor of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> faith, and of the liberty of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined Countries; so that the great Turk must now send another great Army to ayd the Bassa, with whom the <hi>Scrivano</hi> joyning Battel, and overcharged with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, was at first put to the worst; but having repaired his disordered Battel, he with a great slaughter, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered also the Bassa's Army: so contenting himself with what he had already done, he retired with his Army, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the strength of the Mountains, to live that winter upon the spoil of the adjoyning Countries. Besides all which troubles, the Plague also this year, soar raged, both in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and many places of the Turkish Empire: when also the <hi>Janizaries</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some disgrace, by some of the <hi>Sultans</hi> favourites, caused their <hi>Aga,</hi> well accompanied, to enter into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to require their heads: whom <hi>Mahomet,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for his presumption, to be cut in pieces, in the midst

of the <hi>Spahi,</hi> yet not without the great slaughter of the <hi>Spahi</hi> themselves, slain by the <hi>Janizaries.</hi> The other <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> also now ready to revenge the death of their Captain, were by <hi>Cicala Bassa,</hi> bellowing among them a great sum of money, again appeased: which their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, <hi>Mahomet</hi> imputing to their drinking of Wine, contrary to their Law, by the perswasion of the <hi>Musti,</hi> commanded all that had any Wine in their Houses in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or <hi>Pera,</hi> upon pain of death, to bring it forth, and stave it, except the <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassadors: so that some report, Wine ran down the Channel in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as if it had been water, after a great showre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sigismund,</hi> now again possessed of <hi>Transilvania</hi> could not yet well assure himself to keep it; for <hi>Basta</hi> still strengthened with new supplies from the Emperour, was already entred into <hi>Transilvania,</hi> in 1602: the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> busied in their Warres of <hi>Swethland;</hi> and the Turks with their other greater affaires, not sending <hi>Sigismund</hi> their promised ayd. Wherefore, he dealt with <hi>Basta</hi> for a cessation of Arms, till Embassadors might be sent to the Emperour, to intreat for some good attonement: who so handled the matter with the Emperour, that <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> was content, to the behoof of his Majesty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign unto <hi>Basta,</hi> all places as he yet held in <hi>Transilvania,</hi> upon much like conditions, he had about three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made with him; and so in and for all, to submit to his Majesty: whereupon, <hi>Zachel, Moyses,</hi> the Princes Lievtenant, not able to endure, or hear that the Province should again fall into the hands of the <hi>Germans,</hi> went upon a sudden to assail <hi>Basta.</hi> But he an old and x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Commander, perceiving even his first moving, with great speed put his Army in order, joyning Battel with him, and with the losse of some 500 men, overthrew <hi>Moyses,</hi> with his <hi>Transilvanians, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                  <pb n="1166" facs="tcp:130480-02:593"/>
slaying above 3000, and putting the rest to flight; but <hi>Sigismund</hi> hearing what his Lievetenant had done, went into the Camp to <hi>Basta,</hi> excusing himself as done without his privity, and against his will: offering to perform, whatever was by him to be performed, according to the agreement: and presently calling forth his Garrisons out of all strong places, yet by him holden, he surrendred them to <hi>Basta,</hi> and so put himself on his way towards the Emperour: after whose departure, all that Province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe, yielded to <hi>Basta,</hi> as to the Emperour's Lievtenant, who calling an Assembly of all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, took of them an Oath for their obedience and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Emperour.</p>
               <p>But the mean while, the <hi>Valachians</hi> not able longer to endure the great insolency of the Turks, (who after the death of <hi>Michael,</hi> had made one <hi>Jeremiah Vayuod</hi> there) took up Arms: and proclaiming one <hi>Radoll,</hi> (the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours favourite) <hi>Vayuod,</hi> chased <hi>Jeremiah</hi> quite out of the Countrey: who fleeing to <hi>Simon, Palatine</hi> of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> by his and the <hi>Turks</hi> help, drave out <hi>Radoll</hi> again: who now being with <hi>Basta</hi> with about 10000 <hi>Valachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> earnestly requested him, to help him for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Valachia:</hi> who, considering how much it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the quiet of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> to have so near a Province a Friend, gave him a great Regiment of approved Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: with whom, at his entrance into <hi>Valachia,</hi> the <hi>Moldavian</hi> meeting with a great power of his own and Turks, there was fought a most bloudy Battel, <hi>Radoll</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away the Victory: two Turks Bassaes being slain, with a great number of others: after which, <hi>Radoll</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Government.</p>

Who answered, <hi>He had never failed of his Duty therein, but that the</hi> Capi-Aga <hi>alwayes said, It was not needfull to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Soveraign therewith, having committed these matters to others,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And further,</hi> That the cause of all these Disorders proceeded from his Mother,
<pb n="1188" facs="tcp:130480-02:604"/>
the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> &amp; a few others, to whom he had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the managing of those affairs. The mutiniers now more moved, furiously said, <hi>They were assembled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Heads of such offendours: being resolved to take another course, if he should refuse to grant it them, meaning to make a new Emperor.</hi> Howbeit, <hi>Mahomet</hi> answered, <hi>It was no reason, neither would he for their humours put those whom they demanded, innocently to death; but willed them to be contented, till they might by order of justice be tryed: and then he would give them even his own Son, if he were found culpable.</hi> But they replyed, <hi>He had not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Brethren by justice, but for preservation of the State; and that those whom they demanded were so guilty that they deserved not an orderly tryall,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As for the Empress, his mother they were content she should be confined farther off, and no more to meddle with State-matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Mahomet</hi> (through the violent resolution of these most insolent men) caused the <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> and such others as they required, to be brought forth: Who presented themselves as already half-dead, whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> did what he might to have saved; but, the mutiniers clamour to have them dispatched, could not be appeased, till they saw their Heads struck off from their shoulders. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> inwardly grieved, commanded the Executioner to serve some other of the chief Bassaes (whom he knew to be much beloved of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and whom he could willingly have bin rid off) as he had the <hi>Capi-Aga</hi> &amp; the rest; but then their murmuring and mutiny was as it were re-doubled, so that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was for fear forced by giving way to appease them: The old Empress for all that was not then confined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself but a few dayes before had beheaded <hi>Capion,</hi> one of his great Bassaes, either for desire of his wealth, or for envy of his Honor &amp; Valour, yet the former seemed to many the more probable; for, immediately after his death, he seized upon all his Riches, except
<pb n="1189" facs="tcp:130480-02:604"/>
400000 Duckats, which <hi>Calil</hi> Bassa his Father detained for himself: which his purloyning, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, demanded of him one day, if it were true, that he had retained those Duckats: which Fact, <hi>Calil</hi> through fear and covetousness denied and forswore: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thinking by lying to have saved his life, he was for the truth put to death, having his Head forthwith struck off; the greedy Tyrant (for the Bassaes blood served but for a shew) seizing, rifling, and carrying away all his wealth, and changing the Dowry and succession of his Wife and Children, into Bonds, Prisons, and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> another Bassa, perceiving the like danger to hang over his own Head, resolved to flee to the Rebels in <hi>Asia:</hi> but this his purpose discovered by certain Spics, and he with a chief follower of <hi>Capin</hi> Bassa taken by the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> were both by them cut in pieces. In the mean time, the Rebels in <hi>Asia</hi> prosecuted their Rebellion with all diligence, every man joyning unto the first For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were in good estate and rich with the spoils that they had taken. They, resolutely besieging <hi>Angore,</hi> a great and strong Town, the Citizens affraid, offered them a great summ to redeem themselves and City; and, so at last upon the payment of 200000 Duckats, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently departed. Shortly after, <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s new Captains (whom he had put in place of them whom he executed for the appeafing of the Court-souldiers) arrived there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, who would needs make it Treason, and put the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to death for giving the Rebels the said mony (though 'twere done for preservation of their lives) and sack their City; Whereupon, arose a great and cruell fight betwixt these Souldiers and Citizens, both the Subjects of one Prince, and all of one Superstition; but the one side ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with pride and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

their course into <hi>Slavonia,</hi> carrying away a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of prisoners and booties: and, meeting by the way with 600 Christian Souldiers, they slew them every man: at length, some of their roaming Troops chanced to fall into the danger of the Count, who hovered aloof off, for fear of their multitude, a part whereof now falling into his Hands, were all cut in pieces, and a number of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives set at liberty thereby. Hereupon, the <hi>Tartars</hi> still in doubt to meet with the Christian Troops, who slew all of them they lighted on, kept closer together, and so did a great deal the less hurt, than when they roamed up and down at pleasure.</p>
               <p>The Garrison Souldiers of <hi>Canisia,</hi> consulting how to be revenged for the late Defeat at the same time; there was a Fugitive Christian in the Town, who seemed desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to turn <hi>Turk:</hi> of whom the <hi>Turks</hi> made much reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, for that he seemed to know much of the Christians designs, and the means how to cross them: who, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bring them into the midst of the Christians Camp, and deliver it into their hands; but, he seeing the <hi>Turks</hi> much busied with carrying of Victuals into the Castle, brought into the Town after the overthrow of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, knowing where the Ammunition lay, by a Train, laid fire thereunto; and, amidst the stir, by a loop in the Wall got away, and came to <hi>Collonitz,</hi> who lay near in Ambush, expecting the opportunity upon the success of so dangerous an adventure, whereto he was privy. All the place felt the fury of this dreadfull blast, all was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and turned upside down: yea, the fire burst out of the Castle and burnt most of the Town also: the terror here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, made many <hi>Turks</hi> to leap over the walls in hope so to save their lives: but meeting with the Souldiers of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louitz,</hi> they were all either taken or slain. But now, when occasion served for the re-gaining of <hi>Canisia,</hi> those <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Walloons,</hi> whom <hi>Collonitz</hi> had before appeased, who were most of his strength, for want of pay (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)

turned their backs, and were by no entreaty or perswasions to be moved, withdrawing from the rest of the Army to their discouragement: so that <hi>Collonitz,</hi> was to his great discontentment, forced to retire, without any thing more doing.</p>
               <p>Whilst this exploit was in hand, The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> made a cruell spoil about <hi>Rab,</hi> even almost to the gates thereof, carrying away a great number of men and beasts: at last, <hi>Nadasti</hi> his <hi>Hussars</hi> comming that way, by speed overtook them near <hi>Alba regalis</hi> slaying a great number, and forcing the rest to leave much of their prey behind them: with which recovered booty, they returning to <hi>Rab,</hi> the Inhabitants and Country people with tears standing in their eyes, requested to have their owne goods again; but yet they were fain to redeem them for present mony.</p>

               <p>The Rebels now fearing no harm, divided the spoil, filling the Heavens with the noise of Trumpets, in token of Victory: which disorder, the <hi>Valachians</hi> perceiving, turned head, and serring close together, couragiously thrust themselves into the midst of these Victors: which so dismayed and troubled them, that, surprized in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with their hands full of spoiles, they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves: some stood as men amazed, others ran away, others stood on their defence, but all were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like slain; so that, at last, most of them were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the rest put to flight, <hi>Moyses</hi> himself being slain.

Laying there three weeks, waiting for the rest of the forces, he the while disposed of all things needful, for keeping of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> putting into St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Fort, near unto it, 3000 Lansquenets for its relief: then he removed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Posth,</hi> encamping within a League thereof, hoping that the preservation thereof, if the Enemy should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiege it, might in time, be a cause to win <hi>Buda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Turks Army being 100000 men, few dayes after, came and encamped in sight of the Christian Army, on the other side of <hi>Danubius.</hi> In the mean time, certain Souldiers of <hi>Pesth,</hi> fled by stealth, to the TURKS in BUDA, craving of them Victuals: whom (though they were almost in as great want) they bountiously relieved: the Bassa of BUDA, (to corrupt their followers) entertaining these Fugitives, with double pay: who gave him a thousand thanks, greatly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

them plenty of Victuals, good entertainment, and four moneths pay more: none of them hearkened to their allurements, but rather offered of themselves to be sworn again to their allegiance to the Emperour, and to die in the place, rather then forsake it; yet was the want of Victuals then in <hi>Pesth</hi> great: but ere long, <hi>May</hi> 15th, a great Ship laden with Wine and Victualls, arrived there: whose passage, the Turks attending in the Isle, to have intercepted, they of <hi>Pesth</hi> sallying out, killed many of them, forcing the rest to quit the place; and shortly after, a number of other Ships, laden with provision and necessaries, arriving there, filled it with as great plenty, as there had been want: which being conducted thither, by 500 <hi>Harquebusiers</hi> of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> durst not, or could not stay it.</p>
               <p>At the same time, a Turkish Captain fleeing from <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> to <hi>Rab,</hi> shewed the Christians, how they might come to the Suburbs thereof, and spoil the same; yea, and happily surprize the Town, offering himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be the Guide: to whom, the Christians then giving credit, the two Garrisons of <hi>Rab</hi> and <hi>Strigonium,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Suburbs of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> slaying all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, rifling them, firing them, and so, laden with spoil, returned in safety.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> amidst all his delights, was in the midst of the insolencies of his tumultuous <hi>Janizaries</hi> at home, and abroad, in Warres against the rebellious in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Christians in <hi>Europe:</hi> wherefore he resolved (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) first to appease the troubles with his subjects in <hi>Asia,</hi> (though the punishing of Rebellion is more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Prince to maintain his State, than is Warre against a stranger, for conquering of a new Countrey.) Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the Sequel shewed, Falshood and treachery was the ground of the whole business on both sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> spared no kind of cunning, to deceive these crafty men, offering them, with his pardon, great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and honours, so they would lay down Arms, and no more take them up, but in his service; but they well knew, the promises of faithless Princes, cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but words; so that they not onely refused, to yield him their obedience as he desired, but even to have peace with him upon any conditions. Hereupon, he thought best, to offer the Christians that which the other had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, hoping that peace with the one, should be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the other; and to ease him of a care, how to give an honest and honourable way thereunto, the <hi>French</hi> Embassador Leger, was then entreating with the great Bassaes, for the deliverance of Count <hi>Isolan:</hi> whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> thought a fit man, to deal with the Emperour, concerning a Treaty of peace to be had: whereupon, he set him at liberty, with charge, that he should discreetly and faithfully deal with the Emperour about it: which if he should effect to <hi>Mahomets</hi> content, then to remain free, otherwise to return into his former captivity;
<pb n="1208" facs="tcp:130480-02:614"/>
for whom the French Embassador became a pledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Achmet Bassa,</hi> also wrote to <hi>Collonitz,</hi> for the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of this peace, telling him, if they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to surrender <hi>Strigonium,</hi> before they began to treat of any other matter, he need not trouble himself, to give any answer to those Letters: saying also, if they should continue to pay the Tribute for the time to come, and discharge the Arrerages for the time past, it should be commodious for the Turks, and honourable for the Imperials: besides he said, peace should be entreated of with the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> who was commanded by the Turkish Emperour, upon just and reasonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to entertain the same, and never more, but in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, to come into <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collonitz</hi> forthwith, sent these Letters to the Emperour, requesting him to consider what answer he would have given. The Emperour commanded him to embrace the occasion, and to try, whether the Turks desire were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their words or not: <hi>Collonitz</hi> hereupon, with some of the best Commanders in the Army, entred into a Treaty of peace with the Turks: whose demands tended so much to the hurt and dishonour of the Emperour, that they even at first, shut up the way to all further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for after their proud manner, they unreasonably demanded to have <hi>Transilvania, Strigonium,</hi> and <hi>Pesth,</hi> restored to them; for which, they offered to deliver <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gria</hi> and <hi>Canisia,</hi> pibble for Pearls; so that they departed on both sides, as they came: also, while this Treaty was in hand, the Turks gathered together, great store of Men and Ammunition at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to convoy much Victuals to put into <hi>Buda:</hi> whereof <hi>Collonitz</hi> hearing, ceased fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to treat, and betook himself to his Arms, to do what they might, for the hindering their purpose for <hi>Buda,</hi> where there was now such want, that the Turks having eaten all their Horses, and rifled the Governours House for Victuals, resolved to abandon the City, if not reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

within few dayes. The Christians embarqued their Footmen upon the River, under <hi>Alimeine,</hi> Governour of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> and <hi>Sultze,</hi> Governour of <hi>Pesth.</hi> Whilest <hi>Collonitz</hi> with the Horsemen, scoured along the Banks of the River, and <hi>Aug.</hi> 22, near to <hi>Mohatsch,</hi> fell upon the head of the Turk's Army, led by <hi>Murat Bassa,</hi> six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in number, two thousand being <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encamped upon an even plain, he forthwith charged them: where after many notable charges, the Turks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired toward the Body of their Army in great hast: whom <hi>Collonitz</hi> followed with like heat, as he had charged them; but ill followed by his friends, who sought after the spoil, instead of pursuing their Enemies; so that the Turks perceiving the fewness of the pursuers, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and even right hardly charged them: who were now glad themselves to retire; yet so, as without any great losse received: Howbeit, the Turks came on so fast and couragiously, that they had defeated the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, had not the <hi>Haiducks</hi> out of their Boats, resolutely come to their relief: whereupon, the Turks again reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whom the Christians furiously charged, and pursued even to their great Camp, and so returned with the glory of the Field, and spoil of their Enemies: <hi>Murat Bassa</hi>'s red Cornet being taken, with two Field-pieces, seven hundred Turks being slain, and 120 taken, <hi>Saxar Beg</hi> being one: who upon examination, confessed, that <hi>Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san</hi> the day before, came into the Camp, dining with the great <hi>Cham;</hi> after which, he discoursing with him, among other great matters, of his return into his Countrey, was much against the same, till they had victualled <hi>Buda:</hi> whereunto, he was (he said) in honour and duty, bound to give his assistance, the losse of this good place, being of so great importance to the great <hi>Sultan:</hi> otherwise his ayd had bin unto him, rather hurtful than profitable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He also assured them, that the Bassa purposed to new for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie three frontier Castles, and so to go to the Siege

of <hi>Pesth,</hi> which done, to besiege <hi>Strigonium:</hi> which yet he doubted to win this year, winter approaching, and a great part of his forces being far off, that the Tartars were far from the Camp, where the Bassa of <hi>Asia,</hi> leading the reconciled Rebels of <hi>Asia,</hi> and him of <hi>Caramania,</hi> 6000 <hi>Janizaries</hi> were in few dayes expected: which Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though not altogether true; yet time shewed, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried some shew of probability: few Christians, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the Turks, were slain. It was noted, that the Souldiers of Col. <hi>Sultze</hi> refused to pursue the Enemy, whether fearing some ambush, or disdaining to follow Gen. <hi>Collonitz;</hi> the reasons, perhaps, why <hi>Sultze</hi> stayed them from the pursuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collonitz</hi> most bravely behaved himself in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, sometime forcing the charge, and again staying his men in their retreat; so that oft lost among his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and again returning, he escaped death as it were by a miracle, and from being taken by chance; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, had the rest, after his example, prosecuted their good fortune, the Enemy had been quite overthrown, and themselves been both victorious and rich; for besides the spoils by them gotten, they might have carried away a whole years pay, due to the Garrison of <hi>Buda,</hi> which the fearful Turks had left in their Camp, (which upon the recovery of their courage, they recovered) with much more. <hi>Russworm,</hi> (the Christian Army being assembled, about Septemb. 4th) sent forth two most trusty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Souldiers, to understand of the Turks affaires and designes, who, in Turkish Habit, were in their Army 8 dayes unsuspected; and returning back, declared to the General, that the Turks Army was very great, but not such as that which last year besieged <hi>Pesth:</hi> that they lay encamped at large, which made them seem the greater, being well provided of Ordnance: that <hi>Hassan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as General, having brought with him 12000 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> besides his Horsemen, and reconciled Rebels

At length, falling together by the eares about the old Generall and the new: a number were slain, all of the richer sort spoiled, and the <hi>Sultans</hi> service neglected; but, the new Generall at last prevailing. <hi>Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san</hi> with his partakers were glad to flee: yet afterwards, collecting the dispersed Souldiers, and joyning with the Rebells, held still a good Army on foot, doing what harm he could. The <hi>Persian</hi> King also, taking advantage by all these troubles, besieged <hi>Tauris,</hi> kept with a most strong Garrison of <hi>Turks,</hi> using the battering Cannon therein, long scorned by the <hi>Persians,</hi> as not beseeming va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men; wherewith, as with skilfull Cannoniers, the <hi>Portugalls</hi> furnished him; whereby he soon again reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this great City from the <hi>Turks.

to be continually said, in all <hi>Mosquies</hi> throughout his Dominions, giving himself wholly also unto such Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, and works of Charity; sending withall, two of his chiefest Priests bare-headed and footed on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha</hi> (where their Prophet's chief Temple is, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they believe to be most speedily heard) to pray to him for their Prince his health and prosperity.</p>
               <p>At the same time, <hi>Amurat Rais,</hi> an old Pirate, and the <hi>Turks</hi> Admirall, for the West part of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> in his roaming, lighted on a great Flemish ship, which he forthwith beset with his Galleys: the calmnesse of the weather favouring him.

               <p>But, many a hot skirmish passed betwixt the 2 Armies in <hi>Hungary;</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> receiving the most hurt and loss. A Troop of Christians going to seek Booty, fell upon a like Troop of the <hi>Turks:</hi> where, after a sharp encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

on both sides: the <hi>Turks</hi> at length fled, leaving a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dead on the place; losing 2 Ensignes, with 130 ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Horses: the Christians pursuing them hard, drave a number more into <hi>Danubius,</hi> wherein they perished, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many more prisoners, above 80 being <hi>Italian</hi> Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, who as Enemies to God, were in a Court Martiall condemned and hanged, saving the Captain who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.

               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> being now encamped nigh <hi>Buda,</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians left <hi>Pesth</hi> as out of danger; and encamped betwixt the Fort in the Isle of <hi>Vicegrade</hi> and <hi>Vacia,</hi> staying there 4 dayes; and, then by a Bridge made upon <hi>Danubius,</hi> they passed the River, and came and encamped before the Fort of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> (kept by the <hi>Lansquenets)</hi> in the face of the Enemy. The field was plain and open, not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the joyning of a set battel: the encouraged Christians being come thither, to seek it in so fit a place, which the <hi>Turks</hi> sought as much to shun. Nevertheless, for very shame, they put forth 5000 men into the field, 5 dayes after: which Battalion came marching near the Christians upon confidence of 10000 Horse and Foot, which lay as close as possible a little out of the way; whom the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="1227" facs="tcp:130480-02:618"/>
not thinking of, sent forth 1200 against these 5000, to skirmish with them, till the whole Army were put in order, even for a generall Battell that day, whereunto, the whole Christian Army was fully enclined: with great chearfulnes marching on foot, thinking those 5000 <hi>Turks</hi> to have bin the head of the Avaunt-guard, sent to draw them out to skirmish, till the comming on of the rest of their Forces: Howbeit, their design was only to train them out into their Ambushes: whereof they gave suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Testimony, because, after 3 hours skirmish, with loss on both sides, the <hi>Turks</hi> Army appeared not, and the 5000 <hi>Turks</hi> by little and little retired: who, it was not like, would have given ground to 1200, if they had not had some secret meaning therein: which, caused the Christian Carabins not to be too earnest in their pursuit, and more closely to serve together, the better to endure the shock if they should charge them. The <hi>Turks</hi> seeing their purpose discovered, on a sudden made a stand, came on, and hardly charged the foremost Carabins: who, as men half surprized, were not able so valiantly to receive the charge of so great a number, but some few were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and slain, with some <hi>Hungarians</hi> among them, yet they valiantly repulsed them, slaying a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The prease in this conflict was great on both sides: but, new supplies still comming in, the <hi>Turks</hi> at last retited; 300 being left slain, and 100 Christians.</p>
               <p>Now upon the retreat, every man conceived a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall battell next day; the brags of the <hi>Turks</hi> occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christians so to think; for they seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refused battel offered them by the Christians (accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that an eternal Infamy) both for their confidence commonly had in their multitude, and for their opinion of mens inevitable predestination to life or death; being perswaded also, that no mens souls go more readily to Heaven, than of such as die in battell against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; yet at this time, shewed, that a strong apprehension
<pb n="1218" facs="tcp:130480-02:619"/>
of fear is able to prevail against all customs, perswasions, and accidents: for, the <hi>Turks</hi> came not forth according to promise; they having (besides almost all their <hi>Janizaries</hi> and valiant'st Souldiers) lost also all their <hi>Erasbles</hi> despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Souldiers, fighting on Hors-back onely; with a little piece of Tapestry on their Horses-backs: by whose readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they do long in one sort maintain their fight: carrying Darts made of fair Canes, &amp; strongly armed, with Sables or broad Curtelasses; the loss of these men, who stood the <hi>Turks</hi> in great stead, in receiving the Enemies charges, much discouraged them: Howbeit, they in some part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the like losses to the Christians; for, while the <hi>Turks</hi> lodged in the Isle of <hi>Vicegrade, Collonitz</hi> so annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with 8 great Field-pieces, that they were about to forsake the place: which, the more to force them to do, he embarqued himself with 600 <hi>Haiducks,</hi> landing by night near them with great silence, thinking to have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized them; but, by the dayes coming on, the <hi>Turks</hi> were aware thereof, issuing out of their Trenches, and with all their Force charging him, who made Head against them, though he had not men enow to withstand the least part of his Enemies: upon which his so great resolution, the <hi>Turks</hi> stood a great while in doubt to charge them: the Field-pieces which <hi>Collonitz</hi> had brought with him, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to good purpose; the fight endured 2 hours: at length, the Christians oppressed with number, rather than vanquished, left their pieces, disorderly retiring to their Boats: the <hi>Turks</hi> slaying 400 <hi>Haiducks</hi> in eager pursuit, the rest with much ado recovering their Boats, hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their Generall from the Enemies fury: yet, were the most forward and couragious <hi>Turks</hi> in that fight slain also, as was known by some prisoners afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>To prevent the like attempt, the <hi>Turks</hi> cast up great Trenches in the Isle along the Bank of the River, kept by some of their best Souldiers, till the dis-lodgement of the Camp to lay before <hi>Buda.</hi>

               <p>There were the like or worse Calamities in <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> extream want of all things, sore raging in both Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: so that, hardly hath any misery been seen or read of, which was not in those 2 Countries to be found, and of many felt: wherefore, <hi>Basta</hi> had by diligence lately (as was declared) brought <hi>Transilvania</hi> into some good terms as was thought; yet it proved far otherwise: for the Nobility, detesting the <hi>Germans</hi> and their Government, rejected the decrees of the late Assembly, for concluding of peace; so that, assisted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they had took some strong places in the Province, appointing a place to meet at, where the <hi>Turks</hi> and they might confer of the means to effect their designes: <hi>Basta,</hi> hearing secretly hereof, sent many <hi>Haidusks</hi> to lay in wait for them on the way: by which skilfull men in the passages of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Transilvanians</hi> were altogether sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and slain: after which, these and other Souldiers, destitute of pay, furiously fell upon the Province, as if they had bin mortall Enemies, seizing upon all mens goods in common, for that which some few kept from them, massacring all in their way: chiefly, the poor weak innocent people; who, called and cryed upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for remedy of these evils, and for revenge of so great and cruell wrongs. No man could travell, without danger to be spoiled by Theeves: for the <hi>Haiducks,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by prey and roaming up and down, spared neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor Christians: so that they, hearing the <hi>Zecclers</hi> were bringing many Waggons laden with Victuals, and

many Cattle to <hi>Claudianople,</hi> though they were of the same party, lay in wait for them: against whom they seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defend themselves, were cruelly massacred, and Waggons with the Beeves, and other cattel carryediaway. But hunger forceth men to all extremities.

               <p>Amidst these troubles, two Turkish Spies of <hi>Buda</hi> were taken, who had observed all the Christians proceedings: also all their designs, preparations, and levies for this years-Wars; one of whom was empailed, the other strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprisoned, till more matter might be drawn from him. The Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> hearing that the Christians would forthwith take the Field in <hi>Hungary;</hi> to hinder their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, and gain time, till the <hi>Turks</hi> great Army (then preparing) might be brought down into <hi>Hungary,</hi> wrote in most friendly manner to the Governour of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> for the Treaty and concluding of a peace with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: whereof, he with the rest of the <hi>Turks,</hi> seemed to be very desirous: telling him, <hi>If their Army, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Belgrade, <hi>did once arrive at</hi> Buda <hi>and march in field, they could not cause it to return without doing something, considering the great harms they had received from the Christians during the Truce, which they had many ways vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: which evil dealings,</hi> he said, <hi>had greatly incensed them against their Christian-captives, causing their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to snew great rigour against their slaves:</hi> wherefore. he attended his answer.

Howbeit, at length, the Bassa, after a great number on both sides slain, being fled, fled with his Army wholly disordered, with much ado to save himself; But he, more ashamed than discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, repaired his Army, joyning thereto great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty supplies, and so came to revenge his dishonour, and utterly to suppress the Rebels: who now too weak, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betime retired, praying ayd of the <hi>Persian</hi> King, who sent them his Son, with a great, good, and valiant Army.</p>
               <p>The two Armies were now in number equal, but the Rebels of the two, more resolute and carefull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: so that the battel was with great out-cries and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry begun on both sides: at first, The <hi>Turks</hi> seemed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to prevail, till the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings Son with some of his bravest Troops, charging them in the Rear, and some Rebels with like fury on their flanks, their whole Army was so disordered, that <hi>Cicala</hi> doing what he could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Battel, and nothing prevailing, was glad to flee, 30000 <hi>Turks</hi> being slain, and 1000 Rebels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> King after this discomfiture, took in the Country of <hi>Sirvan,</hi> whither <hi>Cicala</hi> (had he prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Rebels) should have marched, to have stayed the <hi>Persian</hi>'s Victories: who now won also <hi>Arusta,</hi> a very great and strong Town near to <hi>Tygris,</hi> where it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with all the adjoyning places and Countries; and hath since recovered from the <hi>Turks,</hi> whatever they in <hi>Solyman</hi>'s time took from his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, except 2 or 3 places.</p>

               <p>The 150000 Crowns, was by a decree of the Pope and Cardinall levied, and payed, of the Tenths of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> So <hi>Maximilian</hi> magnificently entertained, &amp; by the Pope rewarded with 4000 Crowns, returned unto the Emperour; whom the <hi>Turks</hi> were not behind in augmenting their Forces, to invade him: and now the <hi>Tartars,</hi> comming in great number, and, denied passage by the <hi>Polonians,</hi> entered into <hi>Valashia,</hi> which they all over rifled and spoiled at pleasure: such people as could escape, fleeing into Towns, leaving their goods to their merciless rage: <hi>Radol</hi> the Vayuod, fled to <hi>Constat</hi> to <hi>Basta,</hi> where considering his present danger, and still to expect the like, as often as the <hi>Tartars</hi> were thus to come into <hi>Hungary,</hi> he took a new Oath of Allegiance to the Emperour, to die and live in his service; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had proudly rejected the acknowledgement of his duty, and remedy of his harms: upon which submission, <hi>Basta</hi> took him and his Country into his protection.</p>

               <p>In the mean time, the Christians gave some ear to the <hi>Turks</hi> old practice of soliciting a peace, to discover in policy the Commodities and Inconveniencies of the peace by them but in shew offered, though with many protestations: for, in the very time of the parly, they fortified their strong Holds with men and Victualls: especially <hi>Buda,</hi> whereinto, by a Convoy, they put in of all sorts of provision enough for a whole year.</p>

                  <hi>Matthias</hi> returning to <hi>Vienna,</hi> assembled the States of <hi>Enseric,</hi> declaring all that was done at <hi>Presburg,</hi> advising them so carefully, to provide for the Common-weale, as that having money alwayes in readiness, they might go to meet with the Haiducks, if they would not conform to the Articles, but raise new broils.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Spring, Jerome</hi> Prince of <hi>Valachia,</hi> being dead, and leaving a Son, but 13 years old, the Emperour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him under Tutors unto the succession: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Valachians</hi> trusting to the Turks help, went to choose another Prince; but the Widow, certifying <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loscie</hi> her Son in Law hereof, obtaining much money of him, and raising 10000 good Souldiers, overcame the <hi>Valachians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and so preserved that Principality for her Sonne.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> having hitherto done the <hi>Turks</hi>

great harm, in the Mediterranean Sea, the <hi>Sultan</hi> sent, and promised him great matters, hereafter to desist; but the Duke increasing his Fleet, did more harm than before.</p>
               <p>Now though <hi>Illishaschius</hi> and <hi>Turson,</hi> had delivered to the Haiducks, the Articles, and commanded them to be quiet, yet they living by their Swords, could not endure to fall to labour: wherefore, they about <hi>Gimerit,</hi> wrote to them about <hi>Newsoli,</hi> that since they being divers times certified of the misery of their Neighbours, had refused to ayd them; yet they should now remember, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it was mutually to help each other; for the Haiducks passing over <hi>Teise,</hi> were run into that Province, as far as <hi>Budnoc,</hi> minding to spoil all the Countrey, if not speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encountred; and the rather, because they lately had 30000 Hungarian Duckats from the Turks, whom they owned their Lords, with Horses, and other gifts for their leaders, and daily expected ayd from the numerous Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars about <hi>Belgrade:</hi> so, since the harm, the Haiducks did, was inexpressible, they should inform their Neighbours, and, with all speed, take up Arms against them.</p>
               <p>About the end of <hi>March, Matthias</hi> the arch-Duke, proclaimed throughout <hi>Austria,</hi> every man to provide, to take up Arms; joyning this Reason, that he intended himself, to go in April, into <hi>Moravia,</hi> and there to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble both <hi>Hungarians, Austrians,</hi> and <hi>Haiducks,</hi> for a Warre: writing also, to the Vassals of <hi>Austria,</hi> that whereas they knew the States of <hi>ENSERIC,</hi> had approved of their Deputies report of what was decreed at <hi>PRESBuRG;</hi> yet some did not onely not rest upon that pacification, but gathered an Army in the Borders of <hi>Moravia,</hi> purposing to inroad both into <hi>Moravia,</hi> and <hi>Austria;</hi> wherefore the States of <hi>Moravia,</hi> also were forced to raise an Army, and crave help of their Neighbours; and therefore the arch-Duke, mindful of his promise, resolved in person, to undertake this expedition,
<pb n="1310" facs="tcp:130480-02:667"/>
that the States also should with their Servants, joyn unto him; that God, in whose name it was to be taken in hand, might soon grant unto those Countries, wished peace: wherefore, they were to be warned, with what Horse and Foot, they could raise at a day, to be shortly named, to joyn to the arch-Duke, and not suffer any thing to let them. So that if any thing should happen to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yet to send their Forces under some other, seeing he adventured his own life and fortunes; and if God saw good, accounted it great gain to lose them, thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit his Countrey.

so raised an Army, beginning by all meanes, to provide for their affaires; but the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> informed them, that they would intercede for them to the King, yet not to be wanting to them at their need.</p>
               <p>Letters the mean time, came to <hi>Vienna,</hi> from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> declaring <hi>Matthias</hi>'s Embassadors, to have on his behalf, promised faithfully to keep the peace, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> to have received the presents before the chief Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saes; but he would in no wise grant them the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> giving it to <hi>Gabriel Bathor,</hi> and commanding the Bassa of <hi>Buda,</hi> to establish him in that principality.

                  <hi>Presburg,</hi> being natural <hi>Hungarians.</hi> 9. Money not to be carried out of the Kingdom, as hitherto. 10. The <hi>Palatine</hi> dying, the King to chuse another within a year, the chief Justice the while, (as of old) supplying the place. The Protestant States of <hi>Austria,</hi> had sent to those of <hi>Hungary,</hi> then at <hi>Presburg,</hi> requesting, that since they could not obtain the free exercise of Religion, as well within, as without their Cities, they would afford them the ayd due by the pacification at <hi>Vienna:</hi> who sent <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and others, with interceding Letters to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who answered, King <hi>Matthias</hi> never thought to attempt against the priviledges of <hi>Austria,</hi> granted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian;</hi> but he could by no means, grant to the Cities, the liberty of Religion, both for Conscience, and for danger, that might ensue from the Pope, and King of <hi>Spain;</hi> yet he would promise to suffer it, without the Cities, and in bestowing publique Offices, to regard no Religion; yet so, that they laid down Arms, submitted to the King, confessed their fault, craving pardon, whereby perhaps they should prevail most.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Embassadors, going with this answer to the <hi>Austrians,</hi> by divers Reasons, earnestly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to submit, and, by request, to solicite their cause with the King: whereof were, That the League betwixt the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Austrians,</hi> concerned as well the Catholiques, as Protestants: that the <hi>Hungarian</hi> power, could not be brought into <hi>Austria,</hi> but to its utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>King <hi>MATTHIAS,</hi> now stayed at <hi>Presburg,</hi> till the new Building in the Castle was ended, where the Crown was to be kept, that he might see it, with the other Ornaments put thereinto, and sealed up with his own Seal, and the while, laboured to appease divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and to place fit men in great Offices; for the <hi>Hungarians</hi> would not suffer the <hi>Germanes</hi> therein: wherefore many were displaced, and <hi>Sigifrid Collonitz</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, a most well-deserving man: yet soon after, by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>'s Counsel, he was by the <hi>Hungarians</hi> (repenting thereof) both restored to his former Offices, and had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven greater preferments offered him also; but <hi>Illishas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> now <hi>Palatine,</hi> Novemb. 28, largely and earnestly entreated with the King, in behalf of the Protestants of <hi>Austria,</hi> chiefly, because those of <hi>Hungary,</hi> seemed in their behalf, much moved, and the <hi>Moravian</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, openly protested, their States could not forsake them, if their need required.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and other Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, earnestly interceded also for them; yet the <hi>Popes</hi> Nuntio so withstood them, that the King then granted nothing: who returning to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Protestant States of <hi>Austria,</hi> sent six <hi>EMBASSADORS</hi> to the KING, to know whereto to trust, who answered them, <hi>December</hi> the 27, they should be content with the former answer, and submit to the Kings pleasure, or do what they saw good: whereupon, they levied new Forces, perswading their Souldiers, that minding

               <p>Now a great Army of the Protestants lay about <hi>Crembsa</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> So that the King sent to those two Towns 1500 Horse, and some Ordnance under <hi>Bucheme,</hi> to strengthen them: publishing an Edict, <hi>Jan.</hi> 10th, 1609, charging the States to come to <hi>Vienna,</hi> on the 21 day, to take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>There was a War in <hi>Barbary,</hi> betwixt <hi>Muley Nequy</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> his younger Brother: this forcing the Elder to flee, and craved ayd of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain:</hi> who treated with the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> promising him Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, with 100000 Duckats, to return to <hi>Alarache,</hi> or <hi>Arache,</hi> a strong Town in the Realm of <hi>Fez,</hi> seated on the Ocean, at the mouth of the River <hi>Lucus,</hi> that held for him, to draw unto him as many Souldiers as he could, and for the safety of those Succours, to put <hi>Arache</hi> into <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s hands: in which the Kings of <hi>Fez,</hi> do usually keep 300 Light-horse. and 300 <hi>Harquebusiers</hi> in Garrison, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Castilians,</hi> hold almost all the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Towns of the Provinces of <hi>Habat</hi> and <hi>Eriff, Arache</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that of <hi>Algar.

               <p>This advice approved of, he chose him Visier &amp; Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who receiving the Seal, forthwith put many of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> friends to death, paying all the Souldiers with their money, some having been without pay five years: he sent also to the Sultan, 70 mules, laden with <hi>Serders</hi> Treasure, and 60 with Goods, all which, he gave to his Wife and Children.</p>

Soon after, there was another great fire, where <hi>Nassuf</hi> hanged many <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi> finding them too busie in rifling: going up and down with his Scimitar in one hand, and a <hi>Janizaries</hi> head he had cut off, in the other.

               <p>Let us pass into <hi>Africk.</hi> The Family of the <hi>Xeriffs</hi> of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morrocco,</hi> began some 104 years since, from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet Xerif,</hi> born at <hi>Tigumedet</hi> in <hi>Dara,</hi> a Province of <hi>Morrocco:</hi> he was <hi>Alfaqui,</hi> or Preacher of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Law; who, seeing the divisions betwixt those Soveraign Princes: and that the <hi>Portugals,</hi> had seized on the chief Forts of <hi>Morrocco,</hi> began with 3 of his Sons, <hi>Abdalla, Hamet,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to lay the Foundation of a new Monarchy, by a cóvnterfeit Piety, on a godly pretence of warring against the <hi>Portugals:</hi> and upon a desire to retire the <hi>Moors,</hi> who were in their pay, the more easily to chase them out of <hi>Morroeco.</hi> The King of <hi>Fez</hi> (seeing but the out-side of his Designes) let his son's display their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard against the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Morrocco:</hi> who, being at first followed by a great number, vanquished in many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, the bruit whereof retired the <hi>Moors</hi> from their service; whom with <hi>Barriga</hi> their Leader they soon after defeated; yet <hi>Abdalla</hi> lost his life in this Combat: but seized upon <hi>Tarradent</hi> in <hi>Sus;</hi> and in a manner, the whole Country betwixt <hi>Morrocco</hi> and Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> setling their Principality in <hi>Tarradent,</hi> their Father being called Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Province of <hi>Sus.</hi>

               <p>The King of <hi>Morrocco,</hi> fearing their present greatness, yet assured of some fit occasion to bring them under, let them enter into <hi>Morrocco,</hi> but they poisoned him, seizing upon his Realm. The King of <hi>Fez,</hi> seeing afar off this Tempest, the fear of the like calamity much afflicted him; but the <hi>Xeriffs,</hi> with the fourth part of the rich spoiles,

lull his distrust asleep, sending him also the Tribute due for <hi>Morrocco: Hamet</hi> is called King of <hi>Morrocco, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> King of <hi>Sus;</hi> and by a good mutual Intelligence, became fearfull to all those Countries, and then plainly denied the King of <hi>Fez</hi> the Tribute of <hi>Morrocco:</hi> saying, <hi>They were issued from</hi> Mahomet's <hi>line.</hi> The King of <hi>Fez,</hi> seeing the <hi>Xeriffs</hi> had abused the liberty he gave them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the City <hi>Morrocco</hi> with 18000 men, but he was chased away, and his Army defeated at the passage of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Then these two Brethren through peace and idlenesse, quarrelled and fought: where <hi>Mahomet,</hi> after 2 bloudy Battels took <hi>Hamet,</hi> depriving him of his Realm, &amp; made him die in prison. Then he turned the Arms, wherewith he had vanquished his elder Brother, against the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> vanquishing and taking him, and depriving him both of Realm and Life. Thus the <hi>Xeriffs</hi> became Soveraigns of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morrocco.</hi> These Victories made <hi>Mahomet</hi> fearfull, but his posterity was miserable; for <hi>Cidan</hi> was expelled by his Brother <hi>Kequi,</hi> but afterwards, <hi>Kequi</hi> was defeated by <hi>Cidan,</hi> and forced to save his life in 1610, in <hi>Algarbe</hi> in <hi>Portugall: Abdalla, Kequi</hi>'s son, hereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires towards the Mountains in <hi>Sus,</hi> making daily incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his Uncles Territories, with 4000 <hi>Arabians</hi> Horse and Foot that joyned with him; but, finding this too long a course for Conquest, he made use of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, forged in his ambition, and to work an Impression in the peoples minds: he sent some religious <hi>Mahometans</hi> to preach from place to place, that one <hi>Flaquere</hi> of a holy life, gave a son of his a Drumm of admirable Virtue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to keep it carefully, till a Prince called <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla</hi> (expelled by the injustice of his own bloud) should come into <hi>Morrocco,</hi> and then he should beat it, and the people might safely go to war at the sound thereof that it should give peace to the Realm, and settle all its Customs and ancient Laws: <hi>Which Prophesie,</hi> they said, <hi>was now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Algier,</hi> a wondrous drought had so devoured the Fruits of the earth, as there was an exceeding Famine throughout the Land: the <hi>Turks</hi> ascribing the cause, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to their sins; then to the <hi>Moors,</hi> who came out of <hi>Spain;</hi> and sometimes to the licentiousness of Christians in those places: Wherefore, the Judge ordered all <hi>Turks</hi> to pray devoutly to their Prophet for Rain; the <hi>Moors</hi> to depart within 3 dayes on pain of death, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to shave their Heads and Beards, which was speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. But the <hi>Moors,</hi> who through sickness or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, could not depart <hi>Algier</hi> at that time, were cut in pieces.

Yet <hi>Alexander,</hi> was not much amazed, because the General of Artillery, had
<pb n="1379" facs="tcp:130480-02:701"/>
assured him, he would annoy his men as little as he could, desiring to serve him, and so be revenged of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano,</hi> who had beheaded his Brother in Law, upon a false suspect. <hi>Stephano,</hi> to discover the Princes Army, sent 1200 <hi>Tartars,</hi> and 2 or 300 <hi>Moldavians,</hi> who being seen a far off in that plain, <hi>Alexander</hi> sent 500 <hi>Cossacks,</hi> and 400 <hi>Polonian</hi> Lances, to encounter them, who at first, seemed to retire, to draw them by degrees from their Camp; and being about a League off, stood, thinking they durst not charge them; but they fell so upon them, that they slew most of them, not above 5 or 600 esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to their Camp, causing great amazement.</p>
               <p>The Princes Army was much encouraged hereby, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing daily, as is usual in civil Warre. Presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Prince meaning to advance toward the Enemy, his fore-ward was stayed, by 1000 Horse, who had seized on a narrow passage, betwixt a <hi>Poole</hi> and a <hi>Marish;</hi> but certain <hi>Moldavians</hi> advising to send some Horse, by an unknown way, to surprise them behind, the <hi>Cossacks</hi> spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily went, <hi>Moldavians</hi> guiding them: who coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered, within 50 paces, charged them; and being seconded by the fore-ward, of the 1000 Horse, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned not above 50 to their Camp. <hi>Alexander,</hi> now coming with his Army, within Cannon-shot, <hi>Visnovis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,</hi> thought they must make an inclosure with Carts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no retreating place within 10 Leagues: which <hi>Stephano</hi> discovering, shot through that Fort, some being flain, and some hurt: the Prince answered him, but to small purpose, night surprizing them, and having but 8 small Pieces. <hi>Visnoviskie,</hi> spent the night, in encouraging his Souldiers from their former encounters against their Enemies, (who though more in number, yet were most Peasants) which successes, were assurances, that God would use them, to punish the tyrannies of <hi>Stephano;</hi> and then every one should return loaden with rich spoils and recompences from <hi>Alexander.</hi>

                  <pb n="1380" facs="tcp:130480-02:702"/>Hereat, the Souldiers all protested, rather to die, than fail of their duties: the Princess also, comforted the Colonel and Captain, with the intelligence from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Artillery. Next day, while they put their Armies in Battel, <hi>Alexanders</hi> men had the odds in divers skirmishes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Visnoviskie</hi> was <hi>Alexanders</hi> Generall, as most capable: who, seeing <hi>Stephanoes</hi> Horse in three Squadrons, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> most advanced, ordered the <hi>Cossacks</hi> to encounter them: discreetly done; for they both charge freely, are covered with but skins of Beasts, to seem as fearful as they can, observe no order, using cries, fearful to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed; and being broken, seldom return to charge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polish</hi> Lanciers, called <hi>Housarskie,</hi> being 1500 well armed, and led by <hi>Coreskie,</hi> were set on the right hand, against 3000 Horse: the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Foot (about 3000) were in midst of the Army with the Cannon, upon a little Hill: on the left, were the other Chivalry, led by <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Visnoviskie:</hi> the Baggage being a little behind in the Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephano</hi> disposing his Army, began about nine in the morning, to play with his Cannon; but the Bullers flew over <hi>Alexanders</hi> men: who thereupon, bad the <hi>Cossacks</hi> charge the Tartars, whom they defeated: at which time, 2000 Horse, charging the Foot that guarded <hi>Stephano</hi>'s Cannon, slew most, taking the rest, and so possest his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: who seeing his Infantry also indangered, caused 3000 Horse to advance; but <hi>Coreskie</hi> charged them so furiously, that he slew almost half, and routed the rest. Presently after, another Squadron followed: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Coreskie</hi> seeing his men wearied, and tired, retired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Camp. Then came <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Visnoviskie,</hi> to encounter these, and that with the more courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, sure that <hi>Stephano</hi> was there: during this quarter of an houres charge, <hi>Coreskie</hi> breathed, collecting what
<pb n="1381" facs="tcp:130480-02:702"/>
men he could, to succour those in fight, who were almost tired, and <hi>Alexander</hi> far ingaged: who now recovering their Forces, their amazed Enemies that were alive, were put to flight. But <hi>Stephano</hi> (a coward) had retired to the rest of his Foot, who had not yet fought, seeming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die there, than flee; yet seeing the issue of this last charge, he soon fled, having not struck a stroak. The Foot that remained (about 4000) yielded to mercy, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, <hi>God save Alexander, Vayuod of Moldavia.</hi> That day, <hi>Prince Alexander</hi> entred into <hi>Yas,</hi> and in the Castle, was proclaimed by all the <hi>Boyers,</hi> Vayuod, which before, he would never accept of. Next day, hearing that many of the chief of <hi>Yas,</hi> were fled into Mountains and Forrests, to attend the event, he sent <hi>Boyers</hi> to invite them home, with all assurance, causing part of his Army to be quartered in the Countrey; and 500 Horse, and 1500 Foot, under <hi>Coreskie,</hi> were sent to <hi>Vasseloy,</hi> for that <hi>Stephano</hi> had fled that way, and might return.

               <p>He was bound in a Chair made of Copper-wire, and a Fire made round him; so that for twelve hours, he fearfully cryed out for his insupportable paines.

               <p>ALthough the Custom of the Turkish Emperors, was to have neither Brother or Nephew alive, unless sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves by flight: yet the Court Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it was not fit <hi>Mustapha, Achmats</hi> younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should die; for that, their Emperour being but 15 years old, they feared, that dying in his nonage, without children able to Govern, the Empire might fall into combustion and ruin through civil Wars, so <hi>Mustapha</hi>'s life was preserved: yet so, as to remain still a prisoner in some of the Chambers of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> and before <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi> had children, no cruel Decree was made against him, but he continued his contemplation without any liberty; but when <hi>Achmat</hi> had issue, he oft propounded the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Mustapha</hi> to death, which was often concluded: It's written, his death was one evening agreed on, and to be executed next day; but <hi>Achmat</hi> was so frighted in the night with Apparitions and fearfull dreams: that he said, <hi>Since that resolution alone had so terrified him, he believed his torments would much encrease, if put in execution: Wherefore, he commanded his Brother should live.</hi>

But <hi>Achmat</hi> falling grievously sick, his <hi>Bassaes</hi> and Counsellors perswaded him to take some good course for the succession. His young children were not capable to govern, and besides the <hi>Sultana</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dead: but <hi>Sultana Flatra Mustapha</hi>'s Mother was yet living, who lest her Honour should be Ecclipsed, by Government of the <hi>Bassaes</hi> during the Childrens mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, perswaded dying <hi>Achmat,</hi> to make <hi>Mustapha</hi> his Successour; So on his dying day, he calling sor <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> entreated him to take the Government upon him presently after his death: who amazed, answered in much fear and humility, He might not accept of that Honour, since the Empire of right belonged to his eldest Son.</p>
               <p>

people: and that upon this occasion. Prince <hi>Coreskie</hi> being brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the G.

               <p>The Emperour's Embassadour did what possibly he could, but the <hi>Turk</hi> would by no means release him, so as his Friends despaired of his liberty.

Few dayes after, the <hi>Turk</hi> seized on the <hi>French</hi> Embassadours servants, torturing 2 of them, by laying them (as they are wont) on a Table, on their bellies, and giving them 3 or 400 blows with a staff on the soles of their feet, calves of their leggs, and buttocks, yet said they nothing to charge their Master; they did also the same to a poor <hi>Turk</hi> (a Weaver) dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nigh the Embassador, that he might falsely depose, he had seen <hi>Martin</hi> going and comming to his Masters Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, till the time of the prisoners escape: but God suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to depose nought but truth, notwithstanding all those cruel Torments: though the <hi>Turks</hi> do generally much rejoyce at the dysasters of Christians.

with 26 Ordnance, and 5 Morter-pieces, but also by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Munitions, and spoiling their Wells; 800 men, and 300 Women, Turks and Grecians, coming out of it: And through the fear and confusion that was among the Turks in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they doubted not but soon to take the Isle of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> besides divers other places like to fall into their hands.

               <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> after <hi>Tenedos,</hi> soon took <hi>Stalimene,</hi> or <hi>Lemnos</hi> Island from the Turks, and having furnished the Fortress there, with all necessaries for defence, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor General, set sail with the Fleet towards <hi>Scio</hi> and <hi>Zia,</hi> to refresh his men: about which time, the Turk cast away all thoughts of peace with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having wholly broken the Treaty that had been begun at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> by their Secretary <hi>Bellarini.</hi>

               <p>About <hi>August</hi> following, the <hi>Venetians</hi> obtained a signal Victory against the Turkish Fleet, at the mouth of the Dardanelles, in the sight of the great Turk himself.

               <p>In <hi>October</hi> in the same year, the Turks regained the Isle of <hi>Tenedos</hi> though not without ruine to themselves: The Venetian Fleet being gone from that Island, to take in fresh water: the Turks Fleet landed there a great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men, who setting upon the Fort of <hi>Tenedos</hi> by storm, were at first repulsed; but preparing for a new Onser, the Venetian Garrison working a Mine under the Fort, disposed their Powder therein, with a Match fitted to it; and quitting the place, the Turks taking possession, were blown (Fort and all) up into the Ayr. The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Fleet returning, and perceiving what had hapned, the Turks Fleet being at hand, prepared for an encounter, which being resolutely performed on both sides, (for the Grand Seignior, having come purposely to see that Island regained, being of so great importance to the commerce of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> encouraged the Turks): but in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Venetians got a notable Victory, sinking sixteen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To this end, they sent a dispatch to complement the chief Visier, and let him know, That they had not taken Arms, against their Prince, but against certain persons that had abused his Trust and Favour; Yet, rather then tumults should be longer continued, they humbly cast themselves upon the clemency of their Lord, the Grand Seignior.

                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 2, the Pirates of <hi>Algiers</hi> took severall Ships from the Christians, and at one time, 7 together; two of them were <hi>Holland</hi> ships, Laden with fine Linnen, and other commodities, valued at 100000 crowns.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Ragotzi</hi> desired the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperour to take his Forts into his protection, lest the <hi>Turk</hi> should take them into his own power, and so infest <hi>Hungary</hi> with his forces. Hereupon, the Emperors forces in <hi>Hungary,</hi> went to take possession of them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Venice, Aug.</hi> 15. A tempest rose on a sudden, which overturned divers houses, dispersed and tore abundance of boats: and the Arms of the Seignory, which were in Marble, upon the frontispiece of the <hi>Arsenal,</hi> were blown down. And on the 24 of <hi>Aug.</hi> another great tempest, brake down great part of St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief done by it, being valued at above 100000 crowns.</p>
               <p>The Emperour determining to take <hi>Ragotzi</hi> into his protection, ordered forces to be on the Frontires of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> under the command of Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold;</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga</hi> marched thither with 2500 fresh men, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> should meditate a passage into <hi>Hungary,</hi> they might make it a matter of difficulty, for they threatned to make their way through <hi>Hungary,</hi> to fall upon <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior departed from <hi>constantinople, Sept.</hi> 7. in regard the pestilence increased daily, and he intended to take this occasion, finally to extirpate the Rebels: to which end, he ordered most of the <hi>Divan</hi> to accompany him, with the Janizaries and Spahies, and all that he could collect, leaving the care of his affairs to the <hi>Muphti</hi> and his mother the Sultana.</p>
