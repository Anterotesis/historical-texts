            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Opinion is This: That <hi>RESISTANCE</hi> may be Vsed, in case our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> should be <hi>INVADED.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Arguments against it, are these: First, <hi>That the Christian Religion doth plainly forbid the Resistance of Authority.</hi> [<hi>Quaere,</hi> Who has <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Invade</hi> the Established Religion and Rights of the Nation? Is any one Impowered by the Laws to invade the Laws?]</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That though our Religion be Established by Law, which makes a difference between our Case and that of the Primitive Christians, yet in the same Law which Establishes our Religion, it is declared, That it is not lawful, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King or any Commissioned by him.</hi> [Neither doth this reach the Question, For the King can do no Wrong, nor in the second place, can he Commissionate any person to Invade the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished Religion and Rights of the Kingdom; for a Commission of that kind is not a Commission in Law, it is null, and void, and nothing.] <hi>Besides that, there is a particular Law, declaring the Power of the Militia to be solely in the King.</hi> [To do what? <hi>To Invade the Established Religion and Rights of the Kingdom?</hi> If you read the whole Act you will find the direct contrary.] <hi>And that tyes the hands of Subjects, though the Law of Nature, and the general Rules of Scripture had left us at liberty; which I believe they do not, because the Government and Peace of Humane Society could not well subsist upon these Terms.</hi> [As if the Established Religion and Rights of a Nation, which are the very Ends of Government and of Humane Society, were Best Secured by being laid open to Invasion, and exposed for a Prey.]</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Opinion is contrary to the declared Doctrine of all Protestant Churches; and though some particular persons have taught otherwise, yet they have been contradicted herein, and condemned for it by the generality of Protestants.</hi> Whereas the following Testimonies will prove it to be no singular Opinion, but held by the most Eminent Protestants both at home and abroad: And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99338:2"/>
they give such Reasons for their Opinion, as may at least excuse those persons who are of the same Perswasion, till such time as those Arguments are answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as the Opinion condemned.</p>
            <p>To begin with <hi>Luther,</hi> with whom the Papists say Untruly our Religion began, but who was indeed a person, whom it pleased God to make the Great Restorer of Religion to this last Age of the World. <hi>Sleidan</hi> not only tells us, that he was of this opinion, but likewise how he came to be of it, when he had formerly held the contrary. The words are these: <hi>Sleid. Com.

            <p>Before the Princes and Cities entered into an Association, they took the Advice not only of Lawyers, but of Divines also. Now <hi>Luther</hi> had always taught, That the Magistrate might not be Resisted, and there was a little Book of his extant upon that subject. But when the Lawyers in this Consultation shewed, that Resistance was allowed by the Laws in some cases, and made it appear that the present Case was one of those whereof the Laws made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luther</hi> ingeniously professed, that he did not know the lawfulness of it before, and now said, that being <hi>The Gospel doth not Bar nor Abolish the Laws of the State,</hi> as he had always taught; and furthermore, because in this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and dangerous Time many things might so happen, that not only matter of Right, but also the force and necessity of Conscience might occasion us to Arm; therefore an Association might be entered into, to defend our selves, in case <hi>Caesar</hi> himself should make War upon us, or any one else in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s name. He put forth a Book likewise, wherein he first shewed how obstinate the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were in the Diet at <hi>Auspurgh,</hi> and then warned all men in general that they should not obey the Magistrate, if he raised the Militia for such a War. He reckoned up very many and very gross Errors of Popery, to shew those who sided with the Emperour, what things they would fight for, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how great a wickedness it was: He shewed how much more Light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99338:2"/>
than formerly men now had by the knowledge of the Gospel, and that they ought not to engage in so wicked a War.</p>
            <p>There were seven Princes, and twenty four Protestant Cities, which entered into this Association, some of whose Arguments and Reasons for it, we have upon Record, in the following Books of the same Historian. The <hi>Saxon</hi> and the <hi>Lan<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>grave</hi> in their Declaration, 2 <hi>September,</hi> which was in answer to the Emperours, from his Camp at <hi>Ingolstadt,</hi> have these words: <hi>Sleid. Com.

                  </gap>at, abunde nobis constat: ut nos illi, sic ipse vicissim nobis obligatus est: quod autem indictae causâ nos Proscribit &amp; omnibus possessionibus dejicere conatur, in eo juris vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum dissolvit, quo clienti seu beneficiario devinctus est invicem patronus. Iam quod rebellionem nobis objicit, nihil est, &amp; scit ipse, nobis injuriam fieri.</hi> We know very well what Duty the Princes owe to the Emperour, and what on the other side he himself ought to perform: We are mutually bound to one another. Now because he proscribes us without any Process of Law, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to throw us out of all our Possessions, in so doing he breaks that bond of the Law, whereby a Lord and his Client or Beneficiary are bound to each other. As for his charging us with Rebellion, there is nothing at all in it, and he knows in his Conscience that we are wronged. And presently after, <hi>Quod si pactis stetisset atque decretis, nos etiam nostrum officium eramus facturi: sed quoniam ea violavit, &amp; verò praecipua debetur Deo obedientia, sibi culpam ipse tribuat. Etenim quia Religioni molitur exitium atque libertati, causam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, cur ipsum oppugnemus bon<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Nam injusta vis minime Deum habet Authorem; nec alia ratione sumus ei devin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti, quam si Conditiones, quibus est creatus Caesar, impleat.</hi> Now if he had stood to his former Compacts and Decrees, we also should have done our Duty; but because he has broken them, and besides, our Obedience is due to God in the first place, let him lay the blame upon himself. For being he endeavours the destruction of our Religion and Liberty, he gives us cause to oppose him with a <hi>Good Conscience.</hi> For in that case it is lawful to resist, as may be made appear both from sacred and prophane History. For unjust Violence is by no means <hi>the Ordinance of God</hi>; neither are we any otherwise bound to him, than upon performance of the Conditions, upon which he was made Emperour.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> likewise in their Writing, 24 <hi>March,</hi> and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters in <hi>April,</hi> to the same purpose, <hi>Sleid. Com.

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99338:3"/>So much for <hi>Luther</hi> himself and the League or Association, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> the Churches of that Denomination. And <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> often inculcates all over his Writings the same Maxime of <hi>Luther,</hi> which indeed was St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s before them both: <hi>That the Gospel doth not Bar the Laws of the State; That it does not erect a new Government,</hi> but leaves the Government as it found it. And therefore where the Laws and Constitution of a Government allow of a Defence, the Gospel does so too. And in his Commentary on the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> upon those words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov, 24. 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> si talis Defensio non esset concessa, transformaretur Evangelium in doctrinam Politicam, &amp; stabiliret Infinitam Tyrannidem.</hi> The Gospel allows us to make use of Politick Laws which are reasonable. Nay, if a lawful Defence were not allowed by the Gospel, the Gospel it self would be transformed into a <hi>State-Doctrine,</hi> and would establish infinite Tyranny. Or, as he says in another place, it would command infinite Slavery, which it does not. <hi>Non constituit Evangelium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas politias, quare nec infinitam Servitutem praecipit.</hi> 2 Artic. Symbol. Nicen. Sub Quaest. <hi>Hic autem quaeritur, utrùm Armis reprimendi sunt Tyranni, praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes ut faciamus contra mandata Dei?</hi> In his common places under the Title <hi>Vindicta,</hi> upon those words of our Saviour, <hi>He that takes the Sword, shall perish by the Sword.</hi> He says thus: <hi>Accipere Gladium, est non datum à Legibus stringere. Ergo qui vim injustam infert Accipit Gladium, è contra verò qui justâ Defensione utitur, non Accipit Gladium, sed stringit datum à Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</hi> For a man to take the Sword, is to draw it when it is not put into his hands by the Laws. Therefore he who offers unjust Violence, <hi>Takes the Sword</hi>; but on the other hand, he who uses a just Defence, does not <hi>Take the Sword,</hi> but he draws a Sword which the Laws put into his hands. And to name no more places, in his Commentary on the 13 <hi>Rom.</hi> upon those words, <hi>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake.

            <p>It was the misery of most of the Protestants in other Countries, as well as those in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the beginning of their Reformation, to fall under Oppression; particularly the <hi>French, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Protestants: and it is well known they all Defended themselves, and used Resistance; which in <hi>Scotland</hi> ended in an Established Reformation; in <hi>Holland,</hi> ended in an absolute Freedom both from the Popish and <hi>Spanish</hi> Yoke; and in <hi>France,</hi> ended in a free Exercise of their Religion, but was soon interrupted by the true Popish Faith, and Friendship of a Massacre, so that they were forced to Fight all over again. I desire that it may be observed, That neither these <hi>Germans, Scotch, Dutch,</hi> nor <hi>French,</hi> in their first War, ever pretended that their Religion was <hi>Established by LAW,</hi> and thereby made a part of the Government of their Country, <hi>Which men by their Allegeance are bound to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi>; but they used Resistance to repel the Violence which was done only to their Civil Rights, and to the <hi>Native Liberty</hi> of their Consciences. It were foolish Impertinence to cite the Authorities of those that were engaged in this Resistance; and it were endless to cite all the forreign Divines who lookt on, and applauded it, and called it <hi>The LORD's Battles</hi>: I suppose it will be more for every bodies satisfaction, to see what our own Bishops say to it, and whether they will own those men for <hi>Protestants,</hi> who were engaged in such Proceedings: For which purpose I shall set down the words of three of them, Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> men famous in this Church.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But here we are fallen into a Political Question, How much Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Subjects was promised to the Prince by the Fundamental Laws of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very State; whether he have a boundless and unlimited Power, or whether it be measured and adjusted, and more or less mixed with the Power and Authority of the Peers or People? The Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours heretosore was Absolute and Unmixed, they governed all at Pleasure, they made Laws, and they unmade them again, and had the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Life and Death: For which reason the Christians could with no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Resist the Violence of those Times, or Defend themselves against the Wrongs which were done to them. But the Princes of those Countries which you speak of, have certain Bounds set them, which when they pass, the Nobles think it lawful for them to Repel their unjust Violence, and to shake off the Yoke wherewith they are wickedly and illegally Oppressed. And thus the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had the Government of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> only upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Compact, when he did no longer stand to his Compact, and acted Insolently, contrary to the Faith which he had given, was thought to have devested himself of that Government; so that there was no reason, why those Provinces might not lawfully Defend themselves with Arms, and get rid of an Ambitious Tyranny. The King of <hi>France</hi> is much more Absolute, nevertheless this serves for a Law to him, <hi>That the Prince can do nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, and that his Edicts ought not to be regarded, unless they be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Equity as well as Truth.</hi> Besides, the Peers and the rest of the Estates have an Honour and Dignity belonging to them, which the King himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Violate: Which, when the Nobles of that Kingdom were sensible was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, by a Faction of some upstart Men, who served their own Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under a Cloak of Religion, turned all things upside down, and seemed to threaten miserable Calamity to the whole Kingdom, truly they took up Arms to Vindicate the King's and Kingdom's, and all their own Liberties, and thought it not fit to be endured, that the Insolence of a few Men, which was armed against the Laws, should trample upon all Laws, both Divine and Humane, with unsufferable Boldness. They fought therefore for their own Right, not by any Priviledge which the Church has to Defend itself with Arms, but by their Civil Liberty, whereby, without any wrong to the Prince, it was Lawful for them in a way of Defence, to maintain their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99338:5"/>
Establishment against their sworn Enemies. And herein their Case differed from that of the Primitive Church, which was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Absolute Imperial Will and Pleasure, without any Title to Rights of its own. Now, while their condition continu'd thus, <hi>The Christians,</hi> as you say, <hi>were killed, but did not kill</hi>; Notwithstanding, when under <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, they were armed with a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Right, <hi>They were rather for killing than being killed</hi>; and having Vanquished several Usurpers, and <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour, they threw off the Yoke of Persecution from the Neck of the Church.</p>
            <p>In like manner our Church, when she had for a long time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone an hard Bondage under Antichrist, having had no Secular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection at all; after she had begun, by the Mercy of God, to get above Water, and to rise from under those Waves of Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having by the Princes and Nobles standing by her, gained some Protection of the Laws, she began to use her own Power, as far as she had it, and when she was now fortified with Edicts, and Laws, and Priviledges, to Vindicate herself with Arms from the vexatious Oppression of Tyrants.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> who were concerned to provide that the Publick Liberty should not be oppressed by Wrong, nor those things which ought to have been Established by the Law, should be made Null and Void at the Pleasure of some few Forreigners crept in amongst them, thought fit to have that unjust Violence repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a War, and thought fit likewise that the Church, which was no otherwise than justly Armed, for the Preserving that Liberty which she had by Law, should be drawn out into the Field: Where, those that fell on your side, Friend <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> did not perish by the Injury of a Persecution, but by the Stroke of a most just Defence.</p>
            <p>But because it may be said, that these are private Men, which I grant to be true, though their Arguments seem to be of another nature, and look like the publick and common Reason of Mankind, therefore, to finish and perfect this business of Authorities, (with which, as some men are wholly led, so, I hope, others may be so far excused, as not to be haunted and tormented at a dying Hour, and tempted either to Despair, or die with a Lye in their Mouths.)</p>
            <p>In the last place I shall shew, that the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> in several Convocations, have Justified the Protestants in those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and not only maintained in Words, the Justice of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, but, which is more, they laid down their Purses to help them; and charged themselves deeply with Taxes, in consideration of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s great Charges and Expences in Assisting them: as you may see in the Preambles of the Clergy's Subsidy Acts in that Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quinto Elizabethae,</hi> Cap. 24. Among other Considerations, for which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99338:6"/>
the Clergy give their Subsidy of Six Shillings in the Pound, they have these words:
<q>And, finally, pondering the inestimable Charges sustained by Your Highness, as well of late days in reducing the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> to Unity and Concord, as also in procuring, as much as in Your Highness lieth, by all kind of Godly and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Means, the abating of all Hostility and Persecution within the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> practised and used against the professors of God's Holy Gospel, and True Religion.</q>
The first thing in this Passage is the Queen's Assistance of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility in their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein they were opposed by the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who brought <hi>French</hi> Forces into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is set down at large in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, <hi>Stow,</hi> p. 640. The Temporalty, in their Subsidy Act, at the same time, <hi>Cap.</hi> 27. call this Assistance,
<q>The Princely and Upright Preservation of the Liberty of the next Realm and Nation of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from imminent Captivity and Desolation.</q>
The other thing is the Godly and Prudent Means for abating Hostility and Persecution within the Realm of <hi>France.</hi> Now History will inform us, <hi>Stow,</hi> p. 650. That those Means were the Forces sent under <hi>Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to <hi>Newhaven,</hi> to Assist the <hi>French</hi> Protestants who were then in Arms. We have some Men who would find another Name for it, and would call this the Abetting of a Rebellion; but the whole Bishops and Clergy, in Convocation, call it, The use of <hi>Godly and Prudent Means to abate Hostility and Persecution,</hi> practised and used against <hi>the Professors of GOD's Holy Gospel, and True Religion:</hi> For so likewise they call a parcel of Men, who neither Professed nor Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised the Modern Religion of Non-resistance.</p>
            <p>Again, the Clergy grant another Subsidy, 35 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. in consideration of her Majesties Charges,
<q>In the provident and needful Prevention of such intended Attempts, as tended to the Extirpation of the sincere Profession of the Gospel, both here and elsewhere.</q>
The Temporalties Subsidy-Act at the same time will explain this to us, in these Reasons for their Tax, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.
<q>Besides the great and perpetual Honour which it hath pleased God to give your Majesty abroad, in making you the principal Support of all Just and Religious Causes against Usurpers, — Besides the great Succours in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which we do conceive to be most Honourable, in regard of the Ancient Leagues, the Justice and Equity of their Causes.</q>
And to the same purpose again the Temporalty, 39 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 27.
<q>This Land is become since your Majesties Happy days, both a Port, and Haven of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, for distressed States and Kingdoms, and a Rock and Bulwark of Opposition against the Tyrannies and ambitious Attempts of Mighty and Usurping Potentates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are the Clergy in their Subsidy-Act, 43 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 17. at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99338:6"/>
all behind them, either with their Money or Acknowledgements.
<q>For who hath or should have a livelier Sence, or better Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your Majesties Princely Courage and Constancy in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and Protecting the free Profession of the Gospel, within and without your Majesties Dominions, than your Clergy?</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Protestants were Rebels in their Resistance, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> quite through Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Reign, by their Assisting of them, involved themselves in the same guilt. For it had been utterly Unlawful, and a horrid Sin to assist Subjects in the Violation of their Duty and Allegiance, and to aid them in Resisting the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> But this being too absurd to be believed of Confessors, and men who had hazarded their Lives for the Protestant Religion, it is plain that they held Resistance to be lawful in these Cases. And they have declared their Opinion in this matter, where it was fit to be declared, in Acts of Parliament, though it be not to be found in their Catechism. So that if they who hold the same Opinion be in an Error, they have erred with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they have erred with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and they have erred in good Company.</p>
