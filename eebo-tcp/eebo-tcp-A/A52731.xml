            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>Profitable Adventure</hi> TO THE FORTUNATE, And can be UNFORTUNATE to NONE. <hi>BEING</hi> A PROPOSAL for Raising One Million of Money, by setling a Fund of One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Forty Thousand Pounds <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> for Fifteen Years only for it.</head>
            <p>THAT there be Tickets Numbred from One to an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thousand, given out at Ten Pounds a piece, to make up that Million of Money. The said Tickets to be answered by such another Hundred Thousand of Tickets, whereof Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Five Hundred to be Benefitted, in such sort as is herein after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, besides One Pound Yearly which every Ticket will have; so that whoever puts in Ten Pounds, will be sure to have One Pound Yearly for Fifteen Years; and therefore cannot lose, but may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly gain very much by it: Nor can the Objection made use of as a great Argument against any sort of Adventures, <hi>viz.</hi> The taking away Money, and losing it quite from Servants, and such as have but a little, weigh at all in this Case.</p>
            <p>For Note, Whoever puts thus in his Money, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten Pounds, though he meets with none of the Two Thousand Five Hundred Tickets, which are to be called Benefits, he'll have Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Yearly for Fifteen Years, which is near Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> certain for the Money, and so can be no loser by it, and consequently there will be no prejudice to any sort of Mankind that thus shall lay out his Money.</p>

            <p>The Numbers, Blanks, and Benefitted Tickets thus:</p>
            <p>One Hundred Thousand Tickets, Numbred from One, to One Hundred Thousand, to be drawn from one Box, against One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thousand other Tickets, to be drawn from another Box, whereof Ninety Seven Thousand Five Hundred (though Blanks) are to entitle the Numbers against which each is drawn to one Pound Yearly, for the Fifteen Years. And the other Two Thousand Five Hundred, which together, make up the One Hundred Thousand Tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, are to entitle the Numbers against which they are drawn, to the several Benefits here-under exprest; which with the Benefit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the First and Last drawn, makes up the Forty Thousand Pounds Yearly, the Fortunate will gain by this Thing.</p>
