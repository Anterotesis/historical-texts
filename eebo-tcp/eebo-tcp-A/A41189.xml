            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>BRother,<note place="margin">The Pope's Countrey-House.</note> You are welcome to
the <hi>Belveder,</hi> we are now in
a Committee of Secresie, and
may discourse our thoughts
with Freedom, without suspicion of a surprize. How
stand our Affairs in <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, Sir! Matters have not succeeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Wishes and Expectations; I thought I had
been secure of my Designs, and this made me act
with Confidence; but ah!—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>What? Are all our Plots and Intrigues sham'd
into a Sigh? Is your <hi>Tripos</hi> himself deceiv'd? I thought
he had been so unerringly skill'd in the Arts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining,
that no Government could have escap'd
his Trains.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50082:3"/>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>You know his Antient Predecessor at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi>
was sometimes mistaken, and if our Oracle be at
present doubtful, 'tis according to former Precedent,
and far from Wonder in Demonology. I had great
hopes that my terrible Comet-Parliament (whose Rod
did far out-stretch the Regal Scepter) would have
mounted to a higher Elevation than <hi>Charles</hi> his Wain,
and fix'd upon our Horizon: but on a sudden the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
and the Parliament, and our hopes dissolv'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>In my opinion, your Blazing Commons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
with too fiery a Tail, and acted with too much
openness and Effrontery; there was more <hi>Capricio</hi> than
Policy in their Proceedings. Affairs were not ripe
enough for their daring Adventures; they drew up
19 Propositions, and such bold Remonstrances, as if
the King had already been their Prisoner in the Isle of
<hi>Wight.</hi> And what a mischief was it to the Liberty-Keepers
of <hi>England,</hi> to send for Gentlemen into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody,
by no other Warrant, but from Will, Will?
this was an unlucky Indication of the Plurality of
Arbitrary Powers, and was as much as to say in our
Language, <hi>Sic volumus, sic jubemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Proceedings being illegal and unwarrantable
was their Merit, and not their Crime; in my opinion,
their onely Guilt was the imprudence of a too early
Vexation, &amp; their being Arbitrary somewhat too soon.
For I am afraid these frequent Hurricanes should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
upon the Abhorrers of Petitions, an Abhorrence
of Parliaments, and make the People vote, that the
Commons are the greatest Enemies to their own sitting,
and give them occasion to Resolve, that if they must
be Slaves, they had better with St. <hi>Paul</hi> be bound
with one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Chains, than loaden with 500
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50082:3"/>
Irons. Remember that you once govern'd the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by a Junto of Commons, without a King or House
of Lords, and if by a too early violence you force the
King into Extremity, you may give him occasion to
Govern the Realm by a King and House of Peers,
and, at least, to exclude your Members from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
for your continu'd Affronts will furnish him
with plausible Reasons to excuse the Model, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
such a Proceeding. I grant you shew much
Gallantry, and met with good Success in the dayes
of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, but I am your elder Brother, and
have had longer experience in the Ruin of Empires
than your Age can pretend to; therefore it is my
Counsel, as your Friend and Brother, that if you be
again allow'd the Priviledge to choose your Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,
advise them to court the King with fair
Pretensions and reserv'd Compliances, till you can,
by great Complements and a little money, caress him
into an Act of Oblivion, and when he hath forgot
both himself and you, then is the time to remember
the Good old Cause.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed I now wish that we had treated the
King with more fineness, for I know by precedent,
that he who is to do Execution upon a Monarch,
should not appear bare-fac'd, but in Masquerade:
And I have a suspicion that our bolder Votes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
have so awaken'd him, that we may have lost
our Advantage: especially considering that he was
immediate Successor to a murder'd Father.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>But how did you resent the Remove to
<hi>Oxford?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Sir, I had a very painful sense of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval,
it was a kind of Dislocation in the Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick:
for, methinks, the Commons out of <hi>London</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50082:4"/>
look like Members out of joynt. This Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depriv'd us of the blessed Advantages of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
Cabals, and Metropolitan Tumults. But yet,
to shew that no change of Air could alter our Nature
and Resolutions, we did pursue the same Votes at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> that we had commenc'd at <hi>Westminster.</hi> My
Dictator or <hi>Terrae Filius,</hi> was just preparing a Speech
for the Theatre, but that proud Pile was founded by
an Arch-bishop, and so surrounded with <hi>Caesars,</hi> that
we could never enter the <hi>Circus,</hi> but were dispers'd
with a sudden Thunder-clap; and this gave occasion
to some prophane Tantivy-men to ridicule that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and stile it the <hi>Anchovy Parliament,</hi> because it
dissolv'd so soon upon the first Heat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>But I am told of a Declaration that follow'd
that Dissolution, and that the King hath declared,
He will govern by his Laws; and you and I have
more reason to be afraid of that, than of his being
Arbitrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, and I believe that Declaration was
one of the Evils presag'd by that Malignant Comet;
for, to speak plainly, I was never pleas'd with that
Blazing-Rod, for, when it first appear'd in it's We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Position, the Extremity of his <hi>Radius</hi> seem'd to
be just Zenith to the House of Commons: and I am
afraid, that Comet was some <hi>Tory</hi> among the Stars,
that had no good meaning to the Lower House; for
when that Parliament dissolved, it presently disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
as if it came on purpose to point at us, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>Some did fancy here at <hi>Rome,</hi> that that Star
might be the Receptacle of the Souls of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and
the rest of my last Martyrs in <hi>England;</hi> and that the
large Emanation from the Comet, did remark the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50082:4"/>
streaming Effusions of their Blood, and signifie a Rod
to revenge it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>I shall not dispute which Martyrs were the
greater Saints your Regicides or mine; but I must tell
you, that I was resolv'd for the Blood of <hi>Stafford,</hi> not
so much upon the account of his Crimes, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his name; it sounded so like the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
that I fancyed his Blood might be happily omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and be royally and canonically attended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our former Precedent. But I assure you
of late we are become very tender of Catholick blood,
and if the Popish Lords, and my Bosom-Friend <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
were to remain untry'd, till we vote them to
the Bar, they should be reserv'd till <hi>Doomsday.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>But Brother, the Comet hath so amus'd you,
that you have forgotten the Declaration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, it did a little divert me; but, I can
as soon forget the Covenant as the Declaration. The
King indeed did once pass an Act of Oblivion for us,
but it is against our Method of Grace, to grant an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
for the King, except it be to forget his Mercy.</p>
               <p>To declare against the Collective Wisdom of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to term the Actions of an Heroick House of
Commons, Irregularities, Miscarriages, illegal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Proceeding, this is too high an Affront
to be forgotten. For tho we printed our Votes, and
discover'd our Secrets, on purpose to inflame the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Sisters, yet for the King to expose the <hi>Pudenda,</hi>
or Nakedness of the Peoples Members, in Churches
and Markets, to be observ'd and scoff'd at by Crowds
of Tories; this was uncivil and immodest, nay, about
two years ago, I would have call'd it Impudence.</p>
               <p>But that which added to my Vexation was the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical
order for reading of it in the Pulpit; if it had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50082:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been denounc'd below the Mount, in the despis'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Desk,
it would have had no Impression or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity;
but being publish'd from the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum</hi>
of the Pulpit, that most Sacred Seat of Oracles,
this made it pass for <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and because the
Voice came from the Pulpit, some silly People were
apt to think that the Declaration was made in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
This was a Metropolitan Stratagem, and shall
be recorded for the first Article against <hi>William</hi> the
Second.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>But I am inform'd that there was an Use of
Consolation in the conclusion of that Declaration,
wherein the King promis'd the People the Favour of
frequent Parliaments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>In my opinion, that is not so great a Favour,
except we can sit again next door to Hell, where we
may correspond with our old Familiars. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Frequent Parliaments suppose frequent Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
and one Good old fashion'd Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were worth 500 frequent ones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>But I hope you do not despond, and give
up the common Cause as desperate.</p>

               <p>I will never despair as long as you have a
Being in the World, for I yet find, there is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in your Name, the crying Pope and Popery is
still the surest stratagem, and there could be no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
Plot without that infallible Noise.</p>
               <p>But that which most supports my hopes, is, the
King's want of Money. The Fort Royal is defended
by so many Cannons and Regular Fortifications, that
there is no way to take it but starving; And to this
end, we have, by a Solemn Vote, made it Treason
against the Parliament for the King or his Friends to
supply his need, without the consent of his Enemies.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50082:5"/>
For if it be in the power of Zeal, Money, or Perjury,
we will send him such Commons as shall never grant
him a penny, except he stake his Crown, or some
of the Jewels of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>I would have you declare in all the High
Courts of Shops and Coffee-houses, that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as necessary to raise Money in <hi>England,</hi> as a
Purgatory at <hi>Rome:</hi> But I am afraid your Church
of <hi>England</hi> Tories have no more regard to Votes,
than you have for Proclamations. And you have so
alarm'd them by your late Arbitrary Proceedings, that
I am jealous that they should rather think it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to make an honourable and timely Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Crown, by some considerable Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
than run the Adventure to be plunder'd by
your Troops, and sequester'd by your Committees.
I do allow your indisputable Maxim, that the Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the King is the interest of a Presbyterian House
of Commons: And you have wisely ordain'd, that
though the King should be reduc'd to the straitest
Exigencies, yet he must not so much as ask an Alms,
and if Necessity should teach him the common impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to be a Beggar, yet you have politicly resolved,
that it shall be a Crime to be charitable to the Crown,
without the leave of the Commons, those High Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Brother, the Mischief is, that you did once
contribute your Money and Plate to carry on the
War against the King, without a Statute of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Now this may become an unlucky Precedent,
and if ever the Cavaliers come to be considering Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
they may chance to conclude, That they may
as freely give their Gold to support the hands of
<hi>Moses,</hi> as you did to make the Golden Calf of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50082:6"/>
And that it were more Religion and
Loyalty, in their Prince's Extremity, to contribute
their money without a Parliament to preserve the
King and Monarchy, than it was for you to destroy
them both by an Arbitrary Contribution.</p>
               <p>Now this being the fatal Crisis of our Cause, be
sure you maintain with all possible confidence, That
for any one to cast in his Free-will-offerings into the
Treasury or Corban of the Crown, is Will-worship
and Popery, and as Antichristian a Superstition as
Alms and Charity. I wonder you have so long al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the King that Imperial Prerogative to be the
sole Lord of the Mint, it would have been a mighty
Policy and Advantage, if you could have shared in
that Authority, and Enacted that the Coin of <hi>England</hi>
should have had the Image of the King stamp'd on
one side, and the Superscription of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
on the other. This would have been a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
that he could never have had any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
without you. There is an Apocryphal passage
in the Gospel, that would make us believe that Christ
and St. <hi>Peter</hi> should pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi> without
the consent of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and should tell the
<hi>Jews</hi> they were oblig'd to do so too, because the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
had the Image and Superscription of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which
did suppose their subjection to him, and his intire
Authority over them. And I observe that <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, in his <hi>English</hi> Coin, is stamp'd <hi>more Romano,</hi>
and his Image looks like the Ancient Figure of <hi>Caesar
Augustus.</hi> I wish this be not ominous.</p>

lose their Lands; though they should not present their
Oblations, yet the unwilling Sacrifices of our Estates
which will be drawn from us by the Cords of Penal

worst of all, will give the King the Advantage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

ever the King, by any crafty Stratagem, procure a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liering
Parliament, who are Bigots for the Monarchy and
Hierarchy of <hi>England,</hi> both you and I are ruin'd, and
we are sure not to have one Friend in the three Estates.
Such a pack of Tories would restore the Use of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,

of Law and Property, and therefore they are
commonly born with an unhappy Inclination to unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

that we are designing. But you and I must have

               <p>What think you of the Condition of <hi>Tangier?</hi>
In my Opinion, the King's securing that place without
your Aid, and against your Will, was a mighty instance
of his Power and Policy. His gallant Fleet in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,
his victorious Arms at <hi>Tangier,</hi> have made
his name glorious in the Levant; and I believe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Morocco,</hi> tho one of the Heads of the Dragon,
yet dare not address to him with so much Rudeness as
the Tail of a House of Commons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phan.</speaker>
               <p>The preserving <hi>Tangier</hi> from the Assault of the
<hi>Moors,</hi> was one of the blackest Misfortunes that ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell
us; for our Confederates in <hi>Africa,</hi> intrench'd before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50082:8"/>
that Town in a very Critical Juncture; and if they had
carried the place while my House of Comets were bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
it would have given us a brave Advantage to have
storm'd the Throne; for, then we would have clamor'd
against the King, and charg'd him with the Ruine of our
Levant Trade; we would have brought the Loss of that
Town into the <hi>Popish</hi> Plot, and accus'd some <hi>Romish</hi>
Officers for betraying the place to Infidels. This would
have so much lessen'd the King's Reputation both at
home and abroad, and so much serv'd our Interest in the
promoting of popular Complaints, that we could not
have wish'd a happier Event: but to preserve the place
and to triumph too, was so great a Disappointment, that
I begin to fear, the old Prince of the <hi>Blacks</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us.</p>
               <p>Indeed there was a time, when we would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
that Place to the Crown, for fear it should have
been remov'd into the Exchequer; but to speak <hi>San</hi>'s
<hi>Complement,</hi> I had rather <hi>Tangier</hi> should have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to the Crown Imperial of <hi>Morocco,</hi> than to the
Crown Imperial of <hi>England.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pope.</speaker>
               <p>Before we part, I thing my self oblig'd to give
you my Thanks for some late eminent Services.</p>
               <p>First, For your vigorous Pursuit of the excluding Bill.
There were some hundreds of years from the first Date
of <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> which are commonly call'd the first four
Centuries, when you and I had not a Being in the
World. In those days, the Plain Christians kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the old fashion'd Modes of Primitive Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and observ'd the meaner Habits of Meekness, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and Patience, with a tame Subjection to secular
Powers; and tho sometimes they had the Command of
Forts, and Castles, and valiant Armies, yet they were
so silly as to truckle to a Pagan Successor, and suffer him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50082:8"/>
to ascend the Throne without any Affront or Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
But you and I have learn'd braver Principles,
and taught the World, that Dominion is founded in
Grace, that is, in your Favour and Mine.</p>
               <p>Now, if, like these Primitive Fools, you had left the
Throne to the Right and Descent of Law and Nature,
and to the quiet disposure of Providence, then I am
confident, if the Duke had surviv'd the King, that he
would never have render'd his short Reign uneasie, by
removing the Boundaries of an establish'd Religion and
Government, but would have thought himself oblig'd,
in Generosity, to have been Defender of that Faith, and
of that People, who had never given him the least Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
               <p>I am not yet assur'd that the Duke is a Zealot in my
Religion, but you do well to report him to be so, and
you have taken a Course to make him one, and I thank
you for that.</p>
               <p>That which next merits my Thanks is your Bill for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Protestants; for, you have so ingeniously contriv'd
the Project, that it will equally serve your Interest and
mine; for you only exclude the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue, but in
others allow a Confusion of Languages, and suffer eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Division to enjoy their own Dialect: and yet by an
Almighty Vote, resolve, that ninety and nine Divisions
shall be but one single Unite, and the same Idiom.</p>
               <p>Brother, if ever you can effect this, I will grant you
to be a greater Conjurer than I, and that you have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the mystery of Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p>This politick Stratagem would introduce so great a
Confusion into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that many wiser
men would come over to <hi>Rome,</hi> and think it the better
Babel of the two.</p>
               <p>In my opinion, your uniting Device does far exceed a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50082:9"/>
Toleration, for that would leave the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to enjoy it's distinct Order and Establishment; but this
cunning Contrivance and mystical Union, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Glory and Discipline of that Church, which
is the greatest Envy of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have yet no hopes to repeal the 23. but I thank you
for your endeavours of repealing the <hi>35th.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> That
Fundamental, establishing Law of rank Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
I do dispence with your observing of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
day, and the pompous burning of my Effigies, so
you will but damn the Statutes of <hi>Jesabel,</hi> for that was
her ancient Title among yours and mine.</p>
               <p>I hope, next Parliament, tho you meet in a new place
you will pursue your old Votes and Resolutions.</p>
