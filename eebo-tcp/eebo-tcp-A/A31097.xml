         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. Nicholas Skinner, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy and Honored Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE laudable Character given
you by ſome Miniſters of Chriſt:
and other good Souls, now (I
Charitably hope and believe) Praiſing
God in Glory: Eſpecially, the experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
taſt I my ſelf have had of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
(ſince Providence made me ſo
happy in your Acquaintance;) hath En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me to prefix your worthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
Name to this ſmall Tract; whoſe
deſign and chief tendency is, to encourage
poor dejected Souls (under the hidings
of God's Face,) to caſt themſelves on
that (never failing) goodnſs of God (in
Chriſt,) untill God's ſet time for Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb facs="tcp:54102:3"/>
comes. And alſo, to ſtir up
experienced and grown Believers, to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Adoration, and Praiſing of
that Adorable Name, and Wonder work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providence of the Glorious and Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
Jehovah; which hath ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
appear'd, in the Deliverance
wrought for me, his poor nothing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(both for Soul and Body,) and
who am to this very Day) kept alive, and
upheld by that Divine Manutenency of his
own, to the great Admiration both of my
ſelf and thoſe godly Souls who know my
preſent Circumſtances; and Gods dealing
with me. I have been (for ſeveral Years
paſt) more than ordinarily Importun'd,
both by godly Divines, and ſuch Zealous
working <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as your ſelf, to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
what (now) I have preſumed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate,
to ſo dear and well deſerving a
Friend, as you are well known to be, both
to God's Truth, and ſuch (as in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
bear the Bleſſed Image of his Son.
The principal Motive of their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
me to Publiſh this, was the ſtrange
Influence, the Relation hereof (from my
<pb facs="tcp:54102:3"/>
own Mouth) had upon their own Spirits,
the effects whereof they were not able to
hide; the Tears of Joy guſhing out (ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly)
from their Eyes; with both
Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven,
wondering at, and Adoreing the Wonders
of God, in my Caſe: Profeſſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that (in all their time) they had
neither heard, nor known, ſo much of
the goodneſs and Grace of God, vouchſaſed
to a poor loſt and undon ſinner, as was
ſhewn and vouchſafed to unworthy me;
Which occaſioned ſeveral of the godly
Miniſters, eſpecially, Mr. <hi>Noah Bryan,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Timothy Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and the dear Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
(all now with Chriſt) to profeſs,
that they never heard of, or knew any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
come ſo near to <hi>Paul</hi> (as touching
God's method, and way; of Working upon,
and dealing with him, in, and after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion)
as I did. And therefore they
(unanimouſly) agreed (in Judging) that
to Publiſh the ſame, was my Duty. The
which, they doubted not; would be greatly
uſeful, and that both to Saints and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:54102:4"/>
on ſundry accounts. The ſincere
and upright Hearted <hi>Nathaniel Mather</hi>
(late of <hi>Pinners-Hall,</hi>) hath (ſeveral
times) chid; me for my backwardneſs to
ſo neceſſary and uſeful a Work; and a
little before his Death, he at me again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, examining into the Grounds of
my backwardneſs herein. To whom I
reply'd, Sir, There are two things which
(hitherto) have kept me back from Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
this my experience, and how much
of Satan there may be in it, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, The difficulty which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
my ſetting down (in Writing) the
working of the Spirit of Adoption, in
doſcovering and applying Chriſt unto me,
the Remembrance whereof, doth ſo ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me up, and melt me, that I am not
able to ſee my Paper for the Tears of Joy,
which obſtruct my Viſive Faculty. To
which he Reply'd, that it was pitty any
thing ſhould hinder me in ſo good (and
uſeful) a Work. The Second is, the fear
Lodg'd within me, of Peoples not Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
the Relation I ſhall give hereof,
<pb facs="tcp:54102:4"/>
in caſe it were Printed; For, (ſaid I)
the greateſt part of Profeſſors are ſo great
ſtrangers to the nature of true Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(eſpecially when wrought in a Sinner,
in the way and method God took with me)
that they will rather ſuſpect, and queſtion
the truth of what I relate, than Praiſe
God, (or improve the ſame for their
own good, or Spiritual advantage) for the
ſame. To which, Reply was made, That
Satan was always ready to obſtruct any
good Work which hath the leaſt tendency
to God's Praiſe, or the good of Souls.
Since his departure, the freſh Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Importunities of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
above Named, together with the
repeated Solicitations of ſeveral godly,
zealous Chriſtians (yet living,) have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with me, to beat my way through
thoſe Difficulties which lay before me,
leaving the Iſſue (of my preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking)
to the powerful Providence of
God, to make the ſame ſucceſsful, in
what it is deſigned for. And begging
(moſt heartily) your Pardon, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I have taken, in acknowledging the
<pb facs="tcp:54102:5"/>
great Kindneſs, and Reſpect ſhewen (by
your Religious and truly Generous ſelf)
to the meaneſt and moſt unworthy of
Chriſt's (Diſpiſed) Ambaſſadours; the
which (I doubt not) you will find Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Heaven (by my Lord and Maſter,)
as an evident proof of your Faith in, and
unfeigned Love to Him, and his Cauſe
and Intereſt, here on Earth. Let not
(Dear Sir) the diſadvantages under which
I lye (on account of the slanderous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
heaped on me, by malicious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
leſſen your hope of the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
(of Reward) promiſed (by him
that cannot lye) to all your Works and
Labours of Love expreſt to me, and others
of Gods Children, for the Sake of Chriſt.
He that will take notice of a cup of Cold
Water given to a Diſciple, in the Name of
his Diſciple, will (I queſtion not) Record
in Heaven, the refreſhing Wine I have
drank at your Table, (more than once)
and the Silver and Gold ſent me, and
given me by your ſelf, whereby both I
and my diſtreſſed Family, have been kept
from ſinking into the Duſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54102:5"/>
And albeit, I ſhould (at the great day
of Judgment) appear to be a Caſt away
from Chriſt, of which (through Infinite
Grace) I am no more afraid, than I am
afraid that God can ceaſe to be, what he
is.</p>
            <p>Yet your Integrity and Uprightneſs (in
what you have done to me, for Chriſt's
ſake) will be, not only made known, but
graciouſly and abundantly Rewarded.
(and if I miſtake not the deſign of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
which hath put me upon fixing
my thoughts on your ſelf, as the fitteſt
and moſt deſerving Perſon to whom, to
Dedicate this ſmall Extract, of the
large experience I have had of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
goodneſs, and Infinite All-Sufficiency,
in ſaving a loſt Sinner). I

apprehended) out of Doors, ſtops his
Horſe to ſee where the Infant lay, but the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54102:7"/>
Snow being deep, and it Snowing a pace,
he could perceive nothing. But following
the Voice of the Cry, he was led to the
place where I lay; he forthwith knocks at
the Door next to the Dung-hill, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after the cruel, and unnatural Mother
of that poor dying Infant on the Dung-hill,
or to entreat ſomebody, to take Pitty on ſo
deſpicable an Object. On this, my Nurſe
informs the Man whoſe Child I was, with
the whole of my circumſtances, no ſooner
had he underſtood whoſe I was, but he runs
to the place where I lay, takes me up, lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
me in his Cloak, and brings me Home
to my Parents, fifteen long Miles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt Nurture either of Breaſt or
Spoon, (for the ſupport of decaying Nature):
All that fifteen Miles, beſides the ſpace I
lay on the Dung-hill, which (as my Nurſe
her ſelf confeſt to the Man) was about five
hours, I continued to make ſad complaints,
by abounding in Heart moving Skreeks,
and piteous moans all the Day; the Man
expecting every moment when I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
In this condition, he preſents me a
ſad ſpectacle to my Parents, acquainting
them where, and how he found me, and
how that he was (he knew not how or
wherefore) turned off from his Road to go
that way, where he met with me. Forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54102:8"/>
an Expreſs was poſted away, for three
or four of the Chief Phyſitians who were
then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who immediately haſtned
to my Fathers, (being about two Miles and
a half from <hi>Dublin,</hi>) the utmoſt of their
Skill and Judgment was Improved for my
preſent help and relief, but all in vain. The
Intricacy of my ſtate and Condition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being ſuch, as ſufficienly nonpluſt and
Baffled all their Skill, finding no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(in a rational way) of Recovering me,
they gave me up, aſſuring my Relations that
I was a gon Child, (as to this World.) The
Doctors forſaking me; other means were
applied by Ancient Men, and Midwives;
who ſeem'd to have good Judgement and
long experience in curing Children; neither
availed this any thing, God having blaſted
all that men could effect (as Inſtruments)
to make way for his Bleſſing on that means,
which he himſelf had ſingled out for my
effectual cure, that the ſame might be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to the Eternal Praiſe of his own
Wonder working Providence, as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appear. All means apply'd for my
cure and recovery, were (by the powerful
Providence of God), made effectual Food,
to nouriſh, and feed the Diſtempers which
threatned the Life of my Body; untill I was
at length taken by all for Dead. No moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54102:8"/>
of Life appearing in me, I was ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, put into the Winding-Sheet, and
Nailed uy in my Coffin. And as Frinds and
Neighbours were juſt going out of the
Door, to accompany me to my long Home,
the Perſon who carried the Coffin, both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me to ſtir, and alſo heard me to cry
in the Coffin: At which, all were not a
little amazed, and ſome ſo affrighted that
they Run awy.</p>
               <p>About near two Months after this eſcape,
I was a ſecond time taken for Dead, in the
opinion of all the Family, ſtretched out and
wraped in a Winding-Sheet, and leaſt they
might be over haſty in Burying me, it was
judged expedient to wake with me, which is
the manner and Cuſtom in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſitting up all Night with many Lights in
the Room where the Corps lyes. It pleas'd
God, that about Mid-Night, they who
Watcht me, ſaw me lift up the Sheet,
to their great Aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe ſtrange and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Revivals, I was no ſmall grief and
burthen to my Parents, and other Relations
in the Family, and that on the account of
my continuing ſo Long in Pain and Miſery,
no endeavours of Creatures likely to do
me good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54102:9"/>
As I grew in Age, ſo my Diſtemper wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and grew at ſuch a rate, that my little
Body waxed very big, and miſhapen: my
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly was as big as an ordinary Tubb, or
Drum, My Legs no way able to bear, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
my Diſtemper'd body. Thus was I a
burthen not only to others, but alſo to my
ſelf, untill it pleaſed God to check and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
the Humors and Diſtempers in my
Body, which elſe had Checkt me into the
Duſt.</p>
               <p>The means of my Recovery was, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) On a certain Day, as I was
in the Arms of a Maid Servant, whoſe only
Work it was, to attend on and Miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, I beheld on the ground, before the
Door, ſome ſpeckled Shell Snails, which
dropt out of the Load of Furze that came to
the Door, theſe Snailes I Cry'd to have
them, the Maid willing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a gratify my deſire,
pickt up as many as ſhe could ſee of them,
with theſe I pleaſed my Fancy, playing with
them till weary: After which I motioned to
put the Snails into the Fire, and after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while, when I apprehended they were
Roſted, I cryed to have them again, the
Maid and all others that beheld me, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
greatly what I deſigned to do with
them, no ſooner had I clear'd them from the
Shells, but (to the great amazement of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54102:9"/>
Spectators) I fell to Eat them, and to ſuch
ſatisfaction, that (having once taſted of
them) I could not for ſome conſiderable
time, be prevailed with to Eat any other
Meat except Snails. This new Diet (to
which neither entreaty, nor yet example of
any Mortal mov'd me (did by the Bleſſing
of God, prove both Food and Phyſick; for
by them I was (to the great aſtoniſhment
of them who knew me) greatly nouriſhed,
and apparently advantaged in point of
Health: For in a ſhort time after I had taker
to Eating Snails the Swelling of my Body
aſſwaged, and the uſe of my Limbs I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
As I began with this new Diet, ſo I
continued untill I was perfectly cured, to
the great admiration and wonderment of all
ſorts, who both ſaw and heard of my
Practice herein. Many (both Friends and
ſtrangers) did come from City and Country
to ſee and hear of me, hearing the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and rareneſs of my caſe: Among theſe
were my Phyſitians, who formerly gave me
up for a dead Child; they at the firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my being in a hopefull way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
could not credit the News, till
hearing it with great Confidence affirmed;
they ſet a time for coming to my Fathers
to ſee, and enquire whether what was ſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about my Recovery were true; they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54102:10"/>
finding it ſo, both by their ſeeing and
handling my Body; as alſo the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they received from my Parents concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the means of my cure, together with
the manner of my making uſe of ſuch means
of my own accord. They exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at it, concluding with one accord,
that it was immediately from the Spirit of
God, and was certainly Miraculous. This
account I had from my Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who were both Eye and Ear Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of what I have here Related. But leaſt
any ſhould doubt the truth of this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſhall briefly add Two things, which
fully ſatisfies my own Soul of the truth
hereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, The perfect Remembrance
I have of my Eating Snails frequently,
when a little one.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, The frequentneſs of the
Scorns and Mocks wherewith I have met, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from my own (ſince our difference about
Religion) who (when diſcourſing about my
leaving the Church) have many times, and
often hit me in the Teeth (by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach)
with what I was, when an Infant,
How that I was caſt out on a Dung-hill, and
afterwards nailed up in a Coffin, my Grave
made, and a carrying away to be Buried:
And alaſs! The greateſt grief of all was,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54102:10"/>
that I was not at that time Buried alive,
rather than I ſhould live to be a Phanatick,
and (on that account) ſuch a ſtain and
blemiſh to the whole Family, There never
having been a Phanatick of the Family
before me</p>
               <p>And thus, I have (as briefly as I could)
given an Impartial Account of the firſt
ſtrange Deliverance wrought for me, by
the Holy, and All-Working Providence of
God.</p>
               <p>The Second eſcape from Death, when a
Babe; was as follows. Being one Night
faſt a ſleep in Bed, the Maid who tended
me, and conſtantly lay by me, neglecting
to Extinguiſh her Candle when ſhe lay
down; the Candleſtick being ſo placed by
the Maid, that the Candle burning down
near the Socket, or by ſome accidental mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hers (when aſleep) throwing the
Candle down into the Bed, the Sheets and
other Bed-Cloaths took Fire, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo far, that the Bed, Sheets, Rugg
and Mat, were ſpoiled and unfit for uſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
The Maid and I faſt aſleep,
both inſenſible of the apparent danger we
were in. It pleaſed God that my Father
(being awakned in Bed) ſmelt the ſcent of
burning, which was ſo hot in his Noſe, that
he feared danger by Fire, it being in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54102:11"/>
dead of the Night. The whole Family
Buried in Sleep (except himſelf) he could
not reſt, but gets up in his naked Shirt, goes
from Chamber to Chamber, to ſearch out
where the Fire ſhould be; and coming at
length to the Chamber where I lay, he finds
the Room all in a Smother, the Bed and
Cloths all on Fire, and the Maid and I faſt
aſleep. The firſt thing that my Father
did, was to ſnatch me out of Bed, and by
the ſuddenneſs of the wakening me out of
Sleep, and ſeeing the Fire; I was frighted,
and began to Cry; my Father fearing leaſt
harm ſhould thence enſue to my Mother,
who was at that very time near the time of
Travel, he claps his Hand on my Mouth,
and in his Arms carries me out to the Mault
Houſe (very near the houſe) where lay a
Family of <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, who managed the
Mault Houſe, he throws me haſtily into Bed
to them, charging them to keep me warm,
and to quiet me. Having thus ſecured me,
he forthwith returns to the Fire, where he
found the Maid ſtill faſt a Sleep, and by all
he could do, he could not awake her, untill
the Fire Burning her Fleſh, ſhe at length
ſtarts up, and in an amazing Surprize, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelf compaſt with Fire, and miſſing
me in the Bed, and finding my Father be-labouring
himſelf in quenching the Fire,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54102:11"/>
ſhe begins to raiſe the ſhout, my Father
preſently ſtops her Mouth, and made her
ſenſible how things were, and that the Child
was ſafe; and being come to her ſelf, ſhe
aroſe, and helped my Father to put out the
Fire; that no farther harm was done. Now
how near I was to Death, I leave every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Reader to Judge.</p>
               <p>A Third Deliverance wrought for me by
Divine Providence was, his ſaving me from
perriſhing by a Dog. The manner whereof,
was thus, One Morning, ſtanding beſides a
Table, in the Common-Hall, where a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
(who was Caterer to my Fathers
Family) was at Breakfaſt, in order to a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Market, to Buy Proviſion for the
Houſe; I perfectly Remember the Meat he
had, was Butter'd Fiſh; I expecting and
hopeing, he would give me ſome part of
the Fiſh; ſtood over againſt him, peeping
up at him; with my little Fingers on the
edge of the Table: The Gentleman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the poſture I was in; hands out his
Plate to me, with ſome of the Fiſh; the
which I readily embraceing; the great
Maſtiff Dog (a greater and fiercer than
which I never ſaw) lying under the Table;
and ſeeing me ſtretch out my Hand, to reach
the Plate; bounc'd out of a ſudden, lays
hold on me, and pull'd me to him, under
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54102:12"/>
the Table; Catches hold of my Head, the
which he had wholly in his Mouth at one
bit, up to my very Throat. The Gentleman
aſtoniſhed hereat, and well knowing the
diſpoſition, and uncontroulableneſs of the
Dog (there being but one in all the Family,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) the Cook, of whom the Dog ſtood
in fear,) runs forth, crys out, for <hi>Richard</hi>
the Cook in all haſte; for the Dog, <hi>Lion,</hi>
was worrying the Child in the Common-Hall.
The Cook at length entering the
Room, to which the Gentleman directed
him, Tingled a Bell, which he always uſed
to do, when he corrected that Dog, when a
Puppy, crying out (vehemently) <hi>Lion,</hi>
come off, Sirrah. The great Dog, which
had almoſt made an end of me; goes off,
leaving me weltering in my Blood: My
Head (eſpecially my Face) all over Dy'd
in Blood; which cauſed great and amazing
Fear in all that ſaw me in that ſad Condition,
that my Eyes were Gnawed out; untill they
Waſhed my Face, the which when they
had done; they perceived that my Eyes
were untouched: The reaſon of which (as
was Judged by all) being that the Dog,
had gotten my Head ſo far into his Mouth,
that his Teeth could not reach my Eyes.
Thus did God keep and preſerve me, in this
apparent and eminent Danger, there being
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54102:12"/>
no other harm done me, ſave that there
remains ſtill ſeveral holes, or impreſſions
made by the Dogs Teeth, in my Noſe, and
other places in my Face, the which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Grave can deface and wear
out.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Deliverance effected for me
(by Divine Providence) was, ſaving me
from Drowning. The manner of it was
thus, As I was in Company with one of my
Aunts, in the Park, where ſtands a great
Pool of Water, called the Horſe Pool, where
the Horſes uſed to be Watered. My Aunt
earneſtly employ'd, about ſome fine ſmall
Cloaths (a Suit of Child-Bed Linnen, if I
forget not) and leaving me to my liberty,
to ramble while ſhe managed her own Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
I drew near to the Pool, and lying
down on the Banks brink, with my Face
to the Water, and ſeeing ſome Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as ſmall as a Horſe Hair, crawling in
the Water, and within my Arms reach (as
I thought) I longing to catch ſome of them,
put my Hand into the Water, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
them, forced my Body forward,
that I could not recover my ſelf again,
before I ſunk down from the Bank in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Water, with my Head down, and
my Heels up, the Water entering into my
Body at my Mouth and other parts. My
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54102:13"/>
Aunt miſſing me, ſhe looks about and call
for me, but neither ſeeing nor hearing me,
ſhe leaves her Cloaths; and runs to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pool, (of which ſhe was jealous), and
there ſhe finds me with my Heels up in the
Pool, gone almoſt out of her reach into the
Depth, ſhe in an exceeding fright, about
me, takes the Water (to her own
great hazard) and catching faſt hold by one
of my Legs, ſhe pulls me to her, and ſo
brings me out of the Water, but with very
ſmall hopes of my Life; for I had been ſo
long in the Water, and the Water having
gotten in ſuch abundance into my Body,
that for a conſiderable time, ſhe could not
perceive the leaſt breathing in me, which
made her conclude I was Dead; but it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God that I Revived again. Now Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
think ſeriouſly with thy ſelf, how near
I was to a paſſing from one deep, to another,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) from that deep Pool of Water, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bottomleſs depth of an endleſs Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Oh! The Adoreable and unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
depth of Gods Incomprehenſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
Oh! Think of this Providence,
and give the Glory of the Deliverance to
God.</p>
               <p>Another ſtrange and wonderful eſcape I
had, was from a dangerous Boar. It was
thus, One day, my Eldeſt brother (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54102:13"/>
a Counſellor at Law, but now in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity)
and I walking down to the Sea-ſide,
with a Gray-Hound along with us, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Sport by Courſing Rabbets. In the
way, the Gray-Hound meeting with a little
Pig, which belonged to my Fathers Herd
of Swine. This Pig running away from
the Gray-Hound, the Gray-Hound follows,
takes hold of the Pig, the Pig cryes out,
(all the Herd which was near Fourſcore)
comes in to the relief of the Pig; I haſtned
to get the Dog off, by calling and beating,
but the more I belaboured me, in getting
the Dog off, the faſter the Dog held his
hold; the whole Herd in a Ring about me,
and the Gray-Hound with open Mouth,
which cauſed ſome fear in me, at the length
while I was beating off the Dog, the great
Boar with open Mouth makes at me, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up with his Fore-Feet on my Breaſt,
throws me on my Back, between two Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:
The Boar thus on the Top of me,
with his Snout and fearful Tuſhes, bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
himſelf, to rent my Bowels out;
the Gray-Hound which before I could not
for my Life get off from the Pig) of his
own accord, lets go the Pig, and comes in
to my Reſcue; laying faſt hold of the Boar,
which was at top of me, the Boar feeling
the Dog pinch him, he turns furiouſly about
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54102:14"/>
to the Dog, quitting the hold he had of
me, only one ſide of my Coat, he
tore clear away, and had it in his Tuſhes
when he turned from me to the Dog. As
ſoon as I felt the weight off my Body, I got
up in a great and amazing Fright, I made
my eſcape, by running, leaving the Boar
and the Dog to Fight it out. Thus was I
preſerved by the Providence of God; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the Dog (which before, I with
all my Skill and Strength, could not get off)
ſhould quit his hold of the little Pig, and
fall on the great Boar, upon me; who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(undoubtedly) had torn out my Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
Oh! Wonderful Providence.</p>
               <p>Another Eminent Deliverence wrought
by Providence for me, was by preſerving
me from periſhing by a Horſe. Which take
thus, I being once choſen to ride a Horſe,
which was to run a Race, the Ground was
ſingled and meaſured out, all other matters
relating to the Race being agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Parties chiefly concern'd;
when we came to ſtart, the concernedneſs
of each party appear'd in ſtriving to get,
and keep the ſtart, the which happened to
ſucceed well on my ſide, as touching getting
the ſtart, and making good my Ground, till
I came to the Goal, which Iſſued in great
and high Acclamations of Praiſe to me;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54102:14"/>
which did not a little fill me with vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conceit, of ſome Perſonal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of my own; to which the Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
was Attributed. But my Pride was
ſoon ſtain'd: for, there being a River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Town and the Place, where the
Race was Run; my Horſe being very hard
mouth'd, and withall fiery and fleet (tho'
ſmall) I was not able with all the skill and
ſtrength I had, to bear him, after I came
to the Goal; but in full Speed makes ſtreight
to the Town, taking the River, which lay
between him and Home: As ſoon as he
came into the deep, he was taken off his
Speed, and fell into ſuch a jumbling Trot,
that being almoſt ſpent, and wearied in all
my Senſes, he throws me out of the Saddle,
and being caſt on the left ſide of the Horſe,
my Foot ſlipt into the Stirup, and by the
Foot was I held; the Horſe finding himſelf
paſt the River, ſets to running with full
ſpeed, my Head touching the Ground, and
as he run, my head was ſtill a toſſing and
beating between the Horſes Feet, and the
Stones and Gravel of the hight which he
run up from the River, towards the end of
my Fathers Mault-Houſe, which may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Sevenſcore Yards; all which Ground
he trail'd me after him, with my head as
already mentioned. The Shout and Cry
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54102:15"/>
was raiſed from the other ſide of the River
to the Town (and the Horſe ſtill in his full
Speed) it pleaſed God, that the Neighbour
who lived next houſe to my Fathers, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a vehement and continued Cry; ariſes
from his work within, opens his Door,
ſtreet way, to ſee what the Matter was,
and Juſt as he lookt out of his Door, he
ſees the Horſe in full Speed, with his Rider
a Trailing along, juſt paſſing by the Door,
the man Immediately runs before him
(the Paſſage being narrow) uſeing his beſt
endeavours and skill to ſtop the Horſe; the
which he (through Mercy) he Effected, or
elſe that Race had been an end of my Race,
the Horſe ſtood ſtock ſtill while I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from that ſad Confinement. All who
ſaw me, cry'd out, he is gon! he is gon!
there is no hope, nor expectation of his
Life, the Hair of my Head all in one lump
of clotted Blood, nothing to be ſeen of my
Face or Hands, but Blood, and a matter
of aſtoniſhment it was to all, that my Neck
and Limbs were not broken.</p>
               <p>Another ſtrange Deliverance I had from a
Horſe, was thus, Riding one day on the
Chief and Fleeteſt Race Horſe, which was
known to be in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
As I paſt through a Gate, in the High-Road,
juſt as I opened, and entred in at the Gate,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54102:15"/>
a little Bird flies out of the Hedge, within
ſide of the Gate, at which the Horſe ſtarted,
Beginning at the ſame time to bounce, and
plunge, ſtriving all he could to throw me off;
I Riding bare Backed, without a Saddle,
and having a large Lanthorn under my left
Arm; knowing the Horſe to be very high
Mettled, and about Fifteen Hands High; I
I began to apprehend ſome danger, of his
getting me off; becauſe, I could not ſo well
Command and Manage him, by reaſon of
that Lanthorn, and wanting a Saddle, I did
what I could by faire; and gentle means, to
take him off thoſe his unruly, and skittiſh
tricks, but to ſmall purpoſe. Then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to uſe another Method, (<hi>viz.</hi>) By
giving him a looſe Rein, and a Spur in his
ſides, with both Heels, hoping by that
means that he would ceaſe pluneging, and
fall to running, but nothing would do. The
thing (I doubt not) being determin'd in
Heaven's Councel; that this narrow eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
might be Recorded among the reſt
of his Wonders ſhewn in, and about the
preſervation of ſo Poor, and Inconſiderable
a Creature as I am, to the Eternal Praiſe of
Gods Sweet and Unſearchable Providence.
Off he would have me, in order whereto, he
mounts up with his Fore Parts, throwing
me backwards on his Hinder Parts, and from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54102:16"/>
thence to his Fore Parts again, at leaſt ten
or twelve times, in a moſt furious, raging
manner; at length finding that he could not
get me off, by his toſſing and throwing me
backward and forward) he rears and mounts
up with all four together (a conſiderable
height from the Earth) and by that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
motion, threw me a good height
above himſelf, and falling to the Ground,
ſtanding upright on my Feet, as I fell, with
my Lanthorn under my Arm, the Horſe
perceiving himſelf Conqueror, fetched a
ſtroak at me (ſtanding where I fell, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him) with his Heels; which (but a day
or two before) had been Shod with Froſt-Nails
(the Weather being Froſty) and in
the Cap, which I at that time wore, he
leaves the Print of the Froſt-Nails, within
the thickneſs of a Half Crown of my Fore-Head,
never touching my Head nor any part
of my Body: Nor in the leaſt prejudicing
my Body, by thoſe toſſings and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he gave me. Oh! That I might be
duly ſenſible of, and Conſtantly affected
with, the conſideration of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Another eſcape I had by the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, was from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man,
who had laid a Conſpiracy with ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Papiſts, to ſwear me out of my Life. It
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54102:16"/>
was thus, This <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man (by Name <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van
Grundy</hi> a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Man) being ſome
Years Employ'd in the Service of <hi>John
Preſton</hi> of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Alderman,
a good and gracious Man, lately Deceaſed;
from whom the above Named <hi>Evan Grundy</hi>
had run away, at ſeveral times, and with
conſiderable Sums of Mony: by reaſon of
his diſhoneſt and knaviſh Pranks, Alderman
<hi>Preſton,</hi> not daring to truſt him any further
with the Receiving of his Rents, which
were conſiderable (his Eſtate being nigh
two thouſand <hi>per Annum.</hi>) The Alderman
being hard ſet for one whom he could truſt
with the management of his Eſtate: and
knowing me, my Family, and the preſent
Circumſtances I was at that time in; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to me conſiderable encouragement,
on condition that I would undertake (as
his Agent) to manage his Eſtate, which I
did, for between four and five Years, not
without many difficulties, (occaſioned
chiefly by the ſaid <hi>Evan Grundy,</hi> who was
reſtleſs Day and Night, contriving how he
might ſet the Alderman and me at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
hoping (by that means) to ſupplant
me, and to Succeed me in the Employ.)
This <hi>Evan Grundy</hi> being much Indebted to
the Alderman, I had orders to take him, on
a Writ out of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54102:17"/>
Seize (for the Aldermans uſe) all the Good
and Chattels the ſaid <hi>Evan Grundy</hi> was
actually Poſſeſſed of. This peice of Service
I would fain have declined, entreating
the Alderman to put ſome other upon it, and
that, becauſe of the ill Aſpect which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
it would have among the Gentlemen of
the Country; who (knowing the Peaks and
many Bickerings between the other and
me) would be very apt to conclude, that I
had Acted this, in a way of Revenge againſt
him, who daily ſtrove to Supplant me in
that Employ: and then I concluded all the
Black-Mouth'd Juſtices, and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Country, who were known E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the Name and Power of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Purity, would unanimouſly open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Religion, and Improve that Action
to the utmoſt, to the Reproach of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The which, afterward fell out as I
feared: The Alderman refuſing, to comply
with that my (but reaſonable) Requeſt,
he alledging, for his non-compliance with
me, that he had none but me whom he
could truſt in an Affair of that Nature.</p>
               <p>Finding the Ineffectualneſs of my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to prevail with the Alderman, to
Excuſe or Exempt me from that Service;
and his ſtrict Commands being Inſtant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, a Writ was taken out, of which the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54102:17"/>
ſaid <hi>Grundy</hi> having notice he Abſconds (for
a time,) on this, I took the two ſpecial
Bayliffs, who were to Execute the Writ) with
nine or ten of the Village he lived in, into
the Houſe, along with me, to Witneſs that
I Seized thoſe Goods, which were Viſible
in the Houſe, for the uſe of Alderman
<hi>Preſton,</hi> and that for the non-payment of
Rent: I mov'd no Goods, but left them,
where I found them, leaving them to the
Diſpoſal of the Alderman. Immediately,
on this, the wretched Man contrives with
ſome Papiſt Ruſſians, to lay a Plot againſt
me, the Subſtance of which was, that on
a Day I entred his Houſe, to Diſtrain for
ſuch a Man, naming Alderman <hi>Preſton,</hi>
and meeting with a Cabinet, I forc'd the
Lock, and Stole <hi>Three Pound Fifteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
which he ſaid his Witneſſes would
poſitively Swear they ſaw me to Reckon
and put into my Pocket: forthwith he Rides
to a Juſtice of Peace, for a Warrant to Bind
me over, acquainting the Juſtice with the
whole of the concern (in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.)
The Juſtice (tho' Enemy enough
on the Account of Religion,) told him
plainly, that he would not grant a Warrant
againſt me, if he would give him <hi>Five
Hundred Pounds.</hi> He goes to a Second, to
a Third, and to a Fourth, about the ſame
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54102:18"/>
Errand, but from none of them could he
get a Warrant to Bind me over, they being
all affraid to meddle at that time with me,
whether for fear of my Uncle, who was at
that time <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or from any reſtraint from
God on their Spirits, I do not know. He
finding all his Hopes (of having me for ever
diſgraced, if not Arraigned for my Life,)
fruſtrated, Prepares a Bill of Indictment
to Arraign me at my Uncles Barr the
Term next enſuing,. This Aſſault (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs)
was a great Tryal of the little Faith,
and Patience, which the Gift of God handed
out to my Poor Soul, in the inſtant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
as ever I have ſince met with.
I have ſometimes (with Holy <hi>David</hi>
thought, that my Mountain (in reſpect of
Inward and Settled Peace of Concience)
ſhould never be ſhaken or mov'd, till this
Storm aroſe. And albeit it did not influence
my Soul inwardly, to ſhake my Comfort
and Confidence in God, God and my own
Conſcience, knowing mine Integrity, and
Innocency, in the thing laid to my Charge.
Yet Conſidering the Reproach, which I
apprehended would hence ariſe, to the
Name, Goſpel, and People of God; the
Stain and Scandal it would be to my whole
Family:) no Man can fully conceive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54102:18"/>
and ſhame, which took up its
Lodging in my Breaſt. Oh! the toſſings and
workings of my Spirit: Lord think I!
What will this come to? Thou knoweſt
mine Innocency in this Matter. But the
World will readily Believe I am Guilty.
Blaſphemy, and ſad Reproach, will hence
Redound to thy Moſt Holy, and Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Name and Goſpel; which I value
(unſpeakably) more than my Life, and all
the World. The truly Godly and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
(the only Men of my delight) will
(with ſad Hearts) often think, how ſadly
they were miſtaken in me, what to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this Storm would Iſſue in any other,
than what I have already expreſt, I could
not Imagine. The guiltleſs Bluſhes which
daily on this occaſion appear'd in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
I concluded would be to all that
ſaw me, an Argument of my Guilt. The
thoughts of the Term approaching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
the Inward Preturbation of my
Mind; and the Bluſhings of my Face, to
think I muſt ſtand Arraigned for Felony
before a Judge, and all my other Relations
who but a few Years before, had unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cenſured, Condemned, and caſt me out of
their Favours and Affections, for being a
<hi>Phanatick,</hi> (as they term True and Goſpel
Religion.) Oh! How cloſe this went;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54102:19"/>
ſecretly wiſhing (but ſtill with humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to God) that he would pleaſe either
to break that horrid Plot, before I came to
be publickly Arraign'd as a Malefactor, or
elſe call me off, by Death; which I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably
prefer before living to be a cauſe
of Reproach and Blaſphemy, to the Name
and Religion of the Moſt High God. As
the Term drew very near, and the various
and reſtleſs toſſing of my mind on that
Account encreaſed, God (Infinitely Wiſe,
and ever faithful to his Word) who beſt
knows how to time Deliverance, and break
thoſe Nets, in which the Enemies hope to
catch the Innocent He (a very ſhort ſpace
before the Term) lets looſe the Reins to
this wicked Mans Guilty Conſcience, which
wrought ſo violently with him, that all the
ſtrength of Reaſon in him, yea, the hopes
he inwardly cheriſhed, of ſeeing me brought
to perpetual Diſgrace, (if not cut off)
were not able to reſtrain him from treading
the Foot ſteps of <hi>Judas.</hi> A Rope he gets,
out he goes to his own Garden in the dusk
of the Evening, and having faſtned the
Rope about his Neck, juſt as he was drawing
the end of the Rope through the Arm of
a Tree, on which he deſigned to Hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
his Wife and his Man happened to
diſcover what he was about: On this, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54102:19"/>
Shout was up, and ſuch a Cry made, as did
preſently bring about him all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who (over powering him) prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his intended deſign. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their cutting the Rope, yet could they
have no acceſs to that Guilty Conſcience of
his, to aſſwage or allay the horrible and ſelf
Condemning Agonies; which like reſtleſs
Waves and Billows did diſtract and torment
his Soul. He being by force ſtretched on
his Bed, and with the ſame Rope he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to Hand himſelf, being faſt bound
to the Bed, he fell into raging and deſperate
Fits, like to a <hi>Demoniack,</hi> daſhing his Head
with all his force againſt the Bed-Stock,
Foaming at the Mouth, uttering theſe
Words, as faſt, (and with a ſtrange vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
which Frighted all the By-ſtanders)
as he could, (<hi>viz.) I drive away Cows, I
Sell Cows: No, I drove away no Cows, I
Sold no Cows:</hi> Roger Eckerſley, <hi>and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Stopford, <hi>will give under their Hands
that I am an honeſt man</hi> And ſo in raging
Madneſs, expired his laſt Breath, with theſe
Words in his dying Mouth, <hi>I drove no Cows
away, I Sold no Cows;</hi> which were the laſt
Words he ſpoke. The Reader muſt know,
that before this Plot deſigned againſt my
Life and Reputation; the ſame Poor
Wretch Commenced a Law Suit againſt me,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54102:20"/>
or which he had not the leaſt appearance of
Reaſon; ſave, what he, and ſome others
(as deſperately Wicked as himſelf) had
contrived, and which was ſtoutly ſworn,
by an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt Witneſs, for but one poor
Quart of Ale) againſt me, at the Aſſizes
held in the County where he and I Lived.
God knows, I no more knew any thing of
what he Charged againſt me in his Civil
Bill, then I knew of the <hi>Three Pound Fifteen
Shillings,</hi> for which he deſigned to Arraign
me. But ſo it was, that upon the Evidence
poſſitively Swearing, a Decree was Granted
for <hi>Seven Pound,</hi> which was the Sum menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in his Bill: The Decree (contrary to
promiſe) being on a ſudden, (while I was
from Home, about Buſineſs) Executed, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Prime Milch Cows of my Stock where
taken away, and in half an Hours time Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed,
and Sold for <hi>Seven Pounds;</hi> tho'
the Cows in the Judgment of all that knew
them, and who underſtood Cattel, were
really worth <hi>Thirty Pounds</hi> between Brother
and Brother. And thus it pleaſed God, in
the Wonder working Providence of his,
to break theſe Nets, which the Devil (by
his Inſtruments) laid, not only for my Life,
but alſo for my Credit and Reputation.
I do not in the leaſt doubt, but the great
Advantage which the Devil propoſed to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54102:20"/>
himſelf) by putting thoſe Miſcreants on
Work to bring my Name and Perſon into
the blackeſt Contempt, was to overthrow
the efficacy of my Miniſtry, when I ſhould
be thereto called: For the Devil knew very
well, how importunate Godly Miniſters,
and others were with me, to take on me
that great Work of the Miniſtry: And ſore
gueſſes (no doubt) he had, how greatly I
ſhould be Employ'd in diſturbing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
being in a great meaſure made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Lion and Fox like Devices,
ſeveral Years before I was prevailed with to
adventure on ſo Great and Sacred a Work.</p>
               <p>Many more Strange Deliverances hath the
Providence of God wrought for me, his
Poor unworthy Creature: The which, I am
Neceſſitated to Omit, fearing my Book
ſhould Swell to too great a Bulk. I heartily
wiſh that both my ſelf, and others, who
Read what I have Faithfully and Impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Related, of the Wonders of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards me, might be ſo rightly
Affected with what I have Related, as to
give God the Glory and Praiſe of his own
Works: And be (by Reading theſe things)
ſtirr'd up, and Encouraged for ever, to truſt
in that Adorable Providence of Heaven,
which never fails them who belong to
Chriſt.</p>

               <p>WHen I was between Fourteen and
Fifteen Years of Age, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
(as near as I can Remember) the
Lord was pleaſed to dart ſome beginnings
of Convictions into my Soul. Which was
after this manner, One <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> as I
was in the Height of Vigour, in Profaning
God's Holy Day; with the Rude and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Papiſts, there was darted into my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(like an affrightning flaſh of Lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from above) this Apprehenſion, and
Thought, (<hi>Viz.</hi>) That I muſt be either
Converted, or elſe ſent to Hell to be
Damned. This Arrow being Shot out of
his Bow, who never miſſeth the Mark at
which he Shoots; took up its Lodging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me: But what to make of it, or what
the meaning of it ſhould be, I was as far to
ſeek as a Beaſt; ſo Ignorant and Bruitiſh was
I, the Lord knows. But though I knew not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54102:21"/>
from whence it came, or what its Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
would be; yet, being a Meſſenger from
God, it maintained its Ground, ſtuck cloſe
by me, accompanied me whereever I went,
putting me ſometimes into a Sweat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into inward Shiverings of Soul, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into diſtracting and perplexing Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Thoughts, what it ſhould be.
Be ſent to Hell (think I) Lord! What's
that? And be Damn'd, Bleſs me! (think
I:) What's this to be Damn'd? Dear
Reader! Believe me, I had Read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Words Hell, and Damn'd, with
the term Converted: But no more did I
underſtand the Senſe, or the meaning of
the one or the other, of thoſe three Words,
than a Beaſt. At length, I began (in my
Thoughts) to fix on ſomething, what this
ſtrange thing ſhould be, or mean. And the
Reſult came to this, I did Conceive, and
ſtrongly Apprehend, that Hell and Damn'd,
were ſome ugly, frightful, and dangerous
thing, to the which, ſhould I be brought, I
ſhould be a ſad, and undone Creature for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
As for the other, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Converted,
I did verily think, it meant no more, than
the leaving off, or ceaſing from, thoſe Mad
and Youthful Pranks, of Prophaning the
<hi>Sunday,</hi> (as I then called the <hi>Lord's Day),</hi>
with ſeveral other Immoralities to which I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54102:22"/>
been exceedingly and wretchedly adicted:
and in the ſtead or room, of thoſe vain and
wretched Practiſes, to fall upon a ſerious,
and ſober Living. Both of which, I fully
concluded, lay within the compaſs of my
own Free-Will, and Natural Power to
effect.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, I fell to Work; Deſerting
and throwing off, both my Wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and alſo my dearly beloved Sports
and ſinful Paſtimes. To the <hi>Bible,</hi> and
<hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> (a Book I dearly Lov'd)
I Adreſt my ſelf, with all Imaginable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and Seriouſneſs. And being fully
reſolved on a thorow Work of Converſion,
that ſo I might ſhun and eſcape Hell; and
being Damn'd. I became very Bookiſh,
Looking into (almoſt) every Book, where
ever I came; to try, whether I could meet
with any help; which might forward me
in my new Trade of Religion: Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Books, wherewith I met, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
<hi>Call to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Converted</hi> came into my
Hands, the which I did no ſooner open, but
its Title Page invited my Fancy, to make
choice of it, for my chief Companion; the
which I alſo did, Bleſſing my ſelf in that
Book, more than with any other wherewith
I had met; the more, and oftener I Read it,
the more was I Enamor'd with it: even to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54102:22"/>
a preferring it before Gods own Sacred
Book. So ſuited, was it, to the Purpoſe I
had then Engaged in, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to Work out
(of my ſelf, and in my own Strength) that
great Work of Converſion. To my courſe
of Reading and Praying (by thoſe Forms
of Prayer in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and
<hi>Practice of Piety,</hi>) I joined very ſtrict, and
ſevere Faſting. Taking up a Reſolution
that I would in a moſt Solemn manner, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
two Days in every Week (<hi>viz.)
Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> for my Faſting Days:
The which I alſo did; even to ſuch a degree
of Phariſaicall ſeverity, that I almoſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
my Body unfit for any Service. But
Converted I muſt be, and Converted I was
Reſolved to be, whatever it coſt me; in
order whereto, I kept my Religious doings
of Duty both Negatively and Poſitively,
with ſuch a Conſtant and Zealous elaborate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that I verily believe, it would be
hard to find one, among the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Monks,
who could (in all reſpects) match me, or
out do me, at the Trade of Serving God,
in that way I fell in with.</p>
               <p>It can hardly be told, (much leſs believed)
how great Zeal I had for God, and how reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
my Active, and Working Spirit was,
to be with him in Heaven. Tho' I neither
knew God (according to Truth) nor the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54102:23"/>
way to him, no more than a Poor Pagan,
who never heard of him. I had ſuch low,
groſs and carnal Thoughts, and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Deity, that I am very apt to
conclude, the very Heathen had far Higher
and more Sublimate Conceptions, of their
Fictitious Gods; that I had of that Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
and unconceiveably Glorious God,
whom I ſo Ignorantly Worſhipt. I was
wonderfully Zealous, in all Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
wherein I did (at any time) En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage;
both in Private, and alſo in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
In my Private Duties, I was Marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
Retired and Secret. Being full of
Apprehenſions how ill Conſtructions would
(by all ſorts) be put upon my ſo Severe and
Strict way of Living: and for better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
whereof, I ſingled out a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place; then which I thought no
place better for my turn and purpoſe. It
was in a little Room, on the Top of the
Caſtle, wherein my Father Lived. In that
Room I ſpent the moſt of my time, in Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Praying, and Reading my Books; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
my Darling, and chief Admired
and Beloved Book, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s
<hi>Call to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Converted.</hi> When I found my
ſelf much wearied with Reading, I would
ſometimes divert my ſelf, by walking on
the Topp of the Caſtle; during which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54102:23"/>
I did often hear the Shouts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing
Calls of my Wicked Companions,
to bring me back again, to my newly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
Sports, and ſinful Paſtime. It was
no ſmall Matter to encounter with the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Nature, and the violent Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Devil, both joining together,
in Suggeſting and Framing Arguments to
induce, to a willing and ready compliance,
with thoſe Calls and Invitations, to what I
Lov'd and lik'd, as dearly as the daily Food
I Liv'd by. Oh! the ſtrange workings which
I found in my ſelf, during thoſe Combates.
The Ungodly (whoſe Company I had Lov'd
and delighted in ſo dearly) Calling and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting:
The ſtrong Bent and inclination of
the Fleſh drawing: And a ſubtil and violent
Devil Tempting, and Perſwading to return.
What! Forſake thy dear Companions, and
thy ſweet delightful Sports, and Pleaſures
at this Rate? What! To Game or Sport
no more for ever? Alaſs! Poor Wretch:
What good wilt thou get by betaking thy
ſelf to this Penſive, Sad, and Melancholly
kind of Life? Thou haſt had Experience
of the Sweetneſs and delightfulneſs of that
way of Living, which thou art now forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
The many and ſore Miſeries, and
Troubles attending this new courſe of Life
which thou art ſo fond of, and on which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54102:24"/>
thou art ſo reſolutly bent, do not yet
appear in their black and formidable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
therefore be wiſe in time, go back to
thy deſerted Companions, and freely Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
thy forſaken Sports and Pleaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou be'ſt too far gon, in this fond and
dangerous way thou art gotten into: Or
elſe, thou wilt Repent when it is too late.
Beſides theſe aſſaults from the Devil, and
the continual ebullitions of my ſtinking and
vile Nature, which did frequently ſurround
me, with new and freſh Attacks, to draw
me back again. I met with new (and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt
for) Diſcouragements, from my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
who (taking notice of the great
and ſtrange Change, which evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in me) frequently aſſail'd my weak
and poor beginnings, in Piety and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with hard Speeches and unbecoming
Language againſt that preciſe and ſevere
courſe of Life, I had ſo lately embraced,
telling me (with great aſſeverations) that
I ſhould moſt certainly, bring my ſelf to
downright Madneſs; by Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſo much.</p>
               <p>Note Reader, and Oſerve, (by the way)
how great an Antipathy there is in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and in Unregenerate Sinners, to the
Sacred Scriptures, a ſure Argument that
they are the Pure, and Infallible Word of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54102:24"/>
God. Theſe things (accompanied with
innumerable Mocks, Taunts, and Jeers,
which on all occaſions were heaped on my
Name, and Practice proved ſome occaſion
of ſtartling and diſcouragement to me.</p>
               <p>But the fixt apprehenſions I had of being
ſent to Hell, to be Damned, in Caſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
not, and continued a Convert; did
abundantly out-do, all the oppoſitions
which lay (or met me) in my way of ſtrict
and Religious Living. On I went (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the many and great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I found my ſelf encompaſſed with) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
and encreaſing, rather than (any
way) declining or abating: either in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Ardent Zeal in doing them. My
proficiency in Morality, and the advances
I made in Zeal fo the Church and the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
and Service thereof; were ſo Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and manifeſt, that I became the talk
of almoſt all ſorts, eſpecially thoſe who
ſtood Related to my Family. Letters and
Perſons, who paſt to and fro; giving an
Account (in City and Country) what a
ſtrange alteration, and admirable change
appeared in their Couſen <hi>J. B.</hi> and what
a great and wonderful Practiſer of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
he was become. This was ſo noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that I could ſcarce look, or ſpeak;
or paſs in, or out where People were, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54102:25"/>
I had ſomewhat or other, brought into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning my forwardneſs, and Zeal
in Religion. And notwithſtanding I was
(at that time) but an Hypocritical Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
and a Painted Legaliſt, (knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Covenant of
Grace, not ſo much as in the Notion) yet I
was frequently troubled, and exceedingly
aſhamed, to hear mention made of my
Activity, and Zeal; in Serving and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
God. So far was I from either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
or deſiring to make the World
privy to my Intentions of Going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And that which ſpeaks the thing the
more ſtrange, is, to conſider the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Time and Place; neither of
which afforded any thing, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the leaſt part of a Motive, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
to put me on looking towards,
or ſo much as thinking of Converſion:
there being no Preaching in thoſe parts,
(the ordinary means by which Convictions
in order to Faith and Converſion, are
effected.) Nor yet the Example, or Advice
and Council of any Perſon, which might
occaſion in me, ſuch thoughts, or workings
of Soul.</p>
               <p>In this way, I contined for about Six or
Seven Years, after my firſt awakenings, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54102:25"/>
the Church, and its appointed
Service: and growing blind in Phariſaical
Zeal, for the Moral Law, and Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
Book: Until I had (in my own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
and conceit) arriv'd at a high pitch
of Confidence, that I was (beyond all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
really Converted, and that (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently)
I ſhould go to Heaven, and be
Saved. Yea, I did frequently reckon and
account, with my ſelf, that if but two in
the World, ſhould go to Heaven, I ſhould
certainly be one of the two. And that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
I was certainly Converted; and had
taken ſo much, and great pains, in doing
Good, and ſhunning Evil. I had no Fear
or Jealouſy lodg'd in me, about Gods
accepting my Perſon: And his having
regard, to my numerous, and zealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of Duty; both Private and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>My Extraordinary Inclinations to the
Miniſtry; and that matchleſs Zeal which
appear'd in me, for the Church; that Love
and Veneration I had, for its Liturgie, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and Clergie, eſpecially its Prelacy;
gave my Father and other Relations, great
hopes that I ſhould be an Honour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
and a Man of no ordinary Figure, in
the Orb of the Church.</p>

               <p>WHen I was about Twenty One Years

of my Zeal, in Proſecuting that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
(conſiſting of that Negative, and
Poſitive Obedience) which the Law Moral
enjoyns and requires; as the condition of

me; to the end I might be Inſtructed, and
fully convinc'd, how vain my Confidence of
being Sav'd, and going to Heaven, in that
ſelf pleaſing way of Legal Righteouſneſs
was. The manner of it was thus, being on
the Day, called <hi>Eaſter Monday,</hi> at my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral

Lov'd and Venerated; than any Place in
the World beſides; For that I verily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
(in my ſelf) it was as the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

to have been (at that time) a very incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent

the middle of the Sermon, as near as I
could gueſs; there was darted into my
mind, this ſad and killing Thought, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that I had (the day before) Received the
Sacrament unworthily; which ſad Thought
was back'd with that of, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 29
For he that Eateth and Drinketh unworthily,
Eateth and Drinketh Damnation to himſelf,
not deſcerning the Lords Body.</hi>

and an undone man. My Spirit was in ſuch
an amazing Fright, and over whelming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation,
to think, that I was (moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly)
Damn'd, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes:
that indeed, I verily thought, all
the People in the place, were a ſwarm, or a
Legion of Devils, which God (in revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wrath) had ſent from the Bottomleſs
Pit, to guard, and attend my Guilty Soul
thither. The apprehenſions I had of being
Damn'd, and ſent to Hell; ſo rack'd, and
tormented my Spirit, that I found my ſelf
unable to ſtay, till Sermon was ended. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
I ran out of that Place; to ſhun (as I
then thought,) thoſe ſwarms of Devils,
which I ſtrongly conceived, were to guard
me to Hell. As ſoon as I came to my
Lord of <hi>Santry</hi>'s (where I then Liv'd) I
entered my Chamber, with a ſad, and heavy
Heart (God knows;) to my Knees I go,
with an intent to Pray, if ſo be, there
might be any ſcrap of Hope, of my eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
being Eternally Damn'd. But alaſs!
What Tongue or Pen can Relate, the Paſs,
and condition I was then at: My Reaſon,
my Conſcience, and my very Speech, were,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54102:27"/>
as it were Plung'd and Drown'd, in the
Gulph of Deſpair; ſo that I could neither
utter a Word in Prayer, nor yet conſider
what I ſhould do, to Relieve my Bleeding
Soul, in that ſore diſtreſs. I durſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in my Chamber; fearing to ſee and feel
the Devils (actually) to Seize me. To the
Miniſter of the Pariſh I went, (from
whoſe Hands I Received the Sacrament but
the Day before,) not knowing but that he
might Adminiſter ſome kind of Relief, to
one in my condition. He obſerving the
gaſtlineſs of my Looks, and taking notice
that ſomewhat ailed me, he asked me how I
did; to which I could not Reply. He
preſſing to know what the matter was; I at
length, in a very abrupt and broken manner,
told him, that I was full of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and fears, that I was a Damn'd Man;
and that there was no hopes of Mercy, for
ſuch a one as I was.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter ſomewhat ſurprized, at ſo
ſudden, and ſo great a Change; ſince, but
the Day before, he began to Examin what
great and heinous Sins, one of my Age,
and one in ſo encouraging Circumſtances,
(as I was in) could be guilty of; which
ſhould occaſion ſuch ſad Deſpair: He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ſome Texts of Scriptures, thereby
hoping to have given ſome Relief, to my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54102:28"/>
weary gaſping Soul, but all in vain; God's
time of Healing me being not yet come.
And finding by my frequent coming to him,
for Eaſe and Comfort, to how little purpoſe
he had laboured with me; he (at length)
adviſed me, to Ride into the Country, to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
my Father and other Relations; and by
that means, as alſo by Exerciſing my ſelf,
with ſuch Exerciſe as I formerly delighted
in, as Shooting with the Gun, and Angling,
to divert my Melancholy Thoughts. This
I was glad to hear of, my own Inclinations
leading ſo ſtrongly to it: in order to the
effecting of which, I Addreſſed my ſelf, to
my Lord's Houſe-Keeper, entreating her
to acquaint my Lord, that in regard, of
ſome preſent Indiſpoſition, under which I
laboured; and in order to my Health, I had
not only an inclination, but was adviſed, to
Viſit my Father, in the Country: in order
whereto I thought it convenient to acquaint
his Lordſhip therewith, to the end, I might
obtain, not only his Lordſhips free conſent,
but alſo the liberty of a Horſe, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my intended Journey. The Houſe-Keeper,
no ſooner delivered my requeſt to
my Lord, but my Lord Commands her to
call me up into his Chamber. As ſoon as
I received the Command, I fell (immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
into a great Sweat, and ſore Trembling,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54102:28"/>
up I went, and being entered into the
Chamber; my Lord Locks the Chamber
Door, and laying his Hat on a Cabinet, ſits
down in his Chair, and with an earneſt and
piercing Eye, looks on a pretty while before
he Speaks, I all the while ſweating and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
At length my Lord begins, with.
James <hi>what ails you? What is the matter?
I hear you go (privately) to Miniſters, there
is ſomewhat ails you. What is it?</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
(by my Lord's Diſcourſe) that the
Miniſter of the Pariſh, had acquainted
my Lord, with my Caſe, I found my
ſelf far more uneaſie, than before. My
Sweat and Trembleings of Soul encreaſing
upon me: My Lord continued querying,
<hi>What ails you</hi> James, <hi>tell me what is the
matter?</hi> I was ſo overwhelm'd in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that my Speech was ſwallowed up, as
<hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 3. But my Lord not letting
me alone, but (with earneſt Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
preſſing to know what I ailed; I at
length, as a poor Condemn'd Caitiff, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a twine Thread over Hells Mouth,
Roared out, as if my Bowels had burſt
out of my Body: Crying with great and
unutterable Groans and Tears. My good
Lord, Dear my Lord, I am afraid, I am an
undone Creature, I am a Damn'd Man,
there is no Mercy for me. My Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54102:29"/>
(by my Looks and Speech,) that I
was in good earneſt wounded, with Tears
in his Eyes, and with the greateſt concerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for me; began to play the Spiritual
Phyſitian, asking me, with great earneſtneſs,
what groſs, and crying Sins, as Adultery,
Murther, and the like, could one of my
Years, be guilty of, as to occaſion my fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Deſpair of Mercy. And (ſaid my
Lord) admit you were guilty of ſuch, and
greater abominations, what Reaſon have
you for Deſpaire; you muſt know that Jeſus
Chriſt the Son of God, came into the
World, not to lay a Load on you, but to
take your Load off you. Quoting, <hi>Mat. 11.
29. Come unto me, all ye that are weary,
and heavy Laden, and I will give you
Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With many other Texts of Scriptures,
and comfortable Expreſſions, he laboured to
Relieve and Eaſe my burthened and ſinking
Soul, but all in vain, (God's time of curing
my deep and deſperate Wound, being not
come.) As touching my purpoſe, of going
into the Country, My Lord told me, I might
uſe my freedom, but that his Judgment and
Advice was, that it were better for me to
ſtay, than to go into the Country: and
that becauſe, of the great Diſadvantage,
which by going, would accrew to me, in my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54102:29"/>
Studies. My Lord, having declared his
Judgment, what had been beſt for me to do,
I told his Lordſhip I was reſolved to take his
Advice, what ever came of me: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
I did.</p>
               <p>My Sore continually raw, Day and Night,
and ceaſed not. Yea, my Soul refuſed to
be Comforted. According to that of the
<hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the like Caſe, <hi>Pſal. 77. 2. In
the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord, my
Sore ran in the Night, and ceaſed not: My
Sould refuſed to be Comforted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſeemed to follow, and to ply my Studies,
rather for Faſhion ſake, and for fear my
Lord, and my Father, ſhould ſuſpect that
I Loved Idleneſs, rather than any Love I
had thereto: or hopes that ever it would
turn to any Account, for good; to my ſelf,
or others.</p>
               <p>When at any time I look'd into a Book,
inſtead of heeding, or minding what was in
the Book, the Eye of my gnawing, guilty
Conſcience, was fixed on the many Sins I
had committed againſt God, inſomuch, that
all the Sins of my Youth, were in all their
black and aggravating Circumſtances; laid,
and held before me, as a Looking-Glaſs, to
ſhew me, what a monſtrous Sinner I was.
According to that of <hi>David, Pſal. 51. 3.
For I acknowledge my Tranſgreſſions, and my
Sin is ever before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:54102:30"/>
Endleſs were the Toſſings, and Rowlings
of my weary Soul, from one ſad confuſion
and deſpairing Thought, to another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
(almoſt) were the ſorry Prayers
(ſuch as they were) and other Duties, which
I daily Performed; to Keep, and Relieve
my Deſpairing Soul with; but all in vain.
Which cauſed me to conclude, that I had
been much wanting in the Trade of Works,
and that, had I not been ſo, I might have
been acquainted with Peace, and Comfort,
before now. To the Trade of doing, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
addreſt my ſelf; reſolving not to omit,
or leave undone any thing: which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
(by Reading or Hearing) to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Duty. Praying (underſtand by the
Book, for I knew no better) Reading, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and attending the moſt lively Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
frequenting Sacraments, giving
Alms to the Poor, of what Money my
Lord, and other Relations Handed out to
me. That Place in <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 7. was oft in my
Thoughts, according to which I gave away
whatever I got: yea, ſo addicted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Poor and Needy, was I, that I
would give away my very Apparel, when I
had no Money. And all this, from a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
and Superſtitious conceit, that by
thoſe Acts of Duty and Service, I ſhould
Recompence God, for thoſe Sins, which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54102:30"/>
(like a Mill-ſtone on the Back of a Man)
were ſinking my Soul, into the Gulph of
Deſparation.</p>
               <p>I did abound more and more, in Strict
and Circumſpect Walking, according to
do, and Live, the Condition, and Tenure
of the firſt Covenant of Works, under which
I was Labouring for Life: The more I
wrought at the Trade of Duty, the further
I found my ſelf from Peace: which did
cauſe me to Conclude, that my Caſe was
certainly deſperate, and that it was peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
my own: and that none that belong'd
to God, was ever in ſuch a condition, as I
found my ſelf to be in.</p>
               <p>I then renewed my old practice, of going
to Miniſters; acquainting them, with the
deplorable, and wretched State, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in; and earneſtly begg'd their
Advice and Council; what one in my ſad
Circumſtances had beſt to do, in order (if
it were poſſible) to eſcape Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
Oh! that killing Word Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!
When ever I Heard, Read, or
Thought of it, how did it Rack, and
Torment my Spirit? As fearing it would be
my Portion for ever.</p>
               <p>As the Principle from which I Acted, in
order to healing, and cure; was, Do and
Live. So thoſe Spiritual Phyſitians, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54102:31"/>
whom I Addreſt my ſelf, for Council and
Comfort, in this Deſpair of Soul; (being
as ignorant in the Miſtery of the New Birth,
as ever was <hi>Nicodemus,) Joh.</hi> 3. 4. They
put me on doing thoſe Duties, in and about
which, I had Laboured before, even to
wearineſs. The Names of thoſe Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Church to whom I Applied my
ſelf, together with what their ſayings were,
are too Tedious to Relate; and therefore,
I here paſs them by. Only I think fit, to
Acquaint the Reader, with the great and
ſuperlative Ingenuity, and dexterous Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
in healing a Sin-ſick Soul; which
one of them (above the reſt) had attain'd
to, to his Everlaſting Fame be it Spoken.
The Thing is thus.</p>
               <p>After I had acquainted the Biſhop, (for
of no lower a Degree was he) with the ſad,
and lamentable Condition, my Soul was in,
but he forthwith exhorts me, to get a Book
(Stil'd, <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi>) and when
I had got it, I ſhould come to him for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtructions. The Book I forthwith
procured, and to his Lord Biſhop I repair'd,
who finding that I had got the Book: Takes
it out of my Hand, and turning to a Prayer
appointed for one of the Nights in the
Week; with great earneſtneſs charged me,
that when I was ready to go to Bed, that I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54102:31"/>
be ſure to kneel down by my Bed-ſide, and
ſay that Prayer, the which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Lordſhips Directions. But
to how great purpoſe, I leave the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious,
and Experienced Chriſtian to
Judge.</p>
               <p>Having thus applied my ſelf, to ſeven or
eight, of the Ableſt, and moſt Fam'd of
the Fathers, and Dignitaries of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> (then in <hi>Dublin</hi>) and finding
by woful and ſad Experience, how little
they underſtood my Caſe, and how vaſtly
ſhort they prov'd in helping me, in my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
I concluded my Caſe to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſperate and hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>It is not to be told by Tongue, or Pen,
what Soul Conflicts and Agonies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
me, whereever I went, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I ſet about. Inſomuch that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
frequent and Familiar to me, in the
very Night Viſions. The Devil, Hell,
Damnation, with the manner how the
Wicked are handled in Hell; were things
very often preſented to my Phancy, in thoſe
ſhort and Tormenting Slumbers, whereinto
I fell. Yea, I have ſometimes Dreamt,
that I have ſeen, and felt my ſelf in Hell,
among the Damned, tumbling and ſinking
down deeper and deeper, feeling no Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
Which hath occaſioned me often to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54102:32"/>
think of <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe, of which he bitterly
complains. <hi>Job. 7. 14. Then thou ſcareſt
me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it was with <hi>Job,</hi> ſo it was with me,
when I had been even ſpent, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
and Temptations of the Day. I
thought ſometimes, and hoped at leaſt, that
my Bed and Sleep, would ſomething eaſe,
and leſſen my Pain, and inward horror of
Mind. But wo, and alaſs! I was never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
of the Fatigue of the Day, than I was
of the reſtleſs Toſſings of the Night. And
that becauſe, of thoſe Dreams and Viſions,
which (did as it were) realize the things
themſelves, to my Mind. The conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
into which thoſe Soul afflicting
Viſions did put me, did often ſtartle me
out of my Sleep, and cauſed in me reſtleſs
longings for Day-light: and that becauſe,
I could not employ my Thoughts about any
thing, but what had a Tendency to augment
my Deſpair and Miſery. My Thoughts
running out, and Fixing upon the Sins of
my Youth, thinking how many, and Black
they were: Calling to Mind, the Advances
I had formerly made in the way of Strict
and Zealous Religion; and what Methods
and Ways I had uſed, to get Healing and
Comfort, and all in Vain, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54102:32"/>
And that becauſe (as I concluded)
God had given me up, to be a Prey to the
Enemy. Sometimes in the Night when I
could not Seep, I heard Dogs howle, and
cry Pittiouſly, in the Cold Weather, this
I apprehended was a lively Repreſenting to
the Ear, the Skreeks and Roarings of the
Damned in Hell. Thus are they, in thoſe
Eternal Flames, and ſo ſhall I, e're long.
Oh! That I could but ſee one glimps of
the Morning Light! But wo is me, (Deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Forſaken of God,) I ſhall be with
the Damned, in that place of Torment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Morning. I ſhall never ſee Light.
Well, when (contrary to my fooliſh and
wicked Thoughts and Expectations) I had
Lived to ſee the Morning Light; I would
then begin to Reaſon and Query with my
ſelf, what I had ſo earneſtly deſired the Day
for? My Day of Grace is certainly paſt,
and gone: there is no Mercy in ſtore, for
ſuch a one as I am. All the helps and means
of Grace, which have had a Bleſſing attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, for ſpecial Good to others; are
attended with a Curſe to me; I am a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;
in vain it is to Pray any more; or
ſpend any more time in the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
I have had ſad experience of that,
under this Weight would I lye in my Bed,
concluding it altogether in vain, to ariſe to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54102:33"/>
engage in any Duty. This Temptation
ſo far prevailed, that I did (for a time)
Refrain Prayer; and neglect other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Religion. From my concluding,
that I belonged not to God, I found my ſelf
like a dead Log, as if I had neither Life,
nor Soul left in me. I expected certainly
(every Hour; nay, each Minute; nay, every
Breath I fetch'd) to be hurried away; into
the Place, and Company of the Damned;
which cauſed in me, ſuch amazement and
unuſual horror; that I would creep like a
Condemned Malefactor, into the Chimny
corner, among the Company, there reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to ſtay, while any ſtay'd there: On
purpoſe to avoid and ſhun thoſe Damned
Spirits, whom I expected (every twinkling
of an Eye to ſee.</p>
               <p>Among my ſad and deſpairing Thoughts,
concerning the ineffectualneſs of all Means,
and Duties, to do me good; there did come
into my Thoughts, a Paſſage which I had
Read in ſome Author, whoſe Name I have
forgot, it was this, (<hi>viz.) That there are
different Degrees of Torment, among the
Damned in Hell.</hi> This thing I Fix'd my
Thoughts on ſo long, till I did hence Infer,
and Conclude, that ſeeing there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Degrees of Torment among the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Hell, and that the Damned exceed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54102:33"/>
each other, in the Degrees of Sin, muſt
(neceſſarily) be the Ground and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of ſuch a difference: I concluded that
the leſs Sin I committed, the leſs would be
my Torment in Hell. Now every omiſſion
of Duty, (think I) as well as doing what
is Poſſitively forbidden, in the Moral Law,
is a ſin againſt God; and therefore, to make
my Chain the lighter in Hell; I am reſolv'd
againſt all known Sin. And accordingly, I
fell to Works again, perceiving in my ſelf,
no other Motive or Inducement (hereto)
but meerly expecting, and hoping, that
by this means, my being in Hell, would
be made more tollerable and eaſie, than
that of other Reprobates. By this very
thing, it will (eaſily) be underſtood, how
near I was to final Deſpair, in my own
Thoughts and Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>But among all the Combates, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
I met with in the time of my Bondage,
none more Rackt and tormented my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
than thoſe hideous and abominable
Thoughts, which by the Devil were like
Fiery and Poyſoned Arrows Injected into
my Mind; ſometimes againſt the Holy
Scriptures, as that they were not the word
of God, but the Cunning and Politick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Men; deviſed and contrived
by ſome, to Awe, and keep others in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54102:34"/>
This Temptation cauſed no ſmall
Anguiſh, and Perturbation in my Mind:
but did not continue long; for (though ſad
and deſperate I thought my Caſe to be) I
was enabled to Conſider, what a mighty
Power went along with the Scriptures, in
diſcovering my moſt Secret Corruptions;
and putting my Conſcience and Spirit into
ſuch fear, of what would enſue, in Caſe I
did not cofeſs and forſake them. This very
Conſideration (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Word, which
diſcovered to me, my vain, and ſinful
thoughts, and Condemn'd the ill Life, I
had led; and that laid me under ſuch Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
horror and fear, for the ſame, muſt
needs be the Word of an Infinite, All-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and powerful God: did foil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
that Temptation.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the firſt Temptation been
over, but a Second immediately enſues;
which was, That there is no ſuch thing as a
God, in Nature, and that Mens Believing,
and Profeſſing the Being of a God, was
more from uſe of Cuſtom, and from the
ſtrong Workings of Phancy, than from any
real Truth, grounded on ſenſible Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Oh! The ſad Concuſſion this Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
gave to the Powers of Nature. I was ſo
ſtrangely influenced by it, that I ſolemnly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54102:34"/>
Proſeſs, I felt my ſelf ſinking and and juſt
tottering, to fall off my Feet: All over in a
Muck Sweat, with a ſtrange Shivering, and
Trembling, in all the Powers, and Parts of
Soul and Body. But making to a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
looking into a pleaſant Garden; I
leaned on the Window, with my Elbows,
and ſo bore up my Body, from falling, which
otherwiſe, had (undoubtedly) ſunk down
under its preſent Load and Weight, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by that Temptation. Remaining
for ſome little ſpace, in a horrible Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and amazing Conſternation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
I (looking out into the Garden) began
began to conſider, and Reaſon with my
ſelf, thus, How came theſe Trees to grow
thus orderly in this place? Who Rear'd or
Built theſe Sumptuous Buildings? Surely,
not themſelves: why then (think I) if not
themſelveſs; then (of neceſſity) they muſt
Spring from ſome Cauſe, Higher and more
Noble than themſelves (<hi>viz</hi>) Man. Then,
from the Conſideration of the Trees, and
the Buildings; I began to Exerciſe my
thoughts about Man, and other Living
Creatures, thinking thus: And how came
Man, and theſe other Living Creatures, to
have a Being; ſurely (think I) they could
neither Form nor Quicken themſelves; and
if ſo, then of neceſſity, there muſt be ſome
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54102:35"/>
Cauſe of their Being and Living, which is
Higher and more Excellent than they;
which can (thinks my Reaſon) be no other
but an Infinitely Glorious God. And this
(ſaid Reaſon in me) might be Evinced; not
only by conſidering the Particulars already
mentioned; but, by conſidering the Frame
of the World, and the ſtrange Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things therein; and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Government of the Second Cauſes,
wherewith the World abounds.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and ſundry others of the like
Arguments, proved ſo Strong, and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
to convince me, that of neceſſity
there muſt be a God, that that Temtation
vaniſh'd.</p>
               <p>The Devil perceiving himſelf foil'd in
this attempt; he ſets furiouſly on me, with
Blaſphemous Thoughts: Repreſenting God
in ſuch vile ſhapes, and hideous and baſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,
to my Mind; that were I to undergo,
the utmoſt of Miſery, that Creatures are
capable of Inflicting, or I capable of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
I do (humbly) hope, in Chriſt's
Strength, I ſhould unſpeakably chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be Rack'd to Death: than (but
once) to Name them; ſo vile, hideous, and
horrible were they: Proceeding rather from
the Enraged and Revengeful Malice of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54102:35"/>
Devil, againſt the Majeſty of God; than
from the Corruption, and Pravity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Theſe things, I do but glance (or
touch) at, not from any delight I take in
the Remembrance of them: But rather
for the Relief of ſome poor Tempted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
Soul; who (probably) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
with the ſame Fiery Aſſaults; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
within themſelves (as I often did)
that none belonging to God, could ever be
poſſeſs'd, with ſuch black and diſmal
Thoughts. Oh! the gaſtlineſs and fearful
Tremblings. Oh! the Sweats and Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of my very Life, which theſe Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Injections cauſed in me; a ſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Argument, they were (immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Devil, and none elſe. The Sins
flowing from the Pravity of Nature, being
(commonly) rather Pleaſing and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
than Amazing and Terrifying to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>In this ſad Condition, I continued ſo long,
till my very Animal Spirits, were even drunk
up: and the Radical moiſture of my Body,
waſted by that Burning Inflammation which
I (ſenſibly) felt, invade and poſſeſs my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
The pittiful and deplorable State I
was in, both in reſpect of my Soul, which I
found was Invaded by the Terrors of God,
for the breach of his Royal Law; and (as I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54102:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
verily concluded) given up to Satan, by
God, in a Judicial way, to be poſſeſs'd by
him. As alſo, in reſpect of my Body,
in which the ſad Symptoms of my approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doom, did as I verily thought, hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear: ſuch as the growing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of that Burning Inflammation, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mentioned.) Decay of my Sight,
which neceſſitated the uſe of Spectacles, at
the Age of 25 Years: the loſs of my Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and Taſting, for about three Months,
with a great decay of my Hearing: So gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a ſight was I, to behold, that I became a
Spectacle of wonderment to all the Family,
where I Liv'd; ſome concluding, that I
was Starved, by my frequent Faſtings: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(verily) concluding, that Spirits
haunted me; which cauſed (in me) ſuch gaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looks; and cauſed my Body to bend and
bow, towards Crookedneſs; ſo heavy and
Inſupportable, was the Load I lay under.</p>

               <p>THE laſt Day of my Bondage State,
when I look'd for nothing, but a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, to the nethermoſt Hell: In the
unconceiveable Horror, and amazing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation

of Scripture which run in my Thoughts,
from Morning to Bed-time. The Place of
Scripture was, <hi>Eſa. 43. 25. I even I, am

               </p>
               <p>This Scripture got ſuch hold of my Mind
and Thoughts, that (albeit, I no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Senſe, or meaning of the
Spirit of God in it, or how it came into my
Mind that Day, than a Pagan, that never
knew any thing of the True God. I could
not poſſibly keep my Thoughts fixt on any

Rolling and Tumbling, the bare

Day till Bed-Time. I was ſomewhat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the Change, which I found in my
ſelf, (in reference to my Thoughts about
the Scriptures:) for, whereas before, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the State of my Spiritual Bondage,
which was between three and four Years) I
could think of no Scriptures, but ſuch as
Treated of Damnation, of Falling away,
and of Sinning againſt the Holy Ghoſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
applying the ſame to my ſelf, deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
concluding, that my own Doom was,
in thoſe Terrible Scriptures ſet forth, and
diſcovered. I (that Day) forgot thoſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
Scriptures; and could (as I ſaid)
think of nothing, but that Place in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.
25 above mentioned. And that without
the leaſt apprehenſion, what the Sence of
the Spirit (in theſe Words) ſhould be; or
how, or wherefore that Scripture ſhould
make ſuch a forceable entry on my Mind
and Thoughts; as to Eject, and Baniſh from
my Thoughts and Remembrance, the other
Terrible Scriptures: By the wrong Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of which, my State and Condition,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54102:37"/>
became (as to my own Senſe and Thoughts,)
equal to that of the Damned.</p>
               <p>At Night after my Lord had Supped, and
while the inferiour of the Family, were
(Actually) at Supper: I ſtole my opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Reſolving (in my ſelf,) that none ſhould
know where I was; or ſuſpect what I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout;
up Stairs I got, without a Candle,
(the Night being Moon-Shine) I was all of
a Sweat, and a ſtrange Horrour fell on me,
occaſioned by the Conceit, and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I had, that the Devil accompanied me,
(as a Man) up Stairs, whoſe Steppings (along
with mine) I ſtrongly imagined I heard,
which cauſed me to keep my Eyes cloſed,
for fear I ſhould ſee the Devil, in a viſible
Shape. While I was unlocking the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Door, I found the Horror, and Fright,
under which I Laboured, greatly to encreaſe,
the Devil ſuggeſting, that he would either
pull me back, from entring into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
or elſe, that he would enter along
with me, to hinder (or diſtract) me, in
my (intended) Devotion. All this while the
place of Scripture, above mentioned, ran
ſtill in my Thoughts, as before. Being
entred into my Chamber, all in a Sweat,
and unuſual Conſternation of Spirit, I ſtood
before the Bed-ſide, where I uſed to kneel,
in Praying; and with my Eyes cloſed (as I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54102:38"/>
was taking my ſelf to Task, endeavouring
to Recollect my Memory, where I had been
all that Day? With what Company I had
Convers'd? What Duties I had (knowingly)
omitted? And what Immoralities, I had any
ways conſented to?) All on a ſudden, I
found the Eyes of my Underſtanding ſo
clearly Enlightned, that I was enabled to
know and underſtand the meaning of that
Place of Scripture, which run all that Day
in my Thoughts. A Scripture, than which,
The whole <hi>Book of God,</hi> could not afford a
more ſuitable Text for the deſign therein;
which was, to debaſe the Creature; and
to Extol and to Advance the Grace, and
Mercy of the Moſt High Jehovah; who
(alone) Excluding all others) is God (over
all) Bleſſed for Evermore.</p>
               <p>I was from the time of my firſt awakening
(as above mentioned) poſſeſs'd of an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that Converſion conſiſted in an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
(or outward) Reformation of the Life,
and that it was in the Power of the Creature
to effect the ſame. And that by Repenting
of the by-paſt Follies of Youth; and by a
Strenuous, and Zealous Conſtancy, in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrictly according to the Precepts of the
Moral Law; both negatively, and poſſitively,
for the time to come. I was then under the
Predominancy of a legal Spirit: and acting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54102:38"/>
under the Covenant of Works: looking
(with the Bond-Womans Children) for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and Life Eternal in the way of
Works; Reckoning it the only ſure and
ſafe way, to expect Salvation: by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Conditinal Covenant of Works;
and abounding in ſuch perſonal Qulificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as might render me acceptable to God.
Of which (I have often thought) I had as
great meaſure as any he, I knew Living. I
ſhall not Inſiſt on the Particulars of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Qualifications; wherein I am apt to
believe, I did match (if not out ſtrip) the
ſtricteſt Moraliſt I know, who is yet in his
Natural State. In ſhort, I was exceeding
Zealous in the Law; not (in the leaſt) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the Spiritual meaning thereof,
or how miſerably wretched I was, by reaſon
of its Condemning Sentence, againſt not
only my worſt, but alſo againſt my moſt
Refined Acts of Morality. I did then, as
too to many do at this Day of Goſpel
Light, (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſet up the Letter of the
Law, in oppoſition to the Spirit of the
Law.</p>
               <p>But ſo it pleaſed God, that by his ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
me to underſtand the Mind of his
Spirit, in that Text; I ſoon became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that I had taken wrong Methods,
in order to get from under the Laws Curſe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54102:39"/>
and to have a Settled Peace in my ſelf. The
Courſe I had taken for Relieving my wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſinking Spirit, I perceived to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to the Goſpel way, of ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loſt Sinners. I was all for Doing and
Working; and the more Works I did, the
farther I found my ſelf from true Peace and
Comfort. My Chief and only Work (now)
was Believing in the Son of God, in whom
(alone) that Righteouſneſs is to be found,
which Reconciles a Sinner to an offended
God. From that Text (above mentioned)
the Covenant of God's Free Grace (in
Chriſt) was Explained, and laid open, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Eyes of my Enlightned Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
the Terms whereof (I found) were
as far wide of (or contrary to) the way to
which the Covenant of Works directs, for
attaining Life Eternal, as the Eaſt is from
the Weſt, or as Heaven is from Hell.</p>
               <p>The Work of the Spirit in diſcovering
Chriſt to me (from that Text) and his
drawing me to cloſe with Chriſt (ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered)
was ſo ful of amazing, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wonderment, and ſurprizing Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Soul, that I am no mroe able to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
or Relate the ſame, than I am able to
find out the Dimenſions of the Sun, or to
give an exact account of the Number of the
Stars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54102:39"/>
There was held (as it were) a Court of
Enquiry in my Soul. The Holy Ghoſt,
which (before) was the Spirit of Bondage,
wounding and killing me, by the Terrible
Sentence of the Law. He is become the
Spirit of Adoption, to Conſummate a Sweet,
and Bleſſed Marriage, between the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, (God's only Son, by Eternal
and Ineffable Generation) and a poor loſt
and undone Prodigal, who (as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Child)
was Born Heir of the Curſe, Partaker of a
Nature as Vile and Poluted, as Hell it ſelf
could make it; and whoſe Caſe and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(in reſpect of inward Horrour, and
Deſpair of Soul) differed but little (at leaſt
as I thought and believed) from that of the
Damned in Hell.</p>
               <p>Six Things this Bleſſed Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did effect, in order to Conſummate this
Match.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He diſcovered and made known to
me, who the Lord Jeſus (held forth in the
Goſpel) was; from whence he came;
and to what end the Father ſent him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He made plain Diſcoveries to
me, of Chriſt's Almightineſs to Save, and
Reconcile to God, the worſt and moſt
wretched of Sinners: and that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
which (he as Mediator between God
and Sinners) hath wrought, is the alone
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54102:40"/>
Righteouſneſs, by which a Sinner is to be
Saved. And that in a way of Believing
(though not for Believing) that God, for
the ſake, and merrit of his Sons obedience,
to the Law, (both Active and Paſſive)
doth Frankly and Freely, Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
the Poor Rebels Tranſgreſſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the Moral Law, as if he had
never committed them; and accounting
the whole of that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,
(both Active and Paſſive) as truly the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
as if the Sinner had (Perſonally) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the ſame himſelf; and that in a way
of free Imputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He perſwaded my Heart, that
God the Father, (againſt whoſe Law I had
Sinned, and whoſe Anger and Curſe (for
the ſame) I fear'd) was really willing and
deſirous, that I ſhould be Reconciled to
himſelf, by the Virtue of his Sons Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that by my betaking my ſelf to
him; and caſting my weary and ſinking
Soul on him, to be introduced into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
and by his Spotleſs Comelineſs
(put on me) I might be made Amiable, and
Acceptable in his Sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He Diſcovered to me, (and
Perſwaded my Hearts of) the Full, and
Compleat Proviſion, made by God, (and
made known in the Covenant of Grace
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54102:40"/>
for the making Compleatly (and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally)
Happy, thoſe Souls who are by
Chriſt his Son (Believed, and Relied
on for Salvation) Reconciled to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>In Reſpect of theſe, and the like Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
which the Holy Ghoſt makes to the
Elect (in effectual Calling.) And between
that and their Arriving at Glory, he is
Stiled the Spirit of Manifeſtation, and of
Revelation. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Jo. 16. 14. Jo.
17. 6. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He Interrogated, (or Queried) of
my Soul, as follows.</p>
               <p>1. Art thou become truly and thoroughly
ſenſible, and convinced that thou art, by
Departing from (and Sinning againſt) God,
an undone, miſerable, and guilty Creature;
having loſt his Bleſſed Image ſtamped on
thee, in <hi>Adam</hi> thy Natural and Faederal
Head, in the Firſt Creation. And being
now become obnoxious to God's Curſe, and
the Wrath to come, and Partaker of ſuch a
Spiritual Impotency, as Renders thee (utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
uncapable, of doing any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thou mayſt be Delivered out of thy
preſent folorn condition: Art thou Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viuced,
that this thy Miſery, is of thy own
bringing upon thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54102:41"/>
                  <hi>Sinner Anſwers.</hi> O thou Moſt Holy, Juſt,
and Tremenduous God! By the Light now
Sprung from thee, (the Fountain of all Light)
into my Dungeon-like Soul: I plainly ſee what
a wretch I am become, no way like what thou
(at firſt) made me, in <hi>Adam.</hi> I am likewiſe
fully Convinced, that this my Miſery, was
brought on me, by my (every way) voluntary
Defection, and Apoſtacy, when (in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Loins) I firſt yielded to the Motion of the
Tempter.</p>
               <p>2. Art thou Convinced of what the
real Deſert and Merit of thy Sinning
againſt a Holy and Righteous God is?
What canſt thou ſay againſt Gods Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee into Hell: for that Helliſh Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thine, againſt his Holy and Righteous
Law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin. Anſ.</hi> O thou Moſt Holy; and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
Righteous God, who canſt not poſſibly
Act amiſs, in any thing thou doſt, with thy
Creatures. I am (by the Convincing Power
of thy Holy Spirit) made Senſible, that by
my Departing from, and Rebelling againſt thy
Majeſty, I have forfeited that Right, I had
(in <hi>Adam</hi>) to all Good, Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.
And ſhouldſt thou Caſt me into Hell,
and Aſſign me my Portion, with the Apoſtate
Angels, whoſe Conduct and wretched Example
I followed, when I turned my Back on thee,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54102:41"/>
thou art, and wilt (for ever) be, and remain;
a Juſt, a Holy, and a Moſt Righteous God
my Miſery is of my own Procurement; and ſo
far am I from reflecting on thee (as unjuſt)
ſhouldſt thou throw me from thee, for ever,
that I am amaz'd and aſtoniſhed to think, I
ſhould be ſo long out of Hell. The Place where
I (ſometimes) evenlong'd to be, to try whether
there was any ſpecifical Difference, between the
Torments and Miſeries of that Place, and
what I felt in my ſelf, while ſhut up in thy
Laws Priſon, under the ſharp and killing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogie
thereof.</p>
               <p>3. Haſt thou Viewed and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that Mediator, which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and diſcovered to thee, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
Doſt thou think, or, canſt thou be
perſwaded, that he can do thy Work
for thee, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Save thee, from Curſe and
Wrath to come? and not only ſo, but to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
thee, and bring thee back again to the
Favour and Fellowſhip of God? Doſt thou
ſee in him, an Adequate, ſuitableneſs to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all thy Neceſſities?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinner Anſwers.</hi> O Lord! My Eyes are ſo
intent and fix'd on that Mediator, that I can
have no leiſure, or ſpare time, to look on any
other object in Heaven, or Earth; never did,
(neither can) Men or Angels, behold or ſee,
ſuch an object, except himſelf. The Angels,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54102:42"/>
and all the Glory of the whole Creation, are
but Darkneſs and Deformity, when compared,
to his Surpaſſing and Incomparable Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Lovelineſs, ſince I had the firſt
glimps of him; as held forth and diſcovered,
by thy Divine and Efficacious Manifeſtation.
I have forgotten my Miſery; and the fearful
Thoughts of Hell, and Damnation, are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, of the Thoughts and Apprehenſions
I have of his ſuitableneſs, to Anſwer the
neceſſitous Condition of ſuch a Sinner as I
am.</p>
               <p>4. Haſt thou Viewed, and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him ſo, as to like him, and chooſe
him, for thy Reconciler and Saviour? What
ſayeſt thou Poor Sinner! Wilt thou have
him, for thine own? 'Tis Perſonal Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in him, that makes the Thoughts, and
Sight of him Raviſhing, and Enriching for
ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinner Anſwers,</hi> O Tremendous, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing
Myſtery! of Divine Grace, in
ſending forth (from the Father, and the Son)
that Holy Spirit of Promiſe; that by his Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
Virtue, and quickening Power, I
might have ſuch a ſaving Sight, of Chriſt,
the Saviour; as ſhould both beget in me, a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Perſon, and likewiſe cauſe in me, a
burning deſire to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited, and Married to
him: I am indeed ſick of Love to him; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54102:42"/>
filled with ſuch deſires, after him, as nothing
ſhort of a Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, to his Moſt Holy and
Glorious Perſon; can ſatisfy my thirſting Soul.</p>
               <p>5. Art thou willing that this Mediator,
ſhall have the whole Honour of Saving thee,
by his own Mediatorial Righteouſneſs. For,
As no Righteouſneſs (of a meer Creature)
can ſtand before the Bar, of Gods Infinite,
and Incomprehenſible Holineſs; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
ſuch a Tryal, as to be Judged fit and
ſufficient, to Juſtifie a Sinner, before God,
(ſeeing that the Righteouſneſs to which ſuch
Honour is Reſerved, and Aſſigned, muſt be
the Righteouſneſs of God. And alſo the
Righteouſneſs of a ſinleſs Man) ſo this
Mediator will become a Saviour to none
who will mix, (or join) any thing of their
own, or other Creatures, with his Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,
and All-ſufficient Righteouſneſs.
The whole and entire Work of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and Saving Sinners, is Devolv'd on
him alone. He will admit of no Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
in this Work, to which the Father hath
Called and Anointed him. And the which
he himſelf (as Vademony, and Surety for
God's Elect) hath undertaken to go through
and Perform. What ſayeſt thou Sinner?
Art thou willing to this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin. Anſ.</hi> O thou Holy of Holy's! I ſee,
and find ſo little need, of joyning any Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54102:43"/>
of my own, or other Creatures
to the Compleat and Perfect Righteouſneſs
of this Mediator, that I am reſolved to
look no where elſe for a Righteouſneſs whereby
to be Juſtified, and Saved. I am fully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that as he needs no Coadjutor, to help
him out, in this Work of Saving Sinners (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he is the Holy and Almighty one of God:
able to Save to the uttermoſt) So I ſee nothing
like a Legal Righteouſneſs, which can Anſwer
the Demand of the ſtrict and Righteous Law of
God; either in my ſelf; or any other (meer
Creature) whatſoever. Whatever, therefore
is (or can be) Suggeſted or Objected, by the
Devil or Carnal Reaſon, againſt this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of his, (as Inſufficient to Save) I am
(by Strength from above) fixedly Reſolved,
to caſt my Weary Bleeding Soul thereon, come
Life, come Death.</p>
               <p>6. There is a thing called the Croſs,
which thou muſt expect, and look to meet
with, if thou reſolve to Live and Reign
with Chriſt in Heaven hereafter. Thou
muſt look to Part with all that (in this
World) is Near and Dear to thee, for his
ſake, and the Goſpels. Thou muſt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
thy Reputation and Credit, among Men.
Thou muſt become willing to be accounted
a Fool, a Madman, a Turbulent Fellow, an
Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a Separatiſt from the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54102:43"/>
Church. Thou muſt not think (or look)
to be advanced to Worldly Wealth, and
Honour: If thou tread, in thoſe Steps (of
Chriſt) which leads to the Heavenly Glory.
He went to Heaven: Antipodes to this
vain World, wherein thou art: So muſt
thou, if thou deſireſt to meet him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thou muſt expect, and look to
have all the World ſet againſt thee, for thy
Witneſſing to the Truth, and condemning
the Errors, and Wickedneſs of the World.
Thou muſt expect, and look to be Caſt off,
by Father and all Fleſhly Relations, for his
(and the Goſpels) ſake. Thou wilt (for
following Chriſt, in the ways of Holineſs)
be accounted an Hypocrite, a ſelf conceited,
and a ſelf Juſtifying Preciſian, and proud
Phariſee; and that by the greateſt Phariſees
of the Times. The Powers of Darkneſs
will all Combine againſt thee, to Beſiege and
Fight againſt thee: And yea, the very Face
of Providence ſhall ſeem to Frown and look
black on thee; to try, whether thou wilt ſtick
faithfully, to Chriſt, and the Goſpel. And,
finally, If God call thee to leave all; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to lay down thy Life; than to leave,
and loſe Chriſt: Thou muſt Trample them
all under thy Feet, preferring Chriſt before
Father, Mother, Brethren, Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
(tho never ſo Dearly Belov'd) yea,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54102:44"/>
and thy very Life too. What ſayeſt thou
to this Sinner? wilt thou venture on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or taking Chriſt, on theſe Terms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin. Anſ.</hi> For ever Bleſſed and Holy Lord
God! Thou knoweſt how hard this Task is for
Fleſh and Blood; and not only hard, but even
Impoſſible: yet conſidering the abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the Choice, now laid before me; and in
regard of that Divine Power, whereby I find
my Heart made willing, to make Choice of
Chriſt, on the Terms (now) mentioned. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to Chooſe and have him, let God do with
me, and all that is Dear to me, what he Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
ſo he give me his Chriſt: I am ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of the Sweet and Soul Enriching Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which accompany the Croſs, that I
am very unwilling to be Exempted from it, if
I may have my own Choice. I therefore,
(through the Divine Spirits Gracious Power
enabling me hereto, do yield my free and full
conſent, to this matchleſs Match: Caſting my
ſelf on him (when actually Married to him, in
a way of humble dependance) for Strength and
Power, to Act and Suffer (a in way of Duty)
whatever becomes his Diſciple and Follower.
And, oh! that God above (with Chriſt and
the Holy Ghoſt) might ſay, Amen to it.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus Propoſed (by the
Holy Ghoſt) and I, the worſt, and moſt
unworthy of Sinners (to be Saved;) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54102:44"/>
endued, with Power (from him) to cloſe
with the Propoſals made. I (immediately)
felt my whole Heart, and Soul, quickned
within me, and drawn out to an effectual
cloſing with Chriſt, in the offers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
Like a Ship ſticking in the Sand,
which no Strenght or Art of Men, can ſet
a Float, till the full Spring Tide come, and
ſet her a Float, carrying her forth into the
Broad Ocean. The quickening Virtue of
the Holy Ghoſt, and the Attracting Power
of the Lord Jeſus, drew me to believe in
him. My Soul Crying out (with a ſilent and
a ſtill Voice) my Lord, and my God; thou art
mine, to Save me; and I am thine, to Serve
thee. Hereupon, I felt (as it were) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Spirit put into me, whereby I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
to underſtand, and know, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the great God, in cauſing ſo great a
Change, to paſs upon me.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt (within me) Witneſſing
to his own Work (now wrought in my Soul.)
And Sealing me to the Day of Redemption
(in Believing,) I felt a Torrent of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Joy, come from above, flowing in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, in ſuch manner, and meaſure, as I
believe no Saint, or Angel in Heaven, can
ſet forth or expreſs, as I felt it.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, I fell into an Holy Extaſie, and
Divine Rapture, of unexpreſſible Joy, with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54102:45"/>
theſe Thoughts and Expreſſions within my
ſelf.</p>
               <p>Oh! What a Change is this which I now
(ſenſibly) feel? A Dead Sinner brought
to Life again; a Rebel and a Fugitive
from God; brought Home, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
by the Blood of the Lamb. A Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
and a Captive, held ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the killing Terrors of the Law; and
unmerciful Uſurpations, and Infernal
Aſſaults, of the Powers of Darkneſs, ſet
Free; and Manumitted by the Deliverer
of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p>An undone forlorn Sinner, ſhut up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief; who (a while
ſince) would ſhun and fly from God (if
he knew how) for fear of his Frowns;
and the Curſe due, for the breach of his
Law: Now ready to ſhoot himſelf into
Heaven, and Whimper, and Cry (like a
Child) till he be Lodged in the Boſom of
God's Love.</p>
               <p>Oh! My Soul! Who could have thought of
this! When the Irons of the Laws Severity,
had pierced thee ſo deeply? And when the
Apprehenſions (lodg'd in thee) of thy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54102:45"/>
being a Reprobate, and forſaken of God,
deliver'd thee up to Deſparation? The
very Portal or Entrance into Hell it ſelf.
Where am I? What is the Matter?
What am I doing? What ſuch a one as I
Saved? Is it poſſible? Can it be? Am I
not under a Satanical Dream, or Deluſion?
Lord help me, to know if it be a Deluſion,
and undeceive me.</p>
               <p>Here I was at a ſtand for (but) a little ſpace;
it was occaſioned by my calling to Mind,
what a deceitful Enemy the Devil is; and
how near he can go in imitating the Spirit of
God; in cauſing flaſhes of Joy in the Soul,
of an Awakened Sinner. And thinking (at
the ſame time) whether mine was not
ſo?</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Adoption, who began his
Good and Bleſſed Work in my Soul; did
not leave me in this Cloud. But by his own
Elucidating, and Heart Searching Virtue,
and Power: brings to my Thoughts, and
Conſideration, all the Objections, which
either Devil or Carnal Reaſon, could (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
make againſt my being Saved by Chriſt;
and by manifeſting the Fathers Decree and
Purpoſe (concerning me) in Eternity.
And laying open the Nature and Deſign of
the Covenant of Grace. And the every
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54102:46"/>
way Alſufficiency of the Lord Jeſus, to go
through with the Work he hath undertaken
for me. He fully Anſwered all Objections,
and Confuted the Falſe and Sophiſtial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
brought in by Satan; and Corrupt
Reaſon, againſt my being Saved. As he
moſt Powerfully convinced me of Sin. And
the miſery which (thereby) I brought upon
my ſelf. And that when he became a Spirit
of Bondage, to fit me for the Great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian:
So likewiſe (now) he is become a
Spirit of Adoption; he as Powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
me, of that Spotleſs and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteouſneſs; of the Mediator (God-Man,)
by (and for) which I was Juſtified
in the Perſon of my Surety, when (at his
Reſurrection) God the Father Juſtified and
Acquitted him, from all charge of Sin,
whereto he became liable and obnoxious,
when he Struck Hands with the Father,
(as a Surety) for me; and the reſt of the
Elect.</p>
               <p>The Twelve Things here following, he
(Particularly) aſſured me of; and that as
fully and ſenſibly, as ever I was ſenſible,
that I ſaw Natural Light, or Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>1. He aſſured me that I was one of that
Number, whom God the Father Elected,
and Choſe to himſelf (in Chriſt) out of the
Corrupted Maſs, of Fallen Mankind. And
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54102:46"/>
that before Time began; and that my Name
was Recorded in Heaven, in the Lambs
Book of Life.</p>
               <p>2. He aſſured me, that my Sins and
Tranſgreſſions (committed againſt the Law
and Majeſty of Heaven) were all laid to the
Score of Chriſt, by God the Father. And
by him (as my Vademony, and Surety) Born
and Satisfied for.</p>
               <p>3. He aſſured me, that the Debt which
I had Contracted, both in <hi>Adam</hi> (my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Faederal Head) and in my own
Perſon; was fully Paid, and (Actually)
Diſcharged, by my Sponſor, and Surety,
Chriſt: by his Obeying and Keeping the
Law (perfectly) for me: and his bearing,
and undergoing (in my Nature) the Curſe
and Wrath of God; to which (by Sin) I
became Obnoxious.</p>
               <p>4. He aſſured me, that God the Father,
is fully Satisfied, with that Obedience
(Active and Paſſive) of his own Son: and
that it is, for the Worth and Merit of that
Obedience, that God Juſtifies and Accepts
(as Pleaſing to him) both me, and the reſt
of his Elect, for whom (alone) that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
was Performed.</p>
               <p>5. He aſſured me, that all my Sins (how
many, and great ſoever) are Frankly and
Freely Forgiven, and Pardoned, as if they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54102:47"/>
had never been committed: and that, not
for any Act done by me, whether Believing
on Chriſt, or Repenting for Sin: nor yet,
for the Sorrows and Miſeries I underwent
while under the Spirit of Bondage: or for
any Service, to which I ſhould be Called,
while in a Militant State: but for his own
Name, and Glory ſake; and on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what his Son (my Mediator and
Surety) had done and ſuffered in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
               <p>6. He aſſured me, that God the Father Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, with a Real and an Endeared Love;
before I was Called out of a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And that the Reaſon why he handled
me ſo roughly (by the Spirit of Bondage)
was not, becauſe he hated me, (as the Devil
and Carnal Reaſon ſuggeſted.) Or, that he
might (in any meaſure ſatisfy his Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Juſtice, for my Sins: that being done
(long) before I had a Perſonal Being. But
that he might make me the more ſenſible
how hateful Sin is to him (being ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Pure, Spotleſs, and Bleſſed
Nature: and ſo Repugnant and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to his Holy, Juſt, and moſt Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Law. As alſo, ſo Deſtructive to his
Elect, whom he ſo Dearly Loves. Alſo,
that I might know, and become (for ever)
ſenſible, how unſpeakably Wretched and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54102:47"/>
Deplorable that State and Condition is; into
which (by Sin) Man hath brought himſelf:
and out of which, no Created Power could
(poſſibly) Save, and Deliver him. That I
might (for ever) hate and loath Sin (as the
worſt of Evils) and become (for ever) ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
of the Greatneſs, Goodneſs, Love,
Mercy, Wiſdom, and the unconceivable,
and Infinite All-ſufficiency of the Glorious,
and Tremendous Jehovah, Father, Son, and
Bleſſed Spirit; who himſelf (without the
Counſel, or help of Creatures) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
and found out, ſuch a way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
(to his loſt Favour) his Elect, and
Choſen in Chriſt: as neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor the Angels could ever think of.
And (finally) that by his ſo ſharply handle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me, way may be made (into my Soul)
for the Manifeſtation of his Great and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
Love (wherewith he Loves me)
in Chriſt) to Enter and make its Abode for
ever. And that from the Experience, I
have now gotten, both by God's Wounding
me by the Spirit of Bondage; and his
Healing and Comforting me, by the Spirit
of Adoption. I might be fitted, to ſpeak
(Experimentally) both to the Terrifying
and Awakening Secure and Preſumptuous
Sinners. As alſo, to Heal and Comfort,
(Inſtrumentally) Poor Wounded and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54102:48"/>
Sinners, when Sinking into thoſe
Depths of Deſpondency, and Deſpair;
out of which, the Out-ſtretched Arm, of
God's Grace, and Almightineſs, hath De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and Reſcued, poor Sinful Nothing
me.</p>
               <p>7. He aſſured me, that I am now in a
Juſtified, Sanctified, and Adopted State;
The loſt Image of God, being (by his
Sanctifying Operation) Recovered in my
Soul in meaſure.</p>
               <p>8. He aſſured me, that I ſhall be made to
Perſevere, and hold out in a State of Grace;
and that I ſhall be continued in the Love and
Favour of God, for ever, and ever. In
deſpight of all, that the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
can Contrive, or Act againſt me.</p>
               <p>9. He aſſured me, that the Eye of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, ſhould be (Everlaſtingly)
fixed on me; and the Right Hand of God's
Righteouſneſs (Everlaſtingly) kept under
me, for my Security, from being in danger
(at any time) of finally Miſcarrying or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing.</p>
               <p>10. He aſſured me, that the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
Corruption (in my Nature) and
whatever Falls, or Miſcariage, which
ſhould (at any time) be occaſioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
in my Life and Converſation: Should
(with all the Afflictions attending me
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54102:48"/>
for the ſaid Miſcarriages) moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and (infallibly) Work for my Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Good, and Welfare: whatever I
my ſelf, (or others) ſhould Judge to the
Contrary.</p>
               <p>11. He aſſured me, that I ſhould meet
with great Oppoſition, and Tribulation,
in the World; But that all mine Enemies,
ſhould find, they Laboured in vain:
For, that God was on my ſide, to
take my Part, againſt them. And who
will (moſt certainly) Crown all my
Streights and Troubles with a happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>12. He aſſured me, that God's Special
Preſence, ſhould be ſo with me, (in every
Change of Condition in this World) as
that nothing ſhould harm, or ſpoil me.
Yea, that Death (it ſelf) the laſt Enemy
of Nature) ſhould neither Terrify nor Hurt
me. The Mortal Sting thereof, being (by
the Death of My Redeemer) unſtung,
and diveſted of its Power, to harm me, or
any of Chriſts Redeemed ones.</p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars Diſcovered, and ſet
home (by the Holy Ghoſt) on my Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Panting Soul. He Working me
(Powerfully) to a Believing each Particular,
with Application to my ſelf. I was (immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately)
ſurprized, with a more Aſtoniſhing,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54102:49"/>
and overcoming Rapture of Inexpreſſible
Joy, than before. I had clear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations
of the Love of God, to me (in
Particular) and of the great things done,
and Prepared for me, to make me (Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly
happy; in the Beholding and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
himſelf, as my God, and my Father,
and Portion, in Chriſt, for ever. According
to the Unconditionate Free Covenant,
of his own Grace, Made and Eſtablſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, and with Chriſt (his Son) in
the behalf of me, and the reſt of his
Elect.</p>
               <p>No ſooner did I look up to God, and
behold his Reconciled Face, Smile on me,
(in the Face of Jeſus his Son) but I felt ſuch
inward, Soul Inebriating Joy; as I verily
thought, would cauſe my very Soul to Fly
out of my Body, and my Body to burſt in
ſunder. The hardneſs of my Heart (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which I Laboured, all the time of my
Bondage State; and which I ſenſibly felt
to grow and encreaſe; as I called to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the many Follies of Youth;
and the Holy Law of God; whereof thoſe
Follies were ſo many Breaches; each Folly
Deſerving (if it were Poſſible) a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Damnations) was Melted and Thawn
(like a lump of Ice, before the warm Sun)
By the Senſe, and Perception, I had of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54102:49"/>
Love of God (vouchſafed) to ſuch a baſe,
and deformed Sinner, as God knows I was,
and ſtill am. I felt the Servile, and Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Frame, and Diſpoſition of my Spirit,
take Wing: and that Filial Child like Frame
and Diſpoſition of Spirit, (which is ſuited
to a Goſpel Diſpenſation) Succeed in its
Room. And looking up to Heaven (with
the Tears flowing from me, ſo extreamly
faſt; that I heard them drop, drop upon
drop, on the Floor, where I ſtood, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
ſo long, that I (ſenſibly) felt my
Cheeks to Burn and Scald me). My Soul
(in a ſtrange Extaſy) running over thoſe
Particulars, which the Holy Ghoſt had
aſſured me of. Here's the Second Rapture
of Joy.</p>
               <p>What Joy like to this I now feel?
Who can (poſſibly) Relate or expreſs it?
What! Hath God Elected me? even me?
Sinful and Vile me? And hath he done it
before time? And notwithſtanding he
(perfectly) knew, what I ſhould prove in
time? Oh! Wonderful Love! Why me
Lord? Why me? And not one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates

thee, to that Degree that I have?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:54102:50"/>
And hath God laid mine Iniquities,
even all my Iniquities, on the Back of
Chriſt, and Charged them to his Score, as
my Surety? Oh! Amazing Miſtery of
Divine Love, and Grace. Who is able
to know, whether the Father or the Son
Loves me Moſt? The Father in Laying
my Sins on his own, and only Son, tho
Innocent and Harmleſs. Or the Son, in
Condeſcending to Bear them, as his own
Sins? And are all thoſe Sins of mine
Diſcharg'd, and ſatisfied for, by the
Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt
my Surety; who hath kept the Law for me?
Oh! Wonderful Condeſcention, both of
Father and Son!</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, (as I feel it is) That God the
Father, is fully Satisfi'd, with that his
Sons Obedience? And that I am now
Juſtifi'd (in his Sight) by the Virtue
thereof? Oh my Soul! What Cauſe haſt
thou to Rejoyce and Adore God for ever?</p>
               <p>And was the Love of God ſet on me?
Even when in a State of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregeneracy?
Who but a Mercenary Legaliſt will not
be (hence) Convinced, of the Orthodoxy,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54102:50"/>
and Soundneſs of that Diſtinction. Which
differenceth between the Perſon of an Elect
Sinner; and the Sinful Pravity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which Cleaves to him? Surely my
Soul! If God had really hated thee, and
had he been Wrath with thee, as he is
with all the wicked Reprobates, who have
no ſhare in the Redemption of his Son:
Even then, when thou waſt un-called, he
might have ſent thee to Hell. Who could
have hindred him? And were the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
wherefore he handled thee ſo rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(by the Spirit of Bondage) as have
been diſcovered by the Holy Ghoſt: And
not becauſe he hated thee, or (any way)
deſign'd to ſatisfy his Vindicative Juſtice
for thy Sins. What Cauſe haſt thou to
Reflect on, and Abhor thy ſelf, for all thy
hard Thoughts, and unbecoming Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
which were lodg'd in thee, of
God, and his Dealing with thee?</p>
               <p>And is it certain, (as moſt certainly it
is, ſeeing God cannot Lye) That I, Poor
Sinful I, ſhall be made to Perſevere, and
hold out, in a State of Grace; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in Gods Favour for ever. Oh!
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54102:51"/>
What unſpeakable cauſe, haſt thou, to
Adore, Love, and Praiſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> to all
Eternity? And what little Reaſon haſt
thou to be diſcouraged, to think of what
the Powers of Darkneſs can do to hinder
thy Perſeverance?</p>
               <p>And will the Eye of Divine Providence
be on me; and the Right Hand of God's
Righteouſneſs, kept under me; to Secure
me (for ever) from (finally) Miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Periſhing?</p>
               <p>How great Encouragement is this to
thee, my Soul; to have the Eye of Faith,
and Hope (Dependingly) fixt on the
Faithfulneſs, and Almightineſs of God;
ſeeing the End, and the Means, are ever
Inſeparable?</p>
               <p>And hath God (that cannot Lye) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
and Engaged, that the very Being
of Indwelling Corruption, with all the
Out-breaking thereof, in my Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As alſo, the many Afflictions attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame, ſhall (infallibly) Work,
for my Eternal Good. What Reaſon
have I to Cry out, and ſay (with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Soul) Who is a God like unto
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54102:51"/>
thee, who Pardoneſt Iniquity, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by the Traſgreſſion of the Remnant of
thine Heritage? Who out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
produceſt Light; and out of the
greateſt Evil, canſt bring the greateſt
Good.</p>
               <p>And is it ſo, That notwithſtanding the
many, and great Oppoſitions, and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
I am to meet with, in the World.
I ſhall (through Chriſt (accompanying,
and ſtrengthening me) be brought through
them; and made a Compleat Conqueror in
the End? How greatly Zealous, ought I to
be, in Loving and Lauding, the True and
Living God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt?
whoſe Tremendous and Glorious Name,
is Infinitely Tranſcending, all Praiſes,
which Saints or Angels, are Capable of
giving.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that (from henceforth,
till I come to Heaven) the ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God will be with me (in every
Change of Condition) ſo as nothing ſhall be
able to do me Harm. What unſpeakable
Cauſe have I to fear (with a Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
Holy, and Filial Fear) the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54102:52"/>
Name: and Infinite Majeſty of the
Great God? And how unbecoming me
(for whom God hath done ſo many, and
wonderful things) will it be; to Fear,
either Devils or Men, who ſet themſelves
againſt God, and his Sons Intereſt? O my
Soul! Rejoyce (now) in God, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thy Salvation; and Fear nothing,
but what may (any way) grieve his Holy,
and Tender Spirit.</p>
               <p>Marvelous, and unutterable, were thoſe
Manifeſtations of Gods Love, let out upon
me (his poor nothing Creature) in that
Moment of his Spirits Sealing me, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving:
and by the Senſe whereof; the
Holy Ghoſt fill'd up thoſe Vallys and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
in my Soul, and Conſcience; occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
by the ſharp and terrible Workings
of the Spirit of Bondage. And as the
Manifeſtations (but now) Mentioned, were
(in themſelves) Marvelous, and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
ſo were (alſo) the Senſible Effects
they Produced in me, Wonderful and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Effects, I Reduce (for Orders
ſake) to Six Heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:54102:52"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Horrour, and Guilt of my
Conſcience, was gon; which was Succeeded,
by the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God) which did (inwardly) Suggeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Dictate to me: That my State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(Godward) is truely Safe, and moſt
Happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Spiritual Vail; which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
my Heart and Mind; and which kept
me from ſeeing into the Miſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
was taken off, like Scales, or a Web,
off the Eyes of a Blind Man. Whereon,
I was enabled to See, and Behold, who,
and what, Jeſus (held forth in the Goſpel)
is to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Affrighting Diſtractions,
and Overwhelming Hurricanes of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
Soul (occaſioned by my continual
expectation of being ſent to Hell) were
turned into an unexpected and Soul ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Calm, and Sedate Frame of Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Spirit of Slaviſh Fear,
which (on every occaſion) Tormented and
Rackt me, vaniſht; and the Spirit of Power,
of Love, and of a ſound Mind, was given
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Comforts of the
Holy Ghoſt, were Communicated to me,
in ſuch a manner and meaſure, as (unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably)
paſſeth my Frail Capacity, to tell
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54102:53"/>
forth, or expreſs. Which occaſioned me,
to call to Mind, my former Wondering;
and Muſing (while going on, in the way of
my Ignorant, and Blind Zeal (in Serving
God) before the Spirit of Bondage viſited
me) to think, what the Joy of the Holy
Ghoſt ſhould mean? Whenever I did Read
of the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt: Or, did
hear any mention thereof. Joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(think I) Lord what is that? What is
the meaning of it? I cannot tell; or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
what this Joy of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould
be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Spirit of Adoption was
given me, whereby I was enabled to come
to God's Throne of Grace; and with a
Holy, and Humble Boldneſs; to call him
my God, and my Father. The Inſtinct in
the New Creation wrought (by the God of
all Grace) in me; led me to God, as the
Fountain of all Good.</p>
               <p>The Spirit (given me) putting into my
Mouth, Words of Solemn Thanks, and Praiſe;
for the Greatneſs, and Strangeneſs of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>To my Knees I betook me, Adoreing
and Worſhipping (with my Spirit) That
Holy <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Trinity in Unity, and Unity
in Trinity; Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;
the True and Eternal God. Whom all the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54102:53"/>
time of my Blind Zeal, and during the time
of my Bondage State) I had ſo Ignorantly
Worſhipped. I was now (and never before)
Enabled (<hi>Jacob</hi> like) to catch hold of, and
to Wreſtle with a Reconciled God. The
Greatneſs, Holineſs, and Infiniteneſs of his
Majeſty, (which before I knew him in Chriſt
terrified, and affrightned me, with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
Animated and Encouraged me, in
Praying to him. It is not to be Expreſt
(in Words) with what Alacrity, and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Spirit, I approached the Throne
of Grace; and with what Enlargedneſs,
and inward Meltings of Heart, and Soul, I
called on God. When I did but mention
this, My God, and my Father; Oh! what
Raviſhment of Soul, did I (Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally)
feel, Overflowing and Drowning my
very Spirit?</p>
               <p>To my Bed I went, with a Glad, &amp; Raviſh'd
Heart. Chriſt knows, The Burning Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which the Horror, and Bondage
of my Wounded Deſpairing Conſcience
cauſed in my Body, was gon; and my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys
Diſpoſition to Crookedneſs (thought
the ſinking weight which lay on my Spirit
within) was Inſtantly Rebuked, and cauſed
to Retreat, by the Glad, and Joyful Tide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Goſpel Peace; which (that Night)
took up its Lodging within me; Succeeding,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54102:54"/>
and Powerfully Supplanting that Spirit of
Bondage, which made me ſo hopeleſs, and
(as I thought) Paſt all poſſibility of eſcape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hell.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was I ſtretched in my Bed, but
Swooning and Fainting Fits of Love Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeized me: I was Inwardly (and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually)
ſo Apprehenſive of the Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Chriſts Incarnation, his Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himſelf (even to Death) his lying
Confined (as a Priſoner) in the Grave; and
his being Raiſed therefrom; (again) his
Aſcending to Heaven, (from whence he
came) and his Sitting down at the Fathers
Right Hand; to Enter on the Work of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
with God. And that as my Surety
and Mediator, and all for me; that I verily
thought my Body was near its Diſſolution.
A thing, which the clear and certain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(given me) of my being an Adopted
Son of God; made me (even) Long and
Pant after. My Thoughts, and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
were (now) wholly Employed about
Chriſt, and that Bleſſed Change which I
(Senſibly) felt, was Paſt on me. The
ſweet and Soul Raviſhing Communion, I had
with Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; was (to
me) inſtead of Meat, Drink and Sleep, and
that the moſt Pleaſing and Satisfactory, that
I ever Enjoyed. The Actings and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54102:54"/>
of Chriſt (in the aſſumed Nature) for
me, were ſo realized, and the Virtue, and
Reconciling Efficacy, of the ſame, ſo (ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly)
ſet home, on my Wounded and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul, by the Spirit of Adoption, that I
thought I had the Perſon of Chriſt claſpt in
my Arms in the Bed. Oh! The ſweet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſes,
which (by the Operation of the
Holy Ghoſt) paſſed between Precious Jeſus
and my Languid Soul. Then was I made to
know (Experimentally) the meaning of
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. While I was Wakeing, I was
entertained with ſtrange variety of Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
(or Diſcourſe) which Paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and me, which did Explain
and Unfold to me, that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, I continued in ſuch a Melting
Frame; that the very Pillow-beer under my
Head, was, as if dipt in a River, through
the great abundance of Tears (of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
Joy) which the Senſe, and feeling
of Chriſt's Love, conſtrained me to ſhed.
When I found a neceſſity of turning in my
Bed, I could not turn without my Dearly
Beloved, and (Incomparably) Loving Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
in my Arms with me.</p>
               <p>When I Slumber'd, and Slept, I was ſoon
viſited with moſt Joyful, and Raviſhing
Dreams, of God, Chriſt, Holy Ghoſt, the
Glory of Heaven, and the unutterable Bliſs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54102:55"/>
and Felicity, of thoſe Souls, who are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God, by Chriſt. This was
very Frequent, and common when Sleep
came on me, after I had been Sealed in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving.</p>
               <p>And albeit, I never durſt to heed, or
mind Nocturnal Dreams; yet they have
(ſometimes) had ſuch a ſtrange Influence
on me, that I have felt ſuch delightful Joy
and Comfort in my Spirit, that (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
I have been at a ſtand, to think;
whether I had been aſleep, or awake.</p>
               <p>It was a frequent Practice (with me) for
ſome conſiderable time (how long I cannot
now Remember) to ariſe in my Bed; (when
I awaked out of My ſleep) to Bend my
Knees, and lift up my Eyes, Hands, and
Heart to heaven, to Land, Praiſe and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify,
Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; for the
greatneſs, and ſtrangeneſs, of my ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and unlook'd for Salvation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but the Night before (yea, and every
Morning) ready to Drop into final Deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
of ever being Saved. Oh! What
a loſs was I at, in my ſelf? Not knowing
how (ſufficiently) to Extol and Bleſs God;
for what had now befallen me. I was (even)
ready to quarrel with my ſelf; becauſe of
the narrowneſs, and ſtreightneſs of my
Soul, which hindred that I could not take
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54102:55"/>
in more of God: and go out in more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Expreſſions of Love, and Praiſes to him.
For above ſix Months (together) I could
neither lye down, nor ariſe; go down, or
come up Stairs; paſs in or out, from one
place to another; but I ſtrongly Conceited
that I perceived a Guard of Angels attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Perſon.</p>
               <p>It cannot be Expreſſed, with what ſcorn,
and abhorrence; I look'd on the Pride and
Gallantry of the Family where I Lived.
Their Changeable Suits of Rich and Glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Apparel, with their Choice Meats, and
ſweet Muſick, with other delightful Paſtimes,
I look'd on, and accounted them, but as
Smoak and Duſt. The Titles of Worldly
Honour, wherein the Reſt of my Relations
did (not a little) Glory; I accounted the
ſame, but a meer empty Vanity.</p>
               <p>Oh! (think I) That my Poor Relations
could ſee, taſte, and feel, what I do: how
would they diſreliſh, and be aſhamed, and
weary of theſe Poor, periſhing, ſenſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
wherein they Place their Delight,
and Felicity.</p>
               <p>When (at any time) I heard them talk
(boaſtingly) of the Honour and Credit of
the Family; I could not forbear, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
my Contempt, of the ſame: Telling
them (to their very Face) that the Blood
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54102:56"/>
of Jeſus; not the Blood of my Progenitors
(according to the Fleſh) was that which
made me Noble, and truly Honourable.
And that he, or ſhe, who were advanced
to the Higheſt Degree of Honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Earthly King, could (poſſibly) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
and were not waſh'd in the Lambs
Blood; the Higher their Honour and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is; the greater, and more Intollerable,
would be the Doom, and Condemnaton
of ſuch, when (by Death) they go hence.</p>
               <p>Now I began to diſreliſh, and diſcover
what ſmall èſteem I had, of the Liturgy
and Ceremonies, of the Church; of which
I had (formerly) been ſo (extreamly) Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>Three Things (chiefly) occaſioned this.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> The apprehenſion I had, of the
Purity and Holineſs of God's Nature;
which requires a Worſhip ſuited to his own
Pure, and Spiritual Being, according to
that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Conſidered, that no Worſhip
could (poſſibly) find acceptance with God,
but ſuch a Worſhip as is ſtamp'd with God's
own Inſtitution: which I was (then) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
(and am now more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced)
the Liturgy, and Ceremonies of
the Church are not, the ſame being Deviſed
by Men: and Impoſed (by Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54102:56"/>
without any the leaſt Warrant from
the Word of God. According to <hi>Eſa. 8.
20. Eſa. 29. 13. Mat.</hi> 15. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſad Experience I had, of the
uuſuitableneſs of ſuch a Worſhip to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
and a Renewed Soul, while I was
in a Natural State, Ignorant of God, and
the Nature of my Soul, and things truly
Spiritual. I was exceeding Zealous in doing
and Performing that Service, which (now
I find) is of little avail; either to a Pleaſing
God, or profiting an awakened Conſcience.
The Spirit of God having (in effectual
Calling) Taught and Convinced me, that
no Worſhip or Ordinance (in Religion)
can be Food to Nouriſh, and Satisfy, a
Hungry Soul; But ſuch Worſhip, as
is Inſtituted by (and ſuited to Pleaſe)
God.</p>
               <p>God will be found (Savingly) of none, but
thoſe, who ſeek him in the Ways of his own
Inſtitutions. According to <hi>Prov. 8. 32.
1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, The Care and Providence
of Chriſt (my Chief Sheppard) directed
me to attend the Miniſtry of Mr. <hi>Samuel
Mather,</hi> with whom, I (afterwards) ſate
down (in full Communion) to my Souls
great Comfort, and Edification, in the
Knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54102:57"/>
Notice being taken (in the Family, where
I lived) that I diſcontinued going to the
Cathedral Worſhip (the which I commonly
attended, with a more than ordinary Zeal,
ſometimes three times, and ſometimes four
times in the ſame Day) And that I was not
ſeen at the Pariſh Church, on Sabbath Days,
or at the Sacrament; as I uſed to do, the
Eyes of mine Obſervers, were upon me,
to watch me what ways I took in Religion.
Innumerable were the Taunts and Scoffs
caſt on that way of Worſhip, which I had
Eſpouſed and cloſed with; thorough all
which I was carried with invincible Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
Many and ſharp were the Combates
wherewith I Encountered, from my own
Relations eſpecially, the Lord of <hi>Santry</hi>
(in whoſe Family I then liv'd) and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(his Brother) who by their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over me, and the greatneſs of their
Learning and Parts, (between which and
mine, there was no more compare than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sun and a little twinkling Star)
did (frequently) attack me, to bring me
back to the (forſaken) Chruch of <hi>England,</hi>
but all in vain.</p>
               <p>One time (above all others) my Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
that I abſented, not only the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip, but that of his Family alſo,
ſent up his Secretary (another Brother's
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54102:57"/>
Son) to call me to Prayer, in the Family,
on Night. My Couſin delivering my Lords
Command; I reply'd, that I was under ſome
Indiſpoſition; and therefore, Pray'd my
Couſin to excuſe me to my Lord: down he
goes, and no ſooner had he delivered my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but up he comes again, with the ſame
Meſſage, from my Lord. I threw him off
the Second time, with the ſame Excuſe,
alledging, that I could not come. This
Anſwer brought to my Lord, the Second
time. He (in a great Rage) ſends up my
Couſin, with a Peremptory Command, that
I muſt come to Prayer: my Couſin ſtood
ſome conſiderable time, expecting that I
would Anſwer my Lords Peremptory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but my Anſwer was, that ſeeing my
Lord had ſo plainly impoſed on my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in Commanding me to Act againſt
my Conſcience, I thought it was my Duty
to declare, that untill I better underſtood
it to be my Duty, to Obey his Lordſhip
(in a thing of this Nature) than as yet I did,
I neither could, nor would go to joyn in
Prayer, with the Family. This Reply
coming to my Lord's Ear, he let me alone,
for that Night. The next Day my Lord
took me to Task, Examining (very ſtrictly)
and Demanding of me, a Reaſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came not to Prayer, with the Family
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54102:58"/>
ſeeing they never uſed the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>
in the Family?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom I made this Reply.</hi> My Lord,
It is not from any Averſion I have to Prayer,
that keeps me Back, from coming to Prayer
with the Family: But the great Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Lodged in my Conſcience. For, my Lord,
(<hi>ſaid I</hi>) ſhould I (under my preſent Light, and
Conviction) go on my Knees, to joyn in ſuch a
Service, where God is ſo notoriouſly Diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and his Glorious Name ſo greatly Profan'd,
my Conſcience would (like a Flame of Fire)
fly in my Face.</p>
               <p>The Lord then Demanded of me, what I
could Object againſt the Service Perform'd
in the Family?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom I Reply'd,</hi> That the Chief
Objection I made, was againſt the Perſon, who
Perform'd the Service.</p>
               <p>The Lord Demanded, what I had to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
againſt the Perſon, who Pray'd in the
Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom I Reply'd,</hi> That I Objected
againſt him, for Two things. Firſt, that
he was a Rotten <hi>Arminian,</hi> denying the
Doctrine of Election, and Juſtification, by
the alone Imputed Righteouſneſs, of the
Son of God. And that he alſo Held falling
from Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54102:58"/>
Secondly, For that he was in his Life
and Converſation, a notorious Drunkard,
and a common Curſer and Swearer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord then Demanded, Why I did
not come to Family Prayer, when his Son
<hi>James</hi> ſaid Prayers? Reader, thou muſt
know; That when the Chaplain would be
Drinking, and Ryotting abroad, ſometimes
my Lords Son would be Commanded to
Read one of the Evening Prayers at the end
of ſome Bibles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this I Anſwered,</hi> That his Son was
but a Child, and did not underſtand what he
Read.</p>
               <p>Lord have Mercy on me (ſaid my
Lord) who would you have Pray in my
Family?</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid I) I Humbly conceive, no
Man Living is fitter for a Service of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than your Lordſhip. The Great God
having made your Lordſhip, King and Lord
over your own Family, and hath Endued your
Lordſhip with ſuch Incomparable Gifts of
Knowledg, and Learning, and (I hope) of
Grace too.</p>
               <p>And Pray Sir! (ſaid my Lord) How
would you have me Pray?</p>
               <p>My Lord (ſaid I) I Humbly Conceive,
that you are to Pray, according to the preſent
Condition, of the Souls of your Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54102:59"/>
Pray Sir! (ſaid my Lord) How is it
Poſſible for me to know the Inward
Thoghts and Condition of my Families
Souls, ſo as to Order my Prayers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly?</p>
               <p>My Lord (Reply'd I) albeit your Lordſhip,
cannot (poſſibly) Acquaint your ſelf with all
the Secrets of your Family, yet you may by
Catechizeing your Family, and frequently Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
them, about the State of their Souls,
and Gods Dealing with them; find Matter
enough, to Enlarge on, in Putting up Prayers
to God for them, in the General: which is, as
much, as the Rule of Duty directs (or obliges)
to.</p>
               <p>My Lord finding that the Truth I was
call'd to Vindicate, and the Spirit by which
I ſpoke, to be too Powerful for his Great
Learning, he let fall the Diſpute; which I
am very ſure was his Wiſdom, and his beſt
Advantage, ſo to do: Conſidering, that
none ever yer proſpered who continued to
fight againſt God.</p>
               <p>My Lord (by this means) found how I
ſtood affected in Religion; and (according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
Communicated to my Father, his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Apprehenſions of me. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
a Conſultation was held (about me)
to Conſider what Methods were moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to take; not only to prevent my far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54102:59"/>
Advancing, in that way (of Religion)
which they Accounted Phanaticiſm: But
alſo, to bring me Back to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> whereon I had turn'd the Back.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of their Conſultation (as
ſoon afterwards appeared) Iſſued in a fixed
Reſolution to carry it towards me with all
the Urbanity, and Gentleneſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
My Relations conſidering, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(full well) that my Temper, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
was to be drawn, and won by Fair
and Gentle means; not to be Forc't, by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>According to the Methods agreed on; I
was (at a ſtrange and unuſual Rate) Treated
by my Father, my Lord, my Grand-Mothers,
my Uncles, and Aunts, with the
Reſt of my Relations; in ſuch ways of
Kindneſs and Love; as cauſed in me,
ſome hopes, that the Love and Kindneſs
they ſhew'd, and Expreſs'd in their Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with me, had Sprung from an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
(or Conviction) in them, that
the Principles (in Religion) which I had
Embraced (in oppoſition to theirs) were
the Truth. But I (ſoon) found that I was
(herein) miſtaken. For, It was not long
before great offers were made me, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Purſe, to Set me up in the World;
On condition I would deſiſt going to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54102:60"/>
and return apain to the Church
(wherein I was Born, and Baptized:) And
not bring ſuch diſgrace on the Holy Church,
of which my Anceſtors were ſuch Noted,
and Eminent Members. And beſides, That
I might not ſtain my Family, by occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Peoples ſaying, that a <hi>B—</hi> (and, one
who was Son to a Father in the Church) was
turned Phanatick. To which they Added,
The Conſideration of what a hopeful Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
there was before me, of Advancement
to Worldly Greatneſs, in Caſe I did not
hinder my ſelf, by Continuing a Diſſenter
from the Church.. And what hardſhip,
and Poverty, I muſt expect to Wreſtle with,
to my own Ruin, and the great Diſgrace of
the whole Family, in Caſe I refuſed the
Offers made me, and the Advice, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
given for my own good.</p>
               <p>To all which, I was enabled (with an
Holy Magnanimity, and becoming Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude)
to Reply, that the Sight and Senſe I
had of a Future Happineſs (with God in
Heaven) had Blunted, the Edge of my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
to theſe Poor, Low, and Empty Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
which (I queſtion not) will prove
unſpeakably more Vain, Empty and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
to me then they are in themſelves)

               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54102:60"/>
In Caſe (ſaid I) my Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who ſeem ſo greatly concern'd, for
my Good, can procure (from Heaven) an
Infallible Certificate, that my Cloſing with
the Preſent offer (on ſuch a Condition, as
is now laid before me) will not provoke the
Holy Trinity, and prove a Snare to my Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Soul; I ſhall readily comply: But if
they cannot, it will (ſaid I) Prove your
Wiſdom, to let me alone, to Rejoyce in
the Choice I have made Had my Relations
felt, what I have felt for Sinning againſt
God; and could they taſt the Joy, and
Sweet Comforts of God, which have put
me out of Conceit, and Love, with the
preſent World. They would (I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not) be not only unwilling to Blame,
and Cenſure me, for the choice I have
made; but they (themſelves) would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Heartily, make the ſame Choice,
for which I am now ſlighted and judged to
be Miſerable.</p>
               <p>My Relations finding how ineffectual
their Methods prov'd to gain me, they ſoon
turn'd their Smiles into Frowns, and their
kind Speeches, into Diſcourageing Menaces,
what ſevere Courſes ſhould be taken with
me, to reclaim, and reduce me to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:54102:61"/>
My Lord threatned (ſeverely) that
he would have me bound with Ropes
on a Porters Back, and brought into
the Church, in the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this I Reply'd,</hi> That if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
did not as well Gag my Mouth, as Bind
my Hands and Feet, I would (certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
Roar out, and Diſturb, all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

no Force (of that kind) was offered
me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome conſiderable time, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Lord, finding that neither Fair
and Gentle means, would Allure, and
Draw me to the Lyturgy, in their Church;
and that no Severity (wherewith they
threatened me) could Drive me from the
Pure Worſhip of God, in the Meetings. I
was ſoon Attack't with greater, and ſharper
Oppoſition, than I had (before) met with
from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By my Father, Who (in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and Hearing, of at leaſt Forty of
our Family) took me to Task about my
Principles, and in regard of the ſmall
hopes he had of Convincing me, by the
Arguments he uſed: He openly declared,
his Reſolution, never to own me, for his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54102:61"/>
Son; Unleſs I forſook the Meetings, and
came to the Church and Service again, as
formerly. And this Sir! (ſaid my Father)
I think fit to tell you, before all theſe
Friends, to the end you may take it into
Serious Conſideration, whether of the
Twain, you Judge more Eligible; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
your Fanatick Opinion, and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Companions; or, to be deprived of
the Love, and Affections of a Father. And
know it Sir (ſaid he) that I do, by the
Authority of a Father, Command and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you to fix on, whether of theſe two,
you intend to Chooſe, and that within a
Week: If you reſolve to hold your New
Opinion, I charge you, to quit my Lords
Houſe, and Provide another Lodging; and
as for me, I charge you, that you come not
near my Doors, or any of your Brethren,
or Siſters Doors. I'll ſee (ſaid he) which
of your Holy Brethren or Siſters will take
you in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this, I was enabled to Reply thus,</hi>
(viz.) Sir, Though you Reſolve (according
to your preſent Declaration) to caſt me out of
your Paternal (or Fatherly) Affections, and
to diſown me for your Son (meerly) for my
Conſcience to God, becauſe I cannot (without
greatly offending againſt God, and Wounding
my Conſcience) Conform to thoſe Inventions of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54102:62"/>
Men, in God's Worſhip, for which, I can ſee
no Warrant in all the Scripture. I think
(and Judge) it my Duty, (now the Providence
of God calls me to be Try'd) to be as open, free,
and plain, in declaring to you (in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and Hearing of the ſame Relations
who have heard yours to me), theſe Two things.
<hi>Firſt,</hi> That I hope better Things of you, than
to ſee you Act ſo unnaturally in letting your
Child Periſh for want of Neceſſaries for Life,
And that becauſe, I dare not Act againſt my
Conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in Caſe, you do Reſolve,
to Perſiſt, in this your Reſolution, I am
as (fixedly) Reſolved, in Caſting my ſelf;
on the Promiſe, and Providence of God, what
ever comes of me, in this World.</p>
               <p>And before I will Act (herein) againſt the
Light of God's Word, and the Dictates of
my Conſcience within, I hope I ſhall be Enabled
to Chooſe rather to Dye (with <hi>Lazarus</hi>) on a
Dung-hill, for want of Bread. <hi>My Father
(to his Death) kept his Reſolution: and I
(through the ſpecial Grace of God) have
been Enabled to keep mine, and (I hope)
ever ſhall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this (about three Days) I had a
great and ſharp Diſpute with my Lord,
which Continued three Hours and a half
(by my Lord's Chamber Clock.) The
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54102:62"/>
Subject of our Diſcourſe, was about Set
Forms of Prayer: Whether the Word of
God, would Warrant ordinary and fallible
Men, to Compoſe Set Forms of Prayer,
and by Humane Authority to Impoſe
the ſame, on the Conſciences of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>My Lord peremptorily Affirm'd that
Gods Word did Warrant this. And I as
ſtiffly denied that it doth.</p>
               <p>For Proof of the Affirmative, my Lord
Quotes <hi>Luke 11. 2. When ye Pray, ſay,
Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Sir (ſaid my Lord) here's
a Poſitive, Command to prove what I have
Affirmed.</p>
               <p>To this, I ſhall (Humbly) offer Two
Things to your Lordſhips Serious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The apparent differnece between
the Two Evangaliſts, in Setting down
the Words of this Prayer: <hi>Luke</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>When ye Pray, ſay, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> (as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9.)
ſaith, <hi>After this manner therefore Pray
ye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I cannot underſtand (ſaid I) how your
Lordſhip can Reconcile theſe Two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts;
ſo as (Peremptorily) to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54102:63"/>
from the Place now Quoted, that
it is the Mind of Chriſt, that theſe
Words are to be Impoſed on Believers,
as a Prayer, or as their Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By way of Humble, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
Enquiry; Doth your Lorſhip firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Believe, that the Form (now Quoted)
to Prove the Affirmative is (in it ſelf)
a Compleat and Perfect Prayer, containing
all the parts of Neceſſary Prayer?</p>
               <p>I Grant it Sir, (Reply'd my Lord) I believe
it is a Compleat, and a Perfect Prayer,
containing (in it) all the Parts of Neceſſary
Prayer.</p>
               <p>I likewiſe (Humbly) Preſume, That
your Lordſhip takes it for Granted, that
it is the Mind of Chriſt, that this Form
of Prayer is to be Impoſed on Believers, as
their Prayer?</p>
               <p>I Grant it Sir, (ſaid my Lord) I take
it for Granted, that it is the Mind of
Chriſt, that that Form, ſhould be Impoſed on
Believers, as their Prayer.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord (Reply'd I) If the Form
(now mention'd) be a Compleat, Perfect
Prayer; to which nothing need to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and that the ſame is to be Impoſed
(on Believers) as their Prayer, and that by
Chriſt's own Authority. To me it is very
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54102:63"/>
plain, that for any men, to Make,
or Impoſe, any other Prayer, on
themſelves, or others, it is a manifeſt
Breach, and Violation of that Command
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will Inſtance in a Plain Caſe (for Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration
ſake) The Ten Commandments,
in the Law Moral, I doubt not but your
Lordſhip owns them to be a Moſt Perfect,
Compleat Rule of Righteouſneſs; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
all the Parts of our Duty to God
and Man.</p>
               <p>I Grant them to be ſo (ſaid my Lord).</p>
               <p>In the next Place (ſaid I) I Queſtion not,
but your Lordſhip (as readily) Grants,
That this Perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs;
is Commanded, and Enjoyn'd, by God's
own Authority.</p>
               <p>I Grant that alſo (ſaid my Lord) They
are Commanded, and Enjoyned, by God's own
Authority.</p>
               <p>Then (ſaid I) the Caſe is Plain, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deny'd, That for any, to Command,
or Appoint, any Rule of Righteouſneſs:
beſides thoſe, which (in themſelves) are
Compleat and Perfect; and which are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd,
and Commanded by God's own
Authority; it is a manifeſt Breach, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of the Supream Law: to which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may be Added; and from which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54102:64"/>
may be Detracted; without Incurring
the Diſpleaſure, and Curſe of God. <hi>Deut.

               <p>From Prayer, My Lord fell off; to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Liturgy, and Ceremonies in
General, the which he Handled, almoſt,
in all the Particulars of them: And with
ſuch Advantagious Succeſs (on my ſide)
that my Lord (at length) grew weary,
and leſt off: he having (I doubt not)
found that Scripture in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 2. made
good that Day. But whether he became
ſenſible thereof, yea, or not; ſure I am,
that I found that ſweet Promiſe, in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
15. made good to me that Day. Of which
ſuch notice was taken; that hardly any of
my Relations durſt Attack me any more,
except, in a way of Reproach; and Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the Phanaticks, and the New
Religion I had eſpouſed, ſince I left the
Church. <hi>The Good Lord be (for ever) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
and Praiſed, for his Mercy, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs,
to his poor, and deſpiſed Children in
a time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the laſt Encounter I had with
my Lord, about Religion; for that very
Night I took my Leave of my Lord, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humble and hearty Thanks to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
for all his Expreſſions of Love and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54102:64"/>
Kindneſs, wherewith I met under his
Roof, ſince I became a Member of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>It were endleſs to Relate, the many and
ſharp Tryals, to which the Providence of
God called me, (that I might be brought
up in in the School of the Croſs, and fitted
for the Service, to which I was afterwards
Called) out of all which, his (never, never
failing) Providence brought, and delivered
me.</p>
               <p>Should I Expoſe in Print the many
ſtreights and difficulties, wherewith I have
(occaſionally) been Exerciſed, from the
time of my cloſing with Chriſt (in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
to the time of my Call to the Miniſtry.
(Together with the Methods Providence
took to bring me off; and working mine
Eſcape and Deliverance) I believe it would
be Matter of Joy and Rejoyceing, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and (ſeriouſly) Religious Souls. But
my intended Brevity forces me to omit
many Particulars, which would (I do not
queſtion) be of great uſe, both to my ſelf,
and others.</p>
               <p>From what I have here Publiſhed, concerning
God's Dealing with me: Let the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Obſervations, be (Practically) Improv'd,
to God's Eternal Praiſe.</p>
               <div n="1" type="observation">

                  <head>OBSERVATION. I.</head>
                  <p>See, and take Notice, What a Sweet
and Harmonious Concurrence there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God's Electing Purpoſe of Grace,
and his Providential Diſpenſations. The
Foundation of all God's Gracious Dealings
with an Elected Sinner, is his own <hi>Gracious
Purpoſe, fixed in Eternity. Jer. 31. 3 The
Lord hath Appeared of old unto me, ſaying,
yea, I have Loved thee with an Everlaſting
Love; therefore with Loving Kindneſs have
I drawn thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here Note, That Everlaſting Love (in
the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) ſignifies a Love of Eternity.
From whence I make this Obſervation,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That God Loves his Elect, from one
Eternity to another. With this agrees
that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. According
as he hath Choſen us in him, before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World.</hi> This Diſcovery of
God's Love to his Elect, is as a Millſtone
laid on the Back, of that <hi>Popiſh, Arminian</hi>
Doctrin; of a Temporary, and Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Election, to ſink it into the Bottomleſs
Depth, of the Eternal Abhorrence, and
Loathing of God, the Elect Angels, and all
Saved Sinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:54102:65"/>
Therefore from hence Learn, What to
think, and ſay, when the Devil, and thy
vain Heart, Suggeſt unto thee. (Upon thy
doing, and Performing any Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice)
now the Lord hath Elected (or will
Elect me; becauſe I have done thus, and
thus. Reader! The Devil (who ſeeks thy
Ruin) is (cordially) Reconciled to ſuch
an Election, as this: becauſe, he knows it
will end in thy Eternal Ruin, if God leave
thee here.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Repel, and Stave off, this
Curſed, Popiſh, <hi>Arminian</hi> Dream, by (ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly)
Believing, and Affirming, that
God's Electing Love Embraced me in its
Arms; and Regiſtred (or Enrolled my
Name in the Lambs Book of Life, before I
had a Perſonal Being; or any Capacity, to
do or perform any Duty, which could move
God to Elect me.</p>
                  <p>Then, when the Devil, and thy remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Unbelief, ſuggeſt unto thee (upon any
perſonal miſcarriage, or fall into new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
againſt God) now God hath caſt
me out of his Love, and Rejected me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have broken Covenant with him.
Repel this Temptation, by conſidering, and
(ſtedfaſtly) Believing, that the Electing
Love of God, which Embraced me, and
Enrolled my Name in the Lambs Book,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54102:66"/>
(before the Foundation of the World) it
is a Love, like God himſelf: <hi>As without

of fruſtrateing Gods Decrees, and his
Working Providence. The Deaths, and
Dangers, to which I have been (ſo often)
expoſed, have been ſo many and greatly
dangerous; that had not Gods Love to me,
and his Providence over me, preſerved me,
I had (certainly) periſhed. The Snow in
which I lay, for Four or Five Hours, (at
ſo tender an Age, as but three Months
old) was as powerful to have killed me (by
the Extremity of its peircing Cold) as it
was to deſtroy the vaſt Numbers of Men and
Cattel, which have often Periſhed by its
Strength.</p>
                  <p>The Element of Fire, which ſurrounded
me in my Bed, (when buried in Sleep, and
no way able to help my ſelf) it was of as
devouring a quality, to deſtroy me, as the

The Feirceneſs, and Teeth, of the great
Maſtiff-Dog, which had my Head in his

Lions (in the Den) were to cruſh <hi>Daniel;</hi>
had not the Care and Providence of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
God, which Reſtrain'd his Lions, watch'd

                  <p>The Element of Water, in which I was
(ſeveral times) a Drowning, and (to all

powerful to ſwallow me up, and to ſtop my
Breath, as it was to over-whelm, and choak
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt; had not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd

                  <p>The great Boar, How ſtrong and ready

not Divine Providence (ſo ſtrangely, and

When for Chriſt and the Goſpel,
was forſaken, and caſt off, by my Father,
and all other Fleſhly Relations (being turn'd
out, empty handed to the wide World, and

                  <p>I was forſaken of my Bodily Phyſitians,
But the Great Phyſitian of Soul, and Body,
Cur'd me, by poor Contemptible Snails.</p>
                  <p>I was forſaken of my Earthly Father,

Father, who will never forſke me Totally,
or Finally.</p>
                  <p>I was forſaken, by my Brethren, and
Siſters; But thoſe who are the Sons and
Daughters of God, they are become my
Brethren, and Siſters. And albeit, many

Chriſt my Lord and Maſter hath been ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>I had Thoughts of Printing the moſt

            <p>LEſt Satan ſhould get an Advantage,
by this Relation, of God's ſtrange
and wonderful dealing with me, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me Home to Chriſt (in ſuch an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
manner) and his Handling me ſo
ſharply, by the Spirit of Bondage. As
alſo, his Bountiful dealing with me, in
making my Soul, the Receptacle, of ſuch
Raviſhing Joy, and unutterable Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
upon Believing (in Chriſt) in
Effectual Calling. I thought it may be
ſeaſonable, to give the preſent Caution,
to the Poor Doubting, Tempted Believer;
who (through Satans Subtilty Tempting)
will find him (or her) ſelf wretchedly
Prone to Conclude (from what they read
of my Converſion) That the Work of
true Converſion, was never yet (effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
wrought in themſelves. And that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54102:70"/>
becauſe, they were never under ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
Bondage of Soul. Neither (ever
yet) were lifted up ſo near Heaven as I
was.</p>
            <p>Such Poor Tempted Believers, are to
conſider, the Particulars following, for
their help, and relief, againſt the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider, That as in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
there is a vaſt diſparity, or difference
between Perſons, in the Natural Birth;
ſo there is as vaſt a difference, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Birth. Some Women go through
(abundantly) more, and ſharper Pains,
and Throws in Travel, than others meet
with. Some Babes, meet with greater
difficulties, and dangers in the Birth,
than do others. The cauſes whereof (in
Nature) tho they appear not to us, yet it
is moſt certain, that ſo it is.</p>
            <p>So in Converſion, ſome Souls paſs
through greater Horror and Bondage (in
the Conſciences than others do. Some are
brought (as it were) through the very
Jaws of Hell, and deſparation (as I was)
others are dealt more eaſily and gently with,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54102:71"/>
Being ſweetly allured, and (as it were) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
Tranſplanted into Chriſt, they not
well knowing what is done to them. <hi>Paul</hi>
and the rugged Jaylor, were handled more
roughly, their Conſcience were more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wounded, with the frightning Terrors
of God's Law (ſet Home by the Spirit of
Bondage) than <hi>Lydia,</hi> whoſe Heart the Lord
opened, with more gentle Touches of his
Spirit. <hi>Acts 9. 6. Acts</hi> 16. 15, 29.</p>
            <p>That Woman who is ſafely Delivered,
without any danger or great difficulty to
herſelf, or her Babe, hath no reaſon to
queſtion, whether ſhe be indeed Delivered,
becauſe ſhe went not through ſuch danger,
and difficulty as her Neighbour did, who
narrowly eſcaped with her Life: neither
hath ſhe any Cauſe, of being Jealous with
her Neighbour, becauſe her caſe or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was more dangerous and deſperate in
Travel than was her own. Thou who art
brought to Chriſt, by the gentle Drawings
of the spirit of Grace; and not brought
ſo nigh, to the affrightning ſight of Hell.
And to ſuch a Senſe, and feeling, of the
Pains of the Damned: As have cauſed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54102:71"/>
ſome to think themſelves (actually) in
Hell. Admire at, and Bleſs God, for
his Condeſcention towards thee, in bringing
thee through the New Birth ſo eaſily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, That albeit, the
truth of thy Converſion, be not ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diſcern'd, as the Converſion of that
Perſon is, who is brought Home in the
way of Legal Terror. Yet thou art bound
to Bleſs God, for the ſmalleſt meaſure of
Grace, beſtowed on thee, as the ſmalleſt
Spark of Fire (tho' it be hid under a great
heap of Aſhes) is as truly Fire, as the
greateſt Fire in Nature. So thy ſmall
Grace, which (in compariſon of ſome
others Grace) may be ſo weak, and little,
that it can ſcarcely be diſcerned, yet Grace
it is, tho' thou know it not to be ſo. And
he who beſtowed it on thee, and wrought
it in thee; he will never reject or neglect
thee, becauſe of thy little Grace, while he
ſees thee Conſtant and Diligent, in the
uſe of means Labouring to grow in Grace.

Oh! But I do not find, that I am
brought to Chriſt, and which is far worſe,
I fear, I never ſhall.</p>
            <p>To this, I Anſwer, in Two Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thy very fear, about this (great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of Concerns) is an Argument of thy
Tranſlation from the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to the
Second <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.
If the Spirit of Grace, had not given
thee, ſome Sight and Taſte, of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
and Sweetneſs of Chriſt; thou
couldeſt never prize, or deſire after him.
'Tis only the Child that hath Taſted the
Hony or Sugar, that Longs, and Crys for
more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou findeſt a fixt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in thy Soul, in going on to ſeek the
Lord. And his Strength, by Prayer and
Supplication: and other means of Grace,
not reſting in, or depending upon them,
but on Chriſt (alone) for Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
My Life for thine, come Death,
when God Pleaſeth to ſend it: it will end
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54102:72"/>
all thy fears, and put thee beyond the
reach of all thine Enemies. Thy fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Crying to God, (in Prayer) for
Chriſt, and Saving Grace: is the Eccho
of Chriſt Praying (for thea) at the Throne
of Grace. And thy going on, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
to Watch at Wiſdoms Gates, could
not (poſſibly) be, without inviſible Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Spiritual Strength, Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
