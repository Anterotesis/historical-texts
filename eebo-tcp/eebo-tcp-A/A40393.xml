            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough by that infinite distance I am in

the Apologies in the world for this
Attempt; yet when I reflect upon
your own admired Candour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the most inferiour Addresses, and my
own Duty in making this, I need not, I hope,
use a Complement to excuse that, which I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could, nor ought not, but to have done.
For the Author of these Sermons, had that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to your Grace, and your self that Favour
for him, that no other name is so fit, or so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to prefix to any thing of his as your Graces.
And besides, I may very reasonably suppose,
that there may be something in the following
Papers, that may not be unfit to be offered to
such a Personage. I humbly therefore pray, that
either the one, or the other may excuse the
forwardness of this Dedication. As to my own
very great obligations to your Grace, I will not
be so Conceited as to mention them. For when
I have told so Publick, I need not add any
Private Reasons. And besides, it may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by the World as a design to gain a
<pb facs="tcp:57113:3"/>
Reputation to my self, by talking of Favours
from a Person of such Eminence. Yet I beg

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I do not call, I suppose Thee
judicious, and shall therefore give
to Thee, and to my self the ease of
saying little. For I am sensible
enough, that the Author of these
following Sermons will be to all that
read them, so much his own Advocate, that they
will not want any Orator in the Preface. And to
those that read them not, he said nothing, nor
shall I. Passing then by on purpose those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Procuring a fair reception to the Book, by
the ordinary Pageantry of Commendations; I think
it will be enough to assure Thee, that as the Author
left the Copies fairly writ by his own hand, so they
come as truly his to thine. For this Reverend
Person doing me the Honour of leaving me his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
by that I had the Possession and Care of all
his Papers. And amongst them, These I found to
be so worthy of the Publick, that I concluded it a
Trespass against the common interest to keep them
in my own hands. But that too which made me
the more confident of their value, was the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of many, and to that the Approbation of as
great a Person as the Church has any, for their
Impression. And accordingly I did forthwith upon
the Doctors death, committ the Copies to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
who very disingenuously for some years delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and at last utterly refused (for what ends I
<pb facs="tcp:57113:4"/>
know not) the Printing them. But retriving them
from him, I have put them now into honest mens
hands, from whence I hope they will come well cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

they will speak enough for themselves, and need no

SERMON
ON
The First Sunday in Advent.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>S. MATTH. xxi. 9.</bibl>
               <q>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying,
Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is he that cometh in the
Name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Lessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord!</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
is any coming and going that comes so: <hi>Hosanna</hi>
to him, God bless him, or <hi>Hosanna</hi> for him; God be
blessed for him, whoe're he be. All <hi>that went before,</hi>
and all <hi>that follow,</hi> all men will say so.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>in Nomine Domini incipit omne malum,</hi> said <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
once, <hi>In the Name of the Lord begins all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</hi>
(And we still find it so) the whole game of mischief begun and
carried on in <hi>nomine Domini, under the Name of God,</hi> as the Lords
work. How should we do then to discern the right <hi>in Nomine Domini,</hi>
when he that comes in the Name of the Lord, comes truly so? Many
ways peradventure may be given to know it by; but this is the shortest;
If <hi>the multitudes that went before, and that followed after, cry Hosanna</hi> to
him, if the <hi>Saints</hi> of former Ages and their successours approve the
manner of his coming, if it be in a way the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> has from
its first beginning allow'd for Christian; that is, if he come meek and
lowly, humbly riding upon an Ass, with Palms and Olives, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Peace and Love; then he comes <hi>in nomine Domini</hi> right; but
if proud and scornful, with Horse and Chariot, Sword and Spear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Olive Boughs and Branches, with a Sword to cut in sunder
the bond of Peace and Unity, and a Spear to keep off Charity: Let
him cry out <hi>in nomine Domini,</hi> talk of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and take his name into
his mouth never so much, 'tis but a meer <hi>in nomine,</hi> and no more, a
meer pretence and name, no <hi>Domini,</hi> nothing in it really of God; nor
the multitudes before, nor the multitudes that follow, nor any of the
Primitive Christians ever sung <hi>Hosanna,</hi> gave any blessing or approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such comers or their comings. He that comes here in the <hi>Text,</hi>
came nothing so; and he that will come after him, must not come so,
<hi>Hosanna</hi> to no such.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57113:5"/>
But <hi>Hosanna to him that</hi> truly <hi>comes in the name of the Lord:</hi> Gods blessing
with him. To him that comes so in the <hi>Text, to the Son of David,</hi> to him
no question. 'Tis the business, both <hi>Text</hi> and Time, the words in hand,
the days in hand, the days of holy <hi>Advent</hi> are to teach us, to sing
<hi>Hosanna's</hi> to our Saviour, to bless God for his coming, to bless <hi>him</hi> for his
coming, all his comings, all his ways of coming to us; to bless his day
that is a coming, whence all his other comings come: to bless him in the
highest, with heart and tongue, and hand, to the highest we can go, that
he may also bless us for it in the highest.</p>
            <p>That it might be done the better, <hi>Holy Church</hi> has design'd four <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
to prepare us for it, wherein to tune our pipes, and fit our instruments
and voices to sing <hi>Hosanna</hi> in the right key, the highest pitch, to praise
God as is fitting for Christs coming.</p>
            <p>A business sure well worth the doing, and some good time for it
worth the observing, if we either think him worth it, that is here
spoke of as coming, or his coming worth it. Indeed the coming in the
<hi>Text</hi> is not the coming of that Feast that is now a coming, but it is
one of the ways prescribed by the <hi>Church</hi> for our better coming to the
Feast, by preparing with these multitudes some boughs and branches,
some <hi>Hosanna's</hi> and <hi>Benedictus's,</hi> some provision of holy thoughts and divine
affections for it. They <hi>that went before, and</hi> they <hi>that followed</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi>
sung <hi>Hosanna</hi> for a lesser coming of Christs, then that was in the flesh:
we may well do it for a greater; especially making this in the <hi>Text</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or note to ascend to that, one coming to usher to the other; the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of his coming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a way to exalt the greater humility of
his coming into the world. And we have the multitudes before, and
the multitudes that follow, all <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before rejoycing with Father
<hi>Abraham</hi> at his day, and all the <hi>Fathers</hi> since; all that went before or
follow'd since his coming, former and later Christians for our example.
They all in their several Generations thought fit yearly to remember it,
and so long, even four <hi>Advent Sundays</hi> together, to prepare the multitudes
and people for it; that so by preaching to them the way and manner of
all Christs comings, they might 1. perfectly be instructed who it was
and is, that truly comes blessed <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by pretenders and pretences: and 2. also truly and duly give
the blessing where it ought, sing the <hi>Hosanna</hi> when, and where, and to
whom we should, celebrate the memory of Christs coming right, and
<hi>Hosanna</hi> it as is meet.</p>
            <p>Thus did all that went before; and 'tis fit they that come after
should do as much, unless they were wiser or better then all that went
afore them. And all will do it, but those who are afraid to have their
comings discovered to be no comings <hi>in the name of the Lord</hi> by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeness
of their comings; afraid to lose their <hi>in nomine,</hi> the name how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to have the multitudes that follow them fall off from them, if they
should be taught by day, or time, or Text, how far different their ways
and comings are, from the humble lowly comings and ways of Christ,
whose name they so much pretend to come in, though their own name
be the only name they truly come for.</p>
            <p>Better example we have here before us, and by Gods blessing we will
bless with them; follow them in blessing Christ, both himself and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in the time and manner all that have followed him ever did it. And
to do it the better, and more according to <hi>Text</hi> and time, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p>I. Who they were that here blest Christ for his coming. <hi>The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57113:5"/>
that went before, and that followed,</hi> both of them says the
Text.</p>
            <p>II. What was their way of blessing, how they did it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> says the
<hi>Evangelist,</hi> they <hi>cried,</hi> cried it aloud.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Their Song of Blessing, what they cried,</hi> Hosanna to the Son of
David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the
highest.</p>
            <p>When we have throughly considered these particulars, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
nothing but a word of Exhortation to follow them that thus go
before us; as they cried it and sung it before, so we still to cry it and
sing it after them. I begin with the persons, that we may in the first
place know whom it is we follow, the <hi>multitudes that went before, and that
followed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that to the Letter is no more then those companies of people, Men,
Women, and Children who went out to <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> to meet our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
at his coming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when he came riding thither upon an
Ass, some of them before him, some behind him, crying out <hi>Hosanna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many they were it seems, and not a single multitude neither, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
in the plural, several multitudes that did it; and though it be no
argument to prove any thing good or lawful, because the multitudes do
it; yet when the multitudes do good, 'tis good to take some notice of it:
nay when so many do it, it looks the better. The Song of praise sounds
never better then <hi>in the great Congregation, and among much people.</hi> The Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
never sweeter in the ears of Heaven, then when the Choir is fullest;
a good note to teach us to fill Holy Assemblies, to bear our parts in the
Congregation.</p>
            <p>And in this Congregation 2. the Musick it seems has all its keys and
voices: Men, Women, and Children, all sing their parts: no Sex or Age
to think themselves exempted from bearing part in Gods Service: though
the <hi>Apostle</hi> will not suffer Women to preach and teach, he will give them
leave to sing and pray, to answer the Responses, <hi>Antiphones,</hi> and Versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the Hymns and Psalms; the little Children too to learn betimes to
lisp them out: no better seasoning of their mouths then with Prayers
and Praises to their Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Nor 3. were these multitudes meerly the rout of people; there were
men of all conditions in them, though it may be not many <hi>Iosephs</hi> or <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus's,</hi>
yet some no doubt; so many of the Rulers having had their
sick Servants or Wives or Children healed by him. There are none too
good or great for Gods Service. 'Tis no disparagement to any mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be among those multitudes that go out at any time to meet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
no dishonour to say <hi>Amen</hi> with the meanest in them, to joyn with
them in any part or point of Gods Service. You may remember the
nobility of the <hi>Bereans</hi> above the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> is by the Scripture Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
placed in this, that <hi>they received the word with all readiness of mind, and
searched the Scriptures daily,</hi> Acts xvii. 11. in short, were more religious
and devout, and earnest in the way of Christ, to worship him then the
other.</p>
            <p>Nor 4. were these multitudes Choirs of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Clerks,</hi> or only
Orders of Religious men; it was a Congregation of <hi>Seculars,</hi> though
there were <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> in it: 'tis St. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> own note, to
tell us, men are not to put off the work of Devotion and Religion
wholly to the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Clerk,</hi> as if they only were to sing the <hi>Benedictus,
Hosanna's,</hi> or <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> and the multitudes only stand looking on; or
think men in some Religious Orders were only oblig'd to live orderly and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57113:6"/>
like Christians, all secular or lay-men as they pleas'd. <hi>Non ita sane, non
ita est,</hi> says he, <hi>It is not so indeed, it is not so: Hoc plane est quod evertit orbem
universum.</hi> 'Tis this. <hi>It is plainly this,</hi> this false opinion or fancy, <hi>that ruines
all the world.</hi> Behold the multitudes here going before, crying, and the
multitudes following after, answering them in their <hi>Hosanna to the Son
of David,</hi> all ranks of people, the most secular, so religious grown since
Christs coming. 'Tis to be fear'd he is going from us, or will be quickly,
if we omit our parts, if we forget our duties, if we once begin to think
too much of bearing part or share in his Service, either in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
or out of it.</p>
            <p>But 5. however, they that pretend to go out to meet Christ, to have
more sense of Devotion, and Zeal to it then others, they above all sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will be easily heard in their <hi>Hosanna's</hi> or <hi>Benedictus.</hi> The more devout
we are, we sing the louder; the more earnest we be to meet our Lord, the
more welcome will we give him, the higher gratulations and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to him. Whoever fail in their parts, methinks such should not. If
we pretend to love him more then others, then more prayers and praises
to him then others: if we love him more, they will be more, and we will
not be ashamed to profess it in the multitude, nor think much to be in the
multitude among the meanest or poorest at it.</p>
            <p>Surely not, seeing 6. the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves think not much to do so,
seeing them so ready, so eager, so violent, in giving honour to him; can
it be expected that Christians should be behind? but they before, and
we not behind? Too much it is that they before and we behind; it
should be rather, we before and they behind: though they got the start
in time to get before us, we should sure in measure get it, go there before
them. Christ came to them, and they go out to meet him: He comes
to us, and we go from him. He came to them at this time with a sad mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of destruction, and therefore weeps in the mount of his triumph
to look upon the City, and yet they entertain him with <hi>Hosanna's.</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the name of the Lord: so come things to pass. He comes to us
with tydings of great joy, such the <hi>Angels</hi> term it, his Birth no other
coming; yet we think much to sing <hi>Hosanna's</hi> for it, to keep a day of
praise, or a song of praise, or a face and garb of praise: the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
they that do so, less sensible of Christs favours then the very
multitude, then the Jew himself. Rare Christians the while, that think
no better, speak no better, rejoyce no better at Christs coming, at his
greatest and most gracious coming.</p>
            <p>I cannot say this multitude to the Letter, and in the Story are any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
argument for our <hi>Hosanna's.</hi> Yet when a multitude does well,
'tis good to follow them: but take it now 2. in the mystery, and there
needs no greater to perswade us.</p>
            <p>The multitudes <hi>before</hi> are in the mystery, the Holy <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and
<hi>they</hi> that <hi>followed</hi> are the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Now what the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi>
have rejoyc'd at, that must we. <hi>Abraham,</hi> says Christ himself, <hi>rejoyced to
see my day, he saw it and was glad.</hi> Yes, your Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was glad.
He was glad to see Christ a coming, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> viii. 56. The <hi>Prophets</hi> are
every where full of joyful expressions, at the mention of the <hi>Messia's</hi>
coming; their eyes lookt, and their hearts long'd for him: and the
<hi>Prophet Zachary</hi> calls to us to tell it out with Joy, to the Daughter of
<hi>Sion,</hi> tells punctually even of this very joy and coming too, <hi>Zach.</hi> ix. 9.
And <hi>what was written before time,</hi> either by <hi>Patriarch</hi> or <hi>Prophet, was written
for our learning,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. xv. 4. We may do what they did,
what they would have us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57113:6"/>
Or 2. The multitudes before in the mystery are the <hi>Iews,</hi> the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
that follow are the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Both bidden by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to rejoyce,
<hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 10. <hi>Rejoyce ye Gentiles with his people,</hi> his people, the <hi>Iews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> behind, all shall rejoyce in his salvation: for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is now coming to the <hi>Iews,</hi> glory to his people <hi>Israel,</hi> and light unto
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to light them by his coming. So sang old <hi>Simeon</hi> in his Song,
S. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 32.</p>
            <p>3. The multitudes before is the <hi>Iewish Synagogue,</hi> the multitudes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> a multitude indeed that cannot be numbred,
<hi>Revel.</hi> vii. 9. of Emperours, and Kings, and Princes; Bishops and
Priests, Doctors, Martyrs, Confessors, and Virgins, all in their several
Orders and Generations, crying, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David, the whole
world gone after him.</hi> Before indeed only, <hi>Notus in Iudaea Deus,</hi> God only
<hi>known in Iury,</hi> Psal. lxxvi. 1. his coming only talkt of in <hi>Israel,</hi>
but after <hi>quam admirabile nomen tuum in universa terra!</hi> Psal. viii. 1. <hi>O Lord
our Governour, how wonderful or excellent is thy name in all the world.</hi> All these
multitudes, the <hi>Iew</hi> with his multitude of <hi>Patriarchs, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi>
and <hi>Singers,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> with his Sacrifices of Bulls and Rams, and
Goats, and Sheep, of Types and Figures, all crying out <hi>Messiah's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Christians, <hi>Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Doctors, Virgins, Bishops,
Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> and all several Orders in their Choirs and <hi>Churches</hi>
throughout the world, crying out he is come; all the corners of the earth
resounding out <hi>Hosanna's</hi> and <hi>Allelujahs</hi> to him. <hi>Vna est fides praecedentium
at que sequentium populorum,</hi> says St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> all believing and professing
the same <hi>he</hi> that cometh here; they the <hi>Iews</hi> before crying <hi>he</hi> that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi>
we the <hi>Christians</hi> crying he that <hi>is come,</hi> or rather he that cometh still,
that every day comes to us by his Grace, and through his Word, and in
his Sacraments: <hi>Blessed is he that cometh</hi> still, not a tense or tittle chang'd; he
that comes being the same for ever, eternity and things eternal being
ever coming, never gone or going.</p>
            <p>So now the Congregation is full, what should we do but begin our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
when we have <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> to countenance and
bear us company in our <hi>Te Deum</hi> and <hi>Benedictus,</hi> at our Prayers and Praises;
in our Joys and Festivals, all of them crying nothing but <hi>Christ,</hi> nothing
but <hi>Christ,</hi> blessed be he, blessed be he, and blessed be his coming, and
blessed be his day, and blessed be his deeds; the whole practice of all
Christian Churches and Congregations, that ever were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>in nomine Domini, in the name of the Lord,</hi> till these meer nominal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
<hi>Christians</hi> that are afraid of the name of him that cometh, of the
name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> of blessing it or bowing at it; all Christians, all that
came before in the name of Christ, till these pretenders that follow no
body but their own fancies; all agreeing in the same welcome to their
Redeemer, joyning in the same prayers and praises: what should we do
but add our voices and sing with them? better sure with the multitudes
before and behind, the whole multitude of <hi>Saints</hi> of so many Ager, then
with a few scattered headless heedless companies forbear it; better pray
and praise with them, then prattle and prate with these; better their
<hi>Hosanna</hi> and <hi>Benedictus</hi> to him <hi>that cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi> then these
mens sensless Sermons and Discourses, who come in their own name,
and of their own heads, without Gods sending them at all. Having then
so full a Choir, so many voices to bear us company, let us also now sing
with them.</p>
            <p>Yet that we may be sure to sing in Tune, let's first listen a little to the
key and more they bless in: 'Tis a loud one, for 'tis a crying; <hi>they cried:</hi> not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57113:7"/>
in the sense we often take it, for a mournful tone or note (for 'tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of joy and gladness. So S. <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 37. <hi>They began to rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c.)
but with a loud voice it was they praised him, that's the meaning, so
expressed in the same <hi>verse</hi> by that <hi>Evangelist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed true it is, God has turn'd our songs of joy into the voice of
weeping (as the <hi>Prophet</hi> complains) taken away our Feasts and gaudy
days; and we may well cry, and cry aloud in that sadder sense of the
word crying: yet for all that, must we not lay down the other, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Song of prayer and praise, especially upon the point of <hi>Christs</hi>
coming to us. Here it must be crying in another tone, singing, speaking,
proclaiming the great favour and honour of him <hi>that cometh in the name of
the Lord.</hi> Blessing, and honour, and glory to him that so cometh. Now
that we be not out in tune or note, let's mind the word, we shall find the
sweetest ways of blessing in it.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis a loud crying, such is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that teaches us to be devout
and earnest in our prayers and praises, in blessing <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. 'Tis loud and to be heard, to instruct us not to be asham'd of our
way of serving Christ; he that is, Christ will be asham'd of him: so
Christ professes, S. <hi>Mark</hi> viii. 38.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis the crying of a multitude, many multitudes, and intimates to
us what prayer and praise does best, even the Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lick and Common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis the crying of several multitudes, the same thing, and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
peace and unity; that's the only Christian way of praising God:
one God, and one Faith, and one Christ, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> and one heart
and mind of all that profess them; and 'twere best one way of doing
it; the same <hi>Hosanna,</hi> the same <hi>Benedictus,</hi> the same voice and form of
prayer and praise, and Worship, if it could be had.</p>
            <p>5. 'Tis of some before, and some that follow; 'tis not a confused or
disorderly note, or way, hudling and confounding all together, but the
voice of Order, where every one sings in time, in tune, and place; some
begin and others follow, and the <hi>Chorus</hi> joyns, all in decency and order:
this to preach decency and order to them that come in at any time, or
call any where upon the name of Christ, even the very multitude here
in Christs praise keep their parts and order.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis a crying, yet of joy we told you, the voice of mirth and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that we may know Christ is best served with a chearful spirit. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is no such dull heavy thing as some have fancied it, it admits of
Mirth and Songs, so they be <hi>in nomine Domini,</hi> either to the praise of
God, or not to his dishonour, so they be not light, or wanton, or scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or such like.</p>
            <p>7. This crying here is general, and our praises of God must be so too;
all that is without me, and <hi>all that is within me praise his holy name:</hi> all the
powers of my soul, superiour and inferiour, all the organs of my body,
all the instruments of my life and living, my estate and means, all to
concur in giving praise to God, in celebrating the mercies, the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
the condescensions, the out-goings and in-comings of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
            <p>Thus we have the key and tune of blessing God and Christ devoutly,
confidently, publickly, unanimously, orderly, chearfully, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
with all our faculties and powers. Let's now hear the Song of
praise, <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David, Blessed is he,</hi> &amp;c. And that we may
sing in tune, let's know our parts.</p>
            <p>Three parts there are in it as in other Songs, <hi>Bassus, Tenor,</hi> and <hi>Altus,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57113:7"/>
the <hi>Bass,</hi> the <hi>Tenor,</hi> and the <hi>Treble. Hosanna to the Son of David,</hi> there's
the <hi>Bass,</hi> the deepest and lowest note, the humanity of Christ <hi>in filio Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
being <hi>the Son of David;</hi> the <hi>Bass</hi> sings that, that's low indeed for him,
we can go no lower. <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi> there's
the <hi>Tenor</hi> or middle part, he and the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> joyn'd together,
God and Man united, that's a note higher then the first, the Mediator
between God and Man; God in the highest, Son of <hi>David</hi> in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
the middle note then follows. And <hi>Hosanna in altissimis,</hi> the <hi>Altus</hi> or
<hi>Treble,</hi> the highest note of all, we can reach no higher, strain we never
so high.</p>
            <p>We begin low, that's the way to reach high; <hi>Hosanna to the Son of
David:</hi> Yet as low as it is, 'tis hard to hit, hard to reach the meaning of
it. <hi>Hosanna</hi> a hard note, so Interpreters have found it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> will have it an Interjection only, to express rejoycing,
like that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Io triumphe</hi> among the <hi>Latines.</hi> The
truth is, 'tis an expression and voice of joy and gladness, though no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjection:
an expression us'd by the Jews at the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> a
joyful acclamation, enough to authorize common and received expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of joy, though it may be they that use them do not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; especially joy inexpressible (such as ours should be for the
<hi>Son of Davids</hi> coming) may be allow'd to express it self as it can, or as
it does in other rejoycings, when it can do no better.</p>
            <p>Some interpret it Redemption, others an Hymn, or Praise, others
Grace, others Glory, others Boughs <hi>to the Son of David:</hi> All yet concur
in this, that 'tis a joyful wish for prosperity to <hi>Christ</hi> under the title of
<hi>the Son of David;</hi> Grace, Redemption, Praise, and Glory, Psalms and
Hymns, and all the other outward expressions of Thanks, Respect, and
Joy be given to him who now comes to <hi>restore the Kingdom of his Father Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
Nothing too much to be given to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> for him they always
mean by <hi>the Son of David:</hi> No inward or outward joy enough for the
coming of our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Hosanna</hi> mean all these several rendrings, yet the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is no more then <hi>Salvum fac,</hi> or <hi>salva obsecro, Save we beseech thee,</hi>
like our <hi>Vivat Rex, God save the King. Save the Son of David we beseech thee,</hi>
and save us by <hi>the Son of David.</hi> For both it is: A prayer to God to
preserve and prosper him, that he may have good luck with his honour,
and ride on; and a prayer to God to save and deliver us by and through
him, or to him to do it, <hi>Salva o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cro, O fili David, O fili</hi> for <hi>filio. Save
us we pray thee, O Son of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time you understand <hi>Hosanna</hi> to be both a prayer and a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
a short Collect and a Hymn both, an expression of rejoycing
for Christs coming, with a prayer that it may come happy both to him
and us. Thus you have it in <hi>Psal.</hi> cxviii. 24, 25. whence this seems ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be taken or to relate. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, We
will rejoyce and be glad in it;</hi> there's the voice of rejoycing: then follows
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Help me now O Lord, O Lord send us now prosperity:</hi> the
prayer upon it.</p>
            <p>'Tis an easie observation hence, that our rejoycings are to consist in
Prayers and Praises, in Hymns and Collects; no true <hi>Hosanna's</hi> to Christ,
no true blessing him but so; no keeping <hi>Christmas</hi> or any Feast without
them. To spend a day in idleness, or good cheer, is not to keep <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi>
To keep <hi>Christmas</hi> is not to fill our mouths with Meat, but our lips
with Prayers and Praises; not to sit down and play, but to kneel down
and pray; not to rest from work and labour, but by some holy rest and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57113:8"/>
retirement from temporal labour, to labour so to enter into eternal rest.
The business of a <hi>Holiday</hi> is holy business; <hi>Hosanna</hi> business of <hi>Christmas,
Christs</hi> coming so to be solemnized with solemn prayers, and praises, and
thanksgivings.</p>
            <p>And there is more then so in this <hi>Hosanna.</hi> It was the close of certain
Prayers and <hi>Litanies</hi> used by the <hi>Iewish Synagogues;</hi> like our <hi>Libera nos Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
our <hi>Good Lord deliver us,</hi> in our <hi>Litanies.</hi> They first reckoned up the
names of God, God, Lord, King of Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to each <hi>Hosanna;</hi>
then his Attributes, his Mercy, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to each <hi>Hosanna;</hi> then what
they desired, both in publick and private, and for each <hi>Hosanna.</hi> All
resound <hi>Hosanna,</hi> all eccho out <hi>Hosanna,</hi> save, and help, and prosper us.
'Tis no new thing it seems, or of <hi>Popish</hi> Original, to use publick <hi>Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and <hi>Liturgies;</hi> 'tis but what the <hi>Church</hi> of God has ever had in use,
the way from the beginning it always serv'd him in. The very Petitions
of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> are all taken out of the <hi>Iewish Sedar,</hi> or <hi>Common-Prayer-Book:</hi>
and if <hi>Christ</hi> himself who wanted neither words nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to pray, thought fit yet notwithstanding to make use of received ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and antient forms; I conceive not why any that profess him,
should think themselves wiser then their <hi>Master,</hi> and reject old and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Forms of Prayers and Praise. Yet indeed we cannot well expect
they should keep a Form, that will not keep a day to bless him for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
We that resolve of this, may be resolv'd of the other, that no way
like the old to do it in.</p>
            <p>That teaches us to pray the <hi>Messiah</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> may Reign, that his
Kingdom may prosper and be enlarged, that we our selves may be of it,
and prosper in it, that we may have Redemption and Salvation, Grace
and Glory, sing Hymns and Songs of Praise to him both in his Kingdom
here upon Earth, and in his Kingdom in Heaven. This the way of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him at his coming to entertain our selves, and time in blessing him
for his goodness, and desiring of his blessing.</p>
            <p>And yet besides there is as much Faith as Devotion to be here learn'd
from the multitude in this <hi>Hosanna.</hi> There is an acknowledgment of
his Office, that he was <hi>Messiah.</hi> They it seems believed it. I suspect
they that love not to have a day to mind them of his becoming <hi>the Son
of David,</hi> of his Nativity, do scarce believe it: If they thought his
coming real, we should have some real doings at it; they would be as
busie in it as the best. Were <hi>filio David</hi> well grounded in us, did we
really believe him <hi>the Son of David,</hi> we would also become the Sons
of <hi>David,</hi> who was a man of Prayer and Praise, sons of Praise, sing <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna's</hi>
as fast as any: 'Tis only want of Faith that hinders Works; we
believe not in him as we should, what e're we talk, else we would do to
him as we should, accept all his comings, even upon our knees, at least
with all thankfulness, and such Devotion as time and place required of us.</p>
            <p>And 2. we would raise our voices a note higher, add <hi>Benedictus</hi> to
<hi>Hosanna. Blessed is he that cometh,</hi> &amp;c. Bless God, and bless him, and
bless his coming, and bless his goodness, and bless his power, and bless
his fulness, and bless his work, and bless his purpose; desire God to
bless him, and man to bless him, and also bless our selves in him; for
no less then all these is in the words.</p>
            <p>Blessed <hi>first</hi> be God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, Blessed be the Lord
God of Israel, <hi>that</hi> he hath visited and redeemed his people, and hath raised up a
mighty salvation for us in the house of his Servant David. <hi>So old</hi> Zachary,
<hi>S.</hi> Luke i. 68. 69. <hi>Blessed</hi> be God the Father <hi>for the Son,</hi> God the Father <hi>for
the Son of</hi> David<hi>'s coming to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57113:8"/>
Blessed 2. be the Son, blessed be he that cometh, blessed be <hi>Our Lord
Iesus Christ</hi> for his coming, for to him is blessing due, that he would
vouch safe to come and bless: bless the Father for sending, the Son for
coming; blessing to them both for thus blessing us.</p>
            <p>Blessed 3. be his coming, all his comings, his coming in the Flesh, his
coming in the Spirit, his coming in Humility, his coming in Glory: his
coming in the Flesh, that's a blessed coming for us, whereby all other
blessings come unto us; his coming in the Spirit or by his Grace a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
coming too, and still daily coming; his coming in Glory, that may
be a blessed coming to us too, if we bless him duly for his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
if we truly and devoutly rejoyce at his first and second coming,
no doubt but we shall also triumph at his last. That he cometh, came,
and will come unto the end, is blessed news; we therefore with these
multitudes so bless him for it.</p>
            <p>Blessed 4. be his goodness, and that's evident enough in his coming
to us: bless him for that he would be so good to come, when all good was
going from us, when we our selves were gone away from him, run away
as far as well we could, that he would come after us.</p>
            <p>Blessed 5. be his power and authority, for <hi>in the name of the Lord</hi> he
comes, not in his own name, but in the <hi>Fathers</hi> that sent him, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> v.
43. confess, acknowledge, submit to his power and authority; that's
the true way to bless him.</p>
            <p>Blessed 5. be his greatness and fulness of blessing, blessed be his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
for he is full of blessings; in him all fuluess is and dwells, <hi>Col.</hi>
ii. 9. <hi>God blessed for ever;</hi> Rom. ix. 5. Let's make this acknowledgment
of him, profess and proclaim it as they do here call him, the ever
blessed.</p>
            <p>Blessed 6. be all his works, actions, and passions, the works of our
Redemption, Justification, Sanctification, Glorification, which all come
to us only through his Name and Merits. Attribute we all to him and to
his Name, <hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the praise</hi>
and glory of all these great and wonderful things.</p>
            <p>Blessed lastly be all his purposes and intentions towards us, he came to
reveal his Fathers will unto us; bless him for that: bless we should all
such that make known unto us the will of God; <hi>Beati pedes Evangelizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,
Blessed be the feet of the Ministers of the Gospel;</hi> much more this <hi>great
Archbishop of our Souls</hi> that sends them. He came to glorifie the <hi>Father,</hi>
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> viii. to teach us to do so: bless him for that. He came to save
and deliver us from all kind of evil, however we wilfully thrust daily
into it, some or other; bless him for that, say all good of him, that
wishes and works all good to us: but which is only truly to bless, further
we all purposes what we can, and help them forward, that he and we
may be glorified by the hand.</p>
            <p>For this blessing is not meerly a form of words; we must 1. earnestly
and heartily desire God to bless, to bless all Christs ways of coming
to us, that we may joyfully, and chearfully, and devoutly entertain him.
Desire God 2. to bless him that cometh in his name, him whoe're he
be that he sends to us: but this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> especially, that his coming
may come abroad to all the world, all come in unto him. Desire 3.
that man may bless him, incite the sons of men to sing praise too unto
him. <hi>Praise him all ye Nations, praise him all ye people;</hi> strive what we can to get
all we come nigh, to come with us, and bear a part in blessing him.</p>
            <p>In a word, bless we our selves in him, think, and profess, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57113:9"/>
our selves blessed that Christ is come to us, that we have our part
and portion in him; place all our joy, all our rejoycing, all our triumph
that he is with us, that the <hi>name of the Lord is declared</hi> unto us, that by
his coming the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> is called upon us, that we are now of
his retinue, that we now belong unto him, that he is daily coming in
us.</p>
            <p>And for this <hi>Hosanna</hi> now 3. <hi>in excelsis,</hi> indeed, <hi>Hosanna to him in the
highest,</hi> sing we it as loud as we can reach, as loud as we can cry it.</p>
            <p>And that may pass for the first interpretation of <hi>in excelsis,</hi> that we are
to cry it as loud as we can cry it, do what we can to express our joy, how
we can to give him thanks, to exalt his praise what we are able, <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsis,
to the highest</hi> of our power; so <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlviii. 1. <hi>Praise him in the
height.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all of us <hi>in excelsis,</hi> in our highest, yea, and 2. the very highest,
the very most <hi>in excelsis</hi> of us all, the highest of us, is too low to praise
him worthily; yet praise him, O ye highest, ye Kings and Princes of
the earth, <hi>Kings of the earth and all people,</hi> Psal. cxlviii. 11. come down
from your <hi>excelsis,</hi> and lay your Crowns and Scepters at the feet of this
King (as S. <hi>Luke</hi>) that cometh, and submit all your Kingdoms to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ; make ye all your Kingdoms to bless his, that your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
also may be blessed.</p>
            <p>Nay, and yet there are higher then these highest, who are to praise
him, <hi>Praise him all ye heavens,</hi> Psal. cxlviii. 4. Praise him all ye Angels,
praise him all his Hosts, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. So S. <hi>Luke</hi> intimates it when he expresses
it, peace on earth, in Heaven, and glory in the highest: glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the peace that is made between Heaven and Earth by him that
cometh here in the name of the Lord, by whom says the <hi>Apostle</hi> all
things are reconciled, <hi>Whether they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven,</hi>
Col. i. 20. <hi>Hosanna in the highest,</hi> for this peace with the highest, sung
be it by Heaven and Earth, by <hi>Angels</hi> and Men; the <hi>Angels</hi> sung some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a like Song at his Birth when he was coming into the world; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as St. <hi>Luke</hi> interprets it, and will sing it again if we invite them
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> does, to sing with us: and we must desire it, that God
may be prais'd: all glory both in Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>That's the way indeed to <hi>Hosanna in the highest,</hi> as it is a Song of
Praise: but 'tis also we told you a prayer, that even our praises and the
ground of them may continue.</p>
            <p>A prayer 1. to God <hi>in excelsis,</hi> the most highest, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks.
<hi>Save us O thou most highest.</hi> No salvation but from those everlasting hills
of mercy, salvation to be look'd for from none else, the very meanest of
the multitude know that.</p>
            <p>A prayer 2. for salvation <hi>in excelsis,</hi> that he would deliver us with a
high hand, work salvation with a mighty arm; such as all the world
might see it: that he would magnifie this King that cometh, and exalt
his Kingdom that cometh to the clouds, set it above the reach and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of malicious men, make it grow and prosper, maugre all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and opposition of the highest and strongest of the earth.</p>
            <p>A prayer 3. for salvation <hi>in excelsis</hi> indeed, for salvation in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Heavens; not only to be delivered here, but to be sav'd hereafter;
not only for Grace and Righteousness here of the highest pitch, but for
glory of the highest order: a prayer that God as he has exalted him
that here came in his name, so he would exalt us all that call upon his
name, to sit at his right hand in heavenly places, in the highest right.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57113:9"/>
So these multitudes pray, and so pray we; so praise they, and so praise
we. Do what we can our selves to praise and bless him, and do what we
can to get others do it; call upon the <hi>Angels</hi> to joyn with us, do it with
all our might and strength, stretch out our voices, scrue up our strings:
nothing content or satisfie us in our prayers or praises, but the highest,
the highest thankfulness, the highest devotion, the highest expression
and way of both, that either the multitudes before, or the multitudes
that follow, <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> former or latter <hi>Saints</hi> ever used before us.</p>
            <p>All perhaps cannot spread carpets, cloths, and garments to entertain
him; nor have all Boughs of Palms, or Olives to meet him with; all
have not wherewith to make a solemn shew and flourish; but all have
tongues, all may sing <hi>Hosanna's</hi> to him; or if that word be hard, all
may cry <hi>Save us Lord,</hi> and <hi>Blessed be he that came and cometh.</hi> If we have
neither substance to praise him with, nor solemn Ceremonies allowed us
to praise him by, nor solemn Services permitted to pray to him, or to
praise him: we have yet Words, and <hi>Psalms,</hi> and Prayers to do it with,
and times and places that none can hinder us. And if we set about it
<hi>in excelsis</hi> with high courage, such as becomes the Servants of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and neither fear the face of man nor Devil: we may do it <hi>in excelsis</hi>
too, with high Solemnities. Our <hi>Hosanna</hi> to be sav'd, <hi>Save us O King of
Heaven when we call upon thee:</hi> our Prayers will save us from any thing
that can hurt us; he that is in the highest will succour and defend us,
preserve and bless us, and if we follow him strongly with our cries, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
these multitudes close in their Devotion to follow Christ, sing out
his praise with courage, pray with fervency, go out to meet him with
joy, entertain him with gladness, own his coming with confidence, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
it with holy Worship, do all to the highest of our powers: our
<hi>Hosanna's</hi> shall be quickly turn'd into <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> our blessing him into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blessed our selves by him, and we with all the <hi>Saints</hi> that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or followed him, sing <hi>Benedictus's</hi> and <hi>Allelujahs in the highest;</hi> to
the highest God in the highest Heavens for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> is here sent in the verse before the
Text to prepare his way. Holy <hi>Church</hi> sends her <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists,</hi>
and Preachers still, four several days together
before the time (for so many <hi>Advent Sundays</hi> or great
days of Preparation there are in her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Holy <hi>Kalendar</hi>)
to do as much. Conceive <hi>me</hi> the voice of one of them
to day, of one crying in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> in a Land as
wild and barren of <hi>good,</hi> as any Wilderness of <hi>Water. Prepare ye the way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Indeed he had need of a better voice than <hi>mine,</hi> that cries it <hi>now</hi> to any
purpose. Need there is of a loud crier indeed, of <hi>Vox clamantis</hi> at the
highest, one to cry it aloud, and <hi>ring</hi> it in mens ears, to get them to it;
they have so almost forgotten, many of them, both day and preparation;
his <hi>day</hi> and his <hi>way,</hi> so many <hi>new</hi> ones have they of their <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, and where <hi>old</hi> day and way are <hi>both</hi> pretended to be observ'd,
there is too much <hi>Wilderness</hi> and <hi>Desart;</hi> so many wild, irregular, unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
passions and affections, such dry, barren doings, so much of our
own ways, and ends, and interests even in religious business, the streight
way deserted but too much, that we had need of some <hi>rough Iohn Baptist</hi>
to thunder it to awaken us.</p>
            <p>Nor will <hi>once</hi> crying it serve the turn. One single <hi>prepare</hi> will do no
good. <hi>Prepare, make streight, both</hi> little enough; and <hi>three Evangelists</hi> to
cry it so after the <hi>Baptist</hi> has done crying: again and again, over and
over, scarce sufficient to keep wild passions under, to work us to a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
preparation, to <hi>make</hi> streight paths, or <hi>keep</hi> them.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Gospeller for the day, has only the first part of the Text,
the other <hi>three</hi> have both, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 3. S. <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 4. and S. <hi>Mark</hi> here
in the Text. The <hi>Prophet Isaiah,</hi> whence the words are taken, has so too,
with some addition. Were we what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> would have us, we should
need no addition; but being what we are, <hi>line upon line, precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
here a little and there a little,</hi> are too <hi>little</hi> for it. It is best to take the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57113:11"/>
fullest, that our <hi>preparation</hi> may be the fuller, to take it too, out of the
mouths of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> witnesses; that so every word may be established
in our hearts, and in our memories: the <hi>Lords way</hi> prepared, his <hi>paths</hi>
made strait, the <hi>work</hi> done against his coming, whensoever, and howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and which way soever he shall vouchsafe to come unto us.</p>
            <p>The words are originally the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s, <hi>Isa.</hi> xl. 3. prophecied by
<hi>him,</hi> but proclaim'd by S. <hi>Iohn Baptist, Christs Herald</hi> to proclaim his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and his Harbinger to take up his lodging for him in the hearts of the
sons of men. And a <hi>Proclamation</hi> they are to all to prepare and to make
ready, make all ready to entertain him: And <hi>two</hi> points there are of it;
<hi>two</hi> parts of the preparation required in it.</p>
            <p>1. To prepare his way.</p>
            <p>2. To make streight his paths.</p>
            <p>This way of his divides it self you see into the <hi>great</hi> open road, and into
<hi>narrow</hi> paths: and each has its proper way of ordering; prepare to one,
and make streight to the other. <hi>Prepare</hi> his way, make <hi>streight</hi> his paths.</p>
            <p>But to prepare it for the fuller and easier understanding (for I preach
to all) I shall do with the <hi>Text</hi> as we do with our <hi>Rooms</hi> and <hi>Houses</hi> when
we prepare and make them ready; in doing that we turn things upside
down, remove them this way and that way, hither and thither, till we
find where to place them best. I shall use the words so here, <hi>disturb</hi> their
order, that I may bring all into the better order, and we all make the
better preparation, and set all things streight.</p>
            <p>Be pleased then to forgive me the disorder, and consider this <hi>way</hi> and
<hi>Paths:</hi> First, what they are: Then secondly, whose they are: Then
thirdly, this Preparation, that it must be: What fourthly, or how it
must be: And fifthly, by whom it must be.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What</hi> the way that is to be prepared, and what the paths to be made
streight, we must understand by the connexion of these words with
the former, and by the way St. <hi>Iohn</hi> went before us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whose</hi> they are, the <hi>Domini</hi> will tell us, the Lords they are.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>That</hi> prepared they must be, the <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Tense</hi> of the Verbs <hi>Parate</hi>
and <hi>facite,</hi> being the <hi>Imperative</hi> command here to do it, will assure
us.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>How</hi> prepared, the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of the same words will shew us,
when we examine what it is ordinarily to prepare and make
streight.</p>
            <p>5. By <hi>whom</hi> they must be prepared and streightned; the <hi>number</hi> of the
<hi>verb plural,</hi> and <hi>indefinite,</hi> will satisfie us. We are all to do it.</p>
            <p>So 1. What this way <hi>is,</hi> and what these paths <hi>mean. 2. Whose</hi> they are.
3. That prepared they <hi>must</hi> be. 4. <hi>How</hi> prepared they <hi>should</hi> be. And 5.
by <hi>whom</hi> prepared they <hi>ought</hi> to be, are the particulars, by which I
shall lead you in the <hi>way,</hi> and in the <hi>Preparation,</hi> prepare you the way to
prepare the way of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and make <hi>his</hi> paths streight; the only way
to have any comfort of his coming. I begin with the way, to shew you
what it is, that we erre not from it.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>This way</hi> say some, is the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, <hi>Cor spatiosum,</hi> so <hi>Origen;</hi>
and these paths the powers and operations of it. <hi>His way is in this Sea, and
his paths in these deep waters.</hi> Here the wind <hi>blows,</hi> and the tempest <hi>rises,</hi>
and the waves <hi>roar;</hi> the unruly passions make a noise and tumult, and so
as the Psalm has it, <hi>His foot-steps are not known,</hi> Psal. lxxvii. 19. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern his track by reason of their tumultuous doings. <hi>These</hi> are
they that are to be prepared, and stilled, and quieted, the <hi>Soul</hi> calm'd,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57113:11"/>
and laid, and smooth'd, that <hi>Christ</hi> may come into it. But this is the way
into which, and not by which he comes.</p>
            <p>The way by which he comes, or we meet him, is, first, the way of
<hi>Faith.</hi> Faith is the way <hi>by</hi> which he comes into the souls of men, the
way in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> worshipped the <hi>God of his Fathers,</hi> Acts xxiv. 14.
in and by which we first come unto our <hi>Lord,</hi> and worship him as <hi>did</hi> our
<hi>fathers.</hi> Prepare your hearts for it, prepare them for him, that when he
comes he may find faith upon the earth, in this <hi>earth</hi> of ours, where e're
else he miss it. And here as Faith is the <hi>way,</hi> so the several <hi>Articles</hi> of
it may pass for the <hi>paths. God</hi> grant we keep them right, and streight, and
our selves streight to them, in this <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>crooked generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The way secondly by which we meet him, is the <hi>Law, Mandata Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi>
says another. Not much distant from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s stiling it, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
to Christ, the way to bring us to him. The terrors and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Law a good way to <hi>prepare</hi> us for his coming: the <hi>Types</hi>
and <hi>Figures</hi> a good way to <hi>lead</hi> us to him, that we may see he is the same
that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is to come,</hi> the Saviour of all that were, and are,
and shall be sav'd, the same the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> promised, the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured,
the <hi>Prophets</hi> prophecied of, the <hi>Iews</hi> expected, the <hi>Apostles</hi> preach'd
of, the <hi>world</hi> believed on, and <hi>all</hi> must be saved by. With such thoughts
as these then are we to set upon our preparation: 1. To break our high
and haughty spirits by the consideration of the terrors of the <hi>Law,</hi> the
curses due to them that break it (and alas! who is it that does not?) so
to make way to let him in. Then 2. by the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> to confirm
our faith, and make them so many several paths to trace out his <hi>foot-steps,</hi>
and know his coming.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>third</hi> way by which we are prepared, or which we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for him, is <hi>Repentance.</hi> The very way St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> came to preach.
His <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> being the same with this,
<hi>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths streight.</hi> Those words of the
Prophet the Text, and his the Comment. No way indeed to <hi>Christ</hi>
but by this way. No way but by Repentance to begin it. <hi>Turn ye, turn
ye, says the Prophet,</hi> we are all out of the way <hi>God</hi> knows from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
If we will into the way again, into the way of our Lord, turn
we must, repent we must of our <hi>former</hi> ways, and doings, get us into
<hi>better</hi> ways. And then <hi>paths</hi> here will be the streight and narrow ways,
the <hi>rigours</hi> and <hi>austerities</hi> of repentance, the streightning our selves of
all our <hi>former</hi> liberties and desires, making our paths so streight and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that no <hi>tumour</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi> no <hi>swellings</hi> of lust, no <hi>pack-horses</hi> or heavy
carriages of the <hi>world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Devil</hi> may pass by that way any more, nothing
but <hi>Christ</hi> and his little flock of humble vertues, such as can enter at the
streight state, none else henceforward to walk in it. Prepare we repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and <hi>all</hi> its <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>paths</hi> for the third way and its paths.</p>
            <p>A fourth is <hi>Baptism,</hi> the way St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> came in <hi>too,</hi> a way that
<hi>nam'd</hi> him so, the way that was always thought to lead all to <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that came there in any <hi>ordinary</hi> way. <hi>Arise and be baptized,</hi>
Acts xxii. 16. that's the way to the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> The <hi>way</hi> he sent his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
in to bring in the world unto him, St. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. whatever short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way our <hi>new</hi> men of late have found for <hi>their</hi> Disciples. The Articles
and conditions of the Covenant of <hi>Baptism</hi> promised and undertaken by
the baptized either in their <hi>own</hi> persons, or by <hi>proxy,</hi> are the title <hi>paths</hi>
of this <hi>great</hi> way, the several <hi>tracks</hi> that make it up, the ways and paths
we are to walk in, if we intend ever to meet the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57113:12"/>
The <hi>fifth</hi> way is <hi>Gods Commandments,</hi> a way that we all must make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for him, his own way indeed, drawn out by his own hands and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
a way of which himself professes, that he came not to <hi>destroy</hi> it (as
some vainly delude themselves) but to <hi>fulfil</hi> it, to perfect, to exalt it to a
greater height, from the <hi>outward</hi> act, to the <hi>inward</hi> thought; from the
<hi>lower</hi> degree of vertue, to the <hi>highest</hi> of it; from bare <hi>precepts</hi> to addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>counsels,</hi> from meer, <hi>external</hi> performances to right and regular <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in them. And here as the <hi>moral</hi> Precepts are the great <hi>plain</hi> way, so
the <hi>Christian Enh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sements</hi> of them to the highest pitch, the regulations of
them to right intentions, and Christian counsels are the <hi>paths,</hi> the narrow
and straiter paths. The sum and short is this. Holy <hi>Christian</hi> life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
in all its parts according to our powers and capacities, is the fifth
way to be prepared by them that seek the <hi>Lord,</hi> and expect to see his face.</p>
            <p>And yet if there be room and leave for a private conjecture, the <hi>way
of</hi> Gods providence in his judgments and mercies towards <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> the
way of his mercy in saving the believing, and destroying the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Iew,</hi> now near at hand, may come in for a sixth way of the <hi>Lord:</hi>
A way indeed past finding out in all its secret paths, yet to be prepared
for, and more then pointed at by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in that place whence
the words are taken, and by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in this. God there bids comfort his
captive people, for their deliverance from <hi>Babylon</hi> was now nigh at hand,
and their enemies near destruction; calls to them <hi>therefore</hi> to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for it, to make ready and expect it: And here S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> tells
the people the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven is now at hand,</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 2. which (by
comparing it with that <hi>wrath to come,</hi> threatned to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
v. 7. with his exhortation to <hi>flee</hi> from it, and by the coming of the
<hi>great and dreadful day of the Lord,</hi> mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> iv. 5.
in the place where S. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> coming is foretold; and the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it exprest, <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 2. where he is said to come to prepare his way
before him: but <hi>ver.</hi> 1, &amp;c. S. <hi>Iohns</hi> inviting to repentance to divert or
shun it) can be no other than <hi>Christs</hi> coming in Judgment against <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
to execute vengeance upon his enemies, and deliver his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
vengeance and deliverance, the two great manifestations of his
Power and Kingdom; and sure no more then need to cry out to us to
prepare and make right paths against <hi>that</hi> coming, make way for his
judgments to pass by us, and his mercies to come to us.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the way and paths, observe them: many several <hi>paths,</hi>
but <hi>one</hi> only way to Christ and Heaven, observe that too; and though
many ways I shewed you, they all come into <hi>one Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi>
Baptism, and Repentance, Faith and Obedience, Mercy and Judgment,
Precepts and Counsels, <hi>all</hi> into one. 'Tis <hi>way</hi> in the <hi>singular,</hi> to shew that
peace and unity is the only way of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the only way of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet 2. <hi>both</hi> paths and way it is. We must descend to <hi>particulars,</hi> every
one to cleanse his <hi>own,</hi> his own <hi>private</hi> paths. Not only shew me thy <hi>ways,</hi>
O Lord, says <hi>David,</hi> but teach me thy <hi>paths</hi> too, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxv. 3. Not only
to rectifie the outward action, but the inward thoughts; not to content
our selves with a <hi>general profession,</hi> but to come to a particular <hi>practice</hi> of
Religion of the way of <hi>Christ.</hi> Observe that too.</p>
            <p>Particular practice I say, and yet 3. of the general way, of the way
generally and <hi>Catholickly</hi> held by all: and 2. of <hi>all things</hi> generally in that
way, all the several tracks of vertue, <hi>none</hi> to be omitted, seeing the
paths indefinitely, one as well as another, (none as I hear excepted) are
here to be made strait: that's a third thing I wish observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57113:12"/>
But <hi>lastly</hi> the <hi>way</hi> first prepared, then the <hi>paths</hi> made streight. Christs
way is a way of order. First, a general resolution to make all streight
and ready, then a particular entring into every path to do it. Resolve
first upon the way of Piety, then take the paths that lead best to it; <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
first, then <hi>facite,</hi> prepare good resolutions, then set to do them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done well before them, nothing well done without them. And
<hi>viam</hi> first, then <hi>semitas,</hi> the plain way of the Commandments for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
the harder and streighter way of Counsels for great proficie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts and
perfect men.</p>
            <p>II. The way and path thus now found out, we are next to enquire
whose it is, or to whom it leads. <hi>Viam Domini,</hi> the Lords it is; so the
Septuagint and Evangelists all render it, in the Genetive: and <hi>Domino</hi>
it is too; so the Hebrew in the Dative, to him it is, or for him it is; to
him it is it leads, for him it is prepar'd, the preparation all for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viam Domini</hi> 1. His way first, and not our own. <hi>Non sunt viae meae, viae
vestrae,</hi> Isa, lv. 8. His ways are not ours, ours are Lust, Covetousness, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Hypocrisie, meer superficial and external Works, Vanity and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
The ways we spoke of, Mercy and Truth, Faith, Hope, Charity,
Obedience, and all good ways are his, not ours; we have no good ones
of our own. Nay even our Souls, those ways too into which he comes,
are his: his and not our own; the Soul of the Father, and the Soul of the
Son; of all Fathers and Sons: all mine, says God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 4. Our
Bodies too, they are Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20. bodies and spirits all his, made
and prepared for his own way and Service; all again to be prepared by
us, that they may be fit for him to walk and be in.</p>
            <p>For 2. <hi>Viam Domino</hi> it is. To him all our ways and paths must be directed,
to his Glory and Worship: all lead to him as to the end of all; from him
all good ways come, to him all good ways tend: he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi>
is and must be the beginning and end of them. They are <hi>Domini &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi>
both of the Lord and to the Lord, all our ways and preparations,
or all are wrong. To him as to my Lord the King, visiting us in mercy
and gracing us with his presence; and to him as to my Lord Judge to visit
us in judgment, and punish all offenders; as a Lord to us, or a Lord against
us; as our own King in triumph, or another King in fury, and to him in
each consideration there is a proper way, and a proper way of preparing it.</p>
            <p>III. And now 3. Be it what way it will, and to the Lord, under what
notion or way we will; a preparation there is due, a preparation next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
us.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is no meeting him unprepar'd, better meet a Lion in the
way, or a Bear robb'd of her Whelps than him unprepar'd. <hi>Prepare your
hearts unto the Lord,</hi> says the Prophet <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> vii. 3. And make <hi>streight
paths for your feet,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle, Heb.</hi> xii. 13. <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel both</hi> for
preparation. If thou come to serve the Lord, <hi>prepare thy soul,</hi> says the
Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> ii. 1. 2. If thou goest into his house, <hi>prepare thy
foot,</hi> keep it, keep an eye over it, that it slip not there, says the Son of
<hi>David, Eccles.</hi> v. 1. go not in rashly, and in haste. 3. Prepare thy
mouth too, that it be not <hi>too hasty</hi> to utter any thing, says he, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
4. If thou goest any where to pray, <hi>before</hi> thou <hi>prayest prepare thy self,
Ecclus.</hi> xviii. 23. they that fear the Lord will do so, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> ii. 17. will
prepare their hearts, yea and ponder their paths too: for so <hi>Solomon</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
us, <hi>Prov.</hi> iv. 26. <hi>Ponder the paths</hi> of thy <hi>feet,</hi> and let all <hi>thy ways
be established.</hi> Nay ponder them, and all thy ways <hi>shall be</hi> established, so
it may be read; and so <hi>Iotham</hi> found it, became mighty, says that Text,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57113:13"/>
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> xxvii. 6. because he <hi>prepared</hi> his <hi>ways before the Lord his God.</hi> No
way to become great, mighty, and powerful with <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Gods</hi> way in righteousness, keeping our selves streight to the ways
of God; a <hi>reward</hi> sufficient to establish it for a <hi>duty.</hi> That we may do it
as we should, we are now next to enquire what is meant by this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and making streight, and how we are to do it?</p>
            <p>The word in the <hi>Original</hi> is either from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>panim, facies,</hi> and may
be construed either by <hi>faciem date, h. e. speciem,</hi> make the way look fair,
give it a handsom face; and so to prepare the way will be to cleanse the
way: or by <hi>faciem obverter,</hi> or a <hi>facie amovere,</hi> change the face of it, or
remove things off the surface of it: and so to prepare it, will be to clear
the way of rubs and blocks, to remove our sins out of the way. Or 2.
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>angulus</hi> a corner, and may be rendred <hi>Angulate,</hi> corner it out,
and lay it to the <hi>line</hi> and <hi>rule.</hi> And then to prepare, will be to make it
<hi>smooth, regular,</hi> and <hi>equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Put them together, and to prepare the way will be to <hi>remove</hi> all soil
and filth, all blocks and impediments, all roughness and unevenness <hi>out</hi>
of our ways, which are like any ways to hinder our <hi>Lords</hi> coming to us,
so to put all by, that he may have way <hi>to</hi> come to us, and we the easier
and fullier <hi>receive</hi> him when he comes. Thus to prepare his way will be
to remove all <hi>hindrances,</hi> and to make his paths streight will be to bring
all <hi>furtherances</hi> to his coming. To remove our sins by repentance, which
else would hinder him from coming, is to <hi>prepare</hi> the way; to regulate
and order our paths to the rule of his Commandments, to the squares of
righteousness, is to make <hi>streight paths:</hi> both together compleat the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which we will consider first in general, then in particular: first
how his way generally is to be prepared, then how particularly, after a
more particular and <hi>special</hi> way and manner.</p>
            <p>We cannot find how in <hi>general</hi> to prepare his way better then by the
words that follow immediately in the <hi>Prophet Isa.</hi> xl. 4. and are so repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Mountains and lesser Hills, <hi>mole-hills</hi> as well as Mountains, as well great
as less, and as well less as greater <hi>sins</hi> cast down; our very natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and understanding submitted to the obedience of faith. 3. <hi>The crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

must be rectified and set right. 4. All the <hi>rough ways</hi> made
smooth, all our roughnesses and unevennesses natural or customary made
<hi>smooth</hi> and <hi>level,</hi> no stones of offence, no thorns, or bushes, hedges or
ditches in the way.</p>
            <p>That the way be neither mountainous with pride, nor dark with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
nor dirty with lust, nor thorny with worldly cares, nor hollow
with hypocrisie, nor slippery with riot, nor washy with drunkenness,
nor tedious through slothfulness, nor uneven with irresolution and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy.
<hi>Fill</hi> the low valleys we must, with high heavenly affections
and contemplations, with high degrees of Piety and Devotion. <hi>Bring

down</hi> the hills by humility and obedience. <hi>Streighten</hi> the crooked by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and uprightness. <hi>Smooth</hi> the rough ways with meekness, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness,
and charity. <hi>Rull down</hi> the haughty towring thoughts, <hi>raise</hi> up
the groveling mind, <hi>rectifie</hi> the perverse intentions, <hi>smooth</hi> the rough and
uneven passions of the soul, prepare them all; remove out of them every
thing that may <hi>offend,</hi> and bring them all into the way of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in general. But we have a more <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>special</hi> way: for
we may consider the way of the <hi>Lord,</hi> either as the way of a <hi>King;</hi> (for
he is both Lord and King) coming against us with his Armies, or as a
<hi>King</hi> coming to us in his Triumph, to <hi>honour</hi> us and rejoyce with us.</p>
            <p>If we consider the way of the <hi>Lord</hi> as of one coming against us for
<hi>destruction,</hi> prepare we then as the men of <hi>Bethulia</hi> did against <hi>Holofernes,</hi>
Judeth iv. 4, 5. They <hi>sent messengers into all the coasts, they possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
beforehand of the tops of the high mountains, they fortified the villages,
laid up victuals for the provision of War,</hi> and gave <hi>charge to keep the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
ver. 7. so <hi>they</hi> prepared, do <hi>we</hi> so too; <hi>possess</hi> we the tops of the
mountains by setting our affections upon things above; fortifie we the
poor <hi>villages</hi> of our weak natures by strong and holy resolutions, <hi>gather</hi> we
together all kind of provision for our souls out of the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
by constant reading and meditation, <hi>keep</hi> all the passages of them with
care and vigilance, and <hi>send</hi> out messengers into all the coasts of <hi>heaven</hi>
and <hi>earth,</hi> send up our <hi>prayers</hi> to the God of Heaven for help, our <hi>desires</hi>
to the Saints upon the earth to assist us with their devotions, advice and
company.</p>
            <p>Prepare we armour too with <hi>Vzziah, 2 Chron</hi> xxvi. 14. <hi>Shields, and spears,
and helmets, habergeons, and bows, and slings.</hi> Stand we thus ready armed in
the way, our head covered with the hope of salvation for a <hi>Helmet,</hi> our
breast armed with righteousness for a <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> our body defended with
the <hi>Habergeon</hi> of a holy conversation, in our left hand the <hi>Shield</hi> of Faith,
and in our right hand <hi>Alms</hi> far better then the strongest Spear, says the
Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecclus.</hi> xxix. 13. the Sword of the Holy Spirit, the word of
truth girt to our loins, the <hi>bow</hi> and arrows of the holy fear of Gods
Judgments hanging on our shoulders, the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> for our <hi>Sling,</hi> and
<hi>himself</hi> for the <hi>stone</hi> to smite our grand enemy in the fore-head, and put
him to a perpetual shame. <hi>Thus</hi> make ready to entertain him.</p>
            <p>But if 2. he come to us in the way of triumph, or grace, and favour,
then prepare we the way as is usual at the entertainment of great <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
Now at such times they sweep or wash the ways and streets, they
pave, they gravel them, they rail them in, they hang them with <hi>Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
they strew them with Rushes and Flowers, they set guards to fence
the ranks, and place themselves in order to cry out <hi>Vivat Rex,</hi> or some
such thing to receive them with joyful acclamations.</p>
            <p>Let us go and do likewise. <hi>Wash</hi> all our ways with tears, <hi>sweep</hi> them
with the besom of confession, <hi>pave</hi> them with pious vows and purposes,
<hi>spread</hi> them over with fair amendment, <hi>rail</hi> them in by the obedience of
faith and daily caution, <hi>adorn</hi> them by the imitation of the lives of holy
Saints, set them like so many pictures in <hi>Tapestry</hi> before thee, shrew them
with sweet Herbs and Flowers; the <hi>Roses</hi> of Chastity, the <hi>Lillies</hi> of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

the <hi>Woodbines</hi> of Hope and Love, the <hi>Bays</hi> of Constancy, all the
<hi>sweets</hi> of piety and vertue, guard the way, guard all the ways with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and godly zeal, and make all the <hi>streets</hi> and <hi>ways</hi> resound again
with the eccho of praises and thanksgivings. This it is to prepare his
way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57113:14"/>
And thus every way of <hi>his</hi> we spoke of must be prepared. Our <hi>Souls</hi>
so ordered, out <hi>Meditations</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> so regulated, our <hi>Repentance</hi> so
adorned, our <hi>Baptisms</hi> so accompanied, our <hi>Obedience</hi> so fulfilled, <hi>Gods
Providence</hi> and way of dealing with us so accepted, with clean hearts,
grounded resolutions, an even temper, with care and diligence, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
vertue, sweetness, and moderation, zeal and attention, humility
and thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>All this while make streight, must not be forgotten. All this must be
done now also with <hi>upright</hi> hearts, <hi>sincere</hi> intentions; not in outward
form and appearance only, not for fear of punishment, not for hope of
reward and praise, not meerly to avoid danger, nor yet lastly to be seen
of men. All these the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did, and yet for all that, none of them
keeps the Law, says <hi>Christ.</hi> The Law is not fulfilled by the <hi>external</hi> act,
the Commandments not kept by the <hi>outward</hi> performance, 'tis the inward
spirit of <hi>Charity,</hi> when they are done with that, that only keeps them:
'tis that only that makes right ways, sound paths; without it they are
but <hi>rotten</hi> ways, or <hi>hollow</hi> ones; such as <hi>Christ</hi> will not choose to come by,
or rather will choose not to come by: right good sound ways they must
be, if they be his.</p>
            <p>And 2. <hi>right</hi> streight ways too, no turning to the right hand or to
the left: not do one way in <hi>adversity,</hi> another way in <hi>prosperity:</hi> one
Religion when the days are <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> another when the days are
<hi>stormy</hi> and <hi>troublesom. Rectas facite in deserto,</hi> so it is in the Prophet and
Hebrew Text, <hi>Isa.</hi> xl. 3. Make his paths streight in the <hi>Desart,</hi> even
when we are deserted of all, when we are in the barren and dry Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
where no water is, no earthly comfort about us, in the greatest tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
we must keep us still to <hi>uprightness</hi> and <hi>honesty;</hi> that's the way
to <hi>Christ:</hi> however for a while he seem to be far from us, thither it
will bring us after a while; keep innocency, and do the thing that is
right, and <hi>that will bring a man peace</hi> at the last.</p>
            <p>Yet 3. one path or two made streight is not sufficient, <hi>semitas,</hi> 'tis an <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi>
somewhat a kin to an <hi>universal;</hi> it must be all: he that fails or offends
in one is guilty of all, S. <hi>Iames</hi> ii. 10. If all be not streight, all the paths
as well as the ways that you have heard, all the little ways as well as the
great, according to our poor power, if at least we do not study and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it, it is not, it is not right.</p>
            <p>Nor is it so, or will it be, unless we take in 4. the <hi>Prophets in deserto</hi>
too; desert and forsake our selves a little, renounce our <hi>own</hi> ways quite,
seek not our <hi>own</hi> but <hi>his,</hi> streighten our selves a little of our <hi>own</hi> lusts and
liberties, of our <hi>own</hi> desires and ways, that the only way to make <hi>his</hi>
streight, and make <hi>Christ</hi> come streight to <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. We have one point yet behind, <hi>who</hi> it is to <hi>whom</hi> all this is spoken,
and is given in charge. I confess the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Word
are the publick messengers and <hi>harbingers</hi> who are sent to prepare the
<hi>Lords</hi> way (as S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was) before him: yet <hi>every one</hi> must sweep his
own door. For the words are by S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preach'd to all <hi>Pharisees</hi> and
<hi>Sadduces, Publicans</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the people that came to him; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to have a share, and so he gives it them. S. <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 10, 11. verses,
and so onward, tells people, and Publicans, and Souldiers what to do,
sets every one his path, his part of the way to prepare and streighten.
Give me leave to do so too.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> they come first, they have the greatest share
with S. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> to go before the face of the <hi>Lord</hi> to prepare his way;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57113:14"/>
but how? <hi>To give knowledge of salvation,</hi> says old <hi>Zachary, to his people, for
the remission of sins;</hi> or somewhat more, even to give <hi>remission</hi> too, to give
<hi>absolution;</hi> so to give knowledge to the people, or instruct them, and to
absolve them, is some part at least of the Ministers share; but to <hi>Baptize</hi>
also with the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and to <hi>consecrate</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> himself, is to prepare his
way too, to make way for him, to <hi>raise</hi> the Valleys, to <hi>comfort</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
the cast down and afflicted soul against his sorrows, the <hi>penitent</hi>
against his sins, the <hi>fearful</hi> against the fear of death, the <hi>weak</hi> hearted
against trouble and persecution, to encourage them to lift up their heads
and look to the recompence of reward, to raise up the groveling souls of
men from earth and flesh to heaven and heavenly business. 2. To <hi>cast
down</hi> the Mountains of Pride and Singularity, Schism and Heresie,
that lift up themselves against the obedience of <hi>Christ.</hi> 3. To <hi>rectifie</hi> the
perverse and crooked souls of men. And 4. to <hi>smooth</hi> and <hi>soften</hi> them,
to lay the way of Christ smooth and plain before them, make them know
his yoke is easie and his burthen light, by continual preaching to them,
and instructing them, so preparing them for the way of Christ. Thus the
<hi>Minister</hi> prepares his way in the peoples hearts; sometimes cleansing the
young <hi>Infants</hi> way by Baptism, and sometimes rectifying the young and
<hi>old mans</hi> ways by advice and exhortation; sometimes clearing them with
<hi>Absolution,</hi> sometimes purifying them with the Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> some way
or other always preparing them against the Lords coming. And it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him so to do.</p>
            <p>And 2. for the <hi>People.</hi> There needs no more then has been said. The
ways already mentioned concern us all. There is none so <hi>righteous</hi> but
needs some kind of preparation. And he that is not, he needs them all.</p>
            <p>And if we consider now the <hi>time,</hi> so much the more in that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is nearer whom we prepare for, 'Tis now but a few days to the day
he once came to us in the flesh. Let's think of that, and prepare our
selves to give him thanks, to cry <hi>Hosanna,</hi> blessed is he that cometh, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this <hi>blessed way</hi> of his coming, and blessed the <hi>blessed day</hi> of his so coming.</p>
            <p>'Tis not many more days 2. to the coming of his flesh and blood in
the Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> unto us. We are expecting and hoping for it, and
'tis fit we should be preparing for it. <hi>Better</hi> preparation then you have
heard I cannot give you for the one or the other. Only I may add <hi>in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine</hi>
again. Withdraw your selves aside into some desart and solitary
place to prepare you in; retire in private to your souls, and to your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I will bring her into <hi>the Wilderness,</hi> says God, concerning <hi>Israel,</hi> and
speak <hi>comfortably</hi> unto her, <hi>Hos.</hi> ii. 14. The place to hear the voice of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and heavenly comfort is in our <hi>Solitude.</hi> When we are alone, <hi>God</hi> only
and our <hi>selves</hi> together. Remember then we go into our <hi>Closets,</hi> and there
prepare our selves, forget no point of the preparation, but sweep, and
cleanse, and smooth, and adorn our souls with all holy vertues or resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and come well guarded with attention, care, and vigilance, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unbeseeming pass from us in the way, raise up our spirit with holy
thoughts and heavenly desires, cast down our souls with reverence and
humility, come without any roughness or unevenness in our affections or
behaviour, in our ways or paths; so shall the <hi>Lord</hi> come; and come with
comfort, and take us with him, and bring us safely to the end of our
way, the end of our hope, to those things which neither eye hath seen,
or ear heard, or ever entred into the heart of man, which he has prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them that prepare for <hi>him,</hi> in the City prepared for <hi>us</hi> in the
Heavens.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>S. LUKE xxi. verse 27, 28.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a Cloud, with power
and great glory.</p>
                  <p>And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up
your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND because the day of your Redemption draweth
nigh, the day in which your Redeemer came in a
Cloud of Flesh and Clay, we are this day by the
course of Holy <hi>Church</hi> to wish you to look up, and lift
up your heads to see the Son of man your Redeemer
in his <hi>second</hi> coming, coming in a Cloud of Glory.</p>
            <p>That we knowing it is the same Son of man, who
was once born in a <hi>Stable,</hi> and cradled in a <hi>Manger,</hi> that shall one day
come to be the <hi>Iudge</hi> of Heaven and Earth, we might so celebrate his
first coming in flesh, that when all flesh shall stand before him, we might
lift up our heads with joy and comfort.</p>
            <p>For many there are which shall hang down <hi>theirs,</hi> such who have not
thought <hi>aright</hi> of his coming into the world, or not worthily entertain'd
it, or not walked with him in it along the stage of his humility, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rightly pondered the terrors of this second coming in the day of
Judgment, which he himself here Preaches to his Disciples, that <hi>they
might take heed to themselves lest at any time their hearts should be overcharged
with surfeiting and drunkenness (the Disease that usually infects all our Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masses</hi>)
and <hi>cares of this life</hi> (the <hi>Disease that infects all our days</hi>) and <hi>so that
day come upon them unawares;</hi> but that <hi>watch they should, and pray always that
they might be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass,
and to stand before the Son of man,</hi> ver. 34.</p>
            <p>They had but three days before accompanied him to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in his
<hi>progress</hi> of meekness, and now in one of his returns he begins to tell
them of another kind of coming to it in <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>fury.</hi> His <hi>Disciples,</hi>
who by the sight of such strong and goodly buildings could not conjecture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57113:16"/>
they should end unless the world fell with them, ask him presently upon
it, when those things should come to pass, and when should be the end of
the world. Their <hi>Master,</hi> that he might at once both <hi>satisfie</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> their
curiosity, mingles the signs of the particular destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and of the general ruine of the world together: that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
keep them awake, to attend both his general and particular coming,
and make both them and us, at the approach of particular judgments
upon <hi>Cities</hi> or <hi>Nations</hi> always mindful and prepared for the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>last</hi> day: which he here calls the coming of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi>
and tells us how to entertain it.</p>
            <p>So that in the <hi>Text,</hi> as the verses, so the parts are <hi>two.</hi>

            <p>1. <hi>The time when. Then,</hi> after the signs forementioned, then shall they
see.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The generality of it.</hi> They, all that can see, shall see his coming.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The evidence of his coming,</hi> so plain, he may be seen, seen by the eye
of Faith.</p>
            <p>4. The certainty. <hi>They</hi> shall see him, <hi>to be sure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The form in which he comes, <hi>as the Son of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>The end to which he comes.</hi> He comes with power, with the power of
a Judge for quick and dead.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>The manner of his coming.</hi> In a Cloud with power and great glory.
<hi>In the Christians comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Where it begins.</hi> When these things begin to come to pass, then that
begins too. <hi>Then</hi> look up.</p>
            <p>2. To whom it belongs. <hi>You</hi> Disciples, <hi>do</hi> you <hi>look up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>What kind of comfort 'tis,</hi> A looking up, a lifting up the head, when
all heads else droop with fear and grief.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Whence this comfort arises,</hi> from what ground it springs; for <hi>your redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
draweth nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I go on with all in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der as they lie; so that if you remember the
words, you cannot forget the order and method. Then shall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Christs</hi> coming there we begin; but <hi>when</hi> is that? the <hi>Heavens</hi> shall
tell you, the <hi>Earth</hi> shall tell you, the <hi>Sea</hi> shall tell you, <hi>Men</hi> shall tell you:
The <hi>Heavens</hi> by signs and wonders, by storms and tempests, the lights of
Heaven shall lose themselves in darkness, and forsake their <hi>Spheres,</hi> and
their constantest powers shall be shaken out of their course and harmony.
The <hi>Earth</hi> shall quake for fear, and change its place. The <hi>Waves</hi> shall
fright themselves with their own roarings, and <hi>mens hearts shall fail for
fear;</hi> neither knowing how to stand, nor to avoid this dreadful coming.
When these with all the host of heaven and earth startled out of their
natural seats and postures, shall have prepar'd and usher'd him the way;
<hi>then</hi> shall he come. He comes not till all things else have done their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and have gone their last.</p>
            <p>Nor is it fitting so great a coming should be without an <hi>universal</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
where every creature forgetting its own nature begins at last to
study <hi>his.</hi> There is nothing that can stand when <hi>God</hi> comes: Heaven it
self is at a loss, and remembers not its perpetual motion, when it but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
his approach: Every thing is a wonder to it self when <hi>he</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
If nature it self be thus terrified, which groans not for it self
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; what shall we be with all our sins about us, how can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> abide his
coming?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57113:16"/>
Yet then shall <hi>he</hi> appear, when <hi>we</hi> know not how to appear: Heaven
and Earth will change their faces, Men and Angels will hide <hi>theirs,</hi> only
<hi>he</hi> it is that dares be seen. Sins or imperfections make all the creatures
cover themselves with some disguises, or endeavour it, only <hi>he</hi> who is all
purity, all perfection comes then to shew himself.</p>
            <p>Yet when this <hi>Then</hi> shall be, when that day and hour shall come, no
man knows, no <hi>not the Son of man himself,</hi> S. Mark xiii. 32. <hi>as man:</hi> He
that could tell you that come he would, and could tell you the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<hi>signs</hi> that would fore-run it, knew not <hi>then</hi> the time when those signs
should be, or knew it not to <hi>tell</hi> you. That we might always be waiting
for his coming.</p>
            <p>Had it been fit for us to know, no doubt he would have told us; but
so far unnecessary it seems to be acquainted with that secret time, that he
gives us signs which rather <hi>puzzle</hi> then <hi>instruct</hi> us: signs which we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
think <hi>fulfilled</hi> already, signs which have often been the forerunners
of <hi>particular</hi> ruines, and fates of Countries and Kingdoms; signs which
at the same time we fear past already, yet think they are not; that so by
this hard <hi>dialect</hi> of tokens in heaven and earth, we might behold our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
<hi>curiosity</hi> deluded into a perperual <hi>watching</hi> for this last
coming.</p>
            <p>There were in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and there are still in <hi>ours,</hi> men who
lov'd to scare the people with <hi>Prophesies</hi> and <hi>Dreams</hi> of the end of the
world, as if <hi>this then</hi> already were at hand; such as would define the
year and day, as if they had lately dropt out of <hi>Gods</hi> Council Chamber:
but <hi>we beseech you,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul, that you be not troubled neither by spirit, nor
by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand,</hi> 2 Thess. ii.
2. Let <hi>no man deceive you,</hi> ver. 3. they do but deceive you, they vent their
own dreams, and fond presumptions. They know not when the <hi>Master</hi>
of the house will come, <hi>Whether at midnight, or at the Cock crowing, or at the
dawning,</hi> S. Mark xiii. 35. for as a <hi>snare it shall come on all them that dwell on
the face of the earth,</hi> ver. 35. of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>It is enough for us to know there <hi>shall be</hi> a day of Judgment, against
which we must provide every day to make up our accounts, lest that day
come upon us unawares, lest death at least hurry us away to our particular
doom, which will <hi>there</hi> leave us, where the last judgment will be sure to
find us in the same condition; no power or tears of ours being then able
to change or alter it.</p>
            <p>So that the punctual time of this coming, as <hi>Christ</hi> did not intend to
declare, so it matters not to know. A <hi>then,</hi> a time there will be of his
coming.</p>
            <p>2. A time when <hi>they shall see him come. They,</hi> and <hi>who are they?</hi> but <hi>all</hi>
mankind; but <hi>all</hi> the creatures? <hi>Every eye shall see him, they also that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him,</hi> Rev. i. 7. <hi>They</hi> also that <hi>crucified him, and condemned</hi> him, S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xxvi. 64. Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand
of power, says <hi>Christ</hi> himself, to those who were his torturers and his
judges. Nay, <hi>we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,</hi> Rom. xiv.
10. None of us all must think to escape. There we must give account
what we have done amiss, every action, every idle word, every vain
and wanton thought, every inward desire must we yield account of in
the day of judgment. Thy Crown and Throne, O <hi>King,</hi> cannot exempt
thee. Your Honours and Complements, O ye <hi>Nobles,</hi> cannot excuse you.
Thy Riches, O thou son of <hi>Pelf,</hi> cannot buy out thy absence. Thy
sleights, O thou crafty <hi>Politician,</hi> cannot evade it. Thy strength, O <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57113:17"/>
cannot defend thee from the Angel that will drive thee thither.
Your Learning, O ye <hi>Learned</hi> of the earth, can find no argument to keep
you from it. Nor can ye, O ye <hi>Worms</hi> of the earth, ye meanest, find holes
in it to hide you at this coming.</p>
            <p>Come you must all together at <hi>this</hi> coming, and see you shall the Son of
man as he <hi>is</hi> coming. The wicked eyes indeed though <hi>Christ</hi> comes in
glory, shall see nothing of his glory: The Son of man they shall behold,
his <hi>Humanity,</hi> but not his <hi>Deity.</hi> They shall see the wounds their sins have
made, the hands and feet they have nail'd, the side they have pierc'd,
the head they have planted with thorns, all these to their grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to see <hi>him</hi> their Judge, whom they have so abus'd and wrong'd, so
trampled and scorn'd, that he yet bears the marks of their malice and
cruelty even in his <hi>Throne</hi> of Glory.</p>
            <p>But the good mans eyes, they shall see his <hi>Glory</hi> too; they shall behold
his glorious face, which the eyes of the sinners and the ungodly are not
able to perceive, by reason of that veil of sin and darkness that covers
them. Both then shall see him, <hi>these</hi> only the Son of man, <hi>those</hi> the Son
both of God and man, in his <hi>Cloud,</hi> and in his <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are they then that think to hide themselves, who live as if they
never thought to come to judgment? Did men certainly, but seriously
ponder, that will they, nill they, they must one day see <hi>Christ,</hi> they
would use him better in his Members then they do, better in his <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Ministers,</hi> better in his <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Service.</hi> Do they not, think you,
imagine they shall never see him, that they can shelter themselves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
from his presence, that dare use him thus contemptuously, thus
proudly, thus sacrilegiously and prophanely. Lay but this close every
day to your bosoms as you rise, that you must one day come to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and all your actions will be more regular, and your thoughts
higher concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and all that is his, or pertains to him, and you
the better able to answer them when you see him.</p>
            <p>3. For thirdly <hi>see</hi> him you shall, not only hear your doom and pass
away, but <hi>see</hi> him pronouncing it. When he came to Redeem the world,
the eye saw him. <hi>Simeons</hi> and <hi>Anna's,</hi> and all <hi>Iudea's,</hi> many <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> too. He came then that all <hi>might</hi> see him. But in his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when he comes to judge it, then he comes that all <hi>shall</hi> see him; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eye behold him. The eyes that slept in dust before his first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
the eyes that in the time of his abode could never see him for their
distance, the eyes that ever since have seen the world, shall all then see
him, as well as they that pierc'd him, nay as well as they who liv'd with
him, and daily saw him.</p>
            <p>He might, considering how unworthy the best of us carry our selves
of that corporal presence, which he once vouchsaf'd us, considering
how he was then misus'd and handled, have for ever denied us any sight
of his glorious Body; but he forgets the injuries he met with, and will
once more shew himself to our bodily sight; not so much to confound his
persecutors, as to manifest the justice of his judgment; that the whole
world may evidently see, that he who came into the flesh then only to
redeem us, comes in the same flesh again to judge us, that all may see
our Faith in our <hi>Crucified God</hi> was neither vain nor unprofitable, but by
the evidence of their own eyes confess and acknowledge it the only true
way to eternal happiness.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>these</hi> eyes now must one day behold their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> how
should we wash them every day, and cleanse them from earthly defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57113:17"/>
with our tears, that they may be worthy to see that blessed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Wash your eyes ye <hi>wantons</hi> from unclean and lascivious glances.
Cleanse your eyes ye <hi>proud</hi> ones from scornful looks. Wipe your eyes ye
<hi>covetous</hi> minded from that yellow dust that blinds your sight. Open your
eyes ye <hi>ignorant</hi> and seduced souls, that ye run not headlong to your own
destruction, hoodwinkt to Hell, then only to unclose your deceived sight,
when you can see no comfort. Remember you are all one day to appear
before Christs tribunal, where if you expect any comfort to your eyes,
you must come thither with them wash'd, and wip'd, and cleans'd, and
pure, no spots, no films, no blemish, no blood-shot in them. Whether to
your comfort or no, <hi>see</hi> you shall. <hi>That's</hi> certain.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Shall see.</hi> Can we not shut our eyes then when this day shall come?
Can nothing lock up our eye-lids in eternal night, no bar set before us
but we <hi>must</hi> see this Son of man? Can no Hills hide us, nor no Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
cover us? Can we not sleep in dust, and rest quiet in our confusion?
Can we not vanish into that nothing out of which we first arose, or at
least lie hid in that eternal pit from ever seeing any thing but the regions
of everlasting darkness? Must we needs rise out of our wretched Caves
to see him, who cannot but afflict us at his coming? so it is: we <hi>must</hi> see
him. See we must, though but to see the justice of our own damnation.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more certain then <hi>this</hi> sight, sight, it is the <hi>surest</hi> sense,
and to <hi>see</hi> him at his coming is to be <hi>certain</hi> of it at the least; but to see
the Son of man at his coming, is certainly with evidence; and to be
bound to see it, to have such a tie upon us, such a condition on us that
we shall see it, whether we will or no, is a certainty with a <hi>necessity</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>That so no man may doubt of a final retribution, whilst he is certain,
he shall one day see him, who will <hi>reward every man according to his work.</hi>
Let not then the unjustly <hi>oppressed</hi> innocent, let not the <hi>less prosperous</hi> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit droop, or the glorious and yet triumphing sinner: the prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Rebel,</hi> or thriving <hi>Atheist</hi> pride himself in the success of his <hi>Sins;</hi>
for he is coming that shall come, and make the just mans eyes run over
with joy and happiness for his fore-passed tears, and fill the others eyes
with shame and confusion for all their glory. It may be long before he
comes, but come he will at last, and his <hi>reward is with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. But <hi>who</hi> is this that comes? so the <hi>Prophet</hi> once: so we now, or in
what <hi>shape</hi> will he appear? <hi>God</hi> is the Judge of all the earth, and who is
it that can see <hi>God?</hi> Or if he has committed all judgment to the Son, as
it is, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. Yet who can see <hi>him</hi> either, being of one substance with
the Father, the same individual and invisible Essence? That therefore
he may be seen, he comes in the form of the <hi>Son of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was that which <hi>Daniel</hi> foresaw in his night visions, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13.
one <hi>like the Son of man coming with the Clouds of Heaven:</hi> that which S. <hi>Peter</hi>
told <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that <hi>he it was, who was ordain'd to be the judge of quick and dead,</hi>
Acts x. 42. Not as he was <hi>Lord</hi> of Heaven and Earth, or as he was the
<hi>eternal</hi> off-spring of the Deity (for <hi>so he</hi> could not be ordain'd, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being from all eternity) but as the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> for he hath given him
authority to execute judgment also, <hi>because he is the Son of man,</hi> St. John
v. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> was it by which he obtain'd the Throne of Judgment, having in
that <hi>form</hi> both done and suffered all things for our salvation. <hi>God</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but just that he should be our Judge, who came to save us from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that he should judge us, who had been partaker of our infirmities,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57113:18"/>
and knew our weaknesses: and would by the compassion of nature easier
acquit us, or with more evidence of justice condemn us, <hi>himself</hi> having
once been subject to the like humane, though not sinful passions.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>form</hi> in which all eyes may see him, all Nations behold
him: nor shall the scars of his wounds be covered, but that even by them
we may acknowledge our crucified Saviour is become our Judge. Who
whilst he judges us in the <hi>form</hi> of man, will condemn us for nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>power</hi> of man. And yet even by his actions, as he was man, will he
condemn <hi>ours.</hi> His Humility our Pride, his Abstinence our Gluttony and
excess, his Patience our Impatience, his Chastity our Lusts, his paying
<hi>Caesar</hi> beyond his due, our undutiful with-drawings from him; in a word,
his Goodness, Piety, and Devotion, our ungodliness, impieties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness.</p>
            <p>And as it is a mercy thus to be judg'd by one who is sensible of our frail
condition, so is it a glory, besides, that our nature is so high exalted as
to be the Judge of the world, not of men only, but <hi>Angels</hi> too. What
favour may we not expect, when he is our Judge, who is our Saviour,
who will not lay aside our nature in his Glory, that he may retain that
<hi>sympathy</hi> and compassion to us, which was taken with it, when he took it
from us?</p>
            <p>6. I shall not here need to spend much time to tell you 6. what he
comes for, who have told you so often of a day of Judgment, and the
Son of man, to sit on the tribunal. His coming is to Judgment, for he
comes with power, and that power of a Judge.</p>
            <p>Only I must tell you, 2. that his motion is no faster then an <hi>easie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
So loth is he to come to Judgment, so unwilling to enter into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with Flesh and Blood, that he delays the hasty prayers of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Saints under the Altars of Heaven, seems a little to with-hold
the full beams of mercy which he has laid up for the Saints, rather then
to post to the destruction of the wicked. Yet for the elects sake to hasten
he does a little; and therefore he makes a <hi>Cloud</hi> the Chariot of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that when he once begins to come, he may come quickly.</p>
            <p>And not so only, but come in <hi>Glory,</hi> which is the last observable in his
coming in a Cloud, with Power and great Glory.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>Cloud</hi> he ascended, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and the Angel told the Disciples there,
that he should <hi>so</hi> come as they saw him go. In the Clouds say the other
<hi>Evangelists;</hi> they speak of more then one: His cloud is not a single cloud,
there are attendant clouds upon it. Angels surround his Throne, S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xxv. 31. the <hi>Trumpet of the Archangel</hi> sounds before him, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> i. 7.
his <hi>Throne is a throne of Glory,</hi> S. Mat. xix. 28. and his Apostles Thrones
are round about him, and all things are in <hi>subjection under his feet,</hi> 1 Cor.
xv. 27.</p>
            <p>Thus is he rewarded with Majesty and Glory, for his meekness and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
that we seeing the recompence of those despised vertues, may
learn to embrace them, by so strong incentives and allurements.</p>
            <p>What will ye one day say, O ye obstinate <hi>Iews,</hi> when you shall see his
Glory, whose poverty you so despised? What will ye do at his <hi>Throne</hi>
of Judgment, who would not receive him in his <hi>Cradle</hi> of Mercy? How
will his enemies bemoan themselves with them, <hi>Wisd.</hi> v. We <hi>fools thought
his life madness, and his end without honour: How is he now numbred among the
children of God,</hi> the first born <hi>amongst many brethren!</hi> Fools indeed to count
him what we did, for he shall come again with Majesty and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glory</hi> is a word, by which <hi>Christ</hi> seems as it were ever and anon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57113:18"/>
the fainting spirits of his Disciples, which are ready to betray their
Masters to despair upon the apprehension of the fears and terror which
their <hi>Lord</hi> had told them should precede and accompany the latter day.
This word recalls their spirits, that they begin to look up again, and
lift up their heads: For having thus as it were amaz'd their thoughts,
and unhing'd their patience, he setles them again with some special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that when these things begin to come to pass, they should look up,
and lift up their heads, for (however it fall out to others) <hi>their Redemption
draweth nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never could words of comfort come better then in the full discourse
of the day of Judgment; nor can comfort ever be more welcome, then in
the midst of those affrightments. <hi>Christ</hi> never spoke out of season, but
here he seems to have even <hi>studied</hi> it. When these things <hi>begin</hi> to come
to pass, before they are at their full height, even then look up. Worldly
comforts come not so <hi>early.</hi> The heat and fury of the Disease must be
abated e're they yield us any refreshment. They are only heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
that come so timely to prevent our miseries, or to take them at the
beginning.</p>
            <p>Nor is it yet only when the day begins to dawn wherein the Son of man
comes forth to Judgment, that we should first begin to take courage to
approach, but whilst the foregoing <hi>signs</hi> of that day are now first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on. Those terrors that affright <hi>others,</hi> should not startle <hi>us,</hi> even whilst
the lightnings run upon the ground, whilst the Earth trembles, the Sea
roars, the Winds blow, and Heaven it self knows not how to look, the
Righteous is as bold as a Lion, he stands in the midst of security and
peace. This is the state we are to labour for, so to put our trust in the
most High; that no changes or chances of this mortal life may either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
or shake it, or make us to miscarry. Every calamity should teach us
to look up, but these should teach us also to lift up our heads. Whilst
common fears and troubles march about us, our Christian patience will
teach us cheerfulness; but when these things begin to come to pass, these,
which are the ushers to our glory, these should rejoyce and cheer us up,
that our reward is now a coming to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vs,</hi> I say; for this comfort is not general to all that shall see the Son
of man coming in glory, but his Disciples only, such as have followed
him on earth to meet him in heaven. <hi>Lift up your heads:</hi> to his servants
he speaks, such as hear his words, and attend his steps, and do his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
            <p>Others indeed must <hi>hold down</hi> theirs; the ungodly shall not be able to
look up in judgment. The <hi>covetous</hi> man has look'd so always downward,
that he is not now able to look up. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> has so drown'd his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in his cups, so over-burthened his brain, that he can neither lift up
his head nor his eyes at this day. The <hi>voluptuous</hi> man has dim'd his eyes
with pleasures, that he cannot look about: and the <hi>ambitious</hi> man has so
lost his hopes of being high and glorious, and is become so low and base
in the eyes of God, that he is asham'd to lift up his head.</p>
            <p>These only that are the true Disciples of their Master, whose eyes are
us'd to heaven, who have so often lift up their eyes thither to pray and
praise him, they only can look up when these things come to pass.</p>
            <p>Nothing can affright the humble eye, nothing can amaze the eye that
ever dwells in heaven; nothing can trouble the eye that waits upon her
<hi>God,</hi> as the eye of a <hi>Maiden upon</hi> the hand of <hi>her Mistriss.</hi> The humble,
devout, and faithful eye may look up chearfully, whilst all things else
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57113:19"/>
dare not be seen for shame. O blessed <hi>God,</hi> how fully doest thou reward
thy servants, that wilt thus have them distinguish'd from others by their
looks in troubles, who hast so order'd all things for them, that nothing
shall affright them, nothing make them to hold down their heads?</p>
            <p>This is a kind of comfort by it self, above ordinary, that grief or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
should not appear so much as in our <hi>eyes</hi> or <hi>looks,</hi> though so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
terrors stand round about us.</p>
            <p>I <hi>will lift up my eyes unto the Hills,</hi> and I <hi>will lift up mine eyes to thee,</hi> O <hi>thou
that dwellest in the heavens,</hi> are the voice of one that looks up for help; and
in the midst of these dreadful messengers of Judgment, it will not be
amiss for us even so to lift up our eyes, to beg assistance and deliverance.
But that is not all our comfort (though it be a great one that we can yet
have audience in Heaven amidst these fears) we have besides, the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of inward joy, whereby we rejoyce at our approaching glory. The
<hi>righteous shall rejoyce when he seeth the vengeance,</hi> Psal. lviii. 9. even when
the day of vengeance comes, and the <hi>righteous shall rejoyce in their beds,</hi>
Psal. cxlix. 5. whilst they are now rising up and lifting up their heads
out of their graves to come to Judgment.</p>
            <p>Nor must it seem strange to see the righteous with chearful looks, whilst
all other faces gather blackness. It is not the <hi>others</hi> misery that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at, but at their <hi>Saviours</hi> Glory, and their <hi>own</hi> happiness. For their
<hi>Redemption draweth nigh,</hi> that's the <hi>ground</hi> of all their joy.</p>
            <p>And would you not have men rejoyce, who are redeem'd from misery
and corruption, from the slavery of sin, and the power of death? would
you not have poor Prisoners rejoyce at the approach of their delivery:
you cannot blame'um if at such news with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> they <hi>sing in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi>
sing aloud for joy, so loud that the doors dance open for joy, though
the Keepers awake and even sink for fear.</p>
            <p>Your redemption draweth nigh.] They are words will make the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
ashes gather themselves together into bones and flesh; words that
will make the soul <hi>leave</hi> Heaven, with joy to lift up the head of her dear
beloved body out of the Land where all things are forgotten: Yea the
insensible creatures that groan now under the bondage of corruption, will
at these words turn their tunes when they see at hand the days of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Sons of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death and destruction are things terrible, but when the fear of them
is once overpois'd by the near approach of a redemption to eternal life
and glory, O' <hi>Death then, where is thy sting!</hi> O <hi>Grave then where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory!</hi>
They shrink in their heads, and pull in their stings, and cannot
hurt us while we with joy and gladness lift up our heads.</p>
            <p>What are all the signs and forerunners of the day of Judgment, that
they should trouble us, when we know the day of Judgment is our <hi>day of
redemption,</hi> our <hi>day of glory?</hi> What are the darkness of Sun and Moon,
the falling of the Stars, the very totterings of Heaven it self to us, who
even thereby expect <hi>new heavens;</hi> where there is neither need of Sun, nor
Moon, nor Star to give us light, for the <hi>glory of God shall lighten it, and the
Lamb,</hi> this Son of man that is coming in his cloud, is the light of it,
<hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 23. What are the quakings of the Earth, and roarings of the
Sea, to them who neither need Land nor Sea in their journey to heaven?
What are Wars and rumors of Wars, Famines, and Plagues,
and Pestilences, and false Brethren? what are persecutions and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to Rulers, to death and torments? what are those perplexities
and fears, that rob men of their hearts and courages, for looking after
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57113:19"/>
those things which shall come upon the earth? what are all these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to them who are thus by those very things redeem'd out of all their
troubles? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is bold to set up a challenge, <hi>Who shall separate us
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay in all these we are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
through him (this him in the Text) that loved us,</hi> Rom. viii. 35. 37.
And he goes on yet higher, <hi>For I am perswaded, says he, that neither death, nor
life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from
the love of God which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> ver. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>And if thus nothing can ever separate us from <hi>Christs</hi> love, what
should trouble us at his coming, whose coming is but to draw us nearer to
himself? Be <hi>not troubled, be not terrified,</hi> says he, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. but <hi>in patience pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess</hi>
your <hi>souls,</hi> ver. 18. for there <hi>shall not a hair of your heads perish,</hi> ver. 17.
Others may fall, and sink, and perish; but do they what they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, those that hate you, yet care not for it, look up, look up to
<hi>me,</hi> I am coming to redeem you, lift up your heads, and behold the glory
into which I am at hand to lift you up.</p>
            <p>The <hi>sum</hi> of all now is, that in the midst of all your troubles, all your
amazements, all your fears and dangers, you first still lift up your heads,
and look to Heaven for comfort, and fetch it thence by prayers and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
            <p>2. That in the midst of all calamities, you yet remember your <hi>redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
is a coming, and so lift up your heads with joy in the heat and fury
of them all; knowing that they are nothing else but so many forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of your glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> that you look up and lift up your heads with thankfulness, that
he has thus accounted you worthy to see him in his glory, and that your
redemption is no further off. That having thus begun to look up and lift
up your voices in praises and thanksgiving upon earth, he may lift you
up into Heaven in soul and body, at his coming there, to sing <hi>Allelujahs</hi>
with the Saints and Angels, and the four and twenty Elders, to him that
sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore: there to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of all his Glory.</p>

               <q>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Text is a part of the <hi>Epistle</hi> for the <hi>day,</hi> chosen you
may conceive, because the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is the <hi>time</hi> of
his coming is at hand. A fit preparation thought by
the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Christmas</hi> now so near, to prepare us how
to entertain the happy day, the joyful news of our
<hi>Lord Christs</hi> coming in the flesh. To entertain it, I say,
not with <hi>excess</hi> and riot, but <hi>moderation;</hi> not with <hi>rude</hi>
tricks and gambols, but <hi>softness</hi> and meekness; not in <hi>vanity</hi> of clothes,
but <hi>modesty;</hi> not in <hi>iniquity</hi> but <hi>equity,</hi> somewhat departing from our own
right, and seeking occasions to do others right, that all men may see and
know we behave our selves like <hi>Servants,</hi> expecting their <hi>Lords</hi> coming,
according to all the several senses of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> translated <hi>moderation</hi> in
the Text, but stretching further then any one <hi>English</hi> word can express
it.</p>
            <p>A word chosen by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to comprehend the whole duty (if it
might be) of a <hi>Christian</hi> preparing for his <hi>Lord</hi> in the midst of much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and long wearied expectation, back'd with an assurance that the
<hi>Lord</hi> was now hard by a coming to deliver them. The poor <hi>Philippians</hi>
were somewhat sad, or sad-like by the persecutions they suffered from
the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Gnostick</hi> Hereticks that were among them;
many were daily falling off by reason of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. of the former
Chapter, and much hurt those <hi>dogs,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls them, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. of
that Chapter: the <hi>concision,</hi> that is, those Hereticks had done or were
like to do them. But for all that, says he, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> and again, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in the
<hi>verse</hi> before the <hi>Text,</hi> rejoyce too that all men may see it, see your joy in
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in your sufferings for <hi>him,</hi> yet so that they may see your <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
in it too, that as you are not sad like men without <hi>hope,</hi> so you are
not merry like men <hi>out</hi> of their <hi>wits,</hi> but as men that know their <hi>Lord</hi> is
nigh at hand as well to behold their actions, as to free them from their
sufferings, to see their patience and moderation as well as their trouble
and persecution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57113:21"/>
A perswasion it is, or exhortation to patience and meekness, and some
other Christian Vertues (which by examining the word you will see
anon) from the forementioned consideration. A perswasion to moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from a comfortable assurance of a reward, the Lord at hand to give it.
A perswasion to prepare our selves, because our <hi>Lord</hi> is coming: A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
so to do it, that all may know what we are a <hi>doing,</hi> and what
we are <hi>expecting,</hi> that they may see we are neither asham'd of our <hi>Religion,</hi>
nor of our <hi>Lord,</hi> that we neither fear mens <hi>malice,</hi> nor our Lords <hi>mercy,</hi>
that we are confident he is at hand, ready to succour and rescue all that
patiently and faithfully suffer for him, to take vengeance on his enemies,
and deliver his Servants out of all. The time is now approaching, even
at the doors.</p>
            <p>And if we apply <hi>this</hi> as we do all other <hi>Scriptures</hi> to our selves, to teach
us <hi>moderation</hi> and whatever else is contain'd under the word which is so
rendred, and draw down the <hi>Lords</hi> being at hand in the <hi>Text</hi> to all Christs
comings in Flesh, in Grace, in Glory; it will no way disadvantage the
<hi>Text,</hi> but advance it rather, improve the <hi>Apostles</hi> sense and meaning to
all <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>times</hi> to prepare them all to go out to meet the Lord
when or howsoever he shall come unto them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>moderation</hi> must be <hi>it</hi> we must meet him with, be the times what
they will, come the Lord how or when he please, know we time or know
it not; be what will unknown, our moderation must be known, and yet
his coming as unknown as it may be, must be consider'd: always in our
minds it must be, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is one way or other continually at hand.</p>
            <p>Indeed I must confess the times were troublesom and dangerous when
the <hi>Apostle</hi> thus exhorted and comforted the <hi>Philippians,</hi> but the <hi>best</hi> times
are dangerous; danger there is as much of forgetting <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>prosperity,</hi>
as of falling from him in <hi>adversity:</hi> and as much need there is of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
when all happinesses flow in upon us, as when all afflictions fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us: so the advice cannot be unseasonable: And though we call'd the
<hi>Text</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, or the Christians duty in <hi>sad</hi> times, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in them, and so divide the words, yet they will reach <hi>any</hi> times, <hi>ours</hi>
to be sure, which, call we them what we will, much danger there is in
them of falling away from the <hi>true</hi> Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so as much need
of the <hi>Apostles</hi> counsel and comfort in them.</p>
            <p>Yet take the division of the words in the most proper sense.</p>
            <p>I. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> counsel, or the <hi>Christians</hi> duty in <hi>sad</hi> times: In the first
words, <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men;</hi> that it be, is the
Christians <hi>duty;</hi> that it should be, is S. <hi>Pauls counsel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Christians</hi> comfort in <hi>such</hi> times, or S. <hi>Pauls</hi> comforting them
<hi>with</hi> it, in the following, the <hi>Lord is at hand.</hi> With <hi>this</hi> they are to
cheer up their spirits, and S, <hi>Paul</hi> tells it unto that purpose. Which
will afford us a third <hi>Point</hi> to be considered.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>Connexion</hi> of them, that our moderation is <hi>therefore</hi> to be
<hi>known</hi> to all men, because <hi>our</hi> Lord and the <hi>Lord</hi> of all men is at hand
to see what we do, and do to us according to our doings: therefore
set down here indefinitely, only <hi>the Lord is at hand,</hi> without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<hi>how,</hi> or <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> or to <hi>what purpose,</hi> that we might be
the more careful in our duty, more universal in our moderation.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apostle</hi> dealing thus <hi>indefinitely,</hi> and but silently pointing at the
sad condition of the times they saw, we shall take leave to be as general,
and not bind the counsel or the comfort to sad times, though so they
would fit <hi>us</hi> too, as well as the <hi>Philippians.</hi> The advice is good, and the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57113:21"/>
comfort sweet, both necessary at any time whatsoever. I begin with St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> counsel, or the <hi>Christian</hi> duty for moderation. <hi>Let your moderation,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Three</hi> Points I shall consider in it. 1. <hi>Let there be moderation. 2. Let
it be known. 3. Let it be known unto all men.</hi> Let our moderation <hi>be,</hi> he <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested,</hi>
be <hi>extended unto all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let there <hi>be</hi> moderation, or <hi>let</hi> our moderation be; let moderation be
ours, be our practice, that stands first to be considered. And the word so
rendred, has <hi>divers</hi> significations, all indifferently appliable both to the
<hi>context,</hi> and the Christians <hi>duty</hi> against his <hi>Lords</hi> coming.</p>
            <p>The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and first and primarily signifies <hi>equity.</hi> So <hi>Aristotle</hi>
take <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. A duty as fit for <hi>Christianity</hi> as any; not only to be <hi>just,</hi>
but <hi>equal:</hi> nay to prefer equity <hi>before</hi> justice, to depart somewhat from
our own right rather then exact the extremity of justice, rather to <hi>let
go</hi> a Coat or a Cloak, then go to <hi>law</hi> about it, rather to take a blow, an
affront, an indignity, nay turn the cheek for a second, then draw a
Sword; for a third turn the other cheek rather than venture turning out
of Heaven, for turning violently again upon them out of a false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>gallantry</hi> and <hi>valour:</hi> rather go a mile or two <hi>above</hi> our stint and
share then to make disturbance for it. This our <hi>Masters</hi> counsel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
too, to all <hi>his Disciples.</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 40, 41, 42. confirmed to us by
his example, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xvii. 27. Tribute paid by him that was not due,
only lest he should offend them.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is not <hi>equity</hi> but iniquity in them that require more then is
right; yet 'tis a point of a <hi>Christian</hi> sometimes (in petty matters always)
not to stand <hi>rigorously</hi> upon our right, when there is like to come nothing
but continual dissention, and long-liv'd enmities by exacting it.</p>
            <p>So far should we be from doing so, that we should be ready by all fair
compliances to remove all unneighbourly contentions from among us; if
the parting with <hi>trifles,</hi> giving way a little, or the forgiving <hi>small</hi> tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
will do it. More then so there is in this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in seeking occasions
and opportunities to do good. Our <hi>blessed</hi> Lord <hi>went about</hi> doing good,
says S. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> x. 38. from <hi>City</hi> to <hi>City,</hi> says S. <hi>Matth.</hi> ix. 35. from one
place to another, all the Cities of <hi>Iudea</hi> over, from one <hi>opportunity</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<hi>seeking</hi> distressed souls, to do good unto: one point of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that <hi>gentleness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> beseeches the <hi>Corinthians, 2 Cor.</hi>
x. 1. <hi>His</hi> was, not to leave sinners as they deserve; <hi>ours,</hi> not deal with our
Brethren always as <hi>they</hi> perhaps deserve of us, but deal better with them
then so; to proffer them some <hi>condescensions,</hi> seek some such ways and
means to reconcile them to us.</p>
            <p>This is truly <hi>Christian,</hi> if to be <hi>like Christ</hi> be to be truly Christian, and
as fit it is for such times as the <hi>Philippians</hi> then were in; nothing <hi>more</hi> fit
in the times either of <hi>growing</hi> Heresies, or <hi>pressing</hi> troubles, then to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend</hi>
a little to <hi>win</hi> the one, and <hi>give</hi> a little to <hi>avoid</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>And as well it answers to our English rendring it, <hi>Moderation.</hi> Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is nothing else but a moderating that <hi>summum jus,</hi> a bringing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
right to moderate terms, and so striving to be good to them with
whom the contestation is, <hi>to overcome</hi> them into peace and agreement
with us, and so avoid the trouble and vexation, that else is like to come
from them to us, and likely from us to them again, that we be not found
smiting our <hi>fellow Servants,</hi> fighting with one another when our <hi>Lord</hi> comes.
A fit vertue this, to answer that part of the Text too, the <hi>Lords being at
hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A <hi>second</hi> interpretation there is that suits as well; for <hi>humanity</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57113:22"/>
               <hi>civility</hi> it is taken. And truly Christianity teaches not to be <hi>uncivil,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
not uncivil language, not so much as a <hi>thou fool,</hi> threatens <hi>Hell fire</hi>
to such a tongue, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 22. allows not that which is less, a <hi>Racha,</hi>
any kind of expression of contempt, or vilifying our Brother. Such a
fault must come before the <hi>Council,</hi> we must be brought to the Council. Table
for it of God and Christ, and fin'd at what they please for the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour,
though the <hi>Common Law</hi> peradventure will not reach to punish
it. 'Tis none of <hi>Christs</hi> Religion that teaches men to be uncivil; no, not
to return <hi>one</hi> incivility with <hi>another:</hi> no, not <hi>revile again though we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled,</hi>
says St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and brings <hi>Christ</hi> for an example, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 23. <hi>Others</hi>
doing us wrong, nay shrewdly persecuting us too, will not authorize <hi>us</hi>
to do it, to requite our very <hi>persecutors</hi> with any <hi>incivility.</hi> A good <hi>memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>
for those who make it an especial sign of their being better <hi>Christians</hi>
then others, to be rude and uncivil to their <hi>betters,</hi> to be saucy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
to any, to all that run not riot with them into the same madness
and folly, Sacriledge and Heresie, that cannot be content to do men
wrong, and rob them of their dues, but must do it with <hi>ill language</hi> and
<hi>incivility.</hi> They forget sure the <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand, that there is any <hi>such</hi>
thing as a <hi>Lord,</hi> any superiour above them, either at hand, or afar off, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>this</hi> world or in the <hi>other.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is for moderation in
this point too, civil and handsom terms, gestures, and carriage, that
we should carry our selves <hi>like</hi> men, at least, if we will not like <hi>Christians.</hi>
And for such times as the Text refers to, 'tis but seasonable: 1. That
the <hi>sufferers</hi> do not increase their sufferings with their own incivilities, or
corrupt or <hi>dishonour</hi> them, by so doing: and 2. That those that <hi>cause</hi>
them to suffer, do not <hi>enhance</hi> the others sufferings, remembring that
<hi>themselves</hi> also are but men, and the <hi>spoke</hi> of the wheel, (<hi>as that Captive
King observed</hi>) which is <hi>now</hi> above, may <hi>by and by</hi> be below again, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be true (as true it is) that the <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand, his Chariot is
coming after, and the Mother of <hi>Sisera,</hi> the <hi>greatest Captain,</hi> need not
ask, why tarry the Wheels of it so long, why is it so long a coming? It
will come and will not tarry; 'tis happy if it come not on us whilst we
are <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting</hi> and <hi>railing</hi> against any whosoever.</p>
            <p>3. There is a third signification of the word for Modesty, so the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
renders it <hi>Modestia.</hi> As fit a posture for <hi>sad</hi> times, for <hi>any</hi> times, <hi>be</hi>
the Lord at hand, or be he <hi>not,</hi> as <hi>any</hi> whatsoever. Not the peculiar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>women</hi> only, though <hi>of them,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 9. but of <hi>men too,</hi> an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
way to win our adversaries, to win <hi>Infidels</hi> to Christianity, when
they shall behold our conversation in all sweetness and composure, our
bodies comely and decently apparelled, our gate sober, our gesture grave,
our eyes modest, our countenance compos'd, our speech discreet, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
all in order: when they shall see us merry without <hi>lightness,</hi> jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without <hi>scurrility,</hi> sober without <hi>sullenness,</hi> grave without <hi>doggedness,</hi>
compos'd without <hi>affectedness,</hi> serious without <hi>dulness,</hi> all our demeanour
wholly bent to all Christian <hi>well-pleasingness,</hi> at all times, with all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
upon all occasions, in all places, and businesses. This is nothing but
<hi>moderation</hi> neither; we may keep the English still, moderation in our <hi>garb</hi>
and <hi>habit,</hi> and <hi>discourse,</hi> and <hi>motion; modesty,</hi> that is <hi>moderation</hi> in them all.</p>
            <p>4. Yet there is a <hi>fourth</hi> acception of the word, for that sweet, and
meek, and gentle temper of the <hi>mind,</hi> whereby we carry our selves pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and unmov'd in <hi>persecution,</hi> not rendring evil for evil to them that
persecute us, not vexing and tearing our selves upon it, not studying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or returning mischief, but on the contrary good for evil, blessing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57113:22"/>
for cursing, prayers for imprecations, committing our cause, and our
selves to <hi>God,</hi> that judgeth righteously; this is the true Christian
<hi>moderation,</hi> that <hi>to which</hi> we are <hi>called,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter;</hi> that <hi>of which</hi> Christ
gave us an example, suffered as well for <hi>that</hi> to give us an example of it,
as any thing else, 1 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 21, 22, 23. That <hi>to which</hi> belongs the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
S. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 5. from this <hi>Lord</hi> that is at hand. 'Tis the very <hi>vocation</hi>
of a <hi>Christian,</hi> the very <hi>design</hi> of the Christians <hi>Lord,</hi> a blessedness there
is in the very <hi>doing</hi> it, when and whilst we so suffer, we are blessed, S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
v. 10. even <hi>before</hi> that great reward in <hi>heaven,</hi> bidden therefore, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.
<hi>to rejoyce and be exceeding glad upon it,</hi> bidden by S. <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>count it all joy,</hi>
S. <hi>Iames</hi> i. 2. bidden by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi> before the Text; to <hi>rejoyce and
rejoyce again</hi> upon it. Nay so exceeding joy it seems the <hi>Christian</hi> feels in
it, that he is fain upon the back of it in this very verse to call to us to be
<hi>moderate</hi> in the expressing it, to call to us for moderation in it, lest we
should even <hi>burst</hi> with it, or overflow into some extraordinary <hi>effusions</hi> of
it, and so <hi>provoke</hi> more affliction by it. Rejoyce the <hi>Apostle</hi> would have us
in our sufferings for <hi>Christ,</hi> but yet with <hi>moderation,</hi> be meek, and patient,
and contented, and resigned in them, yet not as we were <hi>sensless,</hi> careless,
or desperate, but discreet and <hi>moderate</hi> in them all: neither so sensible of
them, nor <hi>anxious</hi> in them, as to forget others, and our respects due to
any of them; nor so sensless and careless to forget our <hi>selves,</hi> and the care
<hi>due</hi> unto our selves. This the <hi>moderation</hi> most proper to the <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>time,</hi>
persons under persecution, and in the time of being so, the most seasonable
advice: and as seasonable to be given when the <hi>Lord is at hand:</hi> modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be observed in the expectation of his coming. <hi>They were not too
hastily to expect it.</hi> The <hi>Thessalonians</hi> were almost shaken in mind, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by so hasty a conceit, that the <hi>day of Christ was at hand,</hi> 2 Thess. ii. 2.
That Christ was just then a coming; S. <hi>Paul</hi> was fain to stop their haste, to
moderate their expectation, to tell them though the day was <hi>near,</hi> it was
not <hi>so</hi> near as they supposed it, they must be content to expect a little
longer, some things were to be done first. So necessary seems modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this point too, lest expecting the Lord too soon, and failing of
him, they should be shaken, and fall away from him, as if he had decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, quit their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> for want of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>moderation.</hi>
Thus you have the <hi>four</hi> senses of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>four</hi> kinds of moderation. <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
or <hi>Clemency, Humanity</hi> or <hi>Civility, Modesty</hi> or <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness.</hi>
It follows next that they be <hi>shewed,</hi> that we <hi>shew</hi> them all, that we
make them <hi>known. Let your moderation be known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For sufficient it is not always to <hi>do</hi> well; we must be <hi>known</hi> to do it,
though not do it <hi>to be</hi> known; yet be known <hi>to do</hi> it. Indeed when we fast,
or pray, or give alms, or do any good work, we must not do it, that we
may <hi>appear</hi> to men to do so, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 3, 4, 6, 18. yet it must appear
to men, for all that, sometimes <hi>that</hi> we do so. <hi>Ye,</hi> that is, ye <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
are <hi>the light of the world,</hi> and a light is not to be put <hi>under a bushel,</hi>
S. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 15. but on a <hi>Candlestick,</hi> to give <hi>light unto all that are in the house.
Let your light therefore shine before men, ver.</hi> 16. Shine so before them,
that they may see your good works, see and glorifie, <hi>glorifie God</hi> that has
given such graces unto men: glorifie him again by taking thence <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
of such things to themselves. There have been, are still, doubtless,
<hi>many</hi> that <hi>brag</hi> much of Faith and Holiness, and Purity; nay of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and moderation too; but if we call them to S. <hi>Iames</hi> his shew us
them, as he requires them, by their works, we may say as Christ said of
the <hi>Lepers</hi> that were cleansed, S. <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 18. There are scarce found
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57113:23"/>
one of ten that shew that return of Glory unto <hi>God;</hi> if one, they
count him but a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> no true <hi>Israelite</hi> for it: though S. <hi>Iames</hi> says
expresly, Faith is <hi>dead,</hi> where there is no such <hi>expression:</hi> and for those
other vertues, the very <hi>action</hi> is so evidently <hi>outward,</hi> that they must needs
be known <hi>where</hi> they are, they cannot be hid, are not the vertues they
pretend to, if not known. It were strange to hear of equity, or civility,
or modesty, or moderation that could not be <hi>seen;</hi> ridiculous to call <hi>him</hi>
merciful or equitable that <hi>shews</hi> it not by some condescension, to stile <hi>him</hi>
civil whose <hi>behaviour</hi> is nothing less, <hi>him</hi> modest who shews nothing but
immodesty, <hi>him</hi> meek who expresses nothing but <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>impatience.</hi>
These are vertues we must needs see where e're they be.</p>
            <p>It is reported of S. <hi>Lucian</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> that he converted many by his
modest, cheerful, and pious look and carriage, and of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> that
<hi>In carne ejus apparebat gratia quaedam spiritualis,</hi> &amp;c. There appeared a kind of
spiritual grace throughout his body, there shone a heavenly <hi>brightness</hi> in
his face, there darted an <hi>Angelical</hi> purity and <hi>Dove-like</hi> simplicity from his
eyes, so great was the inward beauty of his inward man, that it poured out
it self in his whole outward man abundantly over all his parts and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
No motion in them but with Reason and Religion. Where such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is, it will be <hi>known; must</hi> be too: must so be exprest that men may know
and feel the benefits and effects; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Let your <hi>moderation</hi> speak for
you, whose servants you are, <hi>what</hi> Lord you are under, what is your
expectation and your faith.</p>
            <p>3. Nor is it <hi>thirdly</hi> enough to have it known to <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> to a few, or
to the <hi>houshold of faith alone.</hi> To <hi>all men,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle, Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,
Friend</hi> and <hi>Foe, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Hereticks, good</hi> and
<hi>bad, Christian</hi> and <hi>Infidel.</hi> Condescend to men of low estate, the very
lowest says our <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. xii. 16. Provide things honest in the
sight of <hi>all men, ver.</hi> 17. live peaceably <hi>with all men,</hi> ver. 8. do all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to live so: having your conversation honest among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that
by your good works which they shall behold, they may glorifie God in
the day of visitation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 12. full of <hi>equity,</hi> that they may not
speak evil of you as <hi>rigorous</hi> and <hi>unmerciful;</hi> full of <hi>courtesie</hi> and <hi>civility,</hi>
that the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> be not blasphem'd for a Doctrine of <hi>rudeness</hi>
and <hi>incivility;</hi> full of <hi>modesty,</hi> that the adversary speak not reproachful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the word of truth, have no occasion to do so by your <hi>immodesty;</hi> full
of <hi>moderation,</hi> that all good men may glorifie <hi>God</hi> for your professed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> to those <hi>hard</hi> points in <hi>hard</hi> times, to meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and moderation, when your adversaries are so violent and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
set against you. Known must our moderation be in all its <hi>parts,</hi> that
all may know the <hi>purity</hi> of our profession, the <hi>soundness</hi> of our Religion,
the <hi>Grace</hi> of God appearing in us, the <hi>adversary</hi> be convinced, the <hi>Christian</hi>
Brethren incited by our examples to the same grace and vertue.</p>
            <p>One note <hi>especially</hi> we are to carry hence, that it is no excuse for our
impatience, harshness or any immodest or immoderate fierceness against
any, that they are men of a <hi>contrary</hi> opinion, we use so ill: Men they are,
and even under that <hi>notion</hi> moderation to be used towards them; much
more if we acknowledge the same <hi>Lord</hi> or his being any way near either
to reward or punish. And so I pass to the second <hi>General,</hi> the <hi>Christians
comfort</hi> that holds up his head in the bitterest storms, and makes him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
quite through them all. <hi>The Lord is at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Lord</hi> is several ways said to be at hand, many ways to be near
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57113:23"/>
He is at hand, or near us by his divine <hi>essence, not far,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul</hi>
from <hi>every one of us,</hi> Acts xvii. 27. he is <hi>every</hi> where, we therefore <hi>no</hi>
where, but that he is near us.</p>
            <p>He is near us 2. by his <hi>Humanity.</hi> The taking <hi>that</hi> upon him has brought
him nigh indeed to be <hi>bone</hi> of our <hi>bone,</hi> and <hi>flesh</hi> of our <hi>slesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is nearer us yet 3. by his <hi>Grace.</hi> One with us, and we with him;
<hi>one Spirit</hi> too, he in us and we in him, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 20.</p>
            <p>He is at hand, and nigh us 4. in our Prayers. So holy <hi>David, The Lord is
nigh unto them that call upon him, all such as call upon him faithfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is nigh us 5. in his <hi>Word,</hi> in our <hi>Mouths,</hi> and in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> by the
word of Faith that is preached to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 8. we need not up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
nor down to the deep, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to find out <hi>Christ,</hi> that eternal
word is nigh enough us in his word.</p>
            <p>He is nigh us 6. in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> so near in <hi>Baptism</hi> as to touch and
wash us, <hi>especially</hi> so near in the Blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his Body and Blood,
as to be almost touched by us: there he is truly, really, miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with us, and united to us. 'Tis want of eyes if we discern not
his Body there, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 29. in that, or see not his power in the
other.</p>
            <p>He is at hand 7. with his <hi>Iudgments, Behold the Iudge standeth at the door,</hi>
S. James v. 9. Just before he had said the coming of the Lord draweth
nigh: but at the second look he even sees him <hi>at the door.</hi> Now of <hi>this</hi>
coming <hi>two</hi> sorts we find expected even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, his coming
in judgment against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to destroy his <hi>Crucifiers,</hi> the unbelieving
<hi>Iews,</hi> and the <hi>Apostate Christians</hi> the <hi>Gnostick Hereticks,</hi> that together with
the <hi>Iews</hi> persecuted the Church of Christ; and his last coming at the
<hi>general</hi> Judgment. We may add a <hi>third,</hi> his being always ready at hand
to deliver his faithful servants out of their troubles, and to revenge them
in due time of all those that causlesly rise up against them. The <hi>first</hi> kind
of his coming to Judgment, that against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is the coming by
which the <hi>Apostle</hi> comforts his <hi>Philippians,</hi> that the Lord was now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deliver the persecuted Saints out of their hands. The <hi>third</hi> is that
by which our drooping spirits are supported in all distresses, that he
is near to help us in them all. The second his coming at last in the <hi>general</hi>
Judgment, <hi>then</hi> howsoever, to make a full amends for all, is the great
stay of all our hope, all Christians from first to last. No great matter
how we are here from time to time driven to our shifts, the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will pay for all.</p>
            <p>Nor do any of the <hi>other</hi> comings want their comfort: 'Tis a comfort
that <hi>God</hi> is so near us in his essence, so that in him we live, and move, and
have our being: our life and being are surely the better by it. 2. 'Tis a
great comfort that our <hi>Lord</hi> would vouchsafe us so great an honour as to
become like <hi>one</hi> of us to walk and speak, and eat, and drink, and be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and weep, and live, and die like <hi>one</hi> of us. 3. 'Tis an inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
comfort that he will dwell in us by his <hi>Grace</hi> and Holy Spirit;
make us Holy as himself is Holy. 4. 'Tis a gracious comfort that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
us so ordinarily to discourse with him in our <hi>Prayers.</hi> 5. 'Tis an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
comfort, and that such a one as he affords not to other Nations, to
give us by his word, the knowledge of his Laws, to reveal unto us his
whole will and pleasure. 6. 'Tis a comfort to a <hi>miracle</hi> that he will yet
draw nearer to us, and draw us nearer to himself by the <hi>mysterious</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of himself, his very Blood and Body to us. No greater
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57113:24"/>
               <hi>establishment</hi> to our souls, no higher <hi>solace</hi> to our spirits, no firmer <hi>hopes</hi> of
the Resurrection of our bodies, then by his thus not only being <hi>at</hi> hand,
but <hi>in</hi> our hands, and in our <hi>mouths.</hi> I speak <hi>mysteries</hi> in <hi>the spirit,</hi> but the
comfort never a whit the less: the joy of the <hi>Spirit</hi> far the greater
ever. But all these comforts heapt together, what comfort in the
world like the faithful Christians, all so great, so certain, so nigh at
hand?</p>
            <p>And yet if I take hint from the <hi>Churches</hi> choice of this Text for the
front of her <hi>Epistle</hi> this day to her Children, and say, the Lord may be
said to be at hand too, because the <hi>Feast</hi> of his coming, that coming
which gave <hi>rise</hi> to all the rest, the original of all the rest of his gracious
comings is <hi>at hand</hi> to us. I shall not strain much, and to those that truly
love his appearance, that can really endure to hear of his coming, any day
that shall put 'um in mind of his being at hand must needs be a comfort,
a <hi>day</hi> of <hi>good</hi> tidings: and this as well as any of the rest will afford us an
argument to perswade to <hi>moderation,</hi> to make it known to all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
at the time when the Grace of God appeared to all men whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Which passes me over to the <hi>third</hi> general, the <hi>connexion</hi> of the
Christians <hi>Duty</hi> and his <hi>comfort,</hi> or the perswasion <hi>to</hi> the duty <hi>from</hi> the
comfort of the <hi>Lords</hi> coming. And so many perswasive arguments there
are from it, as there are comings, so many reasons to perswade modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as there are ways of our Lords being at hand: nay one more, and
it shall go <hi>first</hi> because it stand so.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord</hi> it is we do it to, to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and not unto <hi>men:</hi> let that go
for the <hi>first</hi> reason. 'Tis to him, and for his sake we are enjoyn'd it. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> thought it a good argument to perswade <hi>Servants</hi> to their <hi>duties, Eph.</hi>
vi. 7. to do their service with a good will too; and we all are <hi>Servants,</hi>
and here is our <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here 2. and <hi>at hand,</hi> on every hand. We cannot go out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
Let <hi>that</hi> teach us righteousness and equity, modesty and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to do all things as <hi>in his</hi> presence. Would we but think this when
we go about any thing, did we but consider seriously the <hi>Lord</hi> was so <hi>near</hi>
us, heard us, and look'd upon us; our words would be wiser, and our
actions better. We durst not look an immodest look, nor speak an unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
word, nor do any iniquity, or any thing out of order. The <hi>Lord</hi>
is at <hi>hand,</hi> and sees what we are doing; let all then be done with <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Lord</hi> has taken on our nature, and come <hi>nearer;</hi> yet given us
by it an example so to do; to be so moderate as to wash even <hi>Iudas's</hi> feet,
to do good, to be civil and modest, and moderate, even towards them that
are ready to <hi>betray</hi> us, who will do so the next hour, have bargain'd for't
already: he came so nigh us in our nature, that we might so come nigh
him in his Graces; took up our <hi>nature,</hi> that we might take up his <hi>example;</hi>
drew so nigh us, that we might not draw off our affection from our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but serve them in love, how ill soever they serve us: he took
hands and feet to be at hand, to teach our hands and feet how to behave
and moderate themselves towards others.</p>
            <p>4. He is at hand with his <hi>Grace</hi> to help us: there is no excuse of <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</hi>
By <hi>him I can do all things,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> that <hi>strengthens</hi>
me, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 13. Be it never so hard, his grace is sufficient for us, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to enable us to all grace and vertue, even the hardest, and in the
most difficult exigencies and occasions. This he offers to us, offers it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57113:24"/>
more abundant grace. Let us accept it then and walk-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it in all modesty and moderation.</p>
            <p>5. He is at hand to our <hi>Prayers:</hi> let us then desire the grace we just
now spake of. Deny us he will not; do but knock and he comes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
To him that <hi>knocks,</hi> says he, it shall <hi>be opened.</hi> Let us but come
with meek and patient spirits, in love and charity with all men, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them that we may be forgiven, and speed we shall; be merciful
and moderate towards them, so will <hi>God</hi> be merciful and moderate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: moderate at least the <hi>punishments</hi> due to our <hi>iniquities.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi>
is at hand always to hear such a mans prayers; learn we therefore <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The Lord is near us in his <hi>word.</hi> This is his command and will,
must therefore be performed. If the will of the Lord be so, that we
must suffer for righteousness sake, let every answer to our <hi>persecutors</hi> be
with <hi>meekness and fear,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. iii. 15. for happy are you, says
he, and therefore be not <hi>afraid</hi> of their <hi>terror,</hi> neither <hi>be troubled,</hi> ver. 14.
moderate your passions and your fears, and esteem your selves happy by
so suffering, by so doing. 'Tis your Masters revealed will that so it should
be, 'tis his way to draw you nearer to himself, by working you to the
image of his sufferings.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand, the <hi>Iudge</hi> is coming: At hand to <hi>reward</hi> us for
all our sufferings, all our patience and moderation, all our modest and
civil conversation, all our righteousness and mercy. Not one Sparrow,
not the least feather of a good work shall fall to the ground, not one half
farthing be lost, not a hair of any righteous action perish: he is at hand
to take all up that nothing be lost. At hand he is 2. to <hi>deliver</hi> us out of
the hands of all that hate us: if <hi>temporal</hi> deliverance be best, to give us
that; if not, to deliver us however over into <hi>glory.</hi> At hand 3. to take
<hi>revenge</hi> upon his enemies, to repay his adversaries. He came presently
after this <hi>Epistle</hi> to do so to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to destroy the incredulous <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Apostate Hereticks,</hi> those persecutors of the Christian Faith, came with
a <hi>heavy</hi> hand, that they fell to their utter ruine and desolation. Thus
he being at hand to reward and punish, may well serve as an argument to
perswade us to be patient for so short a while, to be moderate both in our
<hi>fears</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> in our <hi>words,</hi> and in our <hi>actions,</hi> to bear a while and <hi>say</hi>
nothing, to endure a while and <hi>do</hi> nothing; for one there is a coming,
nay, now <hi>at hand</hi> to deliver us, to plead our cause, to revenge our quarrel:
let us commit it to him. He is the Judge of all the world, and judges
right: Let us do nothing but with moderation, and not think much to
shew it unto all, when we are sure to be rewarded for it: and those that
observe it not, are sure to be punished.</p>
            <p>8. The Lord is at hand in the blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that is also now
at hand; but a week between us and it. And <hi>moderation</hi> of all kinds is but
a due <hi>preparation</hi> to it, some special act of it to be done against it: Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and equity is the habitation of his seat, says <hi>David:</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>
sits not, nor abides where they are not. The holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> that is his
Seat, a Seat of wonder, is not set but in the righteous and good soul, has
no efficacy but there. <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> are the steps to it; into the
modest and humble soul only will he vouchsafe to come. All <hi>reverence</hi>
and <hi>civility</hi> is but requisite in our addresses unto it. But <hi>moderation, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>sweetness,</hi> and <hi>forgiving</hi> injuries is so requisite that
there is no coming there, no offering at the altar till we be first reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57113:25"/>
to our Brother. <hi>Go be first</hi> reconciled <hi>to thy Brother,</hi> says our Lord <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
S. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 24. so that now if we desire a blessing of the blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
unto us; if we desire the <hi>Lord</hi> should <hi>there</hi> come to us, let our
moderation be known to all men before we come. Let us study the art of
reconcilement, let us not stand upon <hi>points</hi> of honour or <hi>punctilio's</hi> with
our Brother, upon quirks and niceties; let us part with somewhat of
our right; let us do it civilly, use all men with courtesie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
express all modesty and sweetness in our conversation; all
softness and moderation, patience and meekness, gentleness and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindness towards all, even the <hi>bitterest</hi> of our enemies; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand: the <hi>Lord</hi> of Righteousness expects our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and equity; the <hi>Lord</hi> in his body, and looks for the reverent
and handsom behaviour of <hi>our</hi> bodies; the <hi>Lord</hi> of pure eyes and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure any unseemliness or intemperance either in our inward or
outward man: the Lord that <hi>died</hi> and suffered for us, and upon that
score requires we should be content to suffer also any thing for <hi>him,</hi> not
to be angry, or troubled, or repine, or murmur at it, or at them that
cause it. At the Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> he is so near at hand, that he is at
the Table with us, reaches to every one a portion of himself, yet will
give it to none but such as come in an <hi>universal</hi> Charity with all the
forementioned <hi>moderations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to conclude the <hi>Text</hi> as I began it, and fix the <hi>last</hi>
Argument upon the <hi>time.</hi> The time is now approaching wherein
the <hi>Lord</hi> came down from Heaven, that he might be the more at
hand. Fit it is we should strive to be the more at hand to him, the
<hi>readier</hi> at his command and service: the time wherein he <hi>moderated</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and glory as it were to teach <hi>us moderation,</hi> appeared so to all,
that our moderation also might <hi>appear</hi> to all of what size, or rank, or sect
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I remember a story of <hi>Constantia</hi> Queen of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and resolving to sacrifice him to death to
revenge the death of her Nephew <hi>Conradinus,</hi> basely and unworthily
put to death by his Father <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjon,</hi> sent the message to him on a
<hi>Friday</hi> morning to <hi>prepare</hi> himself for death. The young <hi>Prince</hi> (it
seems not guilty of his Fathers cruelty) returns her this answer; That,
besides other courtesies received from her <hi>Majesty</hi> in <hi>Prison,</hi> she did him
a <hi>singular</hi> favour to appoint the day of his death on a <hi>Friday,</hi> and that
it was good reason he should die <hi>culpable</hi> on <hi>that</hi> day whereon <hi>Christ</hi>
died <hi>innocent.</hi> The answer related, so much mov'd <hi>Constantia,</hi> that
she sends him this reply: Tell Prince <hi>Charles</hi> if he take contentment
to suffer death on a <hi>Friday,</hi> because Christ <hi>died</hi> on it; I will likewise
find my satisfaction to <hi>pardon him</hi> also on the <hi>same</hi> day that <hi>Iesus</hi> sign'd
my pardon, and the pardon of his <hi>Executioners</hi> with his Blood. God
forbid I shed the blood of a man, on the day my <hi>Master</hi> shed <hi>his</hi> for
me. I will not rest upon the bitterness of <hi>revenge,</hi> I <hi>freely</hi> pardon
him.</p>
            <p>Behold a Speech of a <hi>Queen</hi> worthy to command the <hi>world,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a Christian indeed. To <hi>apply</hi> it, is only to tell you, we may

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND in that day there <hi>shall be.</hi> And in this day there
<hi>was</hi> a root of <hi>Iesse</hi> that put forth its branch. That
day was but the <hi>Prophesie,</hi> this day is the <hi>Gospel</hi> of it.
Now first (to speak it in the <hi>Psalmists</hi> phrase) truth
flourished out of the earth: now first the truth of it
appeared.</p>
            <p>Some indeed have applied it to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not amiss in a lower sense; but the <hi>Apostle</hi> who is the best <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi>

find the <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>him</hi> it suits to more exactly every tittle of it, and of
the Chapter hitherto, than to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> or any else.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> was properly the <hi>branch</hi> that was then to grow out of old <hi>Iesse</hi>'s root.
For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was born and grown up already some years before, thirteen
at least. He 2. it is whom the Spirit of the <hi>Lord</hi> does <hi>rest</hi> upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
upon <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and all of us; it is the Dove <hi>going</hi> and <hi>returning.</hi> Upon

and understanding, and counsel, and might, and the rest is poured
out upon. He 4. it is alone, that judges the earth in righteousness,
which is said of <hi>this</hi> root, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. He 5. it is that shall smite the earth,

as is prophesied of <hi>him, ver. 6. He</hi> the only <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>God</hi> of Peace, that
can reconcile all enmities and difference, that can unite all disagreeing
spirits. In a word, <hi>He</hi> is the very only <hi>He</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath set up for an

them the <hi>Assyrian</hi> in the former Chapter) there should a day of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
at last appear, a day of rest and glory, when the <hi>Messiah</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi>
should come to <hi>perfect</hi> all their deliverances, and not only <hi>theirs</hi> but the

dwell and rest gloriously among them, and bring them also to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
rest and glory. I begin at the <hi>root</hi> of this great <hi>design,</hi> to shew you
<hi>who</hi> it is, and <hi>whence</hi> he comes, that shall thus stand up for the rest and
glory of the <hi>People.</hi> And the <hi>Root of Iesse</hi> here he is call'd: There shall
be <hi>a root of Iesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>first verse</hi> his <hi>stile</hi> somewhat differs: He is called a <hi>Rod</hi> out of
the stem of <hi>Iesse,</hi> and a branch out of his Roots, and he is them all; and
this root in the <hi>Text,</hi> but a <hi>Metonymy</hi> to express them all.</p>
            <p>1. He is a Rod, the <hi>Rod,</hi> the staff that so comforted old <hi>David, Psal.</hi>
xxiii. that even raises his dead bones out of the <hi>Grave,</hi> and makes him
as it were walk still among the <hi>living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>staff</hi> that supported dying <hi>Iacob,</hi> which he lean'd upon, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
<hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 21. which <hi>we</hi> may worship too without any <hi>Idolatry. A
Rod,</hi> a <hi>Staff</hi> he is to lean upon, a staff that will not fail us, not like the
<hi>reeds</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the supports and succours that the <hi>world</hi> affords us: they
will but run into our hands and hurt us, to be sure never be able to
hold us up. This <hi>Christ</hi> is the only staff for <hi>that.</hi> A staff that will <hi>comfort</hi>
us when we are ready to die, that we may trust to <hi>upon</hi> our death-beds,
that we may commit our <hi>dying spirits</hi> to, as S. <hi>Stephen</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 59. No
other can do that but this of <hi>Christ.</hi> Indeed no rod hath either comfort
or strength to hold by but only <hi>He.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:57113:27"/>
Yet a <hi>rod</hi> 2. he is, to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>correct</hi> us too, as there is need; a rod
of <hi>iron</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> bruises the <hi>rebellious spirits,</hi> Psal. ii. 9. The rod or
<hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the <hi>Shepherds</hi> rod or hook; <hi>one</hi> to shew his <hi>Kingly</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the other his <hi>Priestly</hi> power over us. So the word denotes <hi>two</hi> of his
prime offices out to us, and may yet intimate a <hi>third;</hi> the <hi>Shepherds</hi> rod
being not so much to <hi>strike,</hi> as to <hi>direct</hi> and lead the stragling <hi>Sheep</hi> into
the way: a part of his <hi>Prophetick</hi> Office. So a word well chosen to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
unto us all his <hi>three</hi> Offices. And the Rod or Wand that is carried
before the <hi>Iudge,</hi> when he goes to the Judgment-seat, may not unfitly
be added to the other, and put us in mind that this our <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Priest,</hi>
and <hi>Prophet,</hi> shall also come to be our <hi>Iudge;</hi> and we therefore so to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it, so to yield our obedience to him, so to submit to his Rod, as we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to answer it, when he comes to be our <hi>Iudge,</hi> as we expect or hope
to have his favour in the day of <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he is a <hi>Rod</hi> 3. new <hi>springing</hi> out of the root, a kind of <hi>pliable</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thing, so stil'd for his <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> ready to be wound and
turn'd any way for <hi>our</hi> service, to become any thing, to become all things
for <hi>our</hi> good. A rod so pliant, so flexible, so pliable, so tender; never
any <hi>son</hi> of <hi>man</hi> so pliant to his <hi>Fathers</hi> will, so flexible to all good, so pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to do or suffer, so tender over us, never so meek, and humble, and
lowly, <hi>never any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did 4. ever rod grow out of a more <hi>unlikely</hi> stem, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: the word
used here imports a dead <hi>trunck</hi> cut close down to the earth, no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of life or power in it. The Royal Family of <hi>David</hi> was come to
that, nothing appeared above ground that could give hope of the least
<hi>bud</hi> or leaf. And <hi>then</hi> it was, that notwithstanding this Rod came forth.
<hi>So low may things be brought to humane eyes, and yet rise again:</hi> Gods time is
often then. When our eyes are ready to fail with expectation, and all
hopes have given up the <hi>Ghost;</hi> when the Family of <hi>David,</hi> from whence
all the promis'd and look'd for hope was in a condition near an <hi>extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
when <hi>Herod</hi> had usurp'd the Throne, and the <hi>Romans</hi> setled him,
and his succession in it; when not so much as a <hi>sprig,</hi> or <hi>bud,</hi> or <hi>string</hi> of
hope could be seen by the quickest sight, <hi>then</hi> out starts this <hi>rod</hi> upon a
sudden, and prospers to a wonder. Well might the <hi>Prophet</hi> put <hi>Wonderful</hi>
for one of his names; there was never any like him: and it may <hi>teach</hi>
us <hi>first</hi> to adore this wonder, to kiss this Rod, support or comfort us,
rule or correct us how it will; and 2. thankfully admire <hi>Gods</hi> goodness
that thus does so <hi>unexpectedly</hi> often for us.</p>
            <p>And upon this next title we may do as much: For he is not only a bare
<hi>single</hi> rod, but a <hi>branch</hi> that spreads it self abroad into <hi>twigs</hi> and little
<hi>boughs.</hi> Two <hi>main</hi> ones at the first, his <hi>Divinity</hi> and his <hi>Humanity;</hi> from
which infinite little twigs and leaves, infinite graces and blessings are
extended to us. <hi>My servant the branch,</hi> God calls him, <hi>Zach.</hi> iii. 8. And
the <hi>man</hi> whose <hi>name</hi> is the <hi>Branch, Zach.</hi> vi. 12. The word in both places

For it is not 2. a meer <hi>sprout,</hi> or yet a <hi>barren</hi> one, but <hi>flourishing</hi> and

none of his beauty, or sweetness, by being broken and bruis'd upon the

               <hi>servavit,</hi> to reserve or

            <p>And from the same <hi>Hebrew</hi> root, so signifying <hi>servavit,</hi> we have <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator,</hi>
our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Conservator,</hi> pointed to us. This <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> this <hi>Branch,</hi>
this <hi>Flower</hi> bears in its <hi>name</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> and hath been by <hi>some</hi> drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to be sure can be no mistake, to tell you either from the <hi>Word,</hi> or any way
else, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> is design'd by it; and this <hi>Rod,</hi> and <hi>Branch,</hi> and <hi>Root</hi>
is none but <hi>He.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Root</hi> indeed he is, as well as a <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Branch;</hi> a Root without a
<hi>Metonymy,</hi> as well as by it. The very Root of all our happiness. The
Root in which our very life is hid. <hi>Our life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> says
the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 3. The <hi>Root</hi> 2. and foundation upon which we all
are built; we are all but so many twigs of this great Vine-root, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Branches</hi> from him, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 5. The <hi>Root</hi> 3. whence all good springs
up to us, all Flowers of Art, of Nature, all the <hi>staves</hi> of comfort, and
<hi>rods</hi> of hope, all the branches of grace, and glory; no name properer to
him in all these respects. Nay 4. Even the very <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Iesse</hi> too, from
whom <hi>Iesse</hi> had <hi>his</hi> original, from whom <hi>Iesse</hi>'s family throve into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
from whence his youngest sons <hi>Sheephook</hi> sprang into a Scepter: the
Root of <hi>David</hi> himself too, so says he of himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 16. Why
then say we, or why says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> the <hi>Root of Iesse? Why?</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reason <hi>neither. Iesse</hi> was but a poor man in <hi>Israel.</hi> My Family what is
it? says <hi>David</hi> himself, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xviii. 18. yet from <hi>Iesse</hi> would <hi>God</hi> raise
up <hi>Christ,</hi> that we might know <hi>God</hi> can bring any thing out of any thing.
He can raise <hi>Empires</hi> out of <hi>Sheepcotes;</hi> so he did <hi>Cyrus,</hi> so he did <hi>Romulus:</hi>
the one the Founder of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, the other of the <hi>Roman.</hi>
He raised the first Governour of the <hi>Iews,</hi> out of a bulrush-basket, and
the first States of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church out of a Fisher-boat: And <hi>not
many mighty, not many noble,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 16. <hi>But God hath chosen
the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, and base things
of the world, and things that are despised hath God chosen; yea, and things which
are not, to bring to nought things that are,</hi> ver. 17. 18. So little is <hi>God</hi> taken
with our greatness, our great birth or breeding.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to shame our pride, who undervalue mean things; ready
enough to say with the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> can any <hi>Good thing come out of
Nazareth?</hi> can any great eminent person spring out of the Root of <hi>Iesse?</hi>
Yes it can.</p>
            <p>And our great Ancestors will but shame us, as well as be asham'd of us,
if we have nothing to glory of but our relation to their <hi>ashes:</hi> Our high
descent is not worth the speaking of, and perhaps if we but trace it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
higher than our own memories (to be sure if to the first beginning) the
best and gloriousest <hi>Princes</hi> will find themselves deriv'd from as mean an
original as any poor <hi>Iesse</hi> whatsoever. And this may serve well to cut our
plumes, to stop our rantings of our descent and birth, or any thing, and
teach humility.</p>
            <p>To drive that lesson homer, I may note to you 3. that 'tis the root of
<hi>Iesse</hi> here, not <hi>David,</hi> (though otherwhere he is called the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>David,</hi>
as <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 5.) lest he should seem either to receive glory from <hi>David,</hi> or
need his name, to cover the obscurity of his beginning. There is no glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that of humility, nor any so truly honourable as the humble spirit.</p>
            <p>And of <hi>Iesse</hi> 4. not <hi>David,</hi> to point out as it were the very time of our
<hi>Messiah's</hi> coming; even then when there was scarce any thing to be seen
or heard of the house of <hi>David;</hi> the Royal Line as it were extinct, and
<hi>Davids</hi> house brought back again to its first beginning, to that private
and low condition it was in in the days of <hi>Iesse.</hi> Thus again would <hi>God</hi>
teach us to be humble in the midst of all our ruff, and glory, by thus shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us what the greatest Families of the greatest <hi>Princes</hi> may quickly
come to, where they may take up e're they are aware. And 2. to give
us the nearest sign both of <hi>Christs</hi> coming, and of himself; that when
things were at the lowest, then it would be, and that his coming would
be in a low condition too; in poverty and humility: <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Iesse both</hi>
intimate as much.</p>
            <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> if we may with some <hi>Etymologists</hi> derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
interpret it a <hi>gift,</hi> there will be as good a reason as any, why it is here said
rather of <hi>Iesse</hi> than of <hi>David;</hi> even because this root of all this good is to
us, comes meerly of <hi>free gift, So God loved the world,</hi> says S. <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. 16. that
he gave his only begotten Son; and <hi>not by works of righteousness which we
have done, but according to his mercy,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul:</hi> this great kindness of
<hi>God</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared towards us, this <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared to us,
<hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 4, 5. as a <hi>root,</hi> as a <hi>rod,</hi> as a <hi>branch;</hi> a <hi>root</hi> to settle us, a <hi>rod</hi> to
comfort us, a <hi>branch</hi> to shelter us; a <hi>root</hi> to give us life, a <hi>rod</hi> to rule us in
it, a <hi>branch</hi> to crown us for it; a close stubb'd <hi>root,</hi> a weak slender <hi>rod,</hi> a
tender <hi>branch</hi> full of loveliness, meekness and humility.</p>
            <p>And he appeared as they all do out of the earth, watered by the dew
of Heaven; they have no other <hi>Father</hi> than the <hi>heavenly showers:</hi> so by
the descending of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> as rain into a dry
ground, this holy <hi>Root</hi> put forth, this <hi>Branch</hi> sprung up without other
father of his <hi>humanity;</hi> which is the meaning both of <hi>erit</hi> in the Text,
and <hi>egredietur</hi> in the beginning, both of this <hi>shall</hi> be, here, and that
<hi>shall come forth,</hi> or there shall grow up, in the first <hi>verse</hi> of the <hi>Chapter.</hi>
And thus we have the <hi>first part</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>descent,</hi> and <hi>stock,</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and <hi>condition,</hi> and <hi>birth</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with other things pertaining to it.
And now <hi>for his design,</hi> to <hi>be set up, or stand for an Ensign to the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. And indeed, for that he was born to gather the stragling world
into <hi>one body,</hi> to unite the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> under <hi>one head,</hi> to bring the
straying sheep into <hi>one fold,</hi> to draw all the Armies of the earth together
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57113:29"/>
into one <hi>heavenly host,</hi> that we might all march lovingly under the banner
of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> under the command of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Men had long marched under the command of <hi>Flesh, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hell.
God</hi> had suffered all Nations, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to do so, to <hi>walk after their
own ways,</hi> Acts xiv. 16. But now he commands otherwise, <hi>commands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi>
and leave those unhappy <hi>Standards</hi> to come in to his, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 30.</p>
            <p>And he exempts none, debars none, all men every where are called
to it, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 30. <hi>every nation,</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> in every Nation, that
will come <hi>shall be accepted,</hi> Acts x. 35. <hi>every creature,</hi> says he <hi>himself,</hi>
St. <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 15. <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Greek, bond</hi> and <hi>free, male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> all one
here, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 28. Be we never so heavy laden with sins and infirmities,

pursued by our fiercest enemies, <hi>here</hi> we shall have shelter, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For he is not only an <hi>Ensign</hi> set up to invite us in, but an <hi>Ensign</hi> to
protect us too by the Armies it leads out for us.</p>
            <p>And as it <hi>first</hi> is set up to call us, and <hi>secondly</hi> to bring us into a
place of defence and safety, so does it <hi>thirdly</hi> stand to us, and not
leave us. An <hi>Ensign</hi> may be set up and quickly taken down, but this
stands and <hi>stands for ever.</hi> It is not idly said, when 'tis here said parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
<hi>it is to stand. Humane</hi> forces, devices, and designs may be set
up, and not stand at all; but <hi>God's</hi> and <hi>Christ's,</hi> theirs will: the gates
of <hi>Hell</hi> it self cannot disappoint them, cannot throw down this <hi>Banner,</hi>
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 18. <hi>His counsels shall stand, he will do all his pleasure,</hi> Isa. xlvi.
10. They do but fight against <hi>God</hi> that go about to resist it, says <hi>Gamaliel</hi>
the great <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> Acts v. 39.</p>
            <p>And will you know the Staff, the Colours, and the Flag or Streamer
of this Ensign? why, the <hi>Staff</hi> is his <hi>Cross,</hi> the <hi>Colours</hi> are <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and the <hi>Streamer</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or preaching of them to the world. The
Staff that carried the Colours, was of old time fashioned like a <hi>Cross,</hi> a
cross bar near the top, there was, from which the Flag or Streamer hung;
so as it were <hi>prefiguring,</hi> that all the Hosts and Armies of the Nations
were one day to be gathered under the <hi>Banner</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> to which Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
should daily flow out of all the Nations and Kingdoms of the earth.
By <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> the two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> is the way to him; and the Word
or <hi>Gospel</hi> preached is the Flag wav'd out to invite all people in.</p>
            <p>Come we then in <hi>first,</hi> and let not this <hi>Flag</hi> of Reconciliation, of peace
and treaty; for to such ends are <hi>Flags</hi> sometimes hung out, be set up in
vain; let it not stand like an <hi>Ensign forsaken, upon a hill:</hi> come we in to
treat with him at least about our everlasting peace, lest it become a <hi>Flag</hi>
of <hi>defiance</hi> by and by.</p>
            <p>Come we in 2. and submit to the conditions of peace, submit to his
orders and commands. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> reads: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, here, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
this: He that stands for an Ensign is to be the great <hi>Ruler</hi> and
<hi>Commander</hi> of the Nations; 'tis requisite therefore that we come in and
obey him.</p>
            <p>Come we 3. to this <hi>Standard,</hi> and remember we are also to <hi>fight</hi> under
it: That's the <hi>prime</hi> reason of <hi>Ensigns</hi> and <hi>Banners.</hi> We promise to do it
when we are Baptiz'd, and it must be our business to perform it. It is not
for us to be afraid of pains or labour, of danger or trouble, of our lives
and fortunes for <hi>Christs</hi> service, a Souldier scorns it, even he who fights
but for a <hi>little pay,</hi> and that commonly <hi>ill paid.</hi> And shall we turn cowards
when we fight for a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and that in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which we may be <hi>sure</hi>
of, if we fight well?</p>

Above all 4. if this <hi>Ensign</hi> stand up <hi>for</hi> us, let us stand up <hi>to</hi> it, and
stand <hi>for</hi> it to the last. A <hi>Souldier</hi> will venture all to save his colours, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>wrap</hi> himself up in them, and <hi>dye</hi> so, than part with them. For
<hi>Christ,</hi> for his <hi>Word,</hi> for his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> for his <hi>Cross,</hi> for our <hi>Gospel</hi> and
<hi>Religion</hi> we should do as much. But I am asham'd, the age has shewed us
too many cowards that have not only <hi>run</hi> away from this <hi>Standard,</hi> but
<hi>betray'd</hi> it too; the more unworthy certainly that they should ever reap
fruit or benefit, twig or branch from the root of <hi>Iesse.</hi> The very <hi>Gentiles</hi>
in the next words will sufficiently shame them. For to it, to this <hi>Ensign
do all the Gentiles seek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Shail,</hi> it is, I confess in the <hi>future tense</hi> here, reach'd no further
in the <hi>Prophets</hi> time, but now it does; the Prophesie is fulfill'd, it so
came to pass. And it <hi>quickly</hi> came so, after the <hi>Ensign</hi> was set up, the
<hi>Cross</hi> reared, and the Resurrection had display'd it. For <hi>I, if I be lifted up
from the earth,</hi> says he himself, <hi>will draw all men to me,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 32.
<hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Elamites, the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,
Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and Lybia, Rome and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,
as well as the dwellers in Iudea, Cretes and Arabians,</hi> as well as <hi>Israelites,
Proselites,</hi> as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> he will draw all in to him. The vast multitudes
that came daily in from all quarters of the world, so many Churches of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so suddenly rais'd and planted, are a sufficient evidence to
this great truth. And the term, the <hi>Iews</hi> at this day give the <hi>Christians</hi>
of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the very word in the <hi>Text</hi> for <hi>Gentiles,</hi> confirms as much by
their own confession. So true was both <hi>Isaiah's</hi> Prophesie here, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iacob</hi>'s so long before, that to him should <hi>the gathering of the people be,</hi>
Gen. xlix. 10. But that which is an evidence as great as any, if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies the <hi>Text</hi> as fulfilled then, <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 12. And
there is this only to be added for our particular, that we still go on and
continue seeking him.</p>
            <p>IV. But there is <hi>Rest,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> here added to the success of this great
design, <hi>His rest shall be glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by <hi>his Rest,</hi> we in the first place understand the <hi>Church,</hi> the place
where the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us <hi>his honour dwells,</hi> Psal. xxvi. 3. the place of
which himself says no less, than, <hi>This shall be my rest for ever; here will I
dwell, for I have delight therein,</hi> Psal. cxxxii. 14. And glorious it is the
Apostle tells us, <hi>a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle,</hi> Ephes. v. 27.
glorious all over, so glorious, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> says, the <hi>Gentiles shall come
to its Light,</hi> and <hi>Kings to the brightness of its rising,</hi> Isa. lx. 3. they shall <hi>bring
Gold and Incense from Shebah, the flocks of Kedar, and the rams of Nebaioth shall
come with acceptance to his Altar,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>the glory of Lebanon shall come unto
it,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>They shall call the walls of it salvation, and the gates praise,</hi> ver.
18. <hi>The Lord is an everlasting light unto it, and God is its glory,</hi> ver. 19. So
that we may well cry out with <hi>David,</hi> Glorious things are spoken of thee,
<hi>O thou City of God, thy Church, thy Congregation,</hi> O thou <hi>root of Iesse,</hi> thou
<hi>Son of David,</hi> which thou hast gathered, and thy Churches or holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
too which are rais'd to thee, exceed in glory; the <hi>beauty of Holiness,</hi>
thy holy mysteries, thy blessed self art there.</p>
            <p>And indeed in the holy Mysteries of the <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> is his <hi>second</hi>
place of <hi>Rest.</hi> There it is that the <hi>feeds his flock, and rests at noon,</hi> Cant. i. 7.
And he is glorious there, <hi>glorious</hi> in his Mercies, <hi>illustrious</hi> in his Benefits,
<hi>wonderful</hi> in his being there. No such wonder in the world, as his being
under these consecrated <hi>Elements,</hi> his feeding our souls with them, his
discovering himself from under them, by the comforts he affords us by
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57113:30"/>
His <hi>Cratch</hi> to day was a <hi>third</hi> place of his <hi>Rest,</hi> glorious it was, because
1. the <hi>God</hi> of Glory rested there: because 2. the glorious <hi>Angels</hi> displaid
their Wings, and gave forth their light, and sung about it, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii.
13, 14. because 3. Kings themselves came from far to visite it, and laid
all their glories down there at his feet. There his <hi>rest</hi> was <hi>glorious</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Nay 4. his <hi>Sepulchre</hi> the place of his <hi>rest</hi> in <hi>Death,</hi> was as <hi>glorious,</hi> is as
<hi>glorious</hi> still as any of the other: And I must tell you, the <hi>Latin</hi> reads it
<hi>Sepulchrum ejus Gloriosum;</hi> From thence it is he rose in glory: by that it
was he gain'd the glorious victory over <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> from thence he
came forth a glorious <hi>Conqueror. Thither</hi> have devout Christians flock'd
in incredible numbers. <hi>There</hi> have <hi>Miracles</hi> been often wrought, <hi>there</hi>
have <hi>Kings</hi> hung up their Crowns, <hi>there</hi> have millions paid their homage.
And thence have we all receiv'd both Grace and Glory; from his <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,</hi>
where he lay down in Death, and rose again to Life.</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>Rest</hi> still behind, and it is not only <hi>glorious,</hi> but <hi>it self</hi> is
<hi>glory: His rest,</hi> himself calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 11. yet a rest into which <hi>he would
have us enter too,</hi> Heb. iv. 9, 11. And in <hi>Heaven</hi> it is; no rest to <hi>this,</hi> no rest
indeed any where, but there, and perfect glory no where else.</p>
            <p>And now to wind up all together. This rest and glory, or glorious rest,
which ends the <hi>Text, (and 'tis the best end we can either make or wish</hi>) springs
from the root at the beginning. The <hi>Church</hi> it self, and all the rest and
glory the <hi>Churches</hi> ever had, or have, or shall enjoy, grows all from that.
Our Holy <hi>Temples,</hi> our Holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> our Holy <hi>Days, this</hi> day the <hi>first</hi>
of all the rest, all the benefits of his Death, Resurrection, and Ascension
into Glory; nay our greatest glory in <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, comes from this
<hi>little Branch of Iesse,</hi> this humble Root: and the way to all is by <hi>him</hi> and
his <hi>humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the time suits well, and the <hi>day</hi> hits fair for all. In <hi>that day</hi> says
the <hi>Text,</hi> all this you have heard shall be; and <hi>that</hi> day now is <hi>this.</hi> To
day the <hi>Root</hi> sprang forth, the <hi>Branch</hi> appeared. To day the <hi>Ensign</hi> was
displaid to all the people. From <hi>this</hi> day the <hi>Gentiles</hi> began their search.
<hi>This</hi> day he began to call in his <hi>Church,</hi> and the Shepherds were the first.
<hi>To day</hi> he first was laid to mortal rest. <hi>To day</hi> the glory of his Star appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to wait upon his Cradle. <hi>To day</hi> we also may enter into his rest, one or
other of them.</p>
            <p>One of his places of rest we told you was in the <hi>Church,</hi> or holy place:
let us seek him <hi>there.</hi> Another <hi>Rest</hi> of his we mentioned to be in the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Sacrament:</hi> let us seek him there. His <hi>Ensign</hi> is there set up; let us
go in to him, and offer our lives and fortunes at his feet, proffer to fight
his Battels and obey his Commands: <hi>strive we as the</hi> Apostle adviseth us,
<hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 11. <hi>to enter into his rest. Root</hi> we and <hi>build</hi> our selves upon him.
<hi>Root</hi> we our selves upon him by <hi>humility, build</hi> we upon him by <hi>faith:</hi> grow
we up with him <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> and sprouting out in all
good works: <hi>rest</hi> we our selves upon him, and make him our only stay
and glory. So when this <hi>Root</hi> shall appear the second time, and blow up
his <hi>Trumpet,</hi> as he here set up his <hi>Ensign,</hi> and our dead roots spring afresh
out of their dust, we also may appear with him, with Palms and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in our hands to celebrate the praises of this <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch</hi> of <hi>Iesse,</hi>
and enter joyfully into his rest, into the rest of everlasting glory.</p>

Great persons as ever met upon a day.</p>
            <p>Yet as great as the <hi>persons,</hi> and as great as the <hi>day,</hi> the great lesson of
them both is to be <hi>little,</hi> to think and make little of our selves, seeing
the infinite greatness is this <hi>day</hi> become so little, <hi>Eternity</hi> a Child, the Rays
of Glory wrapt in rags, Heaven crowded into the corner of a <hi>Stable,</hi> and
<hi>he</hi> that is every where want a room.</p>
            <p>I may at <hi>other</hi> times have spoke great and glorious things both of the
<hi>Persons</hi> and the <hi>Day;</hi> but I am determin'd to day to know nothing but
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in <hi>Rags,</hi> but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in a <hi>Manger.</hi> And I hope I shall have
your company along: your thoughts will be my thoughts, and my
thoughts yours, and both <hi>Christ's;</hi> all upon <hi>his</hi> humility and our <hi>own. This</hi>
is our first-born, which we are this day to bring forth (for it is a day of
bringing forth) <hi>this</hi> we are to wrap up in our memories, <hi>this</hi> to lay up in
our <hi>hearts; this</hi> the Blessed <hi>Mother,</hi> this the Blessed <hi>Babe,</hi> this the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and place, and time we find them in, the taxing time, the Beasts
Manger, the Swadling-<hi>clouts, all</hi> this day preach to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57113:31"/>
The day indeed is a <hi>high</hi> day, the Persons high <hi>Estates;</hi> but the case
we find them in, and the esteem too, the day is lately in, is low enough
to teach us humility, and lowliness at the lowest.</p>
            <p>With <hi>this</hi> the day is great, and the <hi>Persons</hi> great, and the <hi>Text</hi> great
too, and time (perhaps) you think it is that it bring forth. Come then
let's see what <hi>God</hi> hath sent us in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Mother <hi>and a</hi> Child, Swadling Clouts <hi>to</hi> wrap it, <hi>and</hi> a Manger for a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to lay it in, <hi>and</hi> all other room or place denied it quite. These <hi>are the</hi> plain <hi>and</hi>
evident parcels of the Text, in number five.</p>
            <p>But the whole business is between <hi>two</hi> persons, the <hi>Mother</hi> and the
<hi>Child;</hi> and it hath <hi>two</hi> consideratiens besides the <hi>letter,</hi> a <hi>moral</hi> lesson and
a <hi>Mystery:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> sufficiently brought forth, and laid before us; a <hi>plain</hi>
lesson of humility from all points and persons. The <hi>other</hi> wrapped up and
involv'd in the <hi>Swadling-clothes,</hi> and <hi>Manger,</hi> and want of <hi>Inn-room;</hi> nay
in the tender <hi>Mother,</hi> her care and travel. For each may have its <hi>mystery,</hi>
and the <hi>Text</hi> no injury, nay hath its <hi>mystery,</hi> and the <hi>Text</hi> injury if it be
not so considered. That's the way, that not one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one tittle of the
<hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> may fall to the ground, or scrap or fragment may be lost.</p>
            <p>We shall do so then. Read you first that great Lecture of Humility
which <hi>Christ</hi> this day taught us by his Birth, and all the circumstances of
it here so punctually exprest: and then shew you a <hi>mystery</hi> in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.
For so great a business as this fell not out by chance, nor the
circumstances at <hi>hap-hazard;</hi> but a reason of all there is to be given: why
<hi>Christ</hi> was born, why of <hi>such</hi> a Mother, at <hi>such</hi> a time, under <hi>such</hi> a name,
in <hi>such</hi> a place, why <hi>so</hi> wrapt and laid, and no fit room allow'd him. And
when we have done so, we will see whether he shall now meet better
usage with <hi>us,</hi> than in the <hi>Inn</hi> he did to day, and learn you by his happy
Mother, <hi>how</hi> to wrap, and <hi>where</hi> to lay him.</p>
            <p>I begin to run over the words <hi>first</hi> as so many points of his humility.
And <hi>seven</hi> degrees it rises by, <hi>seven</hi> particulars in them, we take it from.
1. His being <hi>brought forth</hi> or born. 2. His Mother, <hi>She.</hi> 3. His <hi>wrapping
up.</hi> 4. His <hi>clothes he was wrapt in.</hi> 5. His <hi>laying in the Manger. 6. The no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
he meets with in the Inn,</hi> no room there for him. And <hi>lastly, the time
when this was done.</hi> In <hi>the days of the taxing, then</hi> was this <hi>blessed</hi> Mothers
time accomplished, in the words just before: and then she brought forth
her First-born <hi>Son.</hi> Thus the <hi>Et,</hi> the <hi>And,</hi> couples all, and gives us the
time of the Story, that we may know <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to find it, in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Records by the year of the Taxes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> step of his Humiliation was to be <hi>born,</hi> and brought forth by a
Woman, the only begotten <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Immortal God,</hi> to become the First-born
of a <hi>mortal Woman.</hi> The First-born of every Creature to become the
First-born of so silly a Creature. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou shouldst become
the Son of a woman?</hi> But if thou wouldst needs become a Man, why by the
way of a Woman? why didst thou not <hi>fit</hi> thy self of a Body some <hi>other</hi>
way? Thou couldst have framed thy self a humane Body, of some pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
matter, than the purest of corrupted natures: but such is <hi>thy</hi> humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that thou didst not <hi>abhor the Virgins Womb,</hi> wouldst be brought forth as
other men, that we might not think of our selves <hi>above</hi> other men, how
great or good soever thou makest us.</p>
            <p>But 2. if he would be born of a Woman, could he not have chosen
an othergates than <hi>she,</hi> than a poor <hi>Carpenters</hi> Wife? some great <hi>Queen</hi> or
<hi>Lady</hi> had been fitter far to have made as it were the <hi>Queen</hi> of Heaven, and
<hi>Mother</hi> to the <hi>Heir</hi> of all the World. But <hi>Respexit humilitatem ancillae,</hi> it was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57113:31"/>
the <hi>lowliness</hi> of this his holy Hand-maid, that he lookt to, it was for
her <hi>humility</hi> he chose to be born of <hi>her</hi> before any other. That <hi>we</hi> may
know 1. whom it is that the eternal Wisdom will vouchsafe to dwell
with, even the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>lowly.</hi> That 2. we may see, he even <hi>studies</hi> to
descend as low as possible, that so even the meanest might come to him
without fear. That 3. we should henceforth despise no man for his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
nor bear our selves high upon our birth and stock.</p>
            <p>Our descent and Kindred are no such business to make us proud; <hi>Christ</hi>
comes as soon to the low <hi>Cottage,</hi> as to the loftiest <hi>Palace,</hi> to the <hi>Handmaid</hi>
as to the <hi>Mistriss,</hi> to the Poor as to the Rich, nay prefers them here, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
a poor <hi>humble</hi> Maid above all the gallant <hi>Ladies</hi> of the world. For <hi>God</hi>
thus to be made <hi>Man,</hi> man of a Woman, the eternal <hi>Being</hi> begin to <hi>be,</hi>
Infinity to be encompass'd in a <hi>Virgins</hi> Womb; <hi>he</hi> whose goings out are
from everlasting, now to seem <hi>first</hi> to be brought forth, but now lately
born; <hi>Riches</hi> it self, the Son of <hi>Poverty;</hi> so far to debase himself! who
indeed can sufficiently express <hi>this his generation;</hi> also the poorness, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
contemptibleness, humbleness of it? His delight surely is to be
with the <hi>lowly,</hi> that thus picks and culls out <hi>low</hi> things.</p>
            <p>You will say so 3. most, if you consider his <hi>wrapping</hi> up, as well as
his coming forth: He that measures the Heavens with his <hi>Span,</hi> the waters
in the <hi>hollow</hi> of his hand, <hi>who</hi> involves all things, all the <hi>treasures</hi> of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Knowledge, in whom <hi>all</hi> our beings and well-beings, the decrees
and fates of the world are <hi>wrapt</hi> from all eternity; <hi>he</hi> now come to be
wrapt and made up like a <hi>new-born</hi> child; who can unwind, or unfold his
humility? will our <hi>Master</hi> be thus dealt with as a <hi>Child?</hi> thus handled
like the <hi>common</hi> infant? and shall <hi>we</hi> hereafter think much the <hi>best</hi> of us to
be used like other men? away with all our nicenesses henceforward, and
be content that our <hi>selves</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> should be in all things subject to the
common fate of the sons of men.</p>
            <p>Nor think we much 2. to be wrapt up, and bound sometimes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the liberty of a <hi>stragling</hi> power to hurt our selves, but ever thank
the <hi>hand</hi> that binds us up, and takes care of us when we either cannot
or know not how to help our selves, would undo our selves, if we were
left loose, which in another <hi>English</hi> is too true, too often left undone. <hi>He</hi>
that binds all things with his <hi>Word,</hi> makes them up in his Wisdom, and
wraps them in the <hi>Mantle</hi> of his protection, was content to be bound up
<hi>as</hi> a Child, when he <hi>was</hi> a Child; as if he had wholly laid <hi>aside</hi> his power,
humbled himself to be under the power and discretion of a simple Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Nurse</hi> and <hi>Mother.</hi> To teach us again the humility of a Child, to
behave our selves in every condition, and submit in it as it requires; if
Children, to be content with the usage of children; if <hi>Subjects,</hi> with the
<hi>condition</hi> of subjects; if Servants, of servants, and the like.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clothes</hi> his dear Mother wrapt him in are 4. the very <hi>badges</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;

clothes she wrapt him in, such he is so humble, he will be content with,
even with <hi>rags.</hi> What make we then such ado for <hi>clothes? Iacob</hi> would
bargain with <hi>God</hi> no further then for rayment to put on: he covenanted
with him not for <hi>fashion,</hi> nor <hi>colour,</hi> nor <hi>stuff,</hi> nor <hi>trimming:</hi> and our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Lord here is content with what comes next. But, <hi>Lord!</hi> to see what
ado have <hi>we</hi> about our Apparel! this <hi>Lace,</hi> and that <hi>Trimming;</hi> this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,</hi>

to be clothed as he does the Grass, <hi>when</hi> and <hi>how</hi> he pleases. 'Tis no
shame to be in rags and tatters, if they be but <hi>Christs,</hi> if they come by
<hi>him,</hi> not by our <hi>own</hi> ill husbandries, and intemperances; if for <hi>his</hi> sake
or cause we are brought to them. Clothes are but to cover shame, and
defend us from the cold; they make not a man, nor commend any to
<hi>God. Lazarus's</hi> rags are better wearing than <hi>Dives</hi> his Purple and fine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.
There is a part of <hi>humility</hi> as well as <hi>modesty,</hi> that consists in Apparel;
and this part is here commended to us by our <hi>Saviours</hi> condition, that
howsoever the giddy <hi>Gallants</hi> of the world think of it, the sober <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
of the Church should not think strange to see themselves in rags,
which our <hi>Lord</hi> hath thus rent and torn out to us.</p>
            <p>5. Well, but though he was content to be wrapt in <hi>Swadling-clothes,</hi>
and those none of the handsomest neither, may we not look for a <hi>Cradle</hi>
at least to lay him in? No matter what we may look for, we are like to
find no better than a <hi>Manger</hi> for that purpose, and a lock of <hi>Hay</hi> for his
<hi>Bed,</hi> and for his <hi>Pillow,</hi> and for his <hi>Mantle</hi> too. A poor condition, and
an humble one indeed, for <hi>him</hi> whose <hi>Chariot</hi> is the Clouds, whose <hi>Palace</hi>
is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> whose <hi>Throne</hi> is with the most High. What place can we
hereafter think too <hi>mean</hi> for any of <hi>us?</hi> Stand thou here, sit thou there,
under my Foot-stool, places of exceeding honour compared to <hi>this.</hi> What,
not a room among men, not among the meanest, in some smoky <hi>Cottage,</hi>
or ragged <hi>Cell;</hi> but among <hi>Beasts?</hi> whither hath thy humility driven
thee, O <hi>Saviour</hi> of mankind? Why, meer <hi>pity</hi> of a Woman in thy <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
case, O <hi>Lord,</hi> would have made the most obdurate have removed
her from the <hi>Horses</hi> feet, the <hi>Asses</hi> heels, the company of unruly Beasts,
from the <hi>ordure</hi> and nastiness of a <hi>Stable:</hi> But that we, O <hi>Lord,</hi> might see
what we had made our selves, meer Beasts, as lustful as the <hi>Horse,</hi> as sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
as the <hi>Ass,</hi> as proud, and untam'd as the <hi>Bulls,</hi> as bent to earthly
drudgeries and yokes as the <hi>Oxe</hi> and <hi>Heifer,</hi> that thou wert fain even to
come thither to find us out and redeem us. <hi>This</hi> note will humble us if
any can, and make us not think much if <hi>God</hi> at any time deal with us as
<hi>Beasts, whip</hi> us, and <hi>spur</hi> us, <hi>beat</hi> us with the staff, prick us with the <hi>goad,</hi>
feed us with <hi>hard</hi> meat, like such things as they, seeing we are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like them, as says the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> xlix. 12. 20. To descend from
the Society of <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and all the Host of Heaven, to be
the companion of <hi>Beasts;</hi> from the bosom of his <hi>Father,</hi> to the concave of a
<hi>Manger,</hi> is such a descent of humility, that we have no more understanding
than the very beasts to express it. Go <hi>man,</hi> and sit down now in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
room thou canst, thou canst not sit so low as lay thy <hi>Saviour.</hi> S. <hi>Ierome</hi>
was so much devoted to the contemplation of this strange humility of his
<hi>Master</hi> in this particular, that he spent many of his years near the place
of this hallowed <hi>Manger.</hi> And S. <hi>Luke</hi> in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s interpretation plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
himself much in the recounting of this circumstance of his <hi>Saviour</hi>'s
Birth; and indeed any may so conjecture it, that considers how often he
repeats it in so little compass, <hi>thrice</hi> within <hi>ten</hi> verses, the 7. 12. and 16.

And say I, let others seek him in the Courts of <hi>Princes,</hi> in the head of an
<hi>Army,</hi> under a Canopy of <hi>State,</hi> in a <hi>Cradle</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Ivory;</hi> I will seek
him to day <hi>where</hi> he was laid, whither the <hi>Angel</hi> sent the <hi>Shepherds</hi> to seek
him, where the <hi>Shepherds</hi> found him in a <hi>Manger,</hi> in a <hi>Stable,</hi> in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and <hi>lowly heart;</hi> that in an humble sense of his own unworthiness cries
out with <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> xxx. 2. Surely <hi>I am more brutish than man, and have
not the understanding of a man,</hi> even thinks himself fit for a <hi>Manger,</hi> nay,
not worthy of it, since his <hi>Lord</hi> lay in it.</p>
            <p>6. But the <hi>Manger</hi> is not the <hi>worst,</hi> the dis-respect that <hi>forc'd</hi> him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>that's</hi> the hardest, <hi>that there was no room for them in the Inn, <gap reason="foreign">

no room for <hi>them,</hi> mark that; 'tis not said there was <hi>no room,</hi> no room <hi>at
all</hi> in the <hi>Inn,</hi> but <hi>none</hi> for <hi>them;</hi> they were so poor it seems, and their
outward appearance so contemptible, that notwithstanding the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a <hi>Woman</hi> great with Child, and so <hi>near</hi> her time, they were put
away without respect or regard. To have fall'n by <hi>chance</hi> or some accident
into so <hi>mean</hi> a place, or have been <hi>driven</hi> thither by some sudden storm,
or tempest, and so frighted into travel, had been no such wonder <hi>perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;</hi>
but to be driven thither by the unkindness and inhumanity of
ones <hi>own Countrymen,</hi> and <hi>Tribe</hi> too, is a trial of <hi>humility</hi> indeed; but to
<hi>choose</hi> to be so (for <hi>he</hi> knew all from the beginning before it came to pass)
so to contrive all things for it, and suffer the uncivil <hi>ruggedness</hi> of men to
drive him out to dwell and lodge among <hi>Beasts;</hi> to have <hi>contempt</hi> thrown
upon his <hi>poverty,</hi> and neglect added to all inconveniences, <hi>is</hi> sure to teach
us humility in the harshest usages we meet with. <hi>He</hi> that made all places,
finds none himself, and is <hi>content. He</hi> that hath many Mansions for others
in his <hi>Fathers</hi> house, hath not the least lobby in an <hi>Inn,</hi> and <hi>repines</hi> not at
it. <hi>He</hi> that would have given this churlish <hi>Host</hi> an <hi>eternal</hi> house in Heaven
for asking for, cannot have a <hi>Cabin</hi> for any hire, because his <hi>parents</hi> seem
so poor; and yet he fetches not fire from Heaven to consume him for
his inhumanity.</p>
            <p>How <hi>unlike</hi> us, I pray, for whom no downy <hi>pallets</hi> are soft enough,
no room sufficiently spacious and <hi>Majestick,</hi> no furniture enough costly, no
attendance sufficient, all respect <hi>too</hi> little. Do we ever call to mind this
our <hi>Saviours</hi> first entertainment in the world, or think we are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then our <hi>Master?</hi> He could have come in state, in glory, in all magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
and pomp, attended with all respect and honour, but would not for
our sakes <hi>most,</hi> that we might see what he most delights in, and learn it
as much by his <hi>example</hi> as his <hi>precept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. And yet there is a <hi>seventh degree</hi> of his humility, to let all this be
done to him in such a <hi>publick time and place,</hi> when the whole world was met
together to be taxed, where so many were gathered in such a place of
meeting as an <hi>Inn,</hi> when the whole City is filled from one corner to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<hi>there</hi> and <hi>then</hi> to be so used, so despised, so scorned, as a sign of
men, and the <hi>out-cast</hi> of the people, ranked with the <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Ass,</hi> to
have so many witnesses of affro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts, and contempts put upon him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
and order so to have it done, is the <hi>highest</hi> of humility: for not
only to think meanly of <hi>our selves,</hi> but to desire to have all <hi>others</hi> think
meanly of us, is so hard a <hi>Text</hi> that I fear me few can bear it. Whatever
we suffer, or to whatsoever meannesses and under offices we condescend,
we would not willingly have others think the worse of us for it: there is
too oft a pride in our good works, that lies lurking under them, we
scarce can throw it off; but 'tis <hi>that,</hi> 'tis <hi>that</hi> above the rest that we
should endeavour, to be content to be trampled on, and despised for him
who was so for us.</p>

               <hi>Sum</hi> we up now the points of <hi>Christs</hi> humility, to leave his <hi>Fathers</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for the <hi>Virgins</hi> Womb, the great riches in <hi>Heaven</hi> for great poverty
upon <hi>earth,</hi> to wrap up his <hi>immensity</hi> in <hi>Swadling-clothes,</hi> his <hi>Robes</hi> of glory
in <hi>Clouts</hi> and <hi>Rags,</hi> forsake his <hi>Throne</hi> for a <hi>Manger,</hi> the <hi>adoration</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi>
and <hi>Angels</hi> for the dis-respects of a <hi>surly Host,</hi> to be seen in this mean pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
to all the <hi>world. Domine in quis similis tui?</hi> O <hi>Lord</hi> who is like to thee,
who is like to thee may we say <hi>this way</hi> also in thy <hi>humility</hi> as well as in
thy <hi>glory.</hi> And sure <hi>we</hi> cannot hereafter any of us grudge to be in <hi>rags,</hi> in
<hi>Sheep-skins,</hi> and <hi>Goat-skins,</hi> in Dens and Caves of the earth, destitute,
neglected, forsaken, repuls'd, contemned, but humble our selves to the
meanest condition without any great reflection upon our Birth or former
estates and conditions, if <hi>Christ</hi> shall at any time require it of us; seeing
the <hi>Servant</hi> is not better than his <hi>Master,</hi> nor the dry tree than the green:
and if to <hi>him</hi> all this was done, we should frame our minds at least to a
humility ready to undergo it.</p>
            <p>I have run over the <hi>plain song</hi> of the words, the plain lesson of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that is in them without straining. I must back over again to descant
out the <hi>mysteries</hi> that lie under them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>she brought forth.</hi> Before she travell'd she brought forth, <hi>before her
pain came she was delivered of a man-child;</hi> so prophesied <hi>Isaiah, Isa.</hi> lxvi. 7.
and so the <hi>Fathers</hi> do apply it: She <hi>conceived</hi> without <hi>corruption,</hi> and brought
forth without <hi>sorrow;</hi> the very <hi>Text</hi> may bear witness to it: for she wrapt
it in the Swadling-clothes, and she laid it in the Manger, says St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
No women it seems near to help her: for <hi>she</hi> who needed not the help of
<hi>man</hi> to conceive, needed no help of <hi>woman</hi> sure to bring forth: no corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
no sorrow. A great <hi>mystery,</hi> none ever like it, to begin with.</p>
            <p>But <hi>she</hi> a <hi>Virgin,</hi> thus bringing forth, affords us a <hi>second</hi> too, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us, <hi>what</hi> souls they are of whom <hi>Christ</hi> is born; <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Virgin,</hi>
Chaste and Holy only that bring forth <hi>him.</hi> And the <hi>First-born</hi> he will
be, ever should be of all our thoughts, will be acknowledged so when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
born, <hi>primogenitus,</hi> one <hi>before</hi> whom none; for <hi>that</hi> only is the
sense of First-born here, not referring to any <hi>after,</hi> but to none <hi>before,</hi>
Col. i. 14. <hi>begotten before any creature,</hi> in honour above all creatures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with all the <hi>rights</hi> of primogeniture, even as <hi>man</hi> also. Now <hi>three</hi>
things belonged to the First-born Son, the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the <hi>preheminence,</hi> or
<hi>regal Dignity,</hi> and a <hi>double or larger portion. He</hi> is the <hi>High-Priest of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
Heb. iii. 1. The great <hi>High-Priest</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Profession and
Religion. <hi>He</hi> 2. the <hi>Head of his Church,</hi> Col. i. 18. <hi>To whom all power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in heaven and earth,</hi> S. Mat. xxviii. 18. <hi>He 3. also anointed with the oyl
of gladness above his fellows,</hi> Psal. xlv. 8. <hi>A portion of grace</hi> far above others,
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 16. <hi>That in all things he might have the preheminence, being the First-born,
as well of the dead as of the living,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> i. 18. All these
<hi>mysteries</hi> we have wrapt up in the title of the <hi>First-born,</hi> that by <hi>it</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
to be our <hi>Prince,</hi> our <hi>Priest,</hi> our <hi>elder Brother,</hi> one in whom all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who should be therefore so acknowledg'd and us'd, be <hi>first</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in our affections, be the <hi>first</hi> birth our souls should travel with,
and our affections and actions bring forth.</p>
            <p>But there are more wrapt up in his being wrapt in <hi>Swadling-clothes,</hi> then
can readily be exprest. All the benefits that came by him were <hi>wrapt</hi> up
and not understood, till the Clothes both of the <hi>Manger</hi> and the <hi>Grave</hi>
were unwrapt by his Resurrection. He seem'd not what he was, shewed
not what he came for until <hi>then.</hi> All the while before nothing but <hi>folds,</hi>
and things folded up, the <hi>Cross</hi> made up or involved in his <hi>Cratch</hi> (for of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57113:33"/>
the form of a Cross the Cratch some say was made) mans salvation in

brethren in the First-born among them.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Glory</hi> 2. that was wrapt up in those Clothes, his <hi>God-head</hi> in the
Man-hood, the <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>Flesh, Eternity</hi> in days, <hi>Righteousness</hi> in a body like
to a body of Sin, <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the infancy of a Child, <hi>Abundance</hi> in Poverty,
<hi>Glory</hi> in disrespect, the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Grace in a dry barren dusty Land, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>light</hi> in <hi>Clouds,</hi> and <hi>everlasting life</hi> in the very image of death; will you
see the Clothes that hid this treasure, not from <hi>men</hi> only, but from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils?</hi>
The espousals of just <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and holy <hi>Mary</hi> hid <hi>Christs</hi> Conception
of a <hi>Virgin.</hi> The crying of an Infant in a <hi>Cradle,</hi> the bringing forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sorrow. The Purification her entire <hi>Virginity.</hi> The Circumcision his
extraordinary Generation, without any sin. His flight <hi>conceal'd</hi> his Power,
his <hi>Baptism</hi> his unspotted <hi>Innocence.</hi> His <hi>open</hi> Prayers to his <hi>Father</hi> his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> with him. His sad sufferings obscur'd his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness. The poverty and meanness of his life the height and
greatness of his Birth: and the ignominy of his Death the immensity of
his Glory.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Gospel</hi> 3. that was <hi>wrapt</hi> up in Clothes, that seeing we might see
and not presently understand, a <hi>mystery</hi> kept secret since the world began;
his Doctrine wrapt in <hi>parables,</hi> his Grace covered in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the
inward Grace in the outward <hi>Elements,</hi> his great <hi>Apostolick</hi> Function in
poor simple <hi>Fishermen,</hi> his <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> in a <hi>few</hi> obscur'd Disciples of
<hi>Iudea,</hi> the <hi>height</hi> of his knowledge in the simplicity of <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
of his Precepts in the <hi>plainness</hi> of his Speech, and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the
<hi>end</hi> they drive to in the <hi>humility</hi> of the <hi>way</hi> they lead: well may the
<hi>Prophet</hi> exclaim, <hi>Vere tu es Deus absconditus,</hi> Psal. lv. 15. <hi>Verily thou art a
God that hidest thy self, O God of Israel, the Saviour.</hi> Well may we admire
thy folds and wrappings up, <hi>O God,</hi> and not strive to pry into thy secrets,
thy goings out, and thy comings in; and all thy counsels are past finding
out: to thee only it belongs to know them, to us to obey and submit to
them, and adore them.</p>
            <p>Yet 4. he was thus <hi>wrapt</hi> up to shew us our <hi>condition,</hi> that the beauty
and sweetness of <hi>Christianity</hi> as well as <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> as well as <hi>Christ,</hi>
appears not <hi>outwardly,</hi> or but in <hi>rags.</hi> We cannot see the <hi>Christians</hi> strength
for the <hi>weaknesses</hi> that surround him, nor his joy for the <hi>afflictions</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
him, nor his happiness for the worldly <hi>calamities</hi> that oppress
him, nor his wisdom for the <hi>foolishness</hi> of Preaching, that so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
him, nor his riches for the <hi>poor condition</hi> he is sometimes brought to,
nor his honour for the <hi>scoffs</hi> and <hi>reproaches</hi> of the world he often labours
under. He seems <hi>unknown,</hi> when he is <hi>well known; dying</hi> when he only
<hi>lives, kill'd</hi> when he is but <hi>chastned, sorrowful</hi> though always <hi>rejoycing, poor</hi>
yet <hi>making rich, as having nothing, and possessing all things,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 9, 10.
Thus the <hi>Christian</hi> you see is <hi>wrapt</hi> up, as soon as he is born; nay, and his
very life also is <hi>wrapt up with Christ in God,</hi> Col. iii. 3.</p>
            <p>Nay <hi>lastly,</hi> our <hi>practice</hi> and duty is <hi>wrapt</hi> up with him. <hi>He</hi> is wrapt up
in poor Clothes, that <hi>we</hi> might be wrapt up in <hi>stolâ primâ,</hi> the best Robe,
his Robe of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> that we might put on the white Linen of the
<hi>Saints. Wrapt</hi> up again. 2. he was, his hands and feet bound up like a
Childs, that by the vertue of it <hi>our hands and feet</hi> might be loosed to do
the works of <hi>Christ,</hi> and run the way of peace: he is made a Child that
we might be perfect men in <hi>him;</hi> he brought forth, that we might bring
forth the fruits of good works, and godly living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57113:34"/>
The next <hi>mysteries</hi> lie coucht with him in the <hi>Manger;</hi> where in a strait
and narrow compass he lies, that he may open Heaven <hi>wide</hi> to all believers,
all that keep a strait and strict watch over their ways and actions.</p>
            <p>Where 2. uses to lie the Beasts provender; <hi>there</hi> lies he also who is
the bread that came down from Heaven to feed us, who are often more
unreasonable than the <hi>Beasts; they</hi> know their owner: the <hi>Oxe</hi> and <hi>Ass</hi>

<hi>we</hi> burthen it; <hi>they</hi> will but eat and drink to satisfie, <hi>men</hi> are
grown so sensual they cannot be satisfied. We have made our selves fit
for the <hi>Manger,</hi> which made <hi>Christ</hi> lie there, to see if <hi>he</hi> could fill us, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing can.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>Manger</hi> among the Beasts, that we might sadly consider <hi>what</hi>
we have made our selves, and change our sensual lives, now <hi>he</hi> is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Stable</hi> to call us out.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>There</hi> he lies in a place without any furniture or trimming up, that
we might by the place be instructed that the beauty of <hi>Christ</hi> wants no
<hi>external</hi> setting out: that 2. his beauty is <hi>omnis ab intus,</hi> all within, and
his Spouse is <hi>all glorious</hi> within, <hi>Psal.</hi> xlv. That 3. our eyes might not be
diverted from him by any outward splendours, but wholly fixt upon <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
That 4. by his very first appearance we might know <hi>his</hi> Kingdom
was not of this <hi>world;</hi> he was no temporal <hi>King,</hi> we might see by his
Furniture and Palace: that <hi>lastly</hi> we might know he came to teach us
<hi>new</hi> ways of life, and sanctifie to us the way of poverty and humility.</p>
            <p>5. In the <hi>Stable.</hi> For so <gap reason="foreign">

by the way; that we might understand our <hi>life</hi> here is but a <hi>journey,</hi> and
our longest stay but that of Travellers by the way; and therefore
there he places himself for all comers, by his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and Birth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them home into their Country, our Country which is above.</p>
            <p>Nor is it 6. without a <hi>mystery</hi> that there was no room for him in the <hi>Inn.</hi>
Inns are places of much resort and company, and no wonder if <hi>Christ</hi> be
too commonly thrust out <hi>thence.</hi> They are made houses of licentiousness
and revelling; no wonder if <hi>Christ</hi> be not suffered to be <hi>there.</hi> They are
places of more worldly business; and no wonder neither that there is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>there</hi> no room for <hi>him,</hi> when the <hi>business</hi> is so different from <hi>his,</hi> and

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57113:34"/>
the mystery of every circumstance in it of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Birth; I hope we
have shewed you mysteries enow, and you have seen humility enough.
But it is not enough to see the one or the other, unless now we take up
the <hi>Virgin Maries</hi> part, which is behind, <hi>bring forth</hi> this <hi>First-born</hi> to
<hi>our</hi> selves; suffer him to be born <hi>in</hi> us, who was born for <hi>us,</hi> and bring
forth <hi>Christ</hi> in our lives, wrap him and lay him up with all the tenderness
of a <hi>Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pure Virgin pious soul is this <hi>She</hi> that brings forth <hi>Christ;</hi> the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
and cherishing of him and all his gifts and graces is <hi>this</hi> wrapping
him in <hi>Swadling-clothes;</hi> the laying up his Word, his Promises, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in our hearts, is the laying him in the <hi>Manger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What though there be no room for him in the <hi>Inn,</hi> though the world
will not entertain him? the devout soul will find a place to lay him in,
though it have nothing of its own but rags, a poor <hi>ragged</hi> righteousness:
for our righteousness, says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> is but <hi>menstruous rags;</hi> yet the best it
hath it will lay him in: and though it have nothing but a <hi>Manger,</hi> a poor
strait narrow soul, none of the cleanliest neither to lodge him in; yet
such as it is, he shall command it, his lying there will cleanse it, and <hi>his</hi>
righteousness piece up our rags.</p>
            <p>What though there be no room for him in the <hi>Inn?</hi> I hope there is in
our houses for him: 'Tis <hi>Christmas</hi> time, and let's keep open house for
<hi>him;</hi> let <hi>his</hi> Rags be our <hi>Christmas</hi> Rayment, his <hi>Manger</hi> our Christmas
<hi>cheer,</hi> his <hi>Stable</hi> our Christmas <hi>great Chamber, Hall, Dining-room.</hi> We must
clothe with him, and feed with him, and lodge with him at <hi>this</hi> Feast. He
is now ready by and by to give <hi>himself</hi> to eat; you may see him wrapt
ready in the <hi>Swadling-clothes</hi> of his blessed <hi>Sacrament:</hi> you may behold
him laid upon the <hi>Altar</hi> as in his <hi>Manger,</hi> do but make room for him, and
we will bring him forth and you shall look upon him, and handle him, and
feed upon him: bring we only the rags of a rent, and torn, and broken,
and contrite <hi>heart;</hi> the white linen cloths of <hi>pure</hi> intentions and <hi>honest</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to <hi>swathe</hi> him in: <hi>wrap</hi> him up fast, and lay him close to our souls
and bosoms: 'tis a <hi>day of mysteries,</hi> 'tis a mysterious business we are about;
<hi>Christ wrapt up, Christ in the Sacrament, Christ</hi> in a mystery; let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to let it go so, believe, admire, and adore it. 'Tis sufficient that we
know <hi>Christs</hi> swadling-clothes, <hi>his</hi> Righteousness will keep us warmer
than all our Winter Garments: <hi>his</hi> rags hold out more storms than our
thickest clothes, let's put them on. His <hi>Manger</hi> feeds us better than all
the <hi>Asian</hi> delicates, all the dainties of the world; let's feed our souls
upon him. His <hi>Stable</hi> is not hang'd here with <hi>Arras,</hi> or deck'd with gilded
furniture: but 'tis hang'd infinitely with <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces:</hi> the Stable is
dark, but there is the <hi>Light</hi> of the world to enlighten it. The smell of
the <hi>Beasts</hi> our <hi>sins,</hi> are <hi>perfumed</hi> and taken away with the sweet odours of
holy pardon and forgiveness: the incondite noise of the <hi>Oxe,</hi> and <hi>Ass,</hi> and
<hi>Horse</hi> are still'd with the musick of the heavenly <hi>Host;</hi> the noise of our
sins, with the promises of the <hi>Gospel</hi> this day brought to us. Let us not
then think much to take him wrapt up, that is in a <hi>Mystery,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
how and which way we receive him; 'tis in the condition he
comes to us. Let us be content with him in his <hi>rags,</hi> in his humblest and
lowest condition; 'tis the way he comes to <hi>day:</hi> let us our selves wrap
and lay him up in the best place we can find for him, though the best we
have will be little better then a Manger.</p>
            <p>What though there be no room for him in the <hi>Inn,</hi> in worldly souls, I
hope yet <hi>ours</hi> will entertain him, invite him too, and say as <hi>Laban</hi> said to

14. for thither this <hi>Ejus</hi> points us, this day leads us.
To the <hi>Word</hi> made <hi>Flesh,</hi> to <hi>Christ's,</hi> to <hi>His.</hi> Yet of his
fulness when so made? Of his <hi>emptiness</hi> it would be
rather. Of his emptiness to <hi>day</hi> it is, that we have all
received, that we still receive all: There is nothing we
receive, but 'tis from this days emptiness; and there
is nothing that we receive not from it, from <hi>his</hi> this days emptying
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the form of a servant, from this days <hi>exinanition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is it a day of <hi>fulness</hi> too. His thus very emptying himself for us,
his thus very emptying himself upon us, is the very fulness of his grace,
and favour to us: the day then, wherein it was, a day of fulness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>he</hi> was <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> were <hi>fill'd;</hi> he full of grace, and we fill'd from it.
The fulness of <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it upon this accompt, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 4. A
day wherein <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Types</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> came all to their full,
were fulfilled: we received them all fulfilled to us. A day wherein <hi>he</hi> gave,
and <hi>we</hi> received, gave himself with all his fulness, and we received him.
So then we here did, and I hope we here will do so too.</p>
            <p>A day then <hi>this</hi> worthy to be observed in our generation, wherein to
fill our <hi>hearts</hi> with gladness, and our <hi>tongues</hi> with joy, to return back
somewhat for our great receipts, to confess we received a great grace to
<hi>day</hi> by <hi>his</hi> coming to us, <hi>grace</hi> upon <hi>grace,</hi> favour upon favour by it. To
return therefore 2. <hi>Gratiam pro gratiâ,</hi> thanks to him for his grace, and
do it 3. to the <hi>full</hi> too, with <hi>full</hi> mouths, in <hi>full</hi> Congregations, so to
answer to his fulness somewhat like.</p>
            <p>For to <hi>Vs,</hi> this, <hi>We,</hi> reacheth too, <hi>this fulness</hi> pours out still. <hi>We</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all reason to acknowledge it, as well as any <hi>we</hi> whosoever, at
any time whensoever, at all times whatsoever; but at the <hi>full time, this</hi>
time howsoever. No time comes amiss to do it in, but this time it comes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57113:36"/>
best, a word in season always best. Now here's a <hi>day</hi> of fulness, and a
<hi>Text</hi> of fulness. There wants nothing but our fulness of praise and duty
for it; fulness of humility and thankfulness to receive it. All the <hi>We</hi> in
the <hi>Text</hi> received it so no doubt, all that will be of the <hi>We,</hi> of St. <hi>Iohns</hi>
Congregation, will receive it in the day, will be glad <hi>this</hi> day to receive
it, and thank <hi>God</hi> for it. <hi>God</hi> for sending, <hi>Christ</hi> for coming with this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to us: be glad with <hi>Abraham</hi> to see a day, with the <hi>Shepherds</hi> to hear
a Text, that brings news and tidings of it, be full glad at it.</p>
            <p>And it will become us well to do so, we have good reason, for all <hi>this
fulness</hi> is for <hi>us. His</hi> fulness for <hi>our</hi> filling: <hi>He</hi> full that <hi>we</hi> might be filled.
The fulness <hi>his,</hi> the redundance <hi>ours,</hi> ours the benefit, we receive the
grace, grace for grace, one grace after another, till we also come to a
kind of fulness too, <hi>the fulness of the stature of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may then receive it as we ought, know we that in the <hi>Text</hi>
there is a <hi>fulness</hi> and a <hi>filling</hi> to be considered: the <hi>fulness</hi> his, the <hi>filling</hi>
ours. Of <hi>his</hi> fulness <hi>we</hi> all, there's <hi>his</hi> fulness, a complete, gracious, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
communicative, universal fulness. Of <hi>his</hi> we have all received, and
grace for grace; <hi>there's our filling,</hi> a good, plentiful, gracious, universal
filling too.</p>
            <p>Yet to understand them fully <hi>both,</hi> both the <hi>fulness</hi> and the <hi>filling,</hi> we
must consider this <hi>fulness. First, whose</hi> it is. 2. <hi>What</hi> it is. 3. In what <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
it is. 4. How <hi>great</hi> it is. 5. How <hi>large</hi> it is, five particulars. First,
<hi>His</hi> it is whom we read of a <hi>verse</hi> or two before; for <hi>ejus</hi> is a <hi>Relative,</hi> and
refers to the <hi>Antecedent.</hi> Secondly, A <hi>fulness</hi> it is that is answerable to
his <hi>greatness,</hi> fulness with a double <hi>Article</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>emphatick</hi> fulness, a
perfect fulness. Thirdly, To him it is, or his it is, as he is <hi>Verbum Caro,</hi>
ver. 14. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> both, <hi>both</hi> natures fulness, according to them <hi>both:</hi>
for this <hi>ejus</hi> has not more syllables than natures, and relates as well to the
<hi>one</hi> as to the <hi>other.</hi> Fourthly, So <hi>great</hi> it is, that it may, nay, that it does
<hi>communicate</hi> it self, and yet is <hi>fulness</hi> still. <hi>De plenitudine,</hi> nor <hi>case,</hi> nor
<hi>preposition</hi> can take any thing from it, to diminish it. Fifthly, So <hi>large</hi>
that it extends as far as <hi>all:</hi> all some way or other partake of it, more or
less, according to their capacity and receipt.</p>
            <p>Consider we must again 2. in the <hi>filling.</hi> That 1. 'tis not an <hi>Active,</hi>
but a <hi>Passive</hi> filling, as it were, a <hi>being</hi> filled, a receiving: that 2. 'tis a
receiving <hi>of,</hi> not a receiving <hi>all,</hi> not a <hi>perfect</hi> fulness, but a <hi>proportional.</hi>
That 'tis 3. a receiving <hi>gratis,</hi> nothing but meer <hi>gratia</hi> in it, of grace,
not of desert. That 'tis 4. yet a receiving <hi>sufficient, full,</hi> every one
enough; and that not single grace neither, but one <hi>for</hi> another, one <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
another, one <hi>upon</hi> another. That 'tis 5. a general business, <hi>all</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
somewhat, some grace or other, and that seldom or never by it self:
none without receiving. That 6. it is from <hi>Christ,</hi> from him it is, from
<hi>his</hi> grace, and from <hi>his</hi> fulness, that we receive whatever we receive.
That <hi>lastly,</hi> grace for grace it is, for some end and purpose it is, that we
receive it, <hi>receive</hi> grace, that we may <hi>say</hi> grace, give thanks, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it. 2. <hi>Receive</hi> grace, that we may <hi>shew</hi> grace; receive grace from
<hi>God,</hi> that we may shew it unto <hi>men.</hi> 3. Receive <hi>grace</hi> even <hi>for</hi> grace it self,
to increase and grow in it daily more and more, till both it and we come
both to perfection.</p>
            <p>Of all these this is the <hi>sum,</hi> that in <hi>Christ</hi> there is fulness, <hi>all</hi> fulness,
fulness in <hi>both</hi> natures, fulness that contents not it self, till it have <hi>fill'd</hi>
others, till it fill us <hi>all.</hi> That from this fulness we receive, receive all we
have; all <hi>we have,</hi> though not all <hi>he has,</hi> all sorts of graces fitting for us;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57113:36"/>
and all <hi>gratis,</hi> are therefore to give thanks for it, as we have received,
so to repay again <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>grace.</hi> And of all, this is the scope, the <hi>Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his grace, the scope of the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and
the <hi>day.</hi> 'Tis but making it <hi>yours</hi> too, and then all will be full. And that
it may so, I begin now particularly to open to you all this fulness;
where I am first to shew you whose it is. <hi>His fulness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>His</hi> you know is a <hi>Relative,</hi> must relate to somewhat that is before;
<hi>His,</hi> to some that was spoken of before: <hi>who's that?</hi> one to whom Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> bare witness, that <hi>he was before,</hi> ver. 15. long before in the <hi>beginning,</hi>
ver. 1. but was fain to draw nearer, e're we could see <hi>him,</hi> or his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
to draw himself into the flesh, e're we could fully discern his grace,
or behold his glory, was made flesh, <hi>the word made flesh,</hi> ver. 14. the only
begotten of the <hi>Father,</hi> become the only born of a <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> before
we hear of any one <hi>full of grace and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>word,</hi> this eternal <hi>word,</hi> this only begotten Son of <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>He,</hi>
this, <hi>His,</hi> belongs to: yet this fulness, <hi>then</hi> fully <hi>His,</hi> when he was made
the Son of Man. In that <hi>first</hi> appeared the fulness of his <hi>love,</hi> the fulness
of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> the fulness of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> the infinite
grace and favour done to our flesh, the fulness of his <hi>truth,</hi> and reality
above all those <hi>empty</hi> types and shadows, which more amus'd, then fill'd
the world. The <hi>body,</hi> that's of <hi>Christ,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Col. ii. 17. the
full body of truth, full bodied grace, never till he took a body to make
it full. The <hi>Law</hi> that could not fill us; the very life of things there was
poured out at the foot of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and all the rest went into <hi>smoke.</hi> The
<hi>Prophets</hi> they could not fill us with any thing but expectation, fill us with
good words; but alas! they are but wind, would have proved so too, had
not <hi>he</hi> embodied them. All the <hi>world</hi> could not fill us, the fulness of time
was not come upon it, till the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>fulness</hi> came: all that was in it till
he came was vanity and emptiness; could neither satisfie it self nor us.
'Tis <hi>Christ that filleth all in all,</hi> Ephes. i. 23. He the end of the <hi>Law,</hi> the
completion of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the fulness of the <hi>World.</hi> To <hi>him</hi> it is that <hi>this</hi>
fulness is attributed, to the <hi>fulness of Christ,</hi> Ephes. iv. 13. In <hi>him</hi> it is,
<hi>it dwells,</hi> Col. i. 19. So it pleased <hi>God,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle</hi> there; so to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together <hi>in one all things in Christ,</hi> both <hi>which are in heaven, and which
are in earth, even in him,</hi> Ephes. i. 10. Fulness must needs be his, in whom
all things are gathered altogether, in whom <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>heaven</hi> together.</p>
            <p>2. Thus the fulness you see is <hi>his,</hi> and it being the fulness of Heaven
and Earth, you see in general <hi>what</hi> his fulness is. In particular it cannot
be measured. <hi>It is as high as Heaven, what canst thou do? deeper then Hell, what
canst thou know? the measure of it is longer then the earth, and broader then the
Sea,</hi> Job xi. 8, 9. There is no end of his fulness, no more than of his
greatness: In him are hid <hi>all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. ii.
3. all wisdom and knowledge treasured up in <hi>him,</hi> all in the very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, all the very treasures of wisdom and knowledge, the choicest to
be found there, all even hidden and obscured by <hi>his,</hi> swallow'd up in that;
<hi>he</hi> knows all, and to know <hi>him</hi> is to know all the highest Wisdom, the
deepest knowledge is but silliness and ignorance, in respect of <hi>his,</hi> hides
it self at the comparison, as lesser lights do at the <hi>Suns</hi> glaring Beams, in
<hi>him</hi> is all knowledge, and in the knowledge of <hi>him</hi> is all wisdom hidden
and contained. In him 2. is the <hi>fulness of grace,</hi> Full of grace <hi>are thy lips,</hi>
Psal. xlv. 3. and if the <hi>lip's</hi> full, the <hi>heart's</hi> not empty; for out of the
abundance <hi>there,</hi> the fulness <hi>here,</hi> the very <hi>stature of fulness,</hi> Ephes. iv. 13.
In him 3. is the <hi>fulness of truth,</hi> ver. 14. so full, that he is stil'd the very
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57113:37"/>
               <hi>truth it self,</hi> St. John xiv. 6. <hi>I am the truth,</hi> the truth of the <hi>promises,</hi> all
the promises since the Creation. All the promises of God are <hi>in him yea,</hi>
and <hi>in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. i. 20. The truth of all the <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi>
and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> from the worlds first cradle: the true <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> the <hi>true
Scape-Goat,</hi> the true <hi>High-Priest, Adam,</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and <hi>Samson,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> were but the representations of him,
or what was to be more substantially done by him. <hi>They</hi> are but the
<hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>pictures, he</hi> the substance all the way. To <hi>him</hi> they all related,
had not their offices, actions, or passions, scarce their very names fulfilled
but in <hi>him,</hi> all their fulness was in <hi>him. Their</hi> truth, and all truth <hi>besides,</hi>
the doctrine of truth never fully delivered, never fully revealed or known
till <hi>he</hi> came with it. We knew it but in <hi>pieces,</hi> we saw it but in <hi>clouds,</hi> we
heard it but in dark and obscure <hi>Prophesies,</hi> till <hi>he</hi> came a <hi>light into the world,</hi>
to manifest it all; 'tis then we first hear of the whole will of God, and
the declaring that, the <hi>whole counsel of God,</hi> Acts xx. 27. truth was not at
the <hi>fulness,</hi> till <hi>he</hi> taught it.</p>
            <p>Nor 4. was his the fulness of wisdom and knowledge, grace and truth,
but of the <hi>Spirit</hi> too: not <hi>by measure,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. 34. but immeasurably
full <hi>He,</hi> all the graces of the Spirit, and all of them to the <hi>full</hi> in <hi>him.</hi>
The <hi>Spirit</hi> himself <hi>proceeds</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 26. he must therefore
needs be full of that.</p>
            <p>Full 5. with the fulness of <hi>Riches</hi> too, the unsearchable <hi>riches of Christ,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> iii. 8. so full that we can find out no bottom of it, come
to no end of it, <hi>unsearchable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fulness 6. was the fulness of <hi>Glory</hi> too, we saw it, says St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
two verses before the <hi>Text;</hi> such a glory as of the <hi>onely begotten Son of the
Father,</hi> and that sure is all the fulness of <hi>God.</hi> Yet to put all out of doubt,
this fulness was the fulness of the <hi>God-head</hi> too expresly, all the fulness of
it, and all of it <hi>bodily</hi> too, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. ii. 3. <hi>Bodily,</hi> how's that?
why, that's full in all dimensions, in all dimensions of a body, <hi>length,</hi> and
<hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>heighth,</hi> and <hi>depth;</hi> the length and infinity of his <hi>Power,</hi> the
extent and breadth of his <hi>Love,</hi> the height and eminency of his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>
the depth and unfathomedness of his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> all met together in
<hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Nor will this seem strange at all, if we consider for our <hi>third</hi> point,
in this fulness, <hi>how</hi> and in <hi>what respect</hi> 'tis <hi>his:</hi> and 'tis <hi>his</hi> both as he is
<hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>man.</hi> He could not be thus full as I have told you, unless he
were <hi>God,</hi> could not have the <hi>God-head</hi> dwell in him <hi>bodily,</hi> unless <hi>God</hi> were
in the body, unless he were <hi>incarnate God.</hi> Nor could other kinds of his
fulness be in him, unless he were man. He could not be a full and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and so offered for <hi>one,</hi> had he not been man, nor a perfect
<hi>High Priest</hi> to mediate for us, if not taken from among men; the great
promise that contains all the rest, that of the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> could
not have been fulfilled, would not have had its fulness from him but as
man. The very attribute of fulness speaks him <hi>God;</hi> none full but <hi>God;</hi>
no fulness or satisfaction but in him; yet some kinds of his fulness evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
him man, are not the fulnesses of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>God;</hi> but as <hi>God</hi> made
<hi>man:</hi> and so the <hi>Evangelist</hi> by the <hi>Context</hi> delivers it: as the fulness of the
<hi>word made flesh,</hi> of the eternal word becoming man. This fulness is the
fulness of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> so the fulness of <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And such a <hi>fulness,</hi> that none runs over, <hi>anointed with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
above his fellows;</hi> that's fulness, but that's not all; so above them too
it is, as it runs down <hi>upon</hi> his fellows: he is not full only for himself, for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57113:37"/>
               <hi>us</hi> it was, that he was born, that he was given, that he was anointed, that
he was full, full of grace, and full of truth, and full of glory, that <hi>we</hi>
might be fill'd with grace, and truth, and glory. He indeed is the <hi>head</hi>
that was anointed with oyl, but that head is <hi>ours;</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> is the body
upon which it runs down from the head.</p>
            <p>5. And that not to the near parts alone, to the <hi>beard</hi> or <hi>shoulders,</hi>
but even to the <hi>skirts</hi> of the garment it runs, so full it runs. <hi>Ex hoc omnes,</hi>
all the members, nay all the clothes; not only those that are true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Church,</hi> but even those who have but an outward relation to
it: all that have but an external right or adherence, as <hi>skirts,</hi> and <hi>clothes,</hi>
have yet some benefit of this oyl, of this fulness of his. <hi>Christ</hi> is no nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
his fulness nothing so stinted (<hi>as some narrow and envious souls will have
it</hi>) here's enough for all: enough for the whole world to take, and yet leave
all full still. You may light a thousand candles at one, and yet the light
of it no way lessened by it. You may fill a <hi>thousand</hi> worlds, if there were
so many, from his fulness, and yet <hi>he</hi> never a whit the less full. Take all
you can cope, all that will, nay all that are or shall be, here's still for
all, as much as at the first; <hi>O the depth of the riches of the fulness of Christ!</hi> I
could fill the <hi>hour,</hi> I could fill the <hi>day,</hi> I could fill all the remnant of my
days with the discourses of it; and should I do it, I could yet say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, near the full, but be as far from sounding the depth of it at
the end, as I was at the beginning. I pass therefore to that which we
can better comprehend, easier reach, our <hi>filling</hi> out of this <hi>fulness,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
general.</p>
            <p>2. Our <hi>filling</hi> is here said to be <hi>receiving.</hi> Be our fulness never so great,
it is no other, we have received it all. Alas poor things, we have nothing
of our selves. <hi>What hast thou that thou hast not received?</hi> says the Apostle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 7. Is it <hi>grace?</hi> that grows not in <hi>our</hi> gardens; it comes from
<hi>Paradise:</hi> what we have is transplanted from thence. Is it <hi>nature?</hi> why
<hi>that</hi> too is received. We did not make our selves, we received as well
our <hi>natural</hi> as our <hi>spiritual</hi> endowments, from him that made us. Is it <hi>glory?</hi>
why, <hi>God</hi> calls it <hi>his glory:</hi> a thing he will not share, but by beams and
glances. What should I now mention worldly Riches, Estate, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
they are too evidently received, to be denied they are so. 'Tis the
<hi>blessing of the Lord that makes rich,</hi> Prov. xx. 22. so Riches are received. <hi>I
shall deliver him, and bring him to honour,</hi> says God, <hi>Psal.</hi> xci. 15. so Honour
is received. And <hi>the earth hath God given to the children of men,</hi> Psal. cxv. 16.
so our Estates and Lands, every Clod and Turf of them is received. For
the earth is the <hi>Lords, and the fulness thereof;</hi> and from his fulness we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of it what we have.</p>
            <p>Enough this to humble us; for if thou hast received it, <hi>why dost thou
glory, as if thou hadst not?</hi> 'tis St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s inference upon it. Thou hast no
reason to boast thy self <hi>O man,</hi> thy Honour, thy Riches, thy good Parts,
thy Graces, they are not from thy self, thou didst but receive them,
thou hast nothing of thine own, why art thou proud?</p>
            <p>And 2. if all received, <hi>all</hi> we have nothing but so many <hi>receipts;</hi> look
we then well to our accounts, they are things we are to reckon for: we
had best see how we expend them, that at the general <hi>Audit</hi> we may give
up our accounts with joy.</p>
            <p>To do so, 'twill be convenient to think often of our receipts, our own
poverty, and indigence; a <hi>third</hi> business we may learn hence, to grow
sensible of our emptinesses and necessities, that we are a meer <hi>bill</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
so much received to day, so much yesterday, so much day by day;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57113:38"/>
               <hi>item</hi> our souls, <hi>item</hi> our bodies, <hi>item</hi> our health, <hi>item</hi> our wealth, and so
on ward, nothing but received, and without receiving, nothing.</p>
            <p>Upon this reflection upon our <hi>own</hi> vacuities, we cannot 4. but open
our hearts to receive, our hands to take any thing from <hi>his</hi> fulness to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
us; to desire to have them fill'd, our selves fill'd out of his fulness,
something thence to make us full.</p>
            <p>2. Yet 2. we must not expect to be so fill'd, that we should have an
absolute or perfect plenitude, a plenitude without a diminishing <hi>preposition</hi>
before it: <hi>Plenitudinem,</hi> properly speaking, it will not be; <hi>de plenitudine,</hi>
that's the proper speech, somewhat taken from fulness, a kind of <hi>ablative</hi>
secondary, proportional one. We are not <hi>capable</hi> of other, somewhat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the height, somewhat bated of the <hi>perfection</hi> of it. With this
fulness it was, that the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Protomartyr</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and other Saints are said in holy Scripture to
be full or fill'd, full of Grace, or full of Faith, or full of the Holy Ghost,
full as the <hi>Bucket,</hi> not as the <hi>Spring;</hi> full as the <hi>Streams,</hi> not as the <hi>Ocean;</hi>
full as the <hi>measure,</hi> not as the <hi>immeasurable;</hi> full with a fulness of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
not of redundance; of sufficiency, not of efficiency; full enough
for our selves, but not for others: Alas poor narrow shallow things that
we are, we cannot hold enough for our selves and others too.</p>
            <p>Take from the Bucket or the Stream, and the Bucket will not be full,
and the Stream will want of what it had. <hi>Lest there be not enough for us and
you,</hi> was more then a just fear of the wise <hi>Virgins:</hi> there is not, will not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be enough. No man is sanctified by anothers Grace, no man justified
by anothers Faith: the Fathers goodness will not satisfie for the Sons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graciousness,
nor the Mothers Piety for the Daughters Vanity; their
Righteousness be it as full as it can, will but suffice only for themselves;
'tis only <hi>Christs</hi> Fulness, his Grace, his Righteousness, that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
it self, that we can take any thing from to fill up our own.
Sufficient I think this, to read us a <hi>second</hi> lesson of humility, not to think
too much of our own Righteousness, nor to pride our selves in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts;
for of another they are, but from them no other; they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of <hi>his,</hi> but none receive of <hi>ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sufficient 2. this too to teach us, not to trust to the Piety of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
as if their fulness of good works should excuse our emptiness.
They had but <hi>their</hi> share, what would serve their <hi>turns,</hi> we must afresh to
the <hi>Spring-head,</hi> to have enough to serve <hi>ours.</hi> And the comfort is in the
next point, that it will cost us nothing, we have it <hi>gratis,</hi> for <hi>gratia</hi> it is,
of free grace and favour that we receive it.</p>
            <p>3. That we may not doubt it, 'tis doubled in the <hi>Text,</hi> redoubled; grace,
all <hi>meerly</hi> grace, nothing but grace, <hi>from</hi> it, and <hi>for</hi> it, and <hi>by</hi> it. Nothing
from desert, nothing from works; for <hi>if of works, not of grace,</hi> says St.
<hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. 6. that's plain; for if of desert, not of grace, but duty:
not bought or purchased neither, <hi>freely without mony,</hi> says the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
Isa. 55. 1. Come drink, and eat, and fill your selves. The <hi>Ocean</hi> runs not
freer than <hi>his</hi> grace. <hi>Who hath first given unto him,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom.
11. 35. Who first? why no body sure, for before there was any body,
before the <hi>foundation of the world,</hi> Ephes. 1. 4. he begun with us; even
then <hi>gratificavit nos,</hi> he accepted us; all grace from the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence</hi> too is a lesson of humility, the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>day</hi> is full of it, from one
end of the Text to the other, one end of the day to the other: <hi>grace,
grace,</hi> to put down all opinion of merit or desert; as if it meant to teach
us to be fill'd with humility from the fulness of it <hi>this</hi> day shewed by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57113:38"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> and to be read from <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Texts</hi> that concern it; as if grace <hi>it
self</hi> had this day appeared to teach it.</p>
            <p>4. So much perhaps to be prest the rather from the fulness of the grace
that now follows to be considered in the next particular, lest by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it we should be <hi>exalted above measure,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> by the abundance
of his Revelations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 7. For men may be <hi>proud</hi> of graces, and
here are store received in the Text.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Gratiam pro gratiâ,</hi> the grace of the <hi>Gospel</hi> for the grace of the <hi>Law,</hi>
that's the more abundant, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. v. 17, 20. though this was
a grace too, a favour when time was, and that such, he shewed no such
grace to any people, as to the <hi>Iew.</hi> To them the <hi>Adoption,</hi> the <hi>Glory,</hi> the
<hi>Covenants,</hi> the <hi>giving of the Law,</hi> the <hi>Service of God,</hi> the <hi>Promises,</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
the <hi>coming of Christ also according to the flesh;</hi> all these graces apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 4, 5. these all were great ones, but the <hi>Law brought nothing
to perfection,</hi> Heb. vii. 19. The very <hi>end</hi> of it was <hi>Christ,</hi> Rom. x. 4. The
Law, as great a favour as it was, was but the <hi>Law</hi> still; full of shadows
and imperfections, full of rigours without ability to perform them: <hi>That</hi>
came by <hi>Christ,</hi> the very <hi>grace</hi> and beauty, and glory of the Law was
<hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that was it which was the <hi>perfection</hi> of the
<hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>fulness</hi> of the Adoption, the <hi>performance</hi> of the Covenants, the
<hi>finishing, bringing</hi> in a <hi>better service,</hi> the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the promises, the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi>
of the Fathers, the <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> not according to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the flesh, but according to the power of the Spirit, and of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
grace. This is <hi>de plenitudine</hi> right, over and above all graces and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
that were shewed before, all that ever any received before us.</p>
            <p>So much above them, as spiritual and eternal blessings are above the
temporal, as the reward of glory is above all other rewards; for <hi>grace</hi>
for <hi>grace</hi> 2. is <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>glory:</hi> grace given us by <hi>Christ,</hi> to the end we may
obtain eternal glory by it; all the graces (<hi>If I may so call the good works of
the Law</hi>) tended only to <hi>temporal</hi> promises; read the whole Law over, and
shew me any other if you can; the grace of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> it is, that
first revealed the hopes of glory, thence the Kingdom of Heaven is heard
of first, there first of grace for glory, grace was single grace, till <hi>Christ</hi>
took a second nature to double it, to grace all to us.</p>
            <p>And 3. here's glory again for grace, according to other <hi>Interpreters;</hi>
the reward as sure as the work is: Grace is not only given us to purchase
Glory, but Glory as surely given us for that Grace. The glory of the
Law, or the works of the Law had no <hi>grace</hi> at all, was but a kind of
dark dusky thing: The glory of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the glory after it, and
from it, is that only that <hi>exceeds in glory.</hi> Thus Grace is doubled upon
Grace; we have Grace for Glory; Grace to <hi>come</hi> to Glory, and Glory
again to <hi>reward</hi> our Grace: two great ingredients of the fulness we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<hi>&amp; gratiam pro gratiâ,</hi> even each of these for the other.</p>
            <p>Yet to make the Glory yet <hi>more</hi> glorious, the Grace <hi>more</hi> gracious, here
is 4. Grace for Grace; yet in another sense, one Grace <hi>for</hi> another, one
to <hi>advance</hi> another; Grace <hi>upon</hi> Grace, that we may have Glory upon
Glory. For <hi>Christ</hi> will fill us, if we will, with more than a simple Grace
or Glory, increase and advance us by degrees in both. Grace for Grace is
put to signifie <hi>abundance</hi> of Graces: as <hi>Iob</hi> ii. 4. <hi>Skin for skin,</hi> skin <hi>after</hi>
skin, one thing after another will a man give for his life; Grace for
Grace, that is Grace after Grace will <hi>God</hi> give us, one after another: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave giving, will not only give us one or two simple graces, but a
confluence and full <hi>tide</hi> of them; one crowding upon the other, <hi>gratiam
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57113:39"/>
cumulatam,</hi> Graces upon heaps, <hi>all spiritual blessings,</hi> Eph. i. 3. <hi>redemption,
forgiveness of sins,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>the knowledge of the mystery of his will,</hi> ver. 9. the
<hi>Seal of the Spirit,</hi> ver. 13. all the gifts and graces of the Spirit, all holy
Vertues and Accomplishments, all sanctifying and edifying Graces, for
to procure us Grace in the eyes of <hi>God,</hi> and Graces to gain us Grace in the
eyes of men: Grace to make our selves gracious in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> and
Grace to make others gracious also, to bring others into Grace, into the
Grace of the Gospel. Thus also we receive, and this <hi>And</hi> here hath an
<hi>emphasis,</hi> and 'tis this, to denote this fulness and abundance of Grace,
<hi>that</hi> especially, whatever else.</p>
            <p>Yet this <hi>And</hi> may be an <hi>adversative,</hi> as much as <hi>sed,</hi> or <hi>quamvis;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
thus we receive, and Grace we receive, and Grace in this
abundance, but not <hi>all</hi> Grace <hi>alike,</hi> but Grace for Grace; that is, either
according to his Grace wherewith he loves us, some more, some less, one
this, another that, according to the <hi>measure of the gift of Christ,</hi> Ephes. iv.
7. Or 2. Grace for Grace, according to the measure of the use we make
of one Grace, we receive another. <hi>He that hath, to him shall be given,</hi> St.
Mat. xiii. 12. Or 3. Grace for Grace, that is one <hi>after this manner, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after that,</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 7. One receives one Grace, another receives
another, not all alike, not all the same. <hi>To one is given the word of Wisdom,
to another the word of knowledge, to another Faith,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. xii. 8. and so
onward: and which adds much to the fulness of this Grace, it reaches now
fifthly unto all, <hi>we all have received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>All</hi> is a large word, yet no larger then <hi>Christs</hi> Grace. <hi>Ho every one,</hi>
cries the <hi>Prophet,</hi> every one come take it, <hi>Isa.</hi> lv. 1. he disgraces <hi>Christs</hi>
Grace, nay ungraces it, that ties it up only to I know not what elect ones.
<hi>All things were made by him,</hi> ver. 3. and received they nothing by it? He
<hi>fills all things living with plenteousness,</hi> Psal. cxlv. 16. and receive they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
<hi>He enlightens every man that comes into the world,</hi> ver. 9. and is that
nothing neither? 1. Does he that receives light from <hi>Christ,</hi> receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
Yes, yes, all receive some benefit or other from <hi>Christs</hi> coming;
It were to deny his <hi>fulness,</hi> to deny <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> that went before, all drank of the <hi>same Rock, which
Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 4. they received their <hi>fill</hi> of him, according to
the <hi>capacity</hi> of their Vessels. All the <hi>Prophets</hi> that followed after, they
also were partakers of the same Grace, in another manner. But they
that followed him, they, <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Iews,</hi> they above all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and Grace for Grace. Nay, I am perswaded, that there was no man,
no creature; there is no man, no creature (<hi>the Devils only excepted</hi>) but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some benefit or other from this fulness; the goodness of <hi>God</hi> which
is not willing <hi>that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, and
to everlasting life,</hi> 2 S. Pet. iii. 9. would not suffer any to perish for want of
receiving that without which they could not but perish, that <hi>first</hi> Grace
which might in some measure <hi>dispose</hi> him for a <hi>second,</hi> and so forward,
were he but willing to work with it.</p>
            <p>Nay, even <hi>We,</hi> and what were <hi>we?</hi> We that were his <hi>enemies,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, we receive reconcilement by his Grace; and why not any <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
as well as <hi>we?</hi> We that <hi>were haters of God,</hi> Rom. i. 30. and <hi>hateful to
men,</hi> Tit. iii. 3. We that were <hi>dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> Ephes. ii. 1. full
of all abominable iniquities; we received pardon of them all, and were
received to Grace: and what reason have we then to exclude <hi>any,</hi> who
be they what they will, cannot be worse than we were once, nor in less
capacity to receive it: To be sure, <hi>omnes</hi> will reach them all, and <hi>God</hi> is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57113:39"/>
gracious to all, not only to them that <hi>call</hi> upon him, but to them also
that <hi>never seek him, nor call upon him,</hi> Isa. lxv. 1. This is Grace indeed, and
'tis that makes up the fulness, that shews it full.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis time we should know to whom we owe it: look we back again
once more to the <hi>ejus,</hi> and you have it. Of his fulness, that is, of <hi>Christs,</hi>
it is that we thus all receive; that we receive all this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> i. 6. In <hi>the
beloved it is,</hi> that we are thus gratified, thus grac'd, thus begrac'd. And
the <hi>beloved</hi> is he in whom <hi>he was well-pleased with us all,</hi> S. Mat. iii. 17.
Grace and Truth, why? that's true Grace, and <hi>that came by Iesus Christ,</hi> in
the verse next the Text. <hi>We</hi> were all ungracious Children; <hi>he</hi> the only
gracious Son, who makes us gracious. <hi>In him he chose us,</hi> Ephes. i. 4. <hi>In
him he predestinated us to the adoption of Children,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>In him he hath made us
accepted,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>In him we have redemption, forgiveness, and the very riches of
grace,</hi> ver. 7. All in him, and without him nothing. So get him, and get
all; lose him, and lose all. <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 12. There is <hi>no other name but his,</hi> no
other Grace but his, by which we can be saved. From the Grace he had
with his <hi>Father</hi> from the <hi>beginning,</hi> we have ours in <hi>time,</hi> from the Grace
he hath purchased with him, to which he was exalted <hi>by his obedience,</hi> Phil.
ii. 9. we are also exalted to his Grace. From the Grace wherewith he
loved us, are we made partakers of his Grace. He <hi>design'd</hi> it for us, he
he <hi>deserv'd</hi> it for us, he <hi>infuses</hi> it into us, he <hi>works</hi> it in us, and after all he has
yet reserved a greater for us, an eternal Glory for the reward of Grace.</p>
            <p>7. How can we now then, <hi>lastly,</hi> but render <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace?</hi> say grace,
and bless him over this plenty and fulness; cry <hi>Grace, Grace</hi> unto it, as the
<hi>Prophet</hi> has it, <hi>Zach.</hi> iv. 7. proclaim, and tell it to the world, fill our lips
with Songs and Hymns of Praise, fill the Congregations with his Glory,
and the world with telling out his goodness.</p>
            <p>To do it the better, to do the greater right to his Grace, let us take the
<hi>Grace-cup</hi> in our hand and do it: the Cup which <hi>Christ</hi> blessed, and gave
to us to remember <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>Grace</hi> in. We call it a <hi>receiving,</hi> let us then
receive it, receive, and answer this <hi>receiving</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> with the <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
in the day; receive we him and his fulness, him and his graces, him
with all thankfulness, reverence, and devotion. Set we our selves to do
it, to <hi>draw waters out of these wells of salvation,</hi> Isa. xii. 3. by the hand of
Faith, and bucket of Humility, out of these Fountains of our Saviour:
So the Latin reads it, whose side runs out blood and water, full streams of
grace and pardon, and all the gifts of the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> if we will but
come hither to draw or drink them. We call it a receiving, and so it is,
the most signal receiving, that we have, a receiving him <hi>full</hi> and <hi>whole,</hi>
Body and Blood, Flesh and Spirit, <hi>really,</hi> though not <hi>corporally</hi> both; let us
therefore receive it: Open we but our mouths wide, and he will fill them;
open we our mouths to beg, and we shall receive; open them wide and
full, and we shall be fill'd with fulness too, to day at this <hi>full table,</hi> a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at this time full of all heavenly delicates and dainties.</p>
            <p>Yet as we must open our mouths, so we must open our hands too, our
mouths to <hi>receive,</hi> our hands to <hi>give.</hi> We receive of <hi>Christ,</hi> 'tis fit we
give somewhat out of our receipts; we receive of his fulness, 'tis but
proportionbale, that we give out of our fulness to those that are not
full, that <hi>our abundance may be the supply of others want,</hi> as <hi>Christs</hi> fulness is
of ours: 'Tis a day of <hi>fulness,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> would be full, the <hi>poor</hi> as well as the
<hi>rich,</hi> that all mouths might this day be filled with his praise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi.
20. This is not to eat the <hi>Lords</hi> Body, for one to be full, (<hi>I give it the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
word</hi>) another to be hungry, the poor must have their share; they that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57113:40"/>
have not, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> that is the poor. 'Tis a <hi>Communion,</hi> and all must
communicate, one way or other, <hi>poor</hi> and all. 'Tis a feast of fulness both
in the <hi>Church</hi> and in the <hi>House,</hi> all must communicate of <hi>this</hi> days fulness
one way or other, in one sort or other; and surely when we have filled
our selves with the fulness of <hi>this</hi> house, we cannot but fill others with
the fulness of <hi>ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet there is one more <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, another fulness, to which this
grace and fulness leads us, to be <hi>filled</hi> henceforward with <hi>goodworks,</hi> to be
filled with the fruits of Righteousness, and all the knowledge of <hi>Christ.</hi>
For this it is, that this fulness is received, that this grace is received, that
this Grace-cup, the cup of Salvation is received, that all gifts and graces
are received, that we increase in grace, go on in goodness, proceed in all
kinds of holy vertues, till we come to the fulness of <hi>Christ,</hi> to the fulness
of his grace here, and of his glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>Send down thy Grace, O heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> that we may all receive this
fulness at thy hand; empty us of our sins, empty us of our selves, that
we may henceforward be only fill'd with thee: fill us this day with the
plenteousness of thy table, and reject us not, though too unworthy; fill us
every day with the plenteousness of thy Grace, and leave us not to our
own weakness, that we may go on from grace to grace, from strength to
strength, from vertue to vertue, till we come to be filled with the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of thy house, to the fulness of joy, and pleasure, and grace, and
glory for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>God</hi> and Author of all this fulness, all our receipts, all good gifts
and graces; to the <hi>Father</hi> that gives, to the <hi>Son</hi> that purchas'd, to the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that conveys them to us, be all the fulness of thanks, and praise,
and honour, and glory, for ever and ever.</p>

SERMON
ON Christmas-Day.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 TIMOTHY i. 15.</bibl>
               <q>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Iesus came into the world to save Sinners, of whom I am chief.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is a faithful saying.</hi> And this is the <hi>day</hi> that made it
so, faithful and true, wherein it could first be truly
said, that <hi>Christ Iesus came into the world to save sinners:</hi>
for which both <hi>Text and Day</hi> are well worthy of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
            <p>Turn the whole Scripture over, you will find no say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there more faithful, that speaks God more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
more to have kept his promise, than <hi>this</hi> that tells us that Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
is come into the world. <hi>He</hi> in whom all his promises are fulfilled. And
run through the year you will find no day more faithful than this that
presents us the ground of all our Faith, <hi>Christ Iesus come to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Worthy of all acceptation,</hi> too, they must needs be both, both <hi>Text</hi> and
<hi>Day,</hi> that brings salvation: above all to sinners (of which ye are a part,
and the Preacher chief.) I cannot but with gladness preach it, nor you
but with joy and attention hear it: especially to day, the <hi>day</hi> he came in;
<hi>in a time accepted, in the day of salvation,</hi> when <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>time</hi> so happily meet.
The <hi>day</hi> makes the <hi>Text</hi> seasonable. The business of the <hi>Text</hi> makes the
<hi>Day</hi> acceptable. The necessities of poor sinners make both comfortable.
God make the Sermon profitable too, and we have all we can desire to
day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Text</hi> to be sure promises fair: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself finds so much
comfort in it by his own experience, of the truth and sweetness of it in
the former verses 12, 13. that he here commends it to us, as a saying
worthy all the respect that we can give it, worthy to be preach'd, worthy
to be believed, worthy to be laid hold on, worthy to be laid up faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and remembred, <hi>That Christ Iesus came into the world to save sinners.</hi>
After which saying, nor he nor we have any more to say then that we
are the chief of them, so particularly to apply it. [And that I hope we will
to day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57113:41"/>
For the whole end both of the saying it self, and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s saying it, is
but to dispose and move us worthily to accept Christ now he is come (for
whose coming the Church and we have been this month preparing.)
And the sum of it to put us 1. in comfort, first that how sadly soever
things look'd with us before his coming, by his coming now we may be
sav'd, for <hi>Christ Iesus came to save sinners,</hi> and to put us secondly in the
way how we may; by believing, 1. this faithful saying for a truth: by
accepting it 2. for a word worthy all acceptance; by confessing lastly
our selves the most unworthy of it, yet the chief that need it.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the full sense of the Text, and both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>Christmas</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Doctrine, that</hi> Christ Iesus came into the world to save sinners; <hi>the</hi>
Doctrine of Christmas.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vse</hi> of it, to take it every one of us to himself; take himself to
be the <hi>quorum primus,</hi> the chief of the <hi>quorum</hi> concerned in it, the
chief of sinners; and therefore chiefly interessed in Christs coming.
This the <hi>Vse</hi> both of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and the <hi>Day,</hi> to apply them both, and
cry out every one of us with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 'Tis I, and I, and I, for whom He
<hi>came.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Doctrine there are these particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That</hi> Christ Iesus came into the world.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>That</hi> He came to save sinners.</item>
               <item>3. That <hi>He came to save the chiefest of them,</hi> the very <hi>quorum primi</hi> of
them. What is it else to S. <hi>Paul</hi> or us? or why does he bring himself
in upon no better title?</item>
               <item>4. That <hi>all these are faithful sayings, and worthy of acceptation;</hi> all single,
such; but all together make up a saying <hi>worthy all acceptation:</hi> the
very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the saying above all sayings, the whole <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
it self; the <hi>Word</hi> after which no word can be said: nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of which therefore surely the <hi>Vse</hi> 2. must needs be great if we through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply it: and four ways there are to do it in the <hi>Text,</hi> four <hi>Vses</hi> we are
to make of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If a saying, a <hi>faithful saying</hi> it be, we then faithfully <hi>to believe it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. If <hi>worthy acceptation,</hi> we then worthily <hi>to accept it.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. If it reach the <hi>chief sinners</hi> too, our chief business then, with St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> humbly to apply it to our own particular; not think much any
of us to say, <hi>quorum ego primus;</hi> not to stick to confess our selves the
chiefest among them that are sinners, so we may be found chief, or
second, or any one among them that are saved.</item>
               <item>4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is, a special <hi>saying</hi> this is, not to be wrapt up in silence
then, nor hudled up within private walls, but to be spoken, and
spoken out, cried and proclaimed to all the world.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And all this lastly I add to be done to <hi>day.</hi> That indeed is not in the
<hi>Text,</hi> but 'tis in the <hi>Time,</hi> and never better to be done then now to <hi>day:</hi>
That's the right use of this <hi>Holy time,</hi> that to which the <hi>Church</hi> designs
<hi>Christmas:</hi> to proclaim <hi>Christs coming into the world to save sinners,</hi> and to
call them in all to come to him.</p>
            <p>To carry on the design, I go on now with the <hi>Text,</hi> and begin with
the first branch of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> there, that <hi>Christ Iesus came into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That <hi>he did so this great day is witness,</hi> worthy therefore to be kept
for ever for a witness of it; and they that keep it not, to be suspected
that they do not think he did, nor believe that there was any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57113:41"/>
Yet that such a one there was, <hi>one Iesus that went about doing good,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi>
his rankest enemies will not deny it.</p>
            <p>That that <hi>Iesus was the Christ,</hi> though the <hi>Iews</hi> will not, the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
will confess it, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 43. Christ and Jesus too, <hi>the</hi> Christ, <hi>the</hi>
Saviour of the world; nay, the Christ indeed, and the Saviour indeed,
and they know it, they say there. Nay of the Jews too, many believed
it, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> vii. 31. believed and justified it.</p>
            <p>Nor did they it without good ground; the many <hi>Miracles</hi> that he did in
the confirmation of it, the performing what was prophesied of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
Isa.</hi> xxxv. 6. and lxi. 1. The opening the eyes of the blind, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Lepers, the raising the dead, the preaching to the poor the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of peace, those pure and holy, and comfortable Doctrines that he
taught; were a sufficient resolution to S. <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> question: that it was
<hi>He that should come,</hi> and we should <hi>look for no other,</hi> S. Mat. xi. 3, 4, 5. no
other than He.</p>
            <p>Indeed we need not: for this <hi>Iesus</hi> is a <hi>Iesus</hi> of another sort, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
manner of spelling ('tis observ'd) then all former <hi>Iesus's,</hi> then <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> or <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Iosedec,</hi> or <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrach;</hi>
this <hi>Iehoscuah, Iesus</hi> or a <hi>Iehoscuah</hi> (for 'tis so in the Hebrew) is with the
points of <hi>Iehovah</hi> in it, a <hi>Iehovah, Iesus,</hi> a <hi>Saviour</hi> that is the <hi>Lord,</hi> as the
<hi>Angel</hi> tells us, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 11. A <hi>Iesus</hi> never the like before, a <hi>Iesus</hi> above
every <hi>Iesus, a name</hi> now <hi>above every name, a name to which Heaven, and
Earth, and Hell must bow:</hi> never did they to any <hi>Iesus</hi> else.</p>
            <p>And as this <hi>name</hi> now <hi>above every name,</hi> so this <hi>coming</hi> of his above every
coming. We sometimes call our own births, I confess, a coming into the
world; but properly, none ever <hi>came into the world</hi> but he: For 1. He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
truly can be said to come who is before he comes, so were not we; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he so. 2. He only strictly comes who comes willingly; our crying and
strugling at our entrance into the world, shews how unwillingly we come
into it. He alone it is that sings out, <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> Psal. xl. 3. He only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
comes, who comes from some place or other: Alas! we had none to
come from but the womb of nothing. <hi>He</hi> only had a place to be in before
he came. Now such a <hi>Iesus,</hi> as this, as has God in his name, and must be
conceived to be also so by the way of his coming, may well be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
that should come into the world, Iesus the Christ.</hi> We need seek no further,
especially if it be the <hi>Iesus</hi> that comes to <hi>save sinners.</hi> And he it is says
our next particular.</p>
            <p>2. Nay the <hi>Angel</hi> said <hi>so before he was born.</hi> He had the name given
him for the purpose, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> i. 21. <hi>Thou shalt call his name Iesus:</hi> for why?
<hi>For he shall save his people from their sins.</hi> Himself professes he <hi>came</hi> for the
purpose, <hi>to call sinners to repentance,</hi> S. Luke v. 32. and that's to save them;
yea so for them, that there's a <hi>non veni</hi> to others; he came for no other:
to speak truth, there were no other to come for. <hi>Omnes aberraverunt, We
were all sinners:</hi> So if he came for the best of us, he yet came for sinners,
for them or no body. But so, for such, as not for them that were not such;
so altogether for sinners, as not at all for the righteous. <hi>I came not to call
the righteous,</hi> not them, but sinners as it were in opposition to them. Indeed,
<hi>Opus non habent, they had no need</hi> of his coming. <hi>The whole need not the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
S. Mat. ix. 12. <hi>but they that are sick,</hi> and they are sinners. In a word,
not only so for sinners, as before the righteous, and as it were against
the righteous, but so for sinners too; as for the worst first, for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of them above the least, the <hi>quorum primi</hi> to be the <hi>primi, the chiefest
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57113:42"/>
sinners he chiefly came for:</hi> that's the third Point of this great Doctrine of
the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Look the company he keeps, you'l say so. <hi>Publicans and Sinners</hi> (the
most <hi>emphatical</hi> of the name) there you find him, so often, that he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for it by the righteous, the <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Pharisee,</hi> S. <hi>Mark</hi> ii. 16. So for
the most enormous sinners it seems, that the righteous cannot bear it;
they are scandalized at it. One would think they were so still, that are
so much against Christs saving any body but themselves, that they will
allow him neither to save, nor come to save any body but the <hi>Elect.</hi> True
indeed he saves none but the <hi>Elect,</hi> that is, he saves none but them that
are and shall be sav'd, but he came to save even them too that shall not be
saved. <hi>Not for our sins only,</hi> says S. <hi>Iohn</hi> expresly, <hi>but for the sins of the whole
world,</hi> S. John ii. 2. The whole world, be it as large as it will, and the sins
of it, be they as great as they can, and all the sins of the world indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
be they whose they will in it; for wicked <hi>Manasses</hi> his as well as
good <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s; for <hi>Noahs</hi> Drunkenness, <hi>Lots</hi> Incest, <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery,
<hi>Solomons</hi> Idolatry, S. <hi>Peters</hi> Apostacy, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> persecuting and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
for all sorts of sins and sinners. So they be Saints say they, though
they be of the world says He, <hi>He is a propitiation</hi> for them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>would have
all men sav'd,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 4. even them that <hi>deny him.</hi> When
he has <hi>bought them,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 S. Pet. ii. 1. 'Tis neither a true nor
faithful saying, nor much worth the accepting, as many receivers as it
has, that says otherwise, that binds up his coming only to the <hi>Elect.</hi> For
if not for all, <hi>they</hi> may be out for all their brags, may be too righteous
to be in, among the sinners; among the righteous, that he says himself
he came not for. This saying that we are for, <hi>That Christ Iesus came into
the world to save sinners, is a faithful saying,</hi> worthy all acceptation, even
the chiefest the world affords, to be received by all, whilst it self rejects
none. And that it is so we are now to shew you in all particulars: That
'tis a <hi>faithful saying,</hi> first, That word has many senses, and this saying
is faithful in them all, in all those senses, in all its parts.</p>
            <p>1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>certus &amp; indubitatus,</hi> and <hi>a faithful saying,</hi> is 1. a certain and
undoubted truth. Christs coming is no less. We know it, says S. <hi>Iohn;</hi>
know that the Son of God is come, even his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
v. 20. <hi>Come,</hi> and <hi>come in the flesh,</hi> 1 S. John iv. 3. that's sure enough into
the world; and none but the <hi>spirit of Antichrist,</hi> says he, none but <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
will deny it. An <hi>Angel</hi> this <hi>day</hi> proclaimed <hi>it;</hi> a whole <hi>Choire</hi> came
this <hi>day</hi> down to celebrate it, the <hi>Wisemen</hi> a while after came from the ends
the earth to see it. Nothing but what <hi>we have seen with our eyes, which we
have looked upon, and our hands have handled,</hi> do we declare in it, says S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
1 S. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 1. The whole Land of <hi>Iudea</hi> daily saw it, millions have died
for the truth of it, and the whole world is witness of it.</p>
            <p>And 'tis certain, he came for sinners, <hi>to seek and save</hi> them, S. Luke
xix. 10. keep them from being lost, came and went for them, came into
the world, and went out of it, died to save them. <hi>Whilst we were yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
he did so, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 8. gave commission besides, that when he was gone
remission should be preach'd to sinners all the world over in his name, S.
<hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 47.</p>
            <p>This takes in the chiefest, makes that certain too, that he excludes
none; for <hi>to save</hi> the world <hi>he came,</hi> says he that lay in his bosom, and
knew his heart, to save <hi>and not to judge it.</hi> That comes but <hi>ex eventu,</hi> when
men will not be sav'd. To judge or condemn them was not his business,
unless they were such as would not be sav'd; and are there any so great
sinners as would not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57113:42"/>
2. And all this is not only true and faithful, or certain in it self, but
makes 2. all Gods former sayings to be so too. It fulfils the Promises, it
perfects the Sacrifices, it answers the Types, it compleats all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
that went before: all was shadow till this substance came; all
their good and happiness was but coming till <hi>Iesus came;</hi> all was but say
and say, meer words, till this eternal <hi>Word</hi> leapt down from Heaven. This
coming of Christ gave faith and credit to them all. Now <hi>God is</hi> fully

                  </gap>'s desire of all Nations</hi> is come into the world,
and all the Sacrifices of Bulls, and Rams, and Lambs, and Goats reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated
in this <hi>Holy Lamb;</hi> and all the Types from the beginning of the
world compleated in this great <hi>antitype to day</hi> beginning to appear, in the
<hi>end of the world,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>to put away sin,</hi> Heb. ix. 26.</p>
            <p>Ay, that's the business that makes this <hi>saying</hi> yet more <hi>faithful</hi> in the way
we are now speaking of; this putting away sin, or saving sinners. This
<hi>Lo I come</hi> puts an end and period to all Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices for
sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> xl. No more of them to be heard of when this true Sacrifice is
once brought into the world: All the old Prophesies end here too. For to
bear our iniquities, to make his soul an offering for sin, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for the transgressors, comes this righteous Servant, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Isaiah</hi> stiles him, <hi>Isa,</hi> lxiii. 10, 11, 12. And, to finish the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to make an end of sins, to make reconciliation for iniquity, comes
<hi>Daniels Messiah, Dan.</hi> ix. 24. And now he is come, they all are at an end,
their words made good, and all is true, all faithful and true. And if ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
transgressions, and sins be enough to take in all sorts of sinners (as
no doubt it is) his coming to save the chiefest of them, does but the more
fulfil the truth of all.</p>
            <p>3. But the words are <hi>faithful</hi> 3. in another sense, not the fulfilling on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our Fore-fathers Faith, but the full of ours. For to believe <hi>Christ
Iesus came into the world to save sinners,</hi> is to believe all we are obliged to
believe, either of God, or Christ, or of our selves.</p>
            <p>In the word <hi>Christ</hi> is the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> his own Person and Offices
compris'd; in <hi>Iesus</hi> and his <hi>coming</hi> both his Natures: in <hi>sinners</hi> is our own.
And in his coming into the world <hi>to save</hi> them, is the whole work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of our Redemption. Will you see them how they rise?</p>
            <p>Why? to be Christ is <hi>to be anointed,</hi> and <hi>to be anointed</hi> supposes as well
him that does anoint, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> says, was <hi>God the Father,</hi> Acts iv. 27.
the first Person, and that with which he is anointed, which the same
<hi>Apostle</hi> tells us was the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts x. 38. the third Person, as well as
him that is anointed, whom the <hi>second Psalm</hi> makes God the Son the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Person. And this anointing too implies all his Offices of <hi>King, Priest,</hi>
and <hi>Prophet:</hi> they anointed all of them, and he anointed to be them all.
Here are all the Persons in the Trinity, and therein his own, with all his
Offices besides.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Iesus</hi> is his name; that signifies a Saviour, and that speaks him
God. <hi>Ego sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, &amp; praeter me non est,</hi> Isa. xliii. 11. None can be truly so but
He. But his coming into the world, that shewed us he was man. There's
both his natures. And</p>
            <p>3. In the title of <hi>Sinners,</hi> there's our own, that tells us what we poor
things are: poor wretched sinners that want a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Lastly, his <hi>coming into the world</hi> is but a short expression of all he did and
suffered in it: and <hi>to save sinners</hi> is to take thence a <hi>Church unto himself,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57113:43"/>
to purifie and cleanse them from their sins, to raise them first from the
death of Sin here, to the life of Righteousness, to the communion of Saints,
and to raise them at last from the death of the Grave unto the life of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
yea, the communion of Saints hereafter. This is the sum of the
Christian Faith, and 'tis all summ'd up here: all the Articles of the
<hi>Creed,</hi> nay the whole <hi>Gospel</hi> it self in this one single period; <hi>Christ Iesus
came into the world to save sinners.</hi> A saying which is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
now not only <hi>faithful,</hi> but the full Faith it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faithful</hi> it is 4. in another acception. <hi>Fidelis est qui nunquam fallet,</hi> not
like those <hi>Aquae infideles,</hi> that the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> complains of, <hi>Ier.</hi> xv.
18. those faithless streams, those shallow brooks that fail and dry away
when we most need them. When all other waters fail us, this Fountain
that was set open for <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem, Ezek.</hi> xiii. 1. will run still.
When all other comforts are dried up and gone, this of Christ Jesus
coming will be coming still: When all other sayings put together will
not heal our wounds, nor refresh our weariness, nor cool our heat, nor
quench our drowth: this will do all. When all things else desert and
leave us, and nor Friends, nor Fortunes, nor Wit, nor Eloquence, nor
Strength, nor Policy will help us; this will be faithful to us, this Christ
Jesus will stand to us. No such well-spring of life in the world as he,
and nothing can come so bad to us in the world, but his coming
makes good, a world of good of.</p>
            <p>Nay, this very saying, that he <hi>came into the world to save sinners,</hi> and
the chiefest not excepted, well laid to, will stick close to us in all
distresses, disperse the terrors of our sins, defeat the devices of the
Devil to disturb and fright us: this will support us in our weaknesses,
sustain us in our faintings, raise us out of our despairs, relieve us in
our sicknesses, ease us in our pains, refresh us in our agonies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us on our death-beds, revive us when we are even dead, go with
us out of the world, and never leave us till it has brought and laid
us at his feet who came to save us; and is not willing that any <hi>should
perish,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter</hi> ii. 3, 9. No not the greatest sinner, not any, first or
last.</p>
            <p>5. Well may this saying 5. pass for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> now as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and

               </gap>, be stiled <hi>humanus,</hi> or <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus
sermo, a sweet and pleasant saying,</hi> as well as <hi>faithful.</hi> Pleasing and
joyful news it is to hear that such a person as this speaks of is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us: for all the while we were without this Christ, we were, says
St. <hi>Paul, without God,</hi> too, <hi>in the world,</hi> Ephes. ii. 12. From his coming on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is, that we can say with St. <hi>Peter, Bonum est esse hic,</hi> that <hi>'tis good being
here,</hi> that the world is worth the staying in. It were not without him;
no company worth being with till he came, no pleasure in it till he brought
it with him. For this it is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> makes no mistake; the saying may
be said pleasant without an error.</p>
            <p>Indeed what more pleasant, if to save sinners be his coming? liberty,
and health, and life, and salvation are pleasing news; liberty to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives,
health to the Sick, life to the Dying, salvation to the lost and
perishing; and to save sinners is to give all of them to them all. Such a
saying to them must needs please them all.</p>
            <p>And upon this we must needs allow it lastly to be <hi>faithful</hi> in another
sense: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>fide dignus,</hi> a saying worthy of our faith, worth our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.
All true, and certain, and profitable, nay, and pleasing sayings
are not so. No matter whether some of them believed or no. This is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57113:43"/>
truth of so great concernment, and so truly all, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself,
that <hi>great Doctor of the world,</hi> is content, nay <hi>determin'd to know nothing</hi> else,
nothing <hi>but Iesus Christ, and him Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 2. <hi>Him crucified</hi> is <hi>him
come into the world</hi> to <hi>save sinners:</hi> for by his Cross he sav'd them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Cradle the foot of it was rear'd; and from his coming into a cross
and peevish world, he began to be crucified and bear it. All other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
are not worth the knowing, all other truths not worth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving:
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is but an <hi>A B C</hi> learning to this knowledge.
All the <hi>Iewish Kabala,</hi> all the wise sentences of the wisest <hi>Rabbies,</hi>
all the wisdom of the Heathen world, of all the world: all that is
without Christ Jesus in it, but meer fables, endless genealogies, to
no end or purpose all of them but to fill the head with empty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the heart with vexation, and the tongue with strife: all
meer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>Very dross and dung in respect of the knowledge
of Christ Iesus coming into the world to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet after all this, were there not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to them all; were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not the chiefest sinners in, or might not the chiefest of them
make a particular application of it to himself; were Christs coming
only to a few, and all the rest excluded by some inevitable decree,
there would be but a starv'd kind of comfort in it at the best: nor
could it well command our faith, seeing it might so command us to
believe a lye, and cheat our selves. To make the saying either worth
the saying or the believing, it must be applicable to the chiefest sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and so 'tis here; and the greatest sinner among us may lay hold
upon it.</p>
            <p>And now it being a saying so <hi>faithful</hi> and true in it self, faithful both
to our Fathers and to us, the fulfilling of their Faith, and the ground
of ours, and the sum of it too; a saying that will never fail us in
any exigence and distress, but bear up our spirits at every turn, and
stick firm to us upon all occasions: a saying so pleasing, so worthy of
our Faith, and so close to every one of us: 'tis <hi>worthy</hi> sure lastly <hi>of all
acceptation,</hi>
all the best entertainment we can give it.</p>
            <p>'Tis worthy of it 1. for the Person it brings to us: one that is <hi>fairer
then the children of men,</hi> Psal. xlv. worth entertaining.</p>
            <p>Worthy 2. for the way it brings him to us, in an humble and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
way (such was his coming) he comes into the world like other men,
that we may the easier approach him, and so the more readily entertain
him.</p>
            <p>Worthy 3. for the good things it tells us he brings with him, for
the salvation he comes with to us: a thing worth accepting.</p>
            <p>Worthy 4. for the persons it brings all this good to, or for the
extent and fulness of that goodness, that 'tis to sinners, sinners inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
and at large, sinners of all sizes, all degrees and latitudes; this
certainly worthy all acceptation, by all to be accepted, for all interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in it.</p>
            <p>And 5. to be accepted too with all acceptance, all the best ways
we can imagine, with soul and body, with hand and heart, with all the
expressions of love, and reverence, and joy, and thankfulness; love of
his Beauty, reverence to his Humility, joy in his Salvation, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
for the freeness and fulness of it. If a friend come but a long
Journey to us, we give him all the welcome we can make, and think
nothing enough. This friend came to us <hi>as far as Heaven is from us,
farther then all the corners of the earth.</hi> If a great person come to visit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57113:44"/>
us, we meet him with all the respect and reverence we can contrive:
none too much. This is the greatest person can come to us. If there come
one to save to when we are now ready to perish, how do our hearts
leap, and our spirits dance for joy? how glad are we? nothing can be
more. Here's one comes to do it, and to do it to the utmost; that none
or nothing of us may be lost: what can we now do to him again, who
is, and does all this for us? All we can do is all too little, all expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
too low to receive him with, and this saying that thus assures him
to us, worthy to be written in tables of Gold, with pens of Diamonds,
to be written however on all our hearts, never to be raz'd out, nor ever
to be brought forth but with devotion and reverence, with exultation
and joy.</p>
            <p>And now I am fallen upon my second general, the use we are to make
of this faithful saying, and a four-fold use it will be, to believe; To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
to apply, to proclaim it: I add, to make this the day to begin it
in.</p>
            <p>I: <hi>This is a faithful saying;</hi> we are first therefore to believe it: such it
is <hi>to them that believe,</hi> to others not: St. <hi>Paul</hi> I confess says, only to them
<hi>especially, cap.</hi> iv. 10. But that especially is onely too; for Christ is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
the Saviour of none else. The Saviour truly of all, come down
for all, set up for all; yet not any sav'd by him but Believers for all that.
Nor all they neither, only such as are <hi>careful to maintain good works,</hi> Tit.
iii. 8. This saying not faithful but to Believers; nor any Believers
<hi>faithful,</hi> but such as shew it by good works. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> limits the
words, <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi> in those two last cited places, that we
may not cheat our selves out of the Text, or the good things in it.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we believe not, yet he <hi>abideth faithful</hi> in himself, he and all
his sayings too; that's a <hi>faithful saying</hi> too, 2 Tim. iii. 11. 13. But, nor
he, nor any of his sayings faithful to us, whatever in themselves, if we
be not faithful and believing, if we distrust either the beginning or
end of his coming to us, or by our sins, or foolish scruples, or despairs,
thrust our selves out of our interests in any of them. For the second Use
we are to make of this saying is, not only to believe it but to accept
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Now to accept it, is very highly to prize and value it: and
well we may, 'tis worthy of it. Prize it we then as we do Jewels, as
that Merchant in the <hi>Gospel</hi> did the <hi>Pearl,</hi> sell all to buy it: there's none
to it. Lay it up safe, as we do treasures, that neither Moth corrupt
nor Thief steal it from us, nor Sin nor Satan rob us of it: there's no
treasure like it. Keep it as we do the Records and Tenures of our Estates,
part with it upon no score. Our state in heaven depends upon it; 'Tis
our title to it. Lord, where were we without this assurance to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
where all our hopes if this were lost? whereto all our treasures
if this were gone? We had need prize and value it, and keep it sure:
and this is to accept it.</p>
            <p>And yet to give it all acceptation is somewhat more. To accept it
as <hi>Tertullus</hi> tells <hi>Felix</hi> they did his noble deeds, <hi>Acts</hi> xxiv. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>always, and every where, and with all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do we it then 1. not now and then, not to day only, or one day or
two, but every day, every day we rise, every opportunity that presents
it self, on every occasion that appears; that's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Do we it again 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in all places,</hi> engrave it upon our doors,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57113:44"/>
carve it upon our posts, write it upon our hands, profess it every where
we come; not in our Closets and our Chambers only, but in the Church,
in the High-Priests Palace, in <hi>Pilates</hi> Hall, at the Pillar, and at the Cross,
no where asham'd or afraid to own it.</p>
            <p>Do it 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>with all thankfulness.</hi> And how is that? by
some good deeds sure as well as words. Present we him ever and anon
with some good thing or other: now a basket of good Fruits (so St.
<hi>Paul</hi> sometimes stiles good works:) Now a bottle of good Wine, the
Wine of devout and pious tears: Now with a present of Gold or Silver
to adorn his House or his Attendants: Now with a garment to clothe
his naked members: Now with a dish to feed his poor and hungry Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
Now with this gift, now with another. This is the way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
among men, that they call good acceptance among themselves.
These and all the ways we can, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (for so some <hi>Greek Copies</hi> read for
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) will take all in. But above all <hi>our souls and bodies a living Sacrifice</hi>
will be the most acceptable present we can make him. <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. and
indeed the fittest for him that came to save them.</p>
            <p>This will do well yet 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>quorum ego primus,</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi>
applying the only bad word in the <hi>Text</hi> with an <hi>emphasis</hi> to himself:
his reckoning himself the <hi>chief</hi> of sinners shews us the best way to apply
this <hi>faithful saying</hi> to our selves, the confessing our selves no ordinary
sinners. The third Use of the Doctrine of the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thou, O blessed <hi>Apostle,</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> of sinners! What then (O <hi>Lord</hi>)
are we? <hi>Primo primi, the chief of chiefs</hi> is a stile too little. And yet,
can either He or We now say it, and say truth? if not, the lye may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
peradventure to Gods Glory, but it will work to our own damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Best look to that.</p>
            <p>'Tis an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> most think; yet 'tis no handsom hyperbolizing with
God, methinks. We may find out a way, I doubt not, so to say it, as
yet to say nothing but our own bosom thoughts.</p>
            <p>Three things observ'd, we may both say and think we are any of us
the <hi>chief</hi> of sinners. 1. Look we upon our own sins with the severest
eye, with all the aggravations of them we can imagine. Look we 2.
upon other mens with the most favourable one, with all the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
we can invent. And then 3. compare we them <hi>so</hi> together, and
the work is done: we may really suppose our selves of all men the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sinners.</p>
            <p>To begin with our own sins, and to aggravate them to purpose, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we them ever in their foulest colours, how base and wretched in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
how dishonourable to God, how prejudicial to our Brother, how
scandalous to our Religion, and how destructive to our selves. Consider
we next upon what poor grounds they were committed, upon what slight
temptations, to what silly ends, with what perfect knowledge, with
what full deliberation, with what impudent presumption, how wilfully
against all good motions, how resolutely against all assistances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to the contrary, how desperately against all dangers threatned
from them; and how in gratefully to God and Christ. In a word, what
a long train of mischiefs they probably draw after them, how many we
involve commonly either in the guilt, or in the punishment, or in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and thereby lay as it were a seed of wickedness for ever, and so
sin even in our worms and dust. Thus we are to look upon our own trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</p>
            <p>But 2. When we look upon other mens, we must do that but curso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57113:45"/>
and glancing, think they are never so bad as they are represented,
not so foul by much as they appear at first; that their intentions perhaps
were good, or that it falls out far otherwise than they intended; that
what was done was upon mistake or error; that it was but a slip, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or surreption; that they have not the light, the strength, the grace,
the power that God gives us; that they had not the means or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to shun those sins; that they were overpowered by strong temptations,
or were meerly overtaken, or plainly forced to it and could not help it,
or had not the opportunity to do better; that they did it ignorantly,
meant no hurt at all, and possibly none may come of it; that what e're
it be they are heartily sorry for it; that however they have a thousand
vertues and good things in them to overpoise the evils they have done.
These are the ways we are to consider the sins of other men.</p>
            <p>And then 3. if after this we compare our sins and theirs together, ours
under all the circumstances of aggravation, with theirs under all extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
considerations, our greatest sins with their little ones, our presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
with their infirmities, our vices with their vertues, our bad or sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
intentions with their good and fair professions, our corrupt natures
with their good dispositions, our selves as we are by nature and deprest
by sin with them as exalted by any grace and vertue; it will be no marvel,
no way strange if we think our selves the greatest sinners.</p>
            <p>And indeed we have no reason to do other: we know only our own
hearts, those we are sure are wicked; but we cannot say so of other
mens, can at the best but suppose theirs; of which in charity we ought
always to think the best; ever at least better than our own, especially,
when even little and ordinary sins in some, may be often worse than cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sins in others, according to the difference of light and grace, and the
variety of circumstances that may attend them. All which considered,
if we profess our selves the worst, we shall now need no <hi>hyperbole</hi> to make
it good; nor fear it will be any whit worse for us though it be true. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> it seems held it the surest course thus by the greatest and humblest
confession of his own unworthiness to plead his interest in this <hi>faithful say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
in <hi>Christ Iesus coming into the world to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now sure 4. we may proclaim it, must do so too. 'Tis not a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be kept secret, no mysterious <hi>Cabala</hi> not to be revealed, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only to a few. This <hi>thing,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, was not done in a corner.</hi> Into
the world he came that came to save us. And, to the world and through
the world let it therefore be proclaimed for ever. <hi>'Tis good,</hi> says the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
to old <hi>Tobit to keep close the secret of a King, but 'tis honourable to reveal the
works of God,</hi> Tob. xii. 11.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>day</hi> is a good day to do it in. A <hi>day</hi> wherein the <hi>Lepers</hi> said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> vii. 9. <hi>If we hold our peace some mischief will
come upon us.</hi> I am sure there was enough upon us, when men upon this day
held their peace. Well, tell we now our news as they did theirs, to the
Court, to the City, to the Country, to the world. The <hi>Church</hi> bids us do
do so to <hi>day.</hi> Let the Preacher preach it, let the people tell it, let the
singers begin it, and go before, and the Minstrels and Musick follow and
answer it to <hi>day,</hi> that <hi>Christ Iesus is come into the world to save sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to day we must do more then tell it. We are to believe, to accept,
to apply it too. We have to day the best opportunity to do all, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
our faith, and to advance it, to give a proof of our acceptance of
Christs saving mercies, and the sense of our own sins and miseries.</p>
            <p>Yonder under the <hi>blessed Elements</hi> we shall meet our <hi>Saviour</hi> coming to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57113:45"/>
us. Shall I tell you how to accept that favour, how receive and entertain
him? why! when great Personages are coming to us, we make clean the
House, we trick up the Rooms, we set every thing in order, we set forth
our choicest Furniture, put on our best Apparel, we look out ever and
anon to see if they be coming, and when they are, we go out to meet
them, we make our addresses with all humble and lowly reverence, we
welcome them with the best words we have, we present them with some
lovely present, and take care that nothing unseemly be done before them
whilst they stay.</p>
            <p>Let us do so to him <hi>that came into the world</hi> to <hi>day.</hi> Cleanse we our hearts,
and purifie our hands, dress up all the rooms, all the powers and faculties
of our souls and bodies with graces and vertues, set our affections and
passions all in rule and order, put on the garments of righteousness, and
true holiness; let us long, and thirst, and hunger after him, let us go out
to meet him, accost him with reverence, welcome him with Prayers and
Praises, present him with holy vows and resolutions, and so every way
demean our selves with that humility and devotion, that care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
over all our ways and steps, that nothing appear in us distasteful or
offensive to him now he is come: and say we to him in the words of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
to his <hi>Mother, Whence is this to me that my Lord himself is come unto me,
to me</hi> a sinner, to me the <hi>chief</hi> of sinners!</p>
            <p>Thus if we will entertain him when he comes, thus if we will receive
him now he is coming towards us, he will not only come unto us, but tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with us till he take us with him to himself; make us his world to be in
till he remove us into a better; where the soul that humbly here confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it self the chief of sinners, shall be sav'd and set among the chiefest
Saints, when he shall come again in glory.</p>

this days new-born King, as I ought to speak, as
they ought to be spoken. But, <hi>Non mihi si centum lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae

many tongues,</hi> and they the tongues of Angels too, I
could not yet sufficiently set forth the Beauty of this Fair one, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of this King, the grace of his Person, or the comfort of his <hi>Day,</hi>
this <hi>day</hi> wherein he came to be first reckoned among the <hi>children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet something must be said both for the days sake, and the persons.
'Tis a day of good tidings, so the Angel tells us, and then we must not
hold our peace; the very Lepers that are to hold their hands upon their
mouths cannot hold them at this. Say <hi>we do not well,</hi> if we do, <hi>some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
will come upon us,</hi> 2 Kings vii. 9. And lips so full of grace will require
the return of the lips at least. We can do little if we cannot speak again
when we are spoken to, when God speaks to us, as the Apostle tells us,
by his Son; if we will not render a word in answer to this eternal word,
speak of the beauty, and grace, and blessing that we see in him, and find
by him. God hath blessed him for ever, blessed us to day, will bless us
too, hath already blessed us in blessing him, will bless us more and more
in him, too day and for ever: good reason then, we bless him to day,
who from this day began to bless us for ever.</p>
            <p>All this while you understand me who I mean, who is so <hi>fair,</hi> so <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
so <hi>blessed.</hi> The question is, whether the <hi>Psalmist</hi> means the same. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they give it out for an <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or Marriage-Song at <hi>Solomons</hi>
Espousals with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter. And in such Songs the praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57113:47"/>
of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> and the <hi>Bride,</hi> and good wishes to them are
the usual subjects. It is so here; <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Bride commended, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
well-wisht to in it: but yet <hi>behold a greater than Solomon is here,</hi> a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
graciouser, blesseder than he: Christ married to his Church, or rather
the Divinity contracted to the Humanity, Christ made the <hi>fairest</hi> of the
<hi>children of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> as well as <hi>prae,</hi> more gracious words out of his mouth
than ever out of <hi>Solomons,</hi> more truly ever blessed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, than he, the
Song sung in a fuller key, the words more punctually appliable, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
more exactly fulfilled in him than in <hi>Solomon</hi> himself. The <hi>Fathers</hi>
have so expounded it before us, the <hi>Church</hi> has added authority to it by
the choice of the <hi>Psalms</hi> for a part of the Office of the <hi>Day:</hi> nay, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
has so applied it, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 8, 9. So I am no ways singular: Indeed I love not
to be in such points as these, I tread the antient track; though I confess
I think I can never take occasions enough, nor I nor any else to speak of
Christ, of his beauty, and grace, and blessedness, either to <hi>day</hi> or any day,
though every day whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And though I must say with St. <hi>Hilary, Filium mens mea veretur attingere,
&amp; trepidat omnis sermo se prodere.</hi> I can neither think without a kind of fear,
nor speak without a kind of trembling, of a person of that glory; yet
because 'tis our eternal <hi>Solomons,</hi> the <hi>Words wedding-day,</hi> and the <hi>Text</hi> part
of the <hi>Wedding-Song;</hi> and in such days and Songs the very children, all
comers bear a part; and if they did not, the stones would do it, (indeed
the stones and walls should this day all ring of it) and if they, I must
not be the only sensless stone to hold my peace. Indeed here is a beauty
would make any man an Oratour: lips that would make the dumb man
eloquent, grace would make the most ungratious full of good words,
and holy language, were they well conceived and considered.</p>
            <p>That so they may, the words are now to be considered as a part of an
<hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or <hi>Marriage-Song,</hi> wherein Christ our eternal <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is
set forth in all his lustre. Now in a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> the chief things we look
at are good parts, and a good estate. Our <hi>Bridegroom</hi> here has both. Fair
fac'd, and fair spoken, full of grace and beauty for his parts, and a fair
estate he has too, God be thanked for it; a blessed lot, a goodly heritage
in a fair ground, blessedness it self enstated upon him, and that for ever;
<hi>both</hi> far above the parts and portions of the children of men, the Sons
parts above the parts of the children of men, and the Fathers blessing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the blessings of the fathers of men; and neither the one nor the
other to be conceal'd, but even spoken and sung of while you will. By
us as well as <hi>David,</hi> as loud too, and in as high a key. Run this division
upon it if you please, and take these parts, to sing of in their order.</p>

at, even to the blessing of God again: for so the Hebrew Writers

supply the sense, with a <hi>dico ego. Therefore say I,</hi> and so say we, or
are to say so, <hi>God hath blessed thee for ever. Blessed be God the Father of
our Lord Iesus Christ, and blessed be our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> for all this
grace, for all this blessing. If our Spouse so fair, then we sure should
be faithful: if his lips so full of grace, our lips as full of thanks: if
he blessed of God, we again bless God and him, for so great a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
so great blessings, so continually descending upon us; so
lasting, so everlasting, never sufficiently answered but by all our
ways of blessing; and so blessing him always, all our days, whilst

               </gap> attractive to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When I shall be lift up, shall draw all men to me,</hi> says he himself, S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
xii. 32. That lifting up was upon the Cross, and if that be so attractive,
if he be so powerful in his humiliation, when his face is clouded with
darkness, his eyes with sadness, his heart with sorrow, when his body is
so mangled with wounds, deform'd with stripes, besmear'd with blood,
and sweat, and dust, that <hi>will draw all men to him;</hi> how infinitely prevalent
then must he needs be when we see him in his excellence, smooth, and
even and entire in all the parts of his soul and body. For in both, fair he
is, <hi>formosus,</hi> fair, <hi>formosus prae,</hi> very fair, <hi>formosus prae filiis,</hi> fairer then the
fairest and sweetest child, in whom commonly is the sweetest beauty;
<hi>prae filiis hominum, than the children of men,</hi> when they come to their full
strength and manly beauty. By these degrees we shall arrive to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his beauty; fair he is, very fair, fairer than the sweetest, fairer
than the perfectest beauty of the sons of men, so in both his body and his
soul.</p>
            <p>In his Body first. And fair and comely sure must that Body be which
was immediately and miraculously fram'd by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> pure flesh and
blood that was stirred together by that pure Spirit, out of the purest
Blood and Spirits of the purest <hi>Virgin</hi> of the world. The shadows of that
face must needs be beautiful that were drawn by the very finger and shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> those eyes must needs have <hi>quid sidereum,</hi> as
St. <hi>Ierome, some star-like splendor</hi> in them, which were so immediately of
the heavenly making. The whole frame of that body must needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
which was made on purpose by God himself for the supreme excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to dwell in, to reside in, to be united to, so united by the union
<hi>hypostatical.</hi> A body without sin must needs be purely fair, a body without
concupiscence must needs be sweet, without defect must needs be lovely,
without vacuity must needs be complete, without superfluity must needs
be so far handsom, without inordination must needs be perfect, without
death must needs be firm, without dust must needs be singular, without
corruption must needs be curious and delicate, without any of them must
needs be excellent. And all these were Christs body, without sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
concupisence, without defect, without vacuity, without superfluity,
without inordination, death and dust and corruption could not get the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57113:48"/>
least dominion over it; <hi>thou shalt not suffer my flesh to see corruption,</hi> saies
the <hi>Psalm,</hi> he did not suffer it to see it saies the Gospel, rais'd incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
it quickly was, went down into the grave but staid not there,
came not into the dust at all, into any corruption at all; had none all
the while it was upon the earth, had none under it.</p>
            <p>Fair he was in his conception, conceived in purity, and a fair <hi>Angel</hi>
brought the news. Fair (2.) in his Nativity, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the word in the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,
tempestivus, in time,</hi> that is, all things are beautiful in their time,
<hi>Eccl.</hi> v. 11. <hi>And in the fulness of time</hi> it was that he was born, and a fair
star pointed to him. Fair (3.) in his childhood, he grew up in grace <hi>and
favour.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 52. The Doctors were much taken with him. (4.) Fair
in his manhood; had he not been so, says S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> had there not been
something admirable in his countenance and presence, some heavenly
beauty, <hi>Nunque secuturi essent Apostoli,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Apostles and the whole world,</hi>
(as the Pharisees themselves confess) <hi>would not so suddenly have gone after
him.</hi> Fair (5.) in his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> white as the light, or as the snow, his
face glittering as the Sun, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvii. 2. even to the ravishing the very
soul of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>he knew not what he said,</hi> could let his eyes dwell upon
taht face for ever, and never come down the Mount again. (6.) Fair in his
Passion. <hi>Nihil indecorum, no uncomeliness,</hi> in his nakedness; his very wounds,
and the bloody prints of the whips and scourges drew an <hi>ecce</hi> from the
mouth of <hi>Pilate, Behold the man,</hi> the sweetness of his countenance and
carriage in the midst of filth and spittle, whips and buffets; his very
comeliness upon the Cross, and his giving up the <hi>Ghost,</hi> made the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi>
cry out he <hi>was the Son of God;</hi> there appeared so sweet a Majesty, so
heavenly a lustre in him through that very darkness that encompass'd
him. (7.) Fair in his Resurrection; so subtile a beauty, that mortal eyes,
even the eyes of his own Disciples, were not able to see or apprehend it,
but when he veil'd it for them. (8.) Fair in his Ascension, made his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
stand gazing after him so long (as if they never could look long
enough upon him) till an <hi>Angel</hi> is sent from Heaven to rebuke them, to
look home, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 11.</p>
            <p>If you ask <hi>Eusebius, Evagrius, Nicephorus, Damascen,</hi> and some others,
how fair he was, they will tell you so fair, that the Painter sent from
<hi>Agbarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa</hi> to draw his Picture, could not look so stedfastly
upon him as to do it, for the rays that darted from his face; and though
the Scripture mention no such thing, 'tis no greater wonder to believe
then what we read of <hi>Moses</hi> his face, which shone so glorious that the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> could not behold it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 7. <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Roman
President his Epistle to the Emperour <hi>Antonius,</hi> describes him of very
comely colour, shape, and figure; and so do others. Not such a beauty
yet as that which darts from it wanton rays, or warms the blood, or
stirs the spirits to vain desires, or secular respects and motions; but a
sweetness without sensual daintiness, a lustre without lightness, a modest
look without dejectedness, a grave countenance without severity, a fair
face without fancy, eyes sparkling only heavenly flames, cheeks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
holy modesty, lips distilling celestial sweetness, beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its faults, figure, and proportion, and all such as was most answerable
and advantageous to the work he came about, every way fitted to the
most perfect operations of the reasonable and immortal soul; the most
beautiful then sure when beauty is nothing else but an exact order and
proportion of things in relation to their nature and end, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and to each other.</p>

Take his description from the Spouses own mouth, <hi>Cant.</hi> v. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.
<hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. His head is as
the most fine gold, his locks are bushy</hi> (or curled) <hi>and black as a Raven. His eyes
are as the eyes of Doves, by the rivers of water, washed with water and fitly set,</hi>
[that is, set in fulness, fitly placed, and as a precious stone in the soil of
a Ring.] <hi>His cheeks are as a bed of Spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like Lillies
dropping sweet smelling Myrrhe: his hands are as gold Rings set with Beryl:
his belly as bright Ivory over-laid with Saphyrs. His legs are as pillars of Marble,
set upon sockets of fine Gold. His countenance like Lebanon, excellent as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars.
His mouth is most sweet, yea he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and
this is my friend, O daughters of Ierusalem.</hi> This is our beloved too. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
indeed has poetically express'd it. Yet something else there is in it
besides a poetick phrase. Beautiful he thus supposes he is to be, who was
to be this Spouse, have the beauty of all beautiful things in the world
conferr'd upon him; at least to have the finest and subtilest part of all
worldly beauties, those imperceptible, yet powerful species of them
which make them really amiable and attractive; a head, and locks, and
eyes, and hands, and feet, quantity, colour, and proportion, such as dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them not only a resemblance, but the very spirit of heavenly
beauty, innocence, purity, strength, and vigour. Poets when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
beauty, call it divine and heavenly; this of his it was truly so, a
kind of sensible Divinity through all his parts.</p>
            <p>Shall I give you his colour to make up the beauty? He was white,
pure white in his Nativity, ruddy in his Passion, bright and glistering
in his life, black in his death, Azure-vein'd in his Resurrection. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
now to see the Spouse sit <hi>down under his shadow with great delight,</hi> Cant.
ii. 3. we sure our selves now can do less, and yet this is but the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of his beauty. The true beauty is the souls, the beauty of the soul,
the very soul of beauty; the beauty of the body, but the body, nay the
carcase of it. And this of the souls he had (2.) in its prime perfection.</p>
            <p>2. Now beauty consists in three particulars; the perfection of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments,
the due proportion of them each to other, and the excellency
and purity of the colour. They are all compleat in the soul of Christ.
The lineaments of the soul are its faculties and powers, the proportion
of them is the due subordination of them to God and one another. The
colours are the vertues and graces that are in them.</p>
            <p>His powers and faculties would not but be compleat, which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of old <hi>Adam</hi> in them. His understanding without ignorance, he
knew all, the very hearts of all, thoughts as they rose, what they thought
within themselves, S. <hi>Luke</hi> v. 22. thoughts before they rose, what the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> with other would have done to him, had he committed himself
unto them. Now <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> would have repented had they had the
mercy allowed to <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> x. 13. His will without
wilfulness or weakness, his passions without infirmity or extravagance,
his inferiour powers without defect or maim, his understanding clear, his
will holy, his passions sweet, all his powers vigorous. Hear the Wise man
describe him under the name of Wisdom, <hi>Wisd.</hi> xvii. 22, 23, &amp;c. <hi>In her,</hi>
that is in him, who is the Wisdom of the Father, <hi>is an understanding Spirit,
holy, one onely, manifold, subtile, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, nor subject to hurt,
loving the thing that is good, quick, which cannot be letted, ready to do good, kind
to man, stedfast, sure, free from care, having all power, overseeing all things,
and going through all understanding, pure, and most subtile spirits,</hi> and ver. 25, 26.

light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The powers of his soul being thus pure, vigorous, and unspotted, they
cannot (2.) but be in order; the will following his understanding, the
passions subordinate to them both, all the inferiour powers obedient and
ready at command and pleasure. He had no sooner exprest a kind of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in his sensitive powers at the approach of those strange horrors of
his death and sufferings, but presently comes out, <hi>Non mea, sed tua, Not
my will but thine,</hi> all in a moment, at peace and in tranquillity. No rash or
idle word, no unseemly passage, no sowre look, nor gesture or expression
unsuitable to his Divinity throughout his life: the very Devils to
their own confusion cannot but confess it, <hi>We know thee, who thou art,
the Holy One of God,</hi> S. Mark i. 24.</p>
            <p>To this add those heavenly colours and glances of grace, and vertues,
and you have his soul compleatly beautiful: Meekness, and Innocence,
and Patience, and Obedience even to the death; Mercy, and Goodness,
and Piety, and what else is truly called by the name of good, are all in
him: insomuch that the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us the very <hi>fulness of the Godhead
dwells in him bodily,</hi> Col. ii. 9. No Divine Grace or Vertue wanting in
him. In him are all the <hi>treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</hi> ver. 3. In him
all sanctity and holiness, not so much as the least <hi>guile in his mouth,</hi> 1 S. Pet.
ii. 22. So holy, that he is <hi>made holiness and sanctification unto us,</hi> 1 Cor. i.
30. <hi>Sancti quasi sanguine uncti, We Saints and holy become hallowed by the sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his blood.</hi> In him lastly is all the power and vertue, <hi>omnis virtus,</hi>
that is <hi>omnis potestas, all the power in heaven and earth</hi> fully given to him,
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 18.</p>
            <p>So that now we shall need to say little of the other particular of this
first general point of Christs perfect beauty, that he is not only <hi>Formosus,</hi>
but <hi>Formosus prae,</hi> not only <hi>fair,</hi> but <hi>very fair:</hi> for where there is so much
as you have heard, exceeding and excellent it must needs be. Where the
body is compleat in all its parts, the soul exact in all its powers, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
without any ill inclination natural or habitual, the soul without the
least stain of thought, or glance of irregularity, nothing to sully the soul
or body, all wisdom, and holiness, and power, and vertue: We can say
no less of him then the <hi>Psalmist</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem, Very excellent things are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of thee thou City of God,</hi> thou miraculous habitation of the Almighty,
thou very dwelling not of God only, but the very Godhead too.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I need to say much of the third, the <hi>prae filiis,</hi> that his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is more sweet and innocent then the new-born babes. Alas the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
fairest child comes sullied into the world with <hi>Adams</hi> guilt. Some of
that dust that God cast upon him when he told him, <hi>Dust he was, and into
dust he should return,</hi> sticks so upon the face and body, the very soul and
spirit too of the prettiest infant, that it is nothing to this days child.
<hi>In omnibus sine peccato,</hi> Heb. iv. 15. <hi>In all without sin,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> the
very temptations he suffered were not from the sinfulness of his nature,
any original concupiscence; <hi>non novit,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle</hi> in another place,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 21. he knew it not, <hi>knew no sin</hi> at all: in this he might use St.
<hi>Peters</hi> phrase, <hi>Man I know not what thou meanest,</hi> I know not what this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of man so much as means. <hi>Prae filiis,</hi> he is as much purer then the
child we call innocent, as much before it in purity and innocence, as he is
in time and being. Nay yet again, though we see the sweetest beauty
is commonly that of children whilst they are so, yet even that beauty
must needs have some kind of stain, or mole, or some insensible kind of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57113:49"/>
defect, though we know not what, nor how to term it, which was not in
him. The very natural inordination of our powers must needs give a kind
of dull shadow to our exactest beauty, and silently speak the inward
fault by some outward defect, though we are too dull, being of the same
mold, to apprehend it; whilst there could be no such darkness in the face
of Christ, no Genius in it which was not perfectly attractive, and exactly
fitted to its place and office.</p>
            <p>This perhaps may seem a subtlety to our duller apprehensions; but 'tis
plain that I shall tell you, though but briefly in the fourth particular, that
he is <hi>fairer then the children of men,</hi> then men come to their perfect beauty.
Alas! alas! before that time long, sin had so sullied them, that we may
read dark lines in all their faces: the <hi>Physicgnomist</hi> will tell you all their
faults; our sins and deformities are by that time written in our foreheads,
engraven in our hands; our beauty is almost clean lost into corruption.
Could we see as Angels do, those eyes that seem to sparkle flames, would
look terrible as the fires of Hell. Those cheeks that seem beauteous in
their blushes, would be seen to have no other than the colour of our sins:
those lips which we cry up for sweetness, would stink in our conceit with
rottenness: the teeth that look white as Ivory, we should behold black
with calumny and slander as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot of the foulest Chimneys: the fair
curled locks, would look like snakes, the young spawn of the great red
Dragon: the hands that look so white and delicate, would appear filthy,
bloody, and unclean. We, poor we, are but blind moles and bats. We see
nothing. We know not what is beautiful, what is lovely. If we did,
these earthly beauties would seem what I have said them, nay worse;
Christ only would be beautiful, no body but Christs body, no body but
that wherein Christ dwells, in whose eyes, and cheeks, and lips, and head,
and hands, you might see Christs Beauty, Meekness, Love, Charity,
Goodness, Justice, Mercy, Innocence, Piety, with the rest of those lines
of beauty which were in him. But whatever we would then say of the
bodies, we can say no other even now of the souls of men, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t none are
fair, but that are well colour'd and proportion'd to those heavenly lines,
and in this point freely acknowledge the pre-eminence of Christ, the
prerogative of this Spouse. And well may we say of him with the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi>
that he is <hi>fairer then the children of men,</hi> whom daily sins deform and
render ugly, when the <hi>Apostle</hi> sets him before the <hi>Sons</hi> of God, the <hi>Angels,</hi>
the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and <hi>Seraphins,</hi> which you will of them; <hi>for to which of them,</hi>
says he, <hi>has he said at any time; Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi>
Heb. i. 5. begotten thee after mine own image, the very express image
of my person, the <hi>brightness of my glory,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Fairer then the children of
men,</hi> no doubt, who is as fair and bright as God, who is higher then all
the Sons of men, all the people by the head, by the Godhead which is
in him. Which being in him, there needs no more to say, but that 'tis
of necessity he must be the fairest of the Sons of men, through whose
eyes, and face, and hands, and whole body, the rays of the Divine Beauty
are continually darting from within. Well may we now also expect some
of it at his lips, and so we find it here in the very next words, very fully
issuing there, <hi>Full of grace are thy lips,</hi> that's the second general of the <hi>Text,
Gratia diffusa in labiis, Grace in the lips</hi> as well as beauty in the forehead, in
face or other parts of soul and body.</p>
            <p>Three degrees we observe in the words to make up this fulness, <hi>Gratia
est, gratia diffusa, diffusa in labiis,</hi> that Grace there is in him as well as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
(2.) Grace abundant, and in full measure. And (3.) so abundant,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57113:50"/>
and so full, that it falls into the lips, comes out full spout there, there
above all it issues, and manifests, and appears.</p>
            <p>Grace first, that's good with beauty, all beauty but deform'd without
is; a good hint to you by the way, to get those souls fill'd with grace,
whose bodies God has made fine with beauty. If God has given thee beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
beg of him that he would also give thee grace, beautifie thy soul as well
as body; and strive thou also what thou canst possibly thy self to adorn
thy beauty with grace and goodness; or if thou hast little or no beauty
in thy body, make amends for it by the beauty and sweetness of thy
soul: though thy face be not fair, thy lips may be gracious, thou mayest
be full of good words and works, and thou mayest do God more service
with the grace of thy lips, than with the beauty of thy fairest face that
so amazes and ravishes worldly lovers.</p>
            <p>Now a threefold grace there is in Christ. And (1.) <hi>The grace of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
or personal grace wherewith his own person was indued, so far as to
be free from all kind of sin. The grace of the Head, whereby he disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his graces into all his Members, as the Head of the Church into the
Body, into the souls of Christians and Believers. And then the grace of
Union, that ineffable grace whereby the Godhead is united to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
By the first, he himself is holy, by the second he makes us so. By
the third he wrought all the means to do it. For the first, let us reverence
his person. For the second, let us embrace him, and be rul'd by him. For
the third, let us perpetually admire and adore him.</p>
            <p>'Tis ready to conceive now that he was full indeed, beyond measure
full; the spirit not given to him by measure, so he says himself, S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
iii. 34. and his witness is true, though he bear witness of himself, St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> viii. 14. anointed with it above his fellows, as it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
words repeated and applied expresly to him by St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> i. 9. So full
that he pours out upon us, pours in all we have. We are but empty ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
till he pour into us; without grace, or any good, till he pour it in,
<hi>diffusa in,</hi> as well as <hi>effusa ex,</hi> it is spread abroad in our hearts, says the
<hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> v. 5. as well as spread upon his lips.</p>
            <p>Yet is our fulness but the fulness of earthy pitchers, but five
or six firkins a piece at most when they are filled to the brim: His
fulness the fulness of the fountain, that pours it self over all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Vallies, and yet empties not it self, runs still as fresh as ever;
only holds when there are no more vessels, or the vessels there will hold
no more. His fulness minds us either of our emptiness or shallowness;
and if grace, we have either in our hearts or lips, we will deplore it: fill
our eyes with tears, and our lips with prayers, that he may fill our hearts
with grace, make us some way partakers of his fulness.</p>
            <p>And that we need not doubt of, now 'tis gotten into his lips. They
are the conduits of his grace, they convey it to us. Three several gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we gather from his lips.</p>
            <p>1. His gracious Miracles; by his bare word he heal'd the Lame, and
cur'd the Blind, and restor'd the Sick, and cleans'd the Leper, and dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
the Devils, and rais'd the dead. He spake the word and all was
done. Full of grace indeed to do such deeds of grace, so willingly, so
readily, so generally, and in the lips indeed, when it was all done only by
the word of his mouth.</p>
            <p>2. The gracious instructions that proceeded out of his mouth; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that all wondered at it, says S. <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 22. He only taught with
authority, and a grace; all other teachers, the long winded <hi>Pharisee</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57113:50"/>
himself, but wind and bubble to him, St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> vii. 29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>3. The gracious promises of the Gospel, pardon and forgiveness, grace,
and mercy, and peace, and heaven, and happiness; all fully preach't and
revealed by him. <hi>By the word of his mouth were the heavens made,</hi> says <hi>David,</hi>
made over now to us, kept in store, provided and prepared for us, with
that priviledge too, <hi>prae filiis hominum, before all the children of men,</hi> that
were before us, <hi>that they without us should not be made perfect,</hi> Heb. xi. 40.</p>
            <p>We may without question apply <hi>prae filiis hominum</hi> to this point, to say
here also that his lips are fuller of grace then the children of men; for
even the officers of his enemies were forc'd to confess it long ago, S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
vii. 46. <hi>Never any man spake like this man;</hi> never so graciously, never so
comfortably, never so effectually, never so powerfully, never so sweetly,
never so much grace, and goodness, and glory.</p>
            <p>And 'tis still <hi>diffusa,</hi> lasts still. His lips are his Ministers and Preachers,
and by them he still diffuses his graces daily to us, <hi>Labia Sacerdotis custodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,</hi>
Mal. ii. 7. they keep grace for others, even when they keep none
for themselves. The ministry of the Word and Sacraments, though it
comes sometimes through corrupt and putrid channels, is not defiled or
made unprofitable by it. Out of the childrens, that is, ignorant simple
Ministers mouths, sometimes God perfects praise, and makes the stones,
the most stony and obdurate sinner among them, cry out loud enough to do
others good, to soften others, though they continue hard and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sacraments</hi> (2.) are his lips too, in which grace is diffus'd, full grace
given and poured out upon us, poured in into us. Never grace so fully
given as in those holy <hi>Mysteries;</hi> there you see <hi>diffusa</hi> to the eye, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
pouring out the Wine, and must believe though you do not see the
inward pouring out the Spirit. Never so gracious words proceeded out
of his mouth as those you hear there. <hi>This is my Body which was given for
you. This is my Blood which was shed for you. Take and eat</hi> the one, <hi>Take and
drink</hi> the other. What more abundant grace? what higher favour than
thus to have our lips, and mouths, and hearts filled with himself, and all
the benefits of himself? Wonder we may at it, for 'tis a work of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
an ineffable <hi>mystery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracious indeed always were his words.</hi> Come unto me all ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and heavy laden, and I will refresh you, <hi>S. Matth. xi.</hi> 28. I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance, <hi>S. Matth. ix.</hi> 13. Fear not little flock, for it
is your Fathers good pleasure to give you a kingdom, <hi>St. Luke xii.</hi> 32. Ye that
have followed me in the regeneration, shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
Tribes of Israel, <hi>S. Mat. xix.</hi> 28. God sent not his Son into the world to condemn
the world, but that the world through him should be saved, <hi>S. John iii.</hi> 17.
Behold I give you power to tread on Serpents and Scorpious, and over all the power
of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you, <hi>S. Luke x.</hi> 19. He will
not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking flax, <hi>S. Mat. xii.</hi> 20. Lo I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, <hi>S. Mat. xxviii.</hi> 20. Great
and gracious effusions these, full of grace; yet to give himself daily for
our food and nourishment, and call us to it, is to set seal to all those
other sayings, to bring them home particularly to every one of us, the
very <hi>Amen</hi> and summing up of all the rest.</p>
            <p>'Tis time now to enquire whence all this fulness, all this fairness; <hi>Eo
quod Deus benedixit,</hi> reads one <hi>Transtation,</hi> because God hath blessed him.
Christs beauty is Gods blessing, all beauty is so, be it what it will; from
him it comes, is but a ray of that eternal beauty, that inaccessible light,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57113:51"/>
that <hi>summe pulchrum,</hi> as well as <hi>summe bonum,</hi> the everlasting brightness
of the Father: all the beauty of the mind and body, all the integrity
and vigour of all our powers, are meerly from his blessing, not our merit;
a good lesson from it, not to be proud of any of them. Christ himself as
man had not his beauty any other way. No nor his grace neither. His
Manhood could not merit the union of the Godhead; it was the meer
gift of God so to anoint the Humanity with the Deity, without which
he could not have been the Saviour, could not have made satisfaction for
so infinite a mass of sins. Gods blessing meerly it was, his meer goodness
and blessing so to contrive salvation to us, to enable the Manhood with
the Godhead, to go through the work of our Redemption. <hi>God so loved
the world, that he sent his Son</hi> into the world, in our mortal nature, thus
enabled, thus beautified, thus filled, that we might all be partakers of
his fulness.</p>
            <p>4. Yet in the fourth place, though Christ as meer man could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this grace and beauty, yet when once the Manhood was united to
the Godhead, then he deserv'd the second blessing. Then <hi>propterea, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath blessed</hi> him, is as true a rendring as the other: then when
<hi>being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto
death:</hi> then comes in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s therefore or wherefore rightly, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 8,
9. <hi>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name, that at the name of Iesus every knee should bow,</hi> that we should bow
our selves in humility and thankfulness unto him, that every tongue
should confess, all tongues bless him, and bless God for him, that we
might praise him in the Church, in the midst of the Congregation.</p>
            <p>For a double blessing has Christ purchas'd to himself; a blessing upon his
Person, and a blessing upon his Church. By his Grace and Beauty he has
first purchas'd to himself a <hi>name,</hi> and then a <hi>Church,</hi> a glorious one too,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> v. 27. made himself the head of it. <hi>For it pleased God that in him
should all fulness dwell,</hi> it pleased him also by that fulness <hi>to reconcile all
things to himself,</hi> to make him the head of all, the Saviour of them all, to
bless him in the ordinary stile of Scripture, where children are called
the blessing of the Lord, to bless him with an everlasting seed, a Church
and people to the end of the world, do the gates of Hell what they can
against it.</p>
            <p>5. There remains nothing now but our <hi>Benedixit</hi> to answer God's, our
blessing to answer his. We to bless him again for all his blessings: For to
that purpose is both Christs grace, and Gods blessing, all his blessings;
therefore fulness of grace in him, that it might be diffus'd and poured out
upon us; therefore diffus'd and poured out upon us, that we might pour
out something for it. <hi>Bene fecit,</hi> for <hi>Benedixit,</hi> some good works or other,
at least <hi>Benedixit</hi> for <hi>Benedixit,</hi> good words for it; blessing for blessing.</p>
            <p>Indeed 'tis but <hi>Benedixit</hi> here with God, but <hi>dixit &amp; fecit, he said and it
was done:</hi> saying and doing are all one with God, should be so with us if
we would be like him; our deeds as good as our words, our piety as fair
as our pretences, that's the only truly blessing God.</p>
            <p>And the likest too to last <hi>in secula,</hi> to hold for ever. Good words and
praising God in words, is but the leaves of the tree of blessing; and leaves
you know will wither: the stock, and trunck is blessing God in earnest by
good works, by expressing the diffusions of this grace in our lives and
actions, by imitating and conforming our selves to the beauty of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
            <p>If he be so fair as you have seen it, how can we now but love him? if
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57113:51"/>
his lips so full of grace, how can we but delight to hear him, to hear his
word? If blessed, how can we less then strive to be partakers of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing?
If for ever, how can we but desire to be ever with him, perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attending him? If his beauty was Gods blessing, let us humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ours comes all from him. If the grace of his lips were the blessing
of Gods, let us know we are not able of our selves to speak so much as a
good word as of our selves. If again he was therefore blessed because
he was so beautiful, and so diffus'd his grace, us'd both his beauty and
eloquence to bring about the children of men to become the children of
God; let us so employ those smaller glimmerings of beauty and gifts of
grace we have, to the service and glory of God and his Christ.</p>
            <p>We dote much upon worldly beauties, we think, we talk, we dream of
them, our minds and affections are ever on them, wholly after them.
Why do we not so on Christ, and after him? he is the <hi>fairest of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
Solomon in all his glory</hi> not like him: none of all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>
comes near him. Why do we not then delight to look upon him, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with him, to talk of him, to be ever with him? What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we do not season our labours, our recreations, our retirements, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
with him?</p>
            <p>We are easily won with fair words and gracious speeches. Lo here are
lips the most eloquent that ever were; why do we not even hang upon
them? why do we not with the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> desire him to kiss
us with the kisses of his lips, to communicate his fulness to us? Indeed
I can render no cause at all, but that we are so immerst in flesh, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beauties, that we cannot see the true heavenly beauty of Christ, or
we do not believe it.</p>
            <p>And yet this Jesus is every where to be seen, his Ministers, his Word,
his daily Grace preventing, directing, and assisting, preserving and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us; the creatures plainly and evidently enough discover him daily
to us.</p>
            <p>But to <hi>day</hi> we have a fairer discovery and sight of him. This <hi>Iesus</hi> that
is so fair, this <hi>Iesus</hi> so full of grace, this <hi>Iesus</hi> so blessed of God for ever,
is this <hi>day</hi> presented to us in his Blessed Sacrament: there is he himself in
all his beauty, all his fulness. Say we then to him, Come in thou blessed
of the Lord, come in, we have made ready and prepared the house for
thee and for thy Camels, for thy self and those consecrated elements
that carry and convey thee. Get we our vessels ready, and shut the door
to us, as the poor Widow did shut out all worldly thoughts and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
fancies, that he may pour out his oyl, his grace into them, till they
be full. And pour we out our souls before him in all devotion and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in all praise and thanksgiving. Is not the cup we are to take, the <hi>cup
of blessing,</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> stile? take we it then and bless him with it,
<hi>taste and see how gracious the Lord is;</hi> see and behold how fair he is, how
amiable and lovely, and be ravish'd with his beauty and sweetness, and
never think we can be satisfied with it, with seeing, or hearing, or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him, but be always doing so for ever.</p>
            <p>So shall he make us fair with his beauty, good with his grace, happy
with his blessedness, bring us one day to see his face in perfect beauty,
and so see his grace poured out into glory, there to bless, and praise, and
magnifie him for ever.</p>

a blessed <hi>Text</hi> we have here for it: both a <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Text</hi>
to bless him in. A Text top-full of blessings, and a day
wherein they came. Blessed <hi>Persons,</hi> and blessed <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
in the Text. Blessed Persons, the Blessed <hi>God,</hi> our
Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> Blessed <hi>David,</hi> and a Blessed People; for
a redeemed people are so. <hi>Blessed are the people that are in
such a case.</hi> Blessed <hi>doings</hi> in it too. <hi>God</hi> blessing, and man blessing. <hi>God</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting,
redeeming, saving mightily, saving <hi>Israel:</hi> And one of <hi>Israel</hi> in
the name of all the rest mightily blessing him for so doing to it. All these
blessings as well remembred as came in the day. Never was <hi>Text</hi> so
fraught with blessings: never rose <hi>Day</hi> so fair with blessings: never saw
<hi>Israel</hi> such a one before: never shall <hi>Israel</hi> or any people see such a <hi>Day</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for blessings till we come into the land of blessedness.</p>
            <p>All that can be said to dim it, is, that this is not the day that blessed
<hi>Zachary</hi> gave this blessing in; it may be nor was this the day that God
gave this blessing neither. <hi>Time</hi> it self runs upon such uneven wheels, that
we are fain to borrow hours and minutes to make up the reckoning of our
years and days. 'Tis enough that we count near it; 'twere enough if it
were a day only set apart by Holy <hi>Church</hi> to recount it in; though it were
nothing near it, nothing near the day when the <hi>Lord God</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> thus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
and redeemed his people. Our business is not to be exact <hi>Chronologers</hi>
of the days of our salvation, but exact performers of our <hi>Duties,</hi> our
thanksgivings and praises for it.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Zachary</hi> does it here before this Redemption was fully wrought,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57113:53"/>
six months before this <hi>Horn</hi> of salvation did appear. If we do it a few
days before, or after, it matters not. To bless God for it, that's the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
Only we must be allowed a <hi>day</hi> to do it in either first or last. But
the <hi>Church</hi> having pitcht it generally every where much about this time;
We take it as we find it, quarrel no more with the <hi>Church</hi> for doing it
<hi>now,</hi> then we do with <hi>Zachary</hi> for doing it <hi>then;</hi> when <hi>he</hi> more forestall'd
the time, then <hi>we</hi> can possibly mistake it.</p>
            <p>Being therefore come hither to day upon that account, the account of
blessing God, and having here a day of blessing, and a Text of blessing,
we shall divide the words into blessings too.</p>
            <p>Gods blessing, and mans blessing; Gods blessing man, and mans bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God again.</p>
            <p>I. Gods blessing hath in it these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. His visiting, he hath visited. (2.) His redeeming us, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
(3.) His saving or raising up a salvation for us. That salvation (4.)
no mean or little one, but a mighty salvation: so one of our translations.
A salvation (5.) with a horn to hold by, a horn of salvation; so the
other, a sure salvation. For us (6.) all of us, the very people to hold
by, an universal salvation. A salvation (7.) raised up; an eminent sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Rais'd up (8.) in the right house, in the house of <hi>David,</hi> a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
a glorious salvation. Rais'd up lastly upon a right ground too; <hi>David</hi>'s
relation to him, his servant <hi>David,</hi> or Gods goodness to his servants:
a singular and especial salvation for them above the rest. This is Gods
blessing man, the first general with the particulars.</p>
            <p>II. Mans blessing God is the second, and <hi>that</hi> has these.</p>
            <p>1. An acknowledgment of Gods blessings, and his blessedness, visiting,
redeeming, saving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That blessings they are, and <hi>His</hi> they are, <hi>He</hi>
visited, He redeemed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He therefore blessed for so doing.</p>
            <p>2. A particular applying and setting our selves to bless him for them,
a Benedictus, a Hymn set and begun upon it.</p>
            <p>3. A desire that others, even all would do so too, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may
have as well <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> after it; <hi>Benedictus</hi> as well <hi>sit</hi> as <hi>est</hi> to follow it
(for there is neither here) so may be and is as well, a <hi>Wish</hi> that others
would, as a <hi>Way</hi> that we our selves may bless him by.</p>
            <p>This is all mans blessing God, the poor pittances we bless him with;
acknowledgments, endeavours, and desires, all that we can give him
for all his blessings. A very short return <hi>however</hi> to be given him, such as
it is. And to <hi>Day</hi> however, a <hi>Day</hi> set apart to do it in.</p>
            <p>For all these blessings either rose upon us with the Sun to day, or are
to rise from us e're it rise to morrow. Our <hi>Lords</hi> Nativity being the chief
ground both of <hi>Gods</hi> blessing us, and <hi>our</hi> blessing him. To day it was <hi>he</hi>
began to visit, to redeem, to save, to raise up <hi>his</hi> horn and ours. To day
then sure we to raise up our voices for it in a <hi>Benedictus,</hi> in Hymns and
Praises. All that is in the Text was on his part set on foot as it were to
day. No reason in the world but what is on ours should be so too. That
it may, I shall first spread Gods blessings here before you, so the better to
stir up yours.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Mans</hi> blessing indeed it is that stands first here; yet <hi>Gods</hi> it is that
is so. He first blesses before we bless, before <hi>we</hi> either <hi>can,</hi> or can <hi>think</hi> to
do it. But you must know it is a day, and a business too, where all things
seem out of order at the first. High things made low, and low things
high: the first made last, and the last first. <hi>God</hi> made man, and man <hi>God.</hi>
The very course of Nature out of order, <hi>quite.</hi> No wonder then that the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57113:53"/>
words that tell us it are so too; that our blessing should be set before
<hi>Gods.</hi> However, this certainly it must teach us, that the first thing we
ought now to think or speak of, is blessing God. Yet the way to do that
best, is to understand <hi>His</hi> blessings first; I shall take them in their order:
so his Visiting I begin with.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there they begin all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that's</hi> the rise of all <hi>Gods</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
His looking down upon us, or looking over us (so the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
before it comes to visiting) is the <hi>source</hi> of all his mercies. There is
nothing else to cause them, but that loving eye he hath to his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the pleasure he takes to look upon them. <hi>That</hi> here brings him
down to visit them.</p>
            <p>For I must tell you now this <hi>visiting</hi> is a coming down, down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
down from his glory, down from himself; a coming to purpose, and
down to purpose, when he came so low as flesh; and a visiting indeed,
when he came so near us. He visited in former times but by his <hi>proxies,</hi>
by his <hi>Angels,</hi> the ushers of his glory, or by his Prophets, or by a Cloud,
or by a Fire. Here it was first he visited in person. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was but a
looking down from heaven till now, a looking on us at a distance, (and
that was a blessing too, that he would any way look upon such poor
worms as <hi>we</hi>) it could not be construed visiting properly till this day
came. Now first it is <hi>so</hi> without a <hi>figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is not good old <hi>Zachary</hi> too quick? Does he not cry out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too
soon? our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> was not yet born; how says he then, the <hi>Lord
hath visited and redeemed his people?</hi> Answer we might, the good old man
here prophesied ('tis said so just the verse before) and after the manner of
Prophets, speaks of things to come as <hi>done</hi> already. But we need not this
strain to help us out. <hi>Christ</hi> was already really come down from heaven,
had been now three months incarnate, had begun his visit, had beheld
the <hi>lowliness of his handmaid,</hi> says his Blessed <hi>Mother,</hi> ver. 48. The Angel
had told her twelve weeks since, <hi>Her Lord was with her,</hi> ver. 28. of this
Chapter. Blessed <hi>Zachary</hi> understood it then (no less than his Wife <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
that proclaimed it, <hi>ver.</hi> 43.) though he could not speak it. As soon
as he could he does, and breaks out into a Song of Praise (that was <hi>his</hi>
prophesying) for this new made <hi>Visit,</hi> this new rais'd <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That word slipt e're I was aware, comes in before the time. But 'tis
well it did; you might else perhaps have mistaken visiting for <hi>punishing:</hi>
so it went commonliest in Scripture till to <hi>day.</hi> It does not here. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
has alter'd it from its old acception. And yet punishing sometimes
is a blessing too. 'Tis a mercy we oft stand in need of to bring us home to
God. But it is infinitely a greater, when he comes himself to fetch us
home, as now he does. Shall I shew you how great it is?</p>
            <p>Why, then (1.) It is a visit of <hi>Grace</hi> and honour that he made us here;
he visited us as great and noble persons do their inferiours, to do them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Hence, <hi>Whence it is to me</hi> (says St. <hi>Eliz.) that the Mother of my Lord
should come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. She, good soul, knew not how to value
such an honour, nor whence it was. Whence then is this, O Lord, that
the <hi>Lord</hi> of that Blessed <hi>Mother,</hi> my <hi>Lord himself</hi> should come unto me?
That's a far higher honour, and no reason of it to be given, but that so
it shall be done to those whom this great King of Heaven and Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
thus to honour. 'Tis a blessing first, this that we speak of, by
which God owns and honours us.</p>
            <p>2. It was a visit of <hi>Charity.</hi> He visited his people as charitable men do
the poor mans house, to seek some occasion to bestow an Alms. <hi>He went
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57113:54"/>
about doing good,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts x. 38. As poor as he was, (and the
<hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, poor he was) he had a <hi>bag for the poor,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 6. and
for <hi>our</hi> sakes it was he <hi>became poor,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> viii. 9. emptied bag
and himself, and all to make us rich. His visit now (2.) is a blessing that
makes us rich.</p>
            <p>3. It was a visit of <hi>Service</hi> too. He visited us as the <hi>Physician</hi> does his
<hi>Patient,</hi> to serve his necessity, to cure and recover him. The innumerable
multitudes of the sick and lame, and blind, and deaf, and dumb, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and possessed that he daily healed and cured, will sufficiently evince
he visited them also as a <hi>Physician.</hi> So 'twas a blessing (3.) that cures all
diseases, makes all sound and whole again.</p>
            <p>4. His visit (4.) was a visit of <hi>brotherly</hi> love and kindness. He visited
us as <hi>David</hi> did his Brethren, to supply their wants, carry them <hi>provision</hi>
and take their <hi>pledge, 1 Sam.</hi> xvii. 17. He did so, and much more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>himself</hi> by this visit our Provision, makes his <hi>Body</hi> our meat, and
his <hi>Blood</hi> our drink, and <hi>himself</hi> our pledge; supplies all our defects, and
wants, and enters himself body for body, and soul for soul to make all
good. This a visiting no brother could do more, no brother so much.</p>
            <p>5. His visit (5.) was not of petty kindnesses, but <hi>great</hi> mercies, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
mercies too. He visited us as holy <hi>David</hi> says he does the earth,
<hi>Psal.</hi> lxv. 9, 11. <hi>Thou visitest the earth and blessest it; thou makest it very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
Thou waterest her furrows, thou sendest rain into the little Vallies thereof;
thou makest it soft with the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.</hi> He not
only furnishes our necessities, but replenishes us with abundances, makes
us soft, and plump, and fat, and fruitful by his heavenly dews and show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
This (5.) a visit of abundant superabundant mercies.</p>
            <p>6. His visit (6.) was a visit of <hi>Friendship,</hi> and that's more yet. He vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
us as blessed <hi>Mary</hi> did her <hi>Cousin Elizabeth,</hi> came to us to rejoyce and
be merry with us. So acquainted has he now made himself with us by this
visit, that he now vouchsafes to call us <hi>friends,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 15. he eats,
and drinks, and dwells, and tarries with us, makes it his <hi>delight</hi> to be
among the sons of men. This is a visit I know not a name good enough
to give it.</p>
            <p>And yet lastly, his visit was not of a common and <hi>ordinary</hi> friendship
neither, but of a friendship that holds to <hi>death.</hi> He visited us as the <hi>Priest</hi>
or <hi>Confessor</hi> does the dying man. When health, and strength, and mirth,
and Physicians, and Friends, have all given us over, he stands by and
comforts us, and leaves us not till he has fitted us wholly to his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
A visit of everlasting friendship, or an everlasting visit was <hi>this</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
in the Text.</p>
            <p>Thus I have shewed you a <hi>seven-fold</hi> visit, that our Lord has made us,
made Gods first blessing into seven. A visit of <hi>Honour,</hi> a visit of <hi>Charity,</hi>
a visit of <hi>Service,</hi> a visit of <hi>Kindness,</hi> a visit of <hi>Mercy,</hi> a visit of <hi>Friendship,</hi>
and a visit of <hi>everlasting Love.</hi> All these ways he visited his people, and
still visits them all the ways he can imagine to bless them and do them
good.</p>
            <p>And yet I should have thought I had forgot one, if it did not fall in
with the blessing we are to consider next; <hi>Redeeming.</hi> For he visited us
also as he is said to do the children of <hi>Israel, Gen.</hi> l. 24. to <hi>bring us out of
the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</hi> He visited us to redeem us,
or visited and redeemed.</p>
            <p>2. Now if redeem'd, <hi>Captives</hi> it seems we were. And so we were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a fourfold Captivity. To the <hi>World,</hi> to <hi>Sin,</hi> to <hi>Death,</hi> and to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57113:54"/>
The <hi>World</hi> (1.) that had ensnared and fettered us, so wholly taken us,
that it had taken away our names, and we were called by the name of
the <hi>World,</hi> instead of that of <hi>Men,</hi> as if we were grown such worldlings
that we had even lost our natures and our names, even the best of us; the
Elect are sometimes called so too. To redeem our honours and <hi>us</hi> thence,
God sent his Son, says S. <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. 17. and he chose us out of it, St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
xv. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sin</hi> (2.) <hi>that</hi> had made us Captives too, chain'd us up so fast, that the
best of us cannot but cry out sometimes <hi>O wretched man that I am, who
shall deliver me?</hi> Rom. 7. 24. And none but this visitour, could or can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>God through Iesus Christ,</hi> so S. <hi>Paul</hi> presently adds upon it, and would have
us thank and bless him for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death</hi> that had also got dominion over us: for no <hi>more</hi> dominion, <hi>Rom.</hi>
vi. 9. signifies it had it <hi>once,</hi> and kept us shrewdly under, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 17. But
<hi>Christ Iesus by his appearing</hi> (they are the Apostles words) <hi>has abolish'd death,</hi>
2 Tim. i. 10. <hi>Made us free from sin and death,</hi> Rom. viii. 2.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> (4.) <hi>he</hi> took us <hi>captive</hi> also at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 26. But for
this purpose was the Son of God manifested, says S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that <hi>he might
destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> 1 S. John iii. 8. And as high as the <hi>Fiend</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
it he will <hi>bruise him under our feet,</hi> Rom. xvi. 20. Now to be delivered
from such masters as <hi>these</hi> is a blessing without question.</p>
            <p>All the question is, how either <hi>Zachary</hi> could say so long before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Birth, or we so presently upon it, he <hi>hath</hi> redeemed, when S. <hi>Paul</hi>
says 'twas by <hi>his Blood,</hi> Col. i. 22. S. <hi>Peter, through his death,</hi> 1 S. <hi>Peter</hi> i. 19.
Why, very well both the one and the other. At his <hi>Birth</hi> was this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
first begun, the <hi>foundation</hi> laid; at his <hi>Death</hi> 'twas <hi>finished.</hi> In his
Incarnation and Nativity he took the flesh that died, and the blood he
shed: and we might truly have been said to be redeemed by his Blood,
though he had not shed it, and by his Death though he had not died; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had already taken on our flesh and blood, and from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
became mortal and <hi>began</hi> to dye: or, to speak a little plainer, He
<hi>brought</hi> the price of our Redemption with him at his Birth, He <hi>paid</hi> it
down for us at his Death. The Writings as it were and Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Him about it were <hi>agreed</hi> on at his Birth, were <hi>engrossing</hi>
all his Life, and <hi>seal'd</hi> by him at his Death. So 'tis as true to day as any
day: He <hi>redeemed.</hi> And had not this day been first in the business, the
other could not have been at all, or first, or last. O <hi>Blessed Day,</hi> that hast
thus laid the foundation of all our <hi>good ones.</hi> O ever <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> who hast
<hi>thus</hi> visited and redeemed us; what shall we <hi>do</hi> unto thee, how shall we
<hi>bless</hi> thee?</p>
            <p>3. Nay and yet (3.) thou hast <hi>sav'd</hi> us too. That's the <hi>next</hi> blessing to
be considered. And 'tis worth considering.</p>
            <p>For redeem'd indeed we might be, and yet not saved. Redeem'd and
yet fall again into the same bad hands or into worse: redeem'd from
evils <hi>past,</hi> and yet perish by some to <hi>come.</hi> 'Tis this salvation that makes
all safe.</p>
            <p>Where (1.) we are saved <hi>from our enemies, and from the hand of all that
hate us,</hi> ver. 71. every thing that may hereafter hurt us, as well as we
were redeemed from all that did. <hi>Nor life, nor death, nor height, nor depth,
nor any thing can separate</hi> us now from the love of God in Christ Jesus,
<hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 39. all things shall continually <hi>work for good,</hi> ver. 28. all work
henceforward for our salvation.</p>
            <p>Especially seeing he saves us (2.) from our <hi>sins,</hi> as the <hi>Angel</hi> tells us,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57113:55"/>
S. <hi>Mat.</hi> i. 21. Does not redeem us only from the slavery of our former
sins, and the punishments we lay sadly under for them, but preserves and
saves us from slipping back into the old, and from falling into new ones.
'Tis a <hi>continual</hi> salvation.</p>
            <p>Nay (3.) 'Tis an <hi>eternal</hi> one too he saves us with, <hi>He the Author of
eternal salvation,</hi> Heb. v. 9. There we shall be safe indeed. All salvations
here may have some clouds to darken them, some winds to shake them,
something sometimes to interrupt them, somewhat or other to tarnish or
soil their glory. New enemies may be daily raised up to us. Sin will be
always bustling with us: here we had need to be sav'd and sav'd again,
daily and hourly sav'd, but with <hi>this</hi> salvation once sav'd and sav'd for
ever. Well may we pray with holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cvi. 4. <hi>O visit us with this
salvation.</hi> And well may we term it now, as our Translation does, a <hi>mighty
salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And mighty sure we may justly stile it. For it required a mighty
<hi>Power,</hi> a mighty <hi>Person,</hi> a mighty <hi>Price,</hi> and mighty <hi>Works</hi> to bring such
mighty things to pass. And it had them all.</p>
            <p>1. A mighty <hi>Power:</hi> Almighty too. No created Power could do it.
Horse and man and all things else but <hi>vain</hi> things to save a man, <hi>to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his soul from the hand of Hell,</hi> Psal. xxxiii. 17. lxxxix. 47.</p>
            <p>2. A mighty Person, the very God of might. <hi>I the Saviour, and besides
me none,</hi> Isa. xliii. 11. No other person able to effect it.</p>
            <p>3. A mighty <hi>price</hi> it cost. No <hi>corruptible</hi> things says S. <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> i. 18.
Nothing but the blood of the Son of God, the <hi>precious Blood of Iesus Christ,</hi>
no less could compass it.</p>
            <p>4. Mighty <hi>works</hi> lastly, and mighty workings to work things about,
Miracles and wonders good store it cost to accomplish the work of our
salvation, such as he only who was <hi>mighty before God and all the people,</hi> St.
Luke xxiv. 19. could bring to pass. And this adds much to the glory of
this salvation, that it was done by such great hands and ways as these.</p>
            <p>But not the works only that wrought it, but the works <hi>it</hi> wrought
speak the salvation mighty too. Mighty for certain, which neither the
unworthiness of our persons, nor the weaknesses of our natures, nor the
habits of our sins, nor the imperfections of our works, nor the malice
of our enemies, nor any power, or strength, or subtilty of men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
were able to hinder or controul, but that <hi>maugre</hi> all, it spread it self
to the very ends of the earth, carried all before it. A salvation we may
trust to, we need not fear, <hi>in this mercy of the most highest we shall not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. For (5.) we have here gotten a good <hi>Horn</hi> to hold by, <hi>A horn of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
the original gives it; a salvation not only strong but sure. Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is a <hi>Saviour</hi> too, one that we may confidently lay hold on, one
that neither can nor will deceive or fail us: For,</p>
            <p>1. He is a <hi>King;</hi> so the <hi>Horn</hi> signifies in the <hi>Prophetick</hi> phrase, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii.
8. The four, and seven, and ten Horns there, so many Kings; and it
stands not with the honour of a <hi>King</hi> to deceive or disappoint us.</p>
            <p>2. And he is not a King without a <hi>Kingdom.</hi> He hath a Kingdom (2.)
and power to help us. The Horn signifies that too in the stile of <hi>Prophesie,</hi>
because in the Horn lies the strength, and power, and dominion as it were
of the creature that hath it. And the power of a Kingdom I can tell you
is good hold.</p>
            <p>3. And this Kingdom (3.) is not an <hi>ordinary</hi> Kingdom neither. As this
Horn is above the <hi>Flesh,</hi> so this Kingdom too; not of <hi>this world,</hi> St.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57113:55"/>
John xviii. 36. the likelier still to conduct us to the other, and there set
us safe.</p>
            <p>And yet likelier (4.) because it is not a fading but a <hi>durable</hi> one, a horn
that will hold. <hi>Saul</hi> was anointed with a <hi>vial</hi> of Oyl, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 1. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
the <hi>brittleness</hi> and <hi>shortness</hi> of his Kingdom; but <hi>David</hi> with a <hi>horn,
1 Sam.</hi> xvi. 13. to signifie the <hi>continuance</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>his;</hi> that it should
be a throne established for ever, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> ii. 45. And made good it was by
this <hi>days</hi> Horn rais'd out of his house; of whose Kingdom <hi>there shall be
no end,</hi> says the <hi>Prophet.</hi> So no failure to be afraid of here. It is a sure sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
we have by him.</p>
            <p>And if I may now have the liberty to tell you more particularly what
<hi>kind</hi> of Horn he may most fairly be said to be, you will be the more ready
to catch at it.</p>
            <p>He is then (1.) a Horn of <hi>Oyl</hi> to anoint <hi>us</hi> also <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests;</hi> for so
he makes us, says S. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> i. 6.</p>
            <p>He is (2.) the true <hi>Cornu-copia,</hi> the Horn of plenty; full of grace and
truth, and all good things else: for out of <hi>his</hi> fulness we all receive <hi>ours,</hi>
says the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 16.</p>
            <p>He is (3.) one of the Horns of the <hi>Altar,</hi> or indeed all of them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may safely fly in all our dangers and distresses; where we may lie
secure when all the world has left us. A sure hold now you will confess,
that is so high, so strong, so powerful, so above corruption, so lasting, so
everlasting, so full of lasting honours, plenties, and securities.</p>
            <p>6. And yet as mighty, and sure, and as easie to <hi>catch</hi> hold on as this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is, were it not for this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were it not for <hi>us,</hi> had we no claim, no
interest in it, what were we the better either for the Horn or the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
'Tis this <hi>for us,</hi> that comes next to be considered, that raises up <hi>our</hi>
horns, that makes us glad.</p>
            <p>For this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not the <hi>Iews</hi> alone. They had the <hi>first</hi> title, right
indeed, but not the <hi>only</hi> to it. There is an <hi>Israel</hi> of God (peace be upon it
says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Gal. vi. 16.) as well as an <hi>Israel after the flesh.</hi> There
are Sons of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith as well as of his body, to whom this salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is sent as well as unto them. Blessed <hi>Zachary</hi> brings in those that <hi>sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death into the number,</hi> ver. 79. the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as
well as <hi>Iews</hi> into the light of it; 'tis <hi>omni populo,</hi> to all people whatsoever,
in the Angels message, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. of our Evangelist, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>All people, and all <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> of them, rich and poor, one with
another; so <hi>populus</hi> signifies, not the <hi>plebem</hi> taken out of it, not the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
or meanest of the people escaped or forgotten. 'Tis an <hi>universal</hi> salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is here set up. God does not streighten heaven, though men do.
<hi>He would have all men to be saved,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 4. (though some men need a horn
indeed to get such a salvation down, yet so it is) and to this purpose he
has <hi>rais'd this salvation up,</hi> which is the next advance of this salvation we
are next to handle.</p>
            <p>7. And he rais'd it (1.) as a <hi>Beacon</hi> or <hi>Standard</hi> upon a Hill, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Languages, all kind of persons might flock in unto it.</p>
            <p>Rais'd it (2.) as from the <hi>Dead,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All hopes of it now were in
the dust. For the temporal condition of the <hi>Iews;</hi> their enemies oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, and had them in subjection; long they had so; and all the
attempts for deliverance had been so often baffled, that they durst hope
no longer. For their spiritual condition, both <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were all
<hi>concluded under sin;</hi> the one blinded with his own superstition, the other
shut up in ignorance, and darkness, when on a sudden was this day-spring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57113:56"/>
from on high, this horn, this ray of light (for I see not why this Horn, as
well as those of <hi>Moses</hi> face, may not be construed so) this <hi>ray,</hi> this <hi>Horn,</hi> I
say, rais'd up to light them both into the ways of salvation.</p>
            <p>Rais'd up (3.) as the <hi>horn</hi> out of the <hi>flesh,</hi> a Saviour rais'd up <hi>thence</hi> to
day. Though from above he came, into the flesh he came, that thence
being made sensible of our infirmities, he might the easier bear with
them.</p>
            <p>Rais'd up lastly to raise up our thoughts from all inferiour expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and fix them where they should be for deliverance and salvation,
<hi>Cornu exaltatum,</hi> this salvation eminent for the vastness, the opportunity,
the convenience, the proportion it carries: the seventh particular
we observe in Gods blessing, the fourth advancing of this salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>8. There is an <hi>eighth:</hi> And it is salvation in the <hi>right house.</hi> The Lord
of the <hi>Ascendant</hi> of our salvation in the <hi>Kingly</hi> house, the best house to
make it the more glorious, the house of <hi>David.</hi> Men would willingly be
sav'd honourably, by a person of honour rather then a base hand. Men
love not to owe their lives or honours to an unworthy person, would be
beholding to the <hi>right</hi> King rather than an <hi>Vsurper</hi> for them. The <hi>House</hi>
of <hi>David</hi> here hits right for <hi>that.</hi> And we cannot but acknowledge a huge
blessing in it, even upon this account, that how poorly, sneakingly, and
basely we every day betray our selves into the hands of our enemies, we
are yet thus by <hi>Christ</hi> brought off with honour, and enjoy by <hi>him</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
salvation.</p>
            <p>9. And yet there is one thing more we would desire, not to owe our
selves to a villain, or a miscreant, or to a wicked and ungodly house or
person. To crown his blessings, God has contrived them in the house of
his <hi>servant David.</hi> So God honoureth his servants; so he encourages
them to be good. <hi>They</hi> are the persons, <hi>theirs</hi> the houses where salvation
dwells. They are the pillars of the earth. To <hi>David</hi> his <hi>servant,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
his <hi>servant,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> his <hi>servant,</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> his <hi>servant,</hi> so run the
promises both of a Saviour and salvation, to <hi>them</hi> and to their <hi>seed</hi> for
evermore.</p>
            <p>Sum we up Gods blessings now. Gracious <hi>Visits,</hi> perfect <hi>Redemptions,</hi>
Salvations <hi>many, mighty, sure, general, eminent, seasonable, honourable</hi> salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to <hi>us</hi> and <hi>ours, everlasting</hi> too: what would you more? there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
behind now but <hi>our</hi> blessing God for all these blessings. I hope that
shall not be so long, for 'tis but little that is required for so much; and
but three particulars that make it up. An <hi>acknowledgment of Gods blessings,</hi>
a <hi>setting our selves</hi> to some way to <hi>bless him for</hi> them; and a <hi>desire that all
would do so too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The acknowledgment begins it, the acknowledging of <hi>Gods</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
the first part of <hi>ours;</hi> so sure a point of it, that <hi>Confiteri,</hi> to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or confess the blessing, or him that sends it, is above sixty times in
the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> set down for <hi>blessing.</hi> And whole <hi>Psalms</hi> you
have that are nothing else but an enumeration and catalogue of
blessings, the 66. the 103. the 104. the 105. the 107. the 136.
And the more particular we are in it, the more we bless him. You have
heard how particular <hi>Zachary</hi> is in it here. <hi>He</hi> hath visited, <hi>he</hi> hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> given us nine particulars, leaves neither <hi>gift</hi> nor <hi>giver</hi> unacknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
Honourable it is to do so: honourable to reveal, to <hi>reveal the
works of God,</hi> says the Angel, <hi>Iob</hi> xii. 7. honourable to <hi>him,</hi> honourable
to <hi>us:</hi> we cannot honour God without it, nor expect honour from him,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57113:56"/>
if we will not acknowledge it. Come, and I <hi>will tell you what he hath done
for my soul,</hi> is the best way to begin our blessing.</p>
            <p>2. But it is but to <hi>begin</hi> it. We must go on to the next way of blessing,
set <hi>close</hi> to it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Benedictus</hi> from <hi>Benedicere;</hi> both
tell us there is <hi>much</hi> of it in words. Only <hi>verbum</hi> is <hi>factum,</hi> and <hi>dicere</hi> is <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
sometimes in the holy <hi>page.</hi> So we must take <hi>both words</hi> and <hi>deeds</hi> to
do it with. The word by the hand of thy servant, as the Scripture some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
speaks, is the best way to bless him with. Yet to our <hi>benedicere</hi> in
the <hi>first</hi> sense <hi>first.</hi> And to do that, to give him good words is the least
that we can give him: let us be sure then not to grudge him <hi>them.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
we that he is good, and gracious, and merciful, full of mercy, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in goodness and truth. Streighten we not his visits, stifle we not his
Redemption, coop we not up his salvation to a corner, suffer we it to run
large and full, that the whole world may bless him for it.</p>
            <p>Let us (2.) speak it out. Gods blessings were not done in a corner, no
more must <hi>ours.</hi> Publick and solemn they would be. And the <hi>Church</hi> has
made it (and Text) part of the publick service, that every one might
bear a part in blessing God. Every <hi>one</hi> of us, and every <hi>thing</hi> of us too,
our souls and all that is within us, heart and mind, and all. All within
us and all without us, our <hi>lips</hi> praise him, our <hi>mouths</hi> praise him, our <hi>hands</hi>
praise him, our <hi>flesh</hi> praise him, our <hi>bones</hi> say who is like him, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our body turn themselves into tongues to bless him.</p>
            <p>Bless we him (3.) in set <hi>Hymns</hi> on purpose, in good votes and wishes, that
his <hi>Church</hi> may prosper, his Name be magnified, his Glory advanced to
the highest pitch, for <hi>bene dicere,</hi> is <hi>bene vovere</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And <hi>sanctificare</hi> is no less. To bless is sometimes to <hi>sanctifie.</hi> So God
<hi>blessed</hi> the seventh day, is God <hi>hallow'd</hi> it; and to sanctifie a day, or place
to bless him in, is to bless him by his own pattern that he hath set us:
well said, if well done, I dare assure you, to set apart both <hi>times</hi> and <hi>places</hi>
to bless him in.</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>dicere</hi> is not <hi>all,</hi> sung never sweetly, <hi>said</hi> never so well. The
Lord bless thee in common phrase is, the <hi>Lord do good unto thee.</hi> Indeed
Gods blessing is always <hi>such;</hi> his <hi>benedicere</hi> is <hi>bene facere.</hi> His saying is a
doing, his blessing a making blessed. 'Tis fit our blessing should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like it. To <hi>himself</hi> indeed we can do no good. He neither <hi>wants</hi>
it, nor can be <hi>better'd</hi> by it. To <hi>His</hi> we may. Though not to his <hi>head,</hi> yet
to his <hi>feet:</hi> The <hi>poor;</hi> we may bless them. And the blessing <hi>them</hi> is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>him:</hi> for <hi>inasmuch as ye have done it unto these, you have done it unto me,</hi>
says he himself, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. And truly it must needs be a poor blessing
that cannot reach his <hi>feet.</hi> Nay 'tis a poor one if it reach no higher.</p>
            <p>Indeed he that <hi>giveth alms, he sacrifices praise,</hi> says the Son of <hi>Syrach,
Ecclus.</hi> xxxv. 2. And praise is blessing. But to bless is to <hi>honour</hi> too. And
<hi>honour the Lord with thy substance,</hi> says a <hi>wiser</hi> then the Son of <hi>Syrach, Prov.</hi>
iv. Something must be done to his <hi>own</hi> honour. So nething given or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to support that here among us; for to bless is to <hi>give</hi> thanks, and
that intimates somewhat to be <hi>given</hi> to him, as well as said or spoken
to him. It will else be <hi>verba dare,</hi> and not <hi>gratias,</hi> a meer cheating him
of our thanks. As soon as <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was cured of his Leprosie,
he begs of the Prophet to accept a <hi>blessing</hi> for it. Nature had taught him
God was to be blest so, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> v. 15. When the <hi>Captains</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> had
found by their whole numbers how God had delivered them, they come
with a <hi>blessing</hi> in their hands of <hi>sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
of gold for the house of God,</hi> Numb. xxxi. 52. <hi>David</hi> and his people the story
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57113:57"/>
tells us <hi>blest</hi> him <hi>so</hi> too, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. 20, 21. <hi>offered</hi> incredible sums of
Gold and Silver for the service of the house of God. And let me tell
you, without <hi>begging</hi> for it, that the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God</hi> being now by this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit</hi>
in the Text made the very <hi>office</hi> of salvation, where he daily visits us,
and entertains us with his Body and Blood, with holy conferences and
discourses, where he seals us every day to the day of Redemption, and
offers to us all the means of salvation; there can be no way of blessing God
so answerable and proportionable to his thus blessing us, as <hi>thus</hi> blessing
him again.</p>
            <p>Yet where there is nothing thus to bless him with, there is yet another
way of blessing him; nay where there are other ways, <hi>this</hi> must be too.
To bless him is to glorifie him, and a good life does that, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 16.
By our ill lives the name of God is <hi>blasphemed,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> ii. 24.
Then by our good ones it must needs be <hi>blest. Zachary</hi> seems to point at
this way of blessing, when he tells us we were delivered that we might
serve our <hi>Visitor</hi> in <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> ver. 75. And <hi>thus</hi> he that has
neither eyes to look up, nor hands to lift up, nor feet to go up to the
house of blessing, nor tongue to bless him, nor so much as a Cross to bless
himself or God, not a mite to throw into his treasure, may truly bless
him, and be accepted. To this and all the other ways of blessing is the
Text set. And let all now come in and bear a part in blessing. Blessed <hi>be
the Lord God of Israel,</hi> is now lastly a <hi>call</hi> to <hi>call</hi> them in.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> does so, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlviii. <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi>
and <hi>Light, Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> both above and under them,
<hi>Dragons,</hi> and <hi>Deeps, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Hail,</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> and <hi>Vapour,</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi> and
<hi>Storm,</hi> and <hi>Hills,</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Cattel, Worms,</hi> and <hi>Fowl, Kings</hi>
and <hi>People, Princes</hi> and <hi>Iudges, Young men</hi> and <hi>Maidens, Old men</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi>
all Sexes, Degrees, and Ages, Men and Angels, and all kind of Beings
does he call on to praise, and bless, and magnifie their <hi>Creator:</hi> Indeed the
whole Creation is blessed by this <hi>Visit,</hi> so 'tis but just they should bless
God for <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet how should all these things we mentioned do it? many of them
have no tongues to say, many no sense to understand it. Why? they do
it yet: The Sun by day, the Moon by night may become torches to light
his servants service. The Earth brings forth her Corn and Wine to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
out his <hi>Table;</hi> the deep gives up her Riches, and brings home Golds
and Silks to adorn his Holy <hi>Altars;</hi> the Earth brings Stones and Minerals,
the Hills and Mountains Trees and Cedars to his <hi>House,</hi> the fire kindles
<hi>Tapers</hi> for it, all the meteors of the air, and all the seasons of the years
do somewhat, every wind blows somewhat towards it. The very <hi>Birds</hi>
and <hi>Swallows</hi> get as near the Altar as they can to bless him; the <hi>Snow,</hi> and
<hi>Cold,</hi> and <hi>Ice</hi> crowd as near <hi>Christmas</hi> as they can, to bear a part in this great
Solemnity, in our solemnest thanksgivings. Only he that has no <hi>need</hi> of
this visit, no need of <hi>Christ</hi> or his Redemption, that cares not to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
needs keep no <hi>Christmas,</hi> may stand out, or sit, or do what he will at
this <hi>Benedictus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But sure when all things else thus come in throngs to bless him, and
even Ice and Snow come hot and eager to this Feast, and willingly melt
themselves into his praises, we should not, methinks, come coldly on to
bless him, but come and bring our Families, and Children, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
with us to make the Choire as full as possibly we can. Tell one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
what <hi>Christ</hi> did to day, what he every day does for us, how he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
us to day, how he still visits us every morning, how he redeemed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57113:57"/>
us to day, how he does day by day from one ill or other; how he began to
day to raise up salvation for us, and will not leave raising it for us till we
can rise no higher. Tell we our children next, how in <hi>this</hi> God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>David</hi> his <hi>anointed,</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> must learn to have so. How he
had regard to <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Servant,</hi> will have <hi>so</hi> to <hi>them</hi> if they be his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
let them therefore be sure they be so, fit them thus to sing their
parts betimes in Hymns, and Anthems, and praises to their God; that
they that cannot speak, may yet lisp it out, and when they can speak out,
sing it loud and shrill, that the hollow Vaults and Arches may <hi>eccho</hi> and
rebound his praises: not your Children only, but stones also be thus rais'd
up for children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> 'Tis in the power of your hands (grave Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Fathers, and Brethren) to make the stones cry out of the wall, and
the beam out of the timber to answer, Blessing, and Honour, and Glory,
and Power to him that has rais'd up to us so great salvation.</p>
            <p>I look upon this great <hi>Solemnity</hi> of yours as a meer design of blessing
God, and the <hi>Torches</hi> that light you hither as so many lights set up to
make the light of your good works shine the greater. You have not only
these blessings in the <hi>Text,</hi> but <hi>millions</hi> more to invite you to it. Not to
repeat the blessings and deliverances I have told you; all blessings and
salvations else you owe to this days <hi>Visit</hi> of the Almighty, to this Horn
he raised up for us. Let us bring <hi>them</hi> also into the roll, and thus bless him
for them.</p>
            <p>Some of you <hi>he</hi> has delivered out of <hi>trouble,</hi> bless you him for <hi>that.</hi>
Some of you he has recovered lately from a <hi>sickness,</hi> bless you him for
<hi>that.</hi> Some of you he has delivered lately from a <hi>danger,</hi> bless you him
for <hi>that.</hi> You he has visited in <hi>distress,</hi> visit you his <hi>Temples,</hi> his <hi>poor</hi> and
needy servants, and bless him <hi>so. You</hi> he has redeemed of late from the
gates of <hi>death,</hi> redeem you the <hi>time</hi> hereafter, walk circumspectly and
soberly, and for the rest of your life serve him better, and bless him <hi>so.
You</hi> he has sav'd out of the hands of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Seducers,</hi> save you your
selves henceforward from that <hi>untoward generation,</hi> and come no more
among them. Pay him visit for visit, redemption for redemption, one
salvation for another, and bless him <hi>so. You</hi> he has rais'd to some <hi>honour</hi>
and preferment, raise you up some <hi>pillar</hi> of thanksgiving for it. You he
has rais'd to an <hi>estate,</hi> raise you up some <hi>memorial</hi> to him out of it. <hi>You</hi> he
has rais'd out of <hi>nothing,</hi> you out of a <hi>desperate</hi> condition, your house

will say, you bless him for it. Let there be some token of gratitude set
up here, as God set the <hi>Rain-bow</hi> in the Clouds, <hi>Gen.</hi> xix. 15. that he may
look upon it, and remember, and save you in the time of need, with his
mercy for it.</p>
            <p>In a word, God has <hi>signally</hi> and <hi>strangely</hi> visited us of late years with
his salvation, redeemed us from our <hi>enemies,</hi> and all that <hi>hate</hi> us; those
<hi>Horns,</hi> that like those in <hi>Daniel</hi> pusht down and scattered all before them,
that threw down our Temples, took away our daily service, set up the
<hi>abomination of desolation in these holy places,</hi> Horse, and Foot, and Arms, and
all the instruments of desolation, and stampt upon all holy things and
persons: he has rais'd us up a mightier horn to make those horns draw in
theirs; a horn in the <hi>house</hi> of his servant <hi>David:</hi> restored our <hi>David</hi> his
<hi>anointed</hi> to us, kept him <hi>his</hi> servant, returned him <hi>as</hi> he went, safe and
sound in the principles of his Religion, restored <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his</hi> house, <hi>us</hi> and
<hi>ours,</hi> kept them at least from utterly <hi>pulling</hi> down. O <hi>that men would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonders he has lately done
for the children of men.</hi>

               <q>For ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was
rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty
might be rich.</q>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And do
you know any grace of the Lord Jesus Christ like
this <hi>days</hi> grace, the grace of <hi>Christmas?</hi> any grace or
favour like that grace and favour he this <hi>day</hi> did us,
when he so grac'd our nature as to take it on him?
surely, whether this grace be his becoming poor, or
our making rich, never was it seen more then this
<hi>day</hi> it was. Never was he poorer then this <hi>day</hi> shew'd him, a poor little
naked thing in rags. Never we rich till this <hi>day</hi> made us so, when <hi>he</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich became poor, that <hi>we</hi> being poor might be made rich.</p>
            <p>And rich not in the worst, but in the <hi>best</hi> riches; rich in grace, but
above all grace in <hi>Christmas</hi> grace, in love and liberality to the poor, the
very grace which the Apostle brings in the poverty of Christ here to
perswade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to. <hi>See</hi> (says he) <hi>that ye abound in this grace also,</hi> ver.
7. <hi>For ye know the grace of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> He was so full of it, that
though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, made himself
poor to make us rich; that being made rich we might be rich: To the
poor, bestow some of his own riches upon him again, <hi>some</hi> at least upon
him who gave us <hi>all,</hi> supply his poverty who enricht ours, be the more
bountiful to the poor, seeing he is now become like one of them, that
as through his poverty we were made rich, so even in our very poverty
we might abound also to the <hi>riches of liberality.</hi> So the <hi>Macedonians</hi> did,
<hi>ver.</hi> 2. So would he fain have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> too here, in covert terms;
so he would be understood, and so are we to understand him. Christs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
here brought in as an argument to perswade to liberality.</p>
            <p>A grace so correspondent to the pattern of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> so answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57113:59"/>
both to the purport of <hi>Christmas</hi> and the purpose of the <hi>Text,</hi> that 'tis
hard to say whether the <hi>Day</hi> better explains the <hi>Text,</hi> or the <hi>Text</hi> the <hi>Day.</hi>
For whether we take the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ towards us,
downward, or the grace of the Lord Jesus in us towards him upward:
whether for the grace he did us in becoming poor for our sakes, or for the
grace we are to shew to his poor members for his sake again, for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
poor, and making of us rich: I see not how or where I could
have chosen a better <hi>Christmas</hi> Text, a Text for the Day, or a Day for
the Text.</p>
            <p>For here is both the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> of Christmas; the Doctrine of
Christs free Grace, and the free Use and <hi>Application</hi> of it too. The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
That <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became
poor, that through his poverty we might be rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vse,</hi> That we are to <hi>know it, and acknowledge it,</hi> know it for a <hi>grace</hi>
and <hi>favour;</hi> yea know the grace, know it for a pattern too: <hi>For ye know it,</hi>
that is, to that end ye know it, to take pattern by it, to return grace
again for grace, to shew grace to <hi>his,</hi> for his grace to <hi>us,</hi> to supply his
poverty in his members, for his so gracious supplying ours, to answer the
riches of his grace with being rich; in this <hi>grace</hi> also, in the grace of
love and charity to the poor, the best way to be rich, and to abound to
the riches of his glory.</p>
            <p>But more to appropriate it to the <hi>Day,</hi> you may please to take it in
these particulars. <hi>Christs Birth,</hi> The <hi>Christians benefit,</hi> The <hi>evidence of both.</hi>
The <hi>Inference upon all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Christs Birth. Egenus factus, when he became poor.</p>
            <p>2. The Christians benefit. Propter nos it was, for your sakes it was, &amp; ut vos
divites, That ye through his poverty might be rich.</p>
            <p>3. The evidence of both, Scitis, no less then that of Science, ye know it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The inference</hi> upon all, <hi>scitis enim,</hi> For ye know it, for what? for
a grace and favour; <hi>Scitis gratiam,</hi> the first. And <hi>ut vos divites essetis,</hi>
that we might be rich in the same grace he was: Then secondly, that
ye may do answerable to your knowledge; for <hi>propter nos</hi> it is, for our
sakes he became poor, that for his sake we might look the better upon
the poor; for that he made us rich, that we might be rich in good works;
for <hi>that</hi> he made us rich by the way of poverty, that we might know our
riches have a near relation to poverty, are given us for the poor, as
well as for our selves.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>parts,</hi> and of all these the <hi>sum</hi> is, that Christs Birth is
the Christians benefit; the knowledge of which ought to stir us up to
Christian Charity: or nearer the phrase of the <hi>Text,</hi> that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, though he was rich, became poor to make us rich; rich in
all good gifts and graces, but especially in this of love and mercy to the
poor; came down in grace to us to that purpose, both in the <hi>Text,</hi> and in
the <hi>Day,</hi> the whole and business of them both. I shall prosecute it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and begin with those words in the Text that seem to point us to
the Birth of Christ; <hi>egenus factus:</hi> and if that were the original, the
<hi>factus</hi> would be plain for his being made man. But as it is, 'tis plain
enough, he could not become poor but by becoming man.</p>
            <p>I. For there is not so poor a thing as <hi>man;</hi> indeed no creature poor but
man: no creature lost its estate, and place, and honour, thrust out of
doors, and turned as it were a begging abroad into the wide world, but
man. Other creatures keep their nature and place to which they were
created; man only he kept nothing; first lost his clothes, his robe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57113:59"/>
of innocence, in which he was first clad, was then turned naked out of
his dwelling, out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> only his nakedness covered a little with a
few ragged leaves, fain upon that to work, and toil, and labour for his
living to get his bread; forc'd to run here and there about the world to
get it; all the creatures that were lately but his servants stood gazing
and wondering at him, and knew him not, would no longer own him for
their <hi>Lord,</hi> he look'd so poor, so despicable when he had sinn'd; they
that before were all at his command, by the dominion he had received over
them, now neither obey'd his command, nor knew his voice, so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had he lost the very semblance of their late great Master, so perfectly
poor was he become. The <hi>Devil</hi> kept a power, and awe, and <hi>Principality,</hi>
though he lost his seat; got a <hi>Kingdom</hi> though he lost his <hi>glory:</hi> But man
lost all, glory and grace, riches and honour, estate and power, peace and
ease, shelter, and safety, and all: so that to become poor can be nothing
else but to become man; and <hi>Christs</hi> becoming so, must be his becoming
man.</p>
            <p>Yet not to know it <hi>only,</hi> but to know it for a <hi>grace,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> would
have us, we must know <hi>who</hi> it is that became poor. (2.) <hi>How poor</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
who became poor. (3.) <hi>What</hi> he was still, though he became poor.
<hi>Our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> says the Text, <hi>he</hi> it is, <hi>egenus factus,</hi> he came to
very want, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to a kind of penury like that of beggars. Yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for all that it is, he continued rich still, though he was poor; he could
not lose his infinity of riches, though he took on his poverty, quitted not
his <hi>Deity,</hi> though he covered it with the rags of his humanity.</p>
            <p>We first look upon his person, our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> He is a Lord it
seems that became poor, that first: and truly the first and only time that
we read he entituled himself <hi>Lord,</hi> it follows presently, <hi>he hath need,</hi> St.
Mat. xxi. 3. The Lord hath need. This may be true, as the <hi>Italian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
of the Lords and Princes of the world, none need commonly so
much as they, nor they before they came to be Lords and Princes; but of
the Lord and Prince of Heaven, as our Lord surely is, that's somewhat
strange that he should have any need; yet so it is: and it may serve to
teach the best of us, of men, Lords and great ones too, to be content
sometimes to suffer need, seeing the Lord of Lords was found poor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iesus</hi> (2.) it is, was found so. <hi>Iesus</hi> is a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that's stranger.
A Saviour that is poor is like to prove but a poor Saviour. Yet this is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
Gods method, the <hi>poor and base things</hi> of the world, and things
that are despis'd, to <hi>confound the rich,</hi> and <hi>noble,</hi> and <hi>the mighty,</hi> 1 Cor.
i. 28. that no flesh, as the Apostle infers there, might glory in <hi>his</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
This very name of <hi>Iesus</hi> was then sent by an <hi>Angel</hi> to be given
him, when he had first told he should be <hi>born,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> i. 21. born of a
poor Virgin, and yet save his people from their sins; that we may know
God needs nothing to help him; his very poverty is our <hi>salvation.</hi> Jesus
poor, the poorest contemptible means he can save us by.</p>
            <p>Nay even the <hi>Christ</hi> (3.) the <hi>Messiah</hi> so long expected, comes poor
when he was expected rich, to shew the vanity of mens conceit and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
when they will go alone. <hi>Christ</hi> the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> the great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
the everlasting <hi>High Priest,</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of our souls, he came
poor, that men might give over looking upon the outward appearance of
things, and think it no diminution to the calling of <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Prophet</hi> to be
sometimes in a low and mean condition, seeing the <hi>Christ</hi> himself anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the holy oil above all Priests and Prophets, came in no other.</p>
            <p>And now this we have gotten by considering the person, that if he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57113:60"/>
that is Priest, and Prophet, and Saviour, and Lord, and the Lord of all
may become poor, and God do all his work notwithstanding by him;
then poverty is neither dishonourable in it self, nor so disadvantageous in
its own nature, but that God can still make use of it to his Service, does
still most make use of it, dispences his heavenly treasure to us more
commonly in <hi>earthen vessels,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 7. then in Gold and Silver, and
we therefore not to slight the Ministers of the Lord Jesus Christ,
though become poor, <hi>their bodily presence weak, and their speech contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> undervaluers speak, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 10. For their Lord and ours
became poor himself, as poor as the poorest, which will appear by the
second consideration. I am now to shew you <hi>how poor</hi> he became, of whom
it is here said he became poor.</p>
            <p>And that not only that poor <hi>thing</hi> called man, that poor worm and
dust, that poor <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> we call man, but the very poorest of
the name; the <hi>novissimus virorum,</hi> the lag and fag of all, a very <hi>scum of men,</hi>
says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>very out-cast of the people.</hi> So poor that there is
not a way to be poor <hi>in,</hi> but he was poor <hi>in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Poorly <hi>descended,</hi> a poor <hi>Carpenters Wife</hi> his Mother.</p>
            <p>2. Poorly <hi>born,</hi> in a Stable among Beasts; poorly wrapt in <hi>rags,</hi> poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cradled in a <hi>Manger,</hi> poorly bedded upon a lock of <hi>Hay,</hi> poorly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the <hi>Oxe</hi> and <hi>Ass,</hi> poorly every way provided for, not a fire to dress
him at in the depth of Winter, only the steam and breath of the Beasts
to keep him warm, Cobwebs for <hi>Hangings,</hi> the dung of the Beasts for
his <hi>Perfumes,</hi> noise and lowings, neighing and brayings for his <hi>Musick;</hi>
every thing as poor about him as want and necessity could make it.</p>
            <p>3. Poorly <hi>bred</hi> too, a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> it seems by S. <hi>Mark</hi> vi. 5. at his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fathers Trade.</p>
            <p>4. Poorly <hi>living</hi> too, not a house to put his head in, not a pillow of
his own to lay his head on, S. <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 57. not a room to sup in but what
he borrow'd, S. <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 15. no money, nor meat but by miracle, S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xvii. 27. or by charity, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. 10. not so much as a Bucket to draw
water, or a cup to drink it in, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 11. Nay more, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
more, he was poor even to <hi>beggary,</hi> was fain to beg even water it self, in
the last cited Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. had a bag carried always by one of his
<hi>Disciples</hi> to receive any thing that charitable minded people would put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 6. his Disciples were so low driven following him, that
they were fain sometimes to <hi>pull the ears of Corn,</hi> as they passed by, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their hunger; <hi>five or seven loaves, with two or three little fishes</hi> among
them all, was great provision with them. Indeed we read not punctually
that he begg'd at any time, but we see him as near it, as was possible, if
he did not; and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in all <hi>profane</hi> Writers never signifies
less.</p>
            <p>But let it be but what we translate it, meerly <hi>poor,</hi> though the Prophet
<hi>David</hi> in the Person of Christ, <hi>Psalm</hi> xl. 18. cries <hi>Mendicus sum &amp; pauper,</hi>
I am a poor beggar; be it yet but poor, yet so poor it is he was, that he
was poor in all, every way poor. Poor in <hi>Spirit,</hi> none poorer, none more
willing to be trampled on; suffered men to <hi>plow upon his back, and make long
furrows,</hi> make a poor thing of him indeed, do any thing what they would
with him: poor in flesh too. <hi>They may tell all my bones,</hi> says the Prophet of
him, <hi>Psalm</hi> xxii. 17. <hi>they stand staring and looking upon me,</hi> a meer gazing-stock
of poverty, a miracle of poverty, marvellous poor, poor in <hi>reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He made himself of no reputation, took upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> ii. 7, 8. of a servant, of a <hi>slave,</hi> valued at the lowest price, a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57113:60"/>
man could be, <hi>thirty pieces of Silver.</hi> So poor he could scarce speak out.
<hi>Non clamabit</hi> says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> he shall not cry; he did not, says the
<hi>Evangelist,</hi> S. Mat. xii. 18. It was fulfilled. You could scarce hear his
voice in the streets, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. In a word, so poor that he was as I may say,
asham'd of his name, denied it as it were to him that called him by it,
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xix. 17. <hi>Why callest thou me good?</hi> when yet he only was so.</p>
            <p>Lastly, poor he was in his <hi>Death</hi> too; betray'd by one Disciple, denied
by another, forsaken by the rest, stript off to his very skin, abus'd, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
despis'd by all; died the most ignominious death of all, the death
of Slaves and Varlets. And can you now tell me how he should become
poorer? or can you tell me why we should think much at any time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
poor like him? or not rather cry out, O <hi>Blessed Poverty</hi> that art now
sanctified by Christs putting on? How canst thou but be desirable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
since Christ himself became poor? If God become man, what man
would be an Angel though he might? If Christ the eternal riches think
it becomes him to be poor, who would make it his business to be rich?
Give me rags for clothes, bread for meat, and water for drink, a Stable
for a Palace, the earth for a bed, and straw for a covering, so Christ be
in them, so he be with them, so this poverty be his, so it be for him. I
will lay me down in peace, and take my rest upon the hardest stone, or
coldest ground, and I will eat my brownest bread and pulse, and drink my
water or my <hi>tears</hi> with joy and gladness, now they are seasoned by my
Masters use. I will neglect my body and submit my spirit, and hold my
peace even from <hi>good words</hi> too, because he did so: I will be content with
all, because he was so. The servant must not be better than his Lord, nor
the Disciple than his Master. Our <hi>Lord</hi> poor, our <hi>Iesus</hi> poor, our <hi>Christ</hi>
poor, and <hi>we</hi> striving to be rich, what an incongruity? <hi>The Camel and
the needles eye never fitted worse.</hi> Poverty we must be contented with if we
will have him; poor at least in spirit we must be, ready for the other
when it comes; and when it comes we must think it is becoming, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much become the Disciple to be like the Master, the servant wear his
Lords livery. For our sakes he became poor, and we must not therefore
think much to be made so for his, be it to an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the extreamest.</p>
            <p>Especially seeing poverty is no such <hi>Gorgon,</hi> no such terrible lookt
<hi>Monster</hi> since Christ wore it over his richest Robes, even chose to be poor
though he was rich, would needs be poor, and appear to be so for all his
riches. Indeed it was the riches of his grace that made him poor; had he
not been rich, superlatively rich in that, in grace and favour to us, he
would never have put on the <hi>tatters</hi> of humanity, never at least have put
on the raggedest of them all, not only the <hi>poverty</hi> of our <hi>nature,</hi> but even
the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>poverty,</hi> that he might become like one of us, and dwell
among us. And it was the riches of his glory too, that could turn this
poverty to his glory. What glory like that which makes all things glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
rags and beggary? what riches like his, or who so rich as he that
can make poverty more glorious then the Robes and Diadems of Kings
and Emperours? who so often for his Religion sake have quitted all their
secular glories, plenties, delicates, and attendants, for russet coats, and
ordinaty fare, and rigours, and hardships, above that which wandring
beggars suffer in the depth of Winter. Christianity no sooner began to
dawn into day, but that we find the professors selling all, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. as if
they thought it an <hi>indecency</hi> at least to possess more than their Master did;
though they were rich they became poor, because their Lord became so
though he was rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:57113:61"/>
But when men of rich become poor, the case is much different yet
from that of Christs; men cease to be rich when they come to poverty,
but not so Christ; he is poor and rich together. (3.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
being rich he yet shewed poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 2. The rich and poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never truer any way then here, <hi>&amp; utriusque operator est Dominus,</hi> the Lord
is both himself, as well as worker of them both in others. For in this low
condition of his it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> yet talks so often of the riches of Christ,
the <hi>riches of his grace,</hi> Eph. i. 7. the <hi>riches of his Glory,</hi> Eph. iii. 16. the <hi>riches</hi> of
the glory <hi>of his inheritance,</hi> Eph. i. 18. the exceeding greatness of his power,

when he saw his riches but under a veil, saw but a glimpse and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; the only rich, so great are his riches.</p>
            <p>Indeed the riches of the Godhead, that is, all riches indeed dwell all
in him; though he became man, he left not to be God, our rags only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Robes of the Divinity, his poverty only serv'd for a veil to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
those unspeakable riches, to <hi>teach</hi> us not to boast and brag at any time
of our riches, not to exalt our selves when we are made rich, or when
the glory of our house is increased, but to be as humble notwithstanding
as the poorest and lowest wretch, to teach us (2.) that riches and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may stand together as well in <hi>Christians</hi> as in <hi>Christ;</hi> the riches of grace
and the poverty of estate; and again the riches of estate and poverty of
Spirit. To teach us (3.) not to put off the riches of grace, for fear of
poverty; not quit our Religion or our innocence for fear of becoming
poor by them: to teach us <hi>lastly</hi> that we may be rich in Gods sight, In
truth and verity, how poor soever we are in the eyes of the world, how
needy and naked soever we appear. <hi>He</hi> that being in the form of God
thought it no robbery to be equal with God, even whilst he was so, made
himself of no reputation, of as low a rank as could be; and being the
brightness of his Fathers Glory, the express image of his person, and
upholding all things with the word of his power, veils all this glory,
darkens all this brightness, conceals all this power under the infirmities
and necessities of flesh and poverty, yet only veils all this great riches,
hides and lays it up for us, that through his poverty we might be rich.
The next point we are to handle, the <hi>Christians</hi> benefit <hi>from Christs Birth,</hi>
the Christians gain by Christs losses, the Christians making rich by
Christs being made poor.</p>
            <p>II. And need had he to be rich indeed to enrich so many; need to be
rich whose very <hi>poverty</hi> can enrich us: to speak the very truth, his very
poverty is our riches. It is his rags that clothed our nakedness, it is his
stable that builds us Palaces, it is his hunger that filled our emptiness, it
is his thirst that takes off our driness, it is his necessity that supplies all
ours; he made himself a slave to make us free, a servant to make us
sons; he came down to lift us up, he became as it were nothing to make
us all. The very poverty of Christ is the riches of the Christian, and he
that can chearfully put that on after him, is rich indeed, can want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
for he that can be content to be poor for Christ, who though he
has nothing is content, he wants not though he has not; and if he want
not, he is rich, nay only rich: for he that wants but the least, though he
have never so much, never so full coffers, never so many possessions, nay
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57113:61"/>
and Kingdoms too, he is not rich with all his riches. The poor pious
soul that lives contented in his Cell, and feeds on nothing but bread and
water, and joys in it because it is for Christ, he is rich, and abounds, and
has all, sleeps securer in a <hi>Wilderness</hi> amongst wild Beasts, softer upon <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
Pillar, warmer under the vast Canopy of Heaven, then great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their fortified Castles, upon the Doun of Swans, with all their
Silks and Embroideries about them: for neither a <hi>mans life, nor his riches
consist in the abundance of the things that he possesseth,</hi> St. Luke xii. 15. He
is rich whom Christs poverty, or poverty for Christ enriches with godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and contentment. <hi>That's great gain,</hi> that is, great riches, says St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> So great that we need not look after the petty, fading, transitory
riches of the world, they are but dross and dung compared to the true
riches, the riches of grace and glory we have by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>For call the rich man whom you will, seek all the expressions the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
has to call the rich man by: He that is rich in the grace of Christ
may lay title to them all. He that abounds in Gold and Silver, is he rich?
Behold, Christ calls to us to <hi>buy gold of him tried in the fire,</hi> that we may
be rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 18. and <hi>he sells all without mony,</hi> Isa. lv. 1. 'tis then easie
coming by it, easie being rich: nay, the very trial of our Faith is <hi>more
precious then gold,</hi> 1 St. Pet. i. 7. A Christian in the sorest trials, poverty,
or reproach, or death, is rich you hear in being so. He that has abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of rich clothes and garments, is he rich? Christ calls us to buy
them too at the same easie rate, <hi>white rayment,</hi> the rayment of Princes,
and great men, in the forenamed place of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and with the
long white Robe of Christs Righteousness, the faithful Christian is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled;
so none richer in <hi>clothes</hi> than he. He that heaps up Silver like
the dust, and molten Gold like the clay in the streets, is <hi>he</hi> rich? How
rich then is he that counts the silver like the dust, and the gold like clay,
who is so rich that he contemns those <hi>riches?</hi> He that has his garners full
of Wheat, and his presses with new Wine, is <hi>he</hi> rich say ye? How rich
then is he that lives wholly upon heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> and drinks the Wine
of <hi>Angels,</hi> as the true Christian does? He that washes his steps in Butter,
and has Rivers of Oyl flowing to him out of the Rock, is <hi>he</hi> rich? How
much richer then is he that is anointed with the <hi>heavenly</hi> Oyl, with the
oyl of perpetual joy and gladness in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the true believer is?
He that abounds in Cattel, who cannot number his herds and flocks, is
<hi>he</hi> rich, tell me? how mightily far richer is he that possesses God, <hi>whose
are all the Beasts of the Mountains, and all the Cattel upon a thousand Hills;</hi> and
him he possesses that possesses Christ, that is, one of his, the poorest of
them; he that has stately and magnificent houses good store, richly deckt
and furnisht too, is <hi>he</hi> rich think you? if he be, how infinitely more
rich are they who have Heaven for their house, and all the Furniture fit
for theirs? In a word, may he be called rich, who is highly born, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seated, gloriously attended? how rich then is he that is born of God,
as the true Christian is? whom he makes to <hi>sit together with him in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
places in Christ Iesus,</hi> Ephes. ii. 6. upon whom the Angels continually
attend, about whom they daily pitch their Tents, to whom they are
all but ministring Spirits sent forth to wait upon them as upon the <hi>heirs
of salvation,</hi> Heb. i. 14. Will not all this serve the turn? what then
plainer now at last, then that he tells us he has made us <hi>Kings and Priests,</hi>
Rev. i. 6. Kings they cannot come under a lower notion then rich; and
though Priests of late are not always so, yet a <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> as St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
calls us, 1 St. <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 9. will be rich.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:57113:62"/>
So that now after the several stiles of rich men in <hi>Scripture</hi> you see the
Christian may be truly stiled rich, if either abundance or increase, clothes
or furniture, houses or attendants, may be said to make one rich, or if
Kings themselves may be called such.</p>
            <p>Yet above all this, he is richer still, even in poverty he is rich, and can
make others rich. <hi>As poor,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>yet making many rich, and as
having nothing, and yet possessing all things,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 10. Here's the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Christian riches above all others. None can rob us of them,
no poverty can lose them. <hi>I know how to abound, and how to want,</hi> says St.
<hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> iv. 12. how to abound in the midst of want. They are riches,
the riches of grace, that Thieves cannot steal, nor Moths corrupt, such
as satiate the weary soul, such as make us with St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all estates to be
content, count all riches, all joy, even the sorest and bitterest poverty or
temptation. And when the riches of grace have heaped up our treasuries
here with all chearfulness, then open they to us the treasuries of glory,
riches so far beyond what the world call so, that all here is but meer beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
and want, and misery in comparison; not to be nam'd, or thought
on.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vse</hi> of this is to instruct us henceforward to labour only for the
true riches, to be rich in grace, to be plentiful in good works, not to
squander away our days, like children in running after painted Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies,
in heaping up Gold and Silver, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, to lie, and rust,
and cry out against us not to build our dwellings, or fix our desires, or
place our affections upon earthly rubbish, not to precount our lands, or
houses, our clothes or furniture, our full bags, or our numerous stock and
daily encrease, our riches; but to reckon Christ our riches, his Grace our
<hi>wealth,</hi> his reproach our <hi>honour,</hi> his poverty our <hi>plenty,</hi> his glory the sum
and crown of all our riches and glory. For if you know the <hi>grace of the
Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> this you know also, that 'tis worth the seeking, that 'tis
riches, and honour, and glory, how poor soever it look to the eye of the
world. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, it is only that makes us rich,
and poverty his way to enrich us by, contrary to the way of the world:
and this ye know says the <hi>Apostle.</hi> 'Tis so plain and evident I need not tell
you it, for ye know it. The third point the <hi>evidence</hi> of all that has been
said.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>For ye know it;</hi> for ye know nothing if you know not this. It was a
thing not done in a corner: all the corners of the world rang of it, from
the utmost corners of <hi>Arabia</hi> to the ends of the earth. The wise men came
purposely from the <hi>East</hi> to see this poor little new-born Child, <hi>&amp; tibi ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viet
ultima Thule,</hi> sang the <hi>Poet,</hi> the utmost confines of the <hi>West</hi> came in
presently to serve him: the whole world is witness of it long ago. Nor
were ever Christians ashamed either of this grace or poverty until of late.
It was thought a thing worth knowing, worth keeping in remembrance
by an <hi>anniversary</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Indeed, were it not a thing well known, it would not be believed,
that the Lord of all should become so poor as to have almost nothing of it
all. But <hi>we saw it,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 14. the <hi>word made flesh,</hi> this great high
Lord made little, and low enough, <hi>heard it, saw it with our eyes,</hi> lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and our <hi>hands too handled it,</hi> 1 St. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 1. had all the evidence pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
could be had, the evidence of ear, and eye, and hand; know it
by them all. And not we only, not St. <hi>Iohn</hi> only, but all men know it.
For <hi>this grace of God that bringeth salvation,</hi> that is, the true grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>hath appeared unto all men,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Titus ii. 11.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57113:62"/>
So that they either know it, or if they know it not, 'tis their own fault;
for it has appeared, and has been often declared unto them; so that 'tis
no wonder that the <hi>Apostle</hi> should tell the Corinthians that they know it,
they could not be Christians without knowing it, nor it seems men in
those days neither, that knew it not.</p>
            <p>And yet as generally as it was known, it was a <hi>grace</hi> to know it, one
of the most special gifts and graces, the knowledge of the grace of Christ.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that ye know it is
his <hi>grace.</hi> You could not know it without it, none but they to whom it
is given can know it as they should.</p>
            <p>4. That we may know it so, as well as they; we are now in the last
place to consider what the <hi>Apostle</hi> would infer upon us by it, what should
be the issue of this knowledge: (1.) The <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of the grace:
and then (2.) the <hi>practice</hi> of it. For ye know the grace of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, that though he was rich, yet he so lov'd the poor as to bestow
all his riches freely upon them, upon us that were poor, and naked, and
miserable, and being thrust out of our first home, never since could find
any certain dwelling-place. And therefore we (2.) after his example,
being now enricht by him, should be rich in our mercy and bounty to the
poor; for if his grace was such to us when we were poor, we should shew
the like to the poor now we are rich.</p>
            <p>But that we may be the readier to this, we must first be sensible of the
other, throughly sensible of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it for a grace, a thing meerly of his own good will and favour, that
he would thus become poor to make us rich. Know we and acknowledge
<hi>many</hi> graces in this <hi>one</hi> grace.</p>
            <p>A grace to our <hi>humanity,</hi> that he would grace it with putting on.</p>
            <p>A grace to <hi>poverty,</hi> that he would wear that too.</p>
            <p>A grace to our <hi>persons</hi> as well as to our natures, that it was for our
sakes he did it.</p>
            <p>A grace to our <hi>condition,</hi> that it was only to enrich it.</p>
            <p>Know we then again and acknowledge it from hence.</p>
            <p>1. That poverty is now become a grace, a grace to which the <hi>Kingdom
of God is promised,</hi> St. Mat. v. 3. poverty of spirit. Nay, the poor, and
vile, and base things too hath God chosen, saith St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> i. 28. the
poor are now elect, contrary quite to the fancy that the <hi>Iews</hi> had of them,
whose proverb it was, <hi>that the Spirit never descended upon the poor;</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to which it was then the cry, <hi>Can any good thing come out of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
any Prophet or great good come out of so poor a place as that?</p>
            <p>2. Know we again that Christs poverty above all, or poverty for his
sake is a grace indeed; for to you 'tis given, <hi>given as a great gift of grace
and honour to suffer for his name,</hi> Phil. i. 29. And 'tis a part of our calling,
says St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 21. a <hi>specialty</hi> of that grace.</p>
            <p>3. Know we (3.) that our <hi>Riches</hi> are his <hi>Grace</hi> too. In vain we rise up
early, and go late to bed; all our care, and pains, and labour is nothing
to make us rich without his blessing. <hi>The blessing of the Lord it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Know we however these may prove, the riches of Christ can prove
no other. All the vertues and graces of our souls, all the spiritual joy,
fulness, and contentment are meerly his, they the proper <hi>Grace</hi> of the
Lord Jesus Christ; no grace above them, no grace near them; nothing
can render us so gracious in the eyes of God as they, they are above
Gold, and Rubies, and precious Stones. These and all the rest being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57113:63"/>
in the Text, we may well acknowledge, that there was
good reason to put an Article, an Emphasis upon <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the grace.</p>
            <p>Yet to make all up, all these graces, you must know all the several
graces, outward and inward, come all from this one grace of Christs <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
poor,</hi> being made man, and becoming one of us. To this it is we
owe all we have or hope, to the Grace of Christ at Christmas; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now are to add some practice to all this knowledge, to return some
grace again for all this grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratia,</hi> is thanks, let's return that first; thank God and our Saviour
for this grace of his, whence all grace flows, and for all the several gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as they at any time flow down upon us. <hi>Gratia Deo,</hi> thanks to God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Gratia</hi> is <hi>good will</hi> and favour; let's shew that to others. <hi>Good will
towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But good will is not enough, good <hi>works are graces,</hi> let's study to
encrease and abound, and to be rich in them.</p>
            <p>4. Yet <hi>Gratia</hi> is in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> stile in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and elsewhere,
bounty and liberality to the poor; rich in this grace <hi>especially</hi> we are to
be. 'Tis the peculiar grace of <hi>Christmas,</hi> hospitality and bounty to the
poor. 'Tis the very grace St. <hi>Paul</hi> here provokes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to, by the
example of those of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia, ver.</hi> 1. who to their power
and beyond their power, he bears them witness were not only willing to
supply the necessities of the Saints, but even entreated him and them to
take it. By the example (2.) of <hi>Christ,</hi> who both became himself poor, that
we might be the more compassionate to the poor now he was in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and made us rich, that we might have wherewith to shew our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to them. Now surely if Christ be poor, and put himself among
them, who would not give freely to them, seeing he may chance even to
give to Christ himself among them when he gives? however, what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to any of them he owns it as to himself, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 40. <hi>What ye d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to any of the least of these my brethren, ye do it unto me.</hi> And can any that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
Christ be so wretchedly miserable as not to part with his mony up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this score? Can any be so ungrateful as not to give him a little who
gave them all? shall he become poor for our sakes, and we not shew our
selves rich for his? it were too little in reason not to make our selves poor
again for him, not to be as free to him as he to us. Yet he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a little for his all; that we should out of our abundance sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the want of his poor Members. He is gracious: Behold the grace of
our Lord, I, in this too, in complying with our infirmities, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
us as he might, to impoverish our selves with acts of mercy,
but to be only rich and abundant in them; to which yet he promises
more grace still, the reward of glory. Come ye blessed of my Father, ye
who supply and help my poor ones, come inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world, where ye that have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me in my poverty, or become poor for my sake, or have been rich in
bounty to the poor, as it were to a kind of poverty, shall then reign with
me amidst all the riches of eternal Glory.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>UT, <hi>Lord, What is man, or the Son of man that thou didst
this day visit him? that thou this day crownedst him with
that glory, didst him that honour?</hi> so we may begin to
<hi>day;</hi> for 'tis a day of wonder, of glory and worship;
to stand and wonder at Gods mercy to the sons of men,
and return him glory and worship for it.</p>
            <p>For, Lord, <hi>what is man,</hi> that the Son of God should
become the Son of man to visit him? that God should make <hi>him</hi> lower
then the Angels, who is so far above them, that he might crown <hi>us,</hi> who
are so far below them, with glory and honour equal to them or above
them? It was a strange mercy that God should make such a crum of
dust as man to have dominion over the works of his own hands, that he
should put all things in subjection under his feet; that he should make
the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> for him; and the <hi>Psalmist</hi> might very
well gaze and startle at it. But to make his <hi>Son</hi> such a thing of nought
too, such a <hi>Quid est,</hi> that no body can tell what it is, what to speak low
enough to express it, such a <hi>Novissimus hominum,</hi> such an abject thing as
man, such a cast-away as abject man, as the <hi>most</hi> abject man, bring him
below <hi>Angels,</hi> below men, and then raise him up to Glory again, that
he might raise up that vile thing called man together with him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Dominion when he had lost it; is so infinitely strange a mercy,
that 'tis nearer to amazement than to wonder.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Prophet</hi> here is in amaze, and knows not what to say:
<hi>Both</hi> these mercies he saw here, but he saw not how to speak them. Gods
mercy in mans Creation, and Gods mercy in mans Redemption too.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57113:64"/>
What God made man at first, and <hi>to</hi> what he exalted him when he had
made him. What God made his <hi>Son</hi> for man at last, what he made him
first and last, lower then the <hi>Angels</hi> first, higher then they at last, that he
might shew the wonders of his mercy to poor man both first and last.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>David</hi> did not see <hi>both</hi> in the words he spake, the <hi>Apostle</hi> did;
for to <hi>Christ</hi> he applies them, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 6, 7. And that's authority good
enough for us to do so, to bring it for a <hi>Christmas</hi> Text; especially Christ
himself applying the second verse, <hi>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
hast thou ordained strength,</hi> as spoken in relation to himself, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi.
16. And that's authority somewhat stronger. Yet to omit nothing of
Gods mercy, to do right on all hands to <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Apostle,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> too,
we shall take them in both senses. To refer them to man, the plain let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the whole design and context of the <hi>Psalm</hi> is sufficient reason.
To understand them yet of <hi>Christ,</hi> he himself and his <hi>Apostle</hi> will bear us
out. And though the Text be full of wonder, it is no wonder that it has
two senses; most of the old <hi>Testament</hi> and <hi>Prophesies</hi> have so, a lower and
a higher, a literal and a more sublime sense. Thus <hi>out of Egypt have I called
my son,</hi> Hos. xi. i. <hi>Rachels weeping for her children,</hi> Jer. xxxi. 14. <hi>I have set
my King upon my holy Hill of Sion,</hi> Psal. ii. 6. all applied to Christ or his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and affairs, and yet spoken first to other purposes, of <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
I should lose time to collect more places. 'Tis better I should tell
you the sum of this, that it is the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> wonder at Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards <hi>man,</hi> and his dealing towards <hi>Christ,</hi> that he should deal so
highly <hi>mercifully</hi> towards man, and so highly <hi>strangely</hi> towards Christ;
so mercifully with man as to remember him, to visit him, to make him
but <hi>little lower then the Angels,</hi> and <hi>crown him with glory and worship.</hi> So
strangely with <hi>Christ,</hi> as to make him a Son of man, and lower then the
Angels first, then afterward to crown him with glory and worship:
Things all to be highly wondered at. And the Text best to be divided,
into <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> and <hi>Davids wonder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>Gods mercy</hi> manifested here in three particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>In his dealing with man. What is man?</hi> &amp;c. In the literal sense of the
words.</item>
               <item>2. In his dealing with Christ, <hi>in respect to man.</hi> What is the Son of man?</item>
               <item>3. In his dealing with man, in the sublimer sense of the Text, again
in respect to Christ, what is man, and the Son of man? in the same sense
too.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. <hi>His mercy in his dealing with man</hi> will best appear (1.) by what he did:
And (2.) for whom he did it; that he should do so much for man, that
he should do it for so little; so little, so inconsiderable a thing as man.</p>
            <p>Six branches there are here of what he did.</p>
            <p>1. He was and is ever <hi>mindful of him.</hi> (2.) <hi>He visits him.</hi> (3.) <hi>He made him
but a little lower then the Angels,</hi> but one step below. (4.) He did that only
too to exalt him, <hi>to crown him,</hi> as we read it. (5.) <hi>He crown'd him also.</hi> (6.)
<hi>He crown'd him with glory</hi> and with worship too.</p>
            <p>If you will know (2.) for whom all this. 'Tis</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>man. Adam,</hi> a piece of clay.</p>
            <p>2. For the <hi>Son</hi> of man. <hi>Enos,</hi> a piece of misery.</p>
            <p>3. For a meer <hi>quid est,</hi> for a thing we know not what to call it.</p>
            <p>4. 'Tis for one that the <hi>Prophet</hi> wonders God should mind or think on,
that he should come into Gods mind, much more into his eye to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him: such a one that 'tis a wonder he should be thought on.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>His dealing with Christ</hi> in respect to man, which is the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57113:64"/>
of the words, is a second <hi>manifesto</hi> of his mercy, and shew'd</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In his Exinanition,</hi> that God for mans sake should (1.) make him
<hi>lower then the Angels.</hi> That (2.) he should make him so low as <hi>man.</hi> As
<hi>man</hi> (3.) and the <hi>Son of man:</hi> Such a Son of man (4.) that we cannot
know how to name him, such a <hi>quid est,</hi> such a we cannot tell what, a
<hi>wonder,</hi> a <hi>gazing-stock,</hi> not worth seeing or remembring; and all only
that man by him might be visited and remembred.</p>
            <p>2. In his <hi>Exaltation.</hi> That notwithstanding all this, God should a while
afterwards remember him, <hi>visit</hi> him, <hi>crown</hi> him, <hi>crown him with glory and
honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. And both <hi>Exinanition</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> (3.) that he might yet <hi>visit</hi>
man the more, remember him with greater mercies, crown him with
richer graces, crown him with higher honours here then he did in the
Creation, and with higher glory hereafter then the first nature could
pretend to.</p>
            <p>Upon all these, the <hi>second</hi> general, the <hi>Prophets wonder</hi> comes in well;
will follow handsomely, as the conclusion of all, the <hi>application</hi> of all, to
teach us to wonder and admire at all this mercy, and take up the Text
and say it after <hi>David,</hi> What is man, Lord, what is man that thou, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may wonder and worship too, and give God Glory and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for this wonderful mercy, for the glory and worship that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us: I begin now to shew you his mercy in all the acts here specified;
and the first is, his being <hi>mindful</hi> of us, or <hi>remembring</hi> us.</p>
            <p>1. And he remembers that <hi>we are but dust,</hi> Psal. ciii. 14. and so deals
accordingly, blows not too hard upon us, lest he should blow us clean
away: that's a good remembrance, to remember not to hurt us; and the
Lord <hi>hath been mindful of us,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist</hi> again, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxv. 12. hath
and will ever be <hi>mindful of his Covenant,</hi> Psal. cxi. 5. though we too often
forget <hi>ours,</hi> The <hi>Bride may forget her ornaments,</hi> Jer. ii. 32. <hi>and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her sucking child,</hi> Isa. xlix. 15. <hi>Yet will not I</hi> (says God) <hi>forget you.</hi> The
<hi>Hebrew</hi> here is in the <hi>future,</hi> as the <hi>Latin</hi> is in the <hi>present:</hi> but all times
are alike with God; what he is, he will be to us; even when he seems to
forget us, he is mindful of us. <hi>Recordaris operationum ei,</hi> says the <hi>Chaldee.</hi>
Thou remembrest his works, to reward them; but that's too narrow.
Thou remembrest <hi>his substance,</hi> all <hi>his bones</hi> and members, forgettest none,
to preserve them. Thou remembrest his soul to speak comfortably to it.
Thou remembrest his body to feed and clothe it. Thou remembrest his
goings out and his comings in, to direct and prosper them. Thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest
his very tears, and puttest them up in bottles; <hi>all these things are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his book,</hi> Psal. cxxxix. 15. put down there. When we are shut up in
the Ark, and all the Floods about us, then he remembers us as he did
<hi>Noah,</hi> and in due time calls us out. When we are unhappily fall'n into
<hi>Sodom</hi> among wicked hands, and the City ready to be all on fire about
our ears, then he remembers us as he did <hi>Lot,</hi> nay, as he did <hi>Abraham</hi>
rather when he delivered <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> xix. 29. He is so good, that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
us for one another: remembers us for <hi>Abrahams, Isaacs, Iacobs,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
sake: remembers the Son for the Father, the Nephew for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the Friend for the Friends, <hi>Iobs</hi> friends for <hi>Iobs</hi> sake, <hi>Iob</hi> xlii. 8.
So mindful is God of us, so continually minding us, such a care of us he
has, he careth for <hi>all; no God like him for the care of all,</hi> Wisd. xii. 13. I
would <hi>we</hi> were as careful again to please him, as mindful of him.</p>
            <p>2. And yet (2.) he is not only mindful of man, but <hi>visits</hi> him too.
And <hi>thy visitation,</hi> says Holy <hi>Iob has preserved my spirit,</hi> Job x. 12. Will
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57113:65"/>
you know what that is? <hi>Thou hast granted me life and favour;</hi> so the words
run just before; not <hi>life</hi> only (for his being mindful of us says that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently)
but <hi>favour</hi> also: his visiting intimates some new favour, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above life and safety.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>visiting</hi> is sometimes <hi>punishing, I will visit their sin,</hi> Exod. xxxii.
34. And 'tis a mercy to man sometimes that God visits and punishes him;
it keeps him from sin, increases him in grace, advances him in glory.
And what is man that thou <hi>thus</hi> visitest him, O Lord, and sufferest him
not to run headlong to destruction, though he so deserve it?</p>
            <p>But <hi>visiting</hi> here (2.) is in a softer, <hi>milder</hi> way, 'tis to bestow some
favour on us. Thus holy <hi>Iob,</hi> in words somewhat like the Text, <hi>What is
man that thou shouldst magnifie him,</hi> and <hi>that thou shouldst set thine heart upon
him?</hi> and that <hi>thou shouldst visit him every morning, and try him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Job vii. 17, 18. So, Gods visiting in <hi>Iobs</hi> interpretation is a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of man, a setting of his heart upon him to do him good, a visiting
him with some mercy or other every morning, a purging and purifying
him from tin and dross. In the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s stile it is the <hi>performing
his good word</hi> unto us, <hi>Ier.</hi> xxix. 10. And in the <hi>Psalmists,</hi> a <hi>Visiting with
his salvation,</hi> Psal. cvi. 4. Great mercy without question.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that he <hi>visits</hi> us by his <hi>Son,</hi> to bring us to salvation. Thus
good old <hi>Zachariah</hi> understood it, when he starts out as it were on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with his <hi>Benedictus, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited
and redeemed his people,</hi> S. Luke i. 68. He visits us when we are sick, and
heals our <hi>sicknesses;</hi> he visits us in our sadness, and dispels our <hi>sorrows;</hi> he
visits us in prison, and pays our <hi>Debts;</hi> he visits us in our dangers, and
delivers us <hi>out;</hi> he visits us in our prosperities, and <hi>rejoyces</hi> with us in
them; he visits us by his Mercies, by his Prophets, by his Graces, by
his Spirit: yet all these are nothing to this <hi>visiting</hi> by his <hi>Son,</hi> or little
they are without it; or else they are all included in it: health and joy,
liberty and deliverance, peace and mercy, comfort and instruction, grace
and spirit, all in it, all in the coming down of Christ to visit us. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
is thy mercy that thou thus doest visit poor sinful man!</p>
            <p>3. But thou wert infinitely merciful to him long before, when thou
first madest him, when thou madest him but little lower then the Angels.
(3.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> some <hi>little</hi> thing, but not <hi>much.</hi> Thou gavest him understanding
as thou didst them, only theirs is a little clearer, and without <hi>discourse.</hi>
But <hi>they</hi> understand, and so does <hi>man. They</hi> have wills, and so has <hi>he.</hi>
They are <hi>spirits,</hi> and he has <hi>one. They</hi> are Gods Ministers, and so is <hi>man;</hi>
only they do all with more nimbleness and perfection; for they have no
bodies but to hinder them, but man has. In <hi>that</hi> he is somewhat under
them, yet not much neither, since <hi>Christ</hi> has so exalted our nature as to
unite it to the Godhead, and made all his <hi>Angels</hi> worship it.</p>
            <p>And which takes much too from this diminution, this <hi>minuisti eum,</hi> it
is but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in a second sense for a <hi>little while,</hi> (for so 'tis possible to be
rendred) whilst we live here, for a few years and days: It will not be
long e're we be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>Angels</hi> we are now <hi>below,</hi> S. Luke xx. 36.</p>
            <p>And yet we are a degree nearer to them now, if we expound the words
that we render <hi>Angels,</hi> as S. <hi>Ierome, Pagnin,</hi> and some others do. The
word is <hi>Elohim,</hi> one of the <hi>names</hi> of God; and St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> found a
Translation with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he made us but a little lower then <hi>God
himself.</hi> And may well seem so when he sets a <hi>Dixi dii estis</hi> upon us, <hi>Psal.</hi>
lxxxii. 6. tells us that he said <hi>we were Gods,</hi> and <hi>the Children of the most
High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:57113:65"/>
4. But (4.) bear it what sense it will, what diminution it can, it is
all but to exalt us by it, to crown us; thou hast made Christ to crown him,
only to crown; so we read it in the old Translation: our very <hi>diminutions</hi>
are sent us to augment our <hi>glory.</hi> So infinitely great is Gods mercy to us,
that our very lessenings are for our greatning: A rare excess of mercy to
make us <hi>lower,</hi> so to make us <hi>higher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And 'tis high indeed when it exalts us to a <hi>Crown,</hi> and past doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too, when it comes to a <hi>coronasti,</hi> thou hast done it, as 'tis here both
in the old <hi>Latin,</hi> and the new <hi>English,</hi> certain to hold too, not to be one
of those corruptible Crowns the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of, of <hi>Bays</hi> or <hi>Laurel</hi> in the
<hi>Olympick</hi> games, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. If we add the other reading mentioned by
St. <hi>Chrysostome, Coronabis,</hi> Thou shalt crown him; hast already, and shalt
<hi>again,</hi> shalt <hi>continue</hi> crowning him. Here's a mercy will hold as well as
stretch, as <hi>everlasting</hi> as 'tis <hi>infinite.</hi> Two senses there are of <hi>Coronasti,</hi> of
this crowning; it may signifie either plenty, or reward. <hi>Thou crownest the
year with thy goodness,</hi> Ps. lxv. 11. <hi>He crowneth thee with loving kindness,</hi> Psal.
ciii. 4. In both it signifies an abundance of mercies, and blessings. But he
shall <hi>receive a crown,</hi> St. James i. 12. is the same with a high reward. In
both senses God crowns man here, with the fulness of heaven and earth,
gives him liberty to feed and clothe himself with what he pleases, keeps
nothing of all his plenty from him; and which is more, gives him it as
it were a reward for his labour, though it be vastly far above all his
pains.</p>
            <p>6. If this reward be <hi>glory</hi> now (6.) as here it is, he has put a crown of
Gold indeed upon his head, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks. The glory to be made
after the very image and likeness of God himself, and to be made so at
a consultation with so much solemnity, that's the <hi>glory</hi> here. It was a
kind of one to be made somewhat near the <hi>Angels</hi> likeness; but
to have <hi>Gods</hi> added to it is, glory upon glory. What glory like Gods? what
glory of man like that to be like God?</p>
            <p>Having <hi>honour</hi> added to this glory, that all the creatures should do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to him, the fiercest and stubbornest of them submit their necks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet, and the very crooked <hi>Serpent</hi> creeps away as afraid of him;
none of them dare to lift him up a <hi>head,</hi> or a <hi>horn,</hi> a <hi>paw</hi> or <hi>crest,</hi> or <hi>hiss</hi>
against him; for the Fowls of the Air, and Fishes of the Sea, all of
them to serve to his command and use, <hi>What is man become now, What hast
thou made him thus, O God?</hi> Much of this glory I confess is now departed
from him, or blurred, or sullied in him, that we can see little of his
former purer rays, by reason of his own sin and folly; yet <hi>thus</hi>
God made him, all this he did for him, and the <hi>glimmerings</hi> of all these
glories and mercies are still upon him. And the mercy peradventure is the
greater, though the glory be the less, in that notwithstanding all mans
demerits, he yet continues in some degree or other all these mercies to
him. You will see it still the greater if you now consider who it is all this
is done to, who it is that God thus <hi>remembers, visits, makes,</hi> and <hi>crowns</hi>
with glory and worship.</p>
            <p>A worshipful piece God wot, a poor thing call'd <hi>man,</hi> stil'd <hi>Adam</hi> here,
a piece of clay and dirt, <hi>ex limo,</hi> a pure clod, a meer walking pitcher,
brittle, and dirty too; and the dirtier since his fall.</p>
            <p>Miserable (2.) besides. <hi>Enos</hi> is a second word the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here expresses
man withal; and that signifies a sad, sick, calamitous, miserable, incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
wretch; and which adds to it so by <hi>descent</hi> too, and by entail never
here to be cut off: <hi>Filius Enos,</hi> the Son of man, the son of misery; he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57113:66"/>
comes crying into the world, as if he foresaw it, e're he well could
see, and felt it at his first appearance. How innumerable are the <hi>troubles,</hi>
how unavoidable the <hi>necessities,</hi> how incredible the <hi>mischances,</hi> how num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless
the <hi>sicknesses,</hi> how unsupportable the <hi>infirmities</hi> that surround him
from his first hour? infinite need there is that God should be mindful of
him, that he should have some eye upon him, and regard him; for he
comes in helpless into the world, and continues so if God help him not.</p>
            <p>This is that then (3.) makes the <hi>Prophet</hi> come with a <hi>quid est,</hi> Lord what
a <hi>thing is this?</hi> what a thing is man? a thing so <hi>hidden</hi> with infirmities, so
<hi>covered</hi> with misfortunes, so <hi>clouded</hi> with griefs, so <hi>compassed</hi> with sorrows,
so <hi>wrapt</hi> up in night and darkness, in sins and miseries, that one knows
not what it is, or how to christen it.</p>
            <p>Such a thing only we may conceive it, (and we cannot conceive half of
its poornesses and emptinesses) that we can only gape and wonder at it. In
the 144. Psalm, where the <hi>Psalmist</hi> propounds this question as it were again
of <hi>what is man?</hi> He answers presently, <hi>ver. 4. Man is like a thing of nought,
his time passeth away like a shadow.</hi> He is not so much as a thing; he is but
<hi>like</hi> it, though that very thing be a thing of <hi>nought</hi> too; a meer <hi>shadow</hi> of
a <hi>thing</hi> of <hi>nought</hi> he is, which we may well wonder at, but cannot well
imagine, and wonder again that God should think of such a shadow as
he, that he should be mindful of the dust of the earth, that he should
regard the dirt, that he should visit a we know not <hi>what,</hi> that he should
raise a piece of clay so near Angels and himself, that he should crown
such a dunghil of wretchedness and misery, that he should bestow his
glory upon such a shadow, and worship upon the dust of his feet, and
the dirt under him. <hi>O Lord how wonderful is thy goodness towards the children
of men!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis more wonderful for all that, if we now consider his dealing with
his <hi>own Son,</hi> for the sakes of the Sons of <hi>men.</hi> The second particular of
his mercy, that for man and the Sons of men he has made this Text to be
said of <hi>him</hi> also, made him a thing to be wondred at, by his dealing with
him both by his <hi>Exinanition</hi> and by his <hi>Exaltation.</hi> To him now we come
to apply the words, for to <hi>him</hi> they properly belong. Where first we will
find out his <hi>Exinanition,</hi> or his being emptied and abased, to be wondred
at.</p>
            <p>What is <hi>man?</hi> so only before; but what is now the <hi>best</hi> of men, the
<hi>Son</hi> of man himself? The term of <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>man</hi> is very proper unto <hi>Christ;</hi>
called so by <hi>Daniel</hi> long before he was so, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 13. And it may bear
a note, that <hi>Christ,</hi> he only is properly <hi>filius hominis</hi> in the singular, the
Son of man single, born of the Virgin without a man. Others are <hi>filii ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi>
in the plural: every one is so, born by the help of two, Father and
Mother both. But notwithstanding man, and the Son of man are dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions
to the Son of God; for to have been made like Angels had been
a high derogation; but lower then <hi>they,</hi> what shall I call it?</p>
            <p>But (2.) So low as man, can you lend me a word for it? for <hi>what is
man,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> should be made <hi>one?</hi> I have told you over and over what he
is, but what art thou O blessed God that thou should'st be made such a
things as he?</p>
            <p>Or (3.) if man he must be made, what need he be made the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>man</hi>
yet? He might have brought a humane nature down from heaven, that
had been fittest for him: an incorruptible humanity. To be man and the
Son of man, rottenness of rottenness, vanity of vanity (for man in the
<hi>Psalmists</hi> phrase is nothing else) there's a <hi>debasement</hi> below <hi>debasement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57113:66"/>
And yet (4.) to be such a Son of man, that has a <hi>quid est,</hi> a <hi>si quis</hi>
writ over him, to enquire who he is, so obscure and ignoble that neither
<hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Esau</hi> can discern him; but <hi>Esau</hi> with a <hi>quis est,</hi> Isa. lxiii. 1. and
<hi>David</hi> here with a <hi>quid est</hi> only can decipher him; without <hi>form</hi> or <hi>comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
form or fashion, or name, or title, one despised and rejected even of
men, a man of <hi>sorrows,</hi> and <hi>acquainted with griefs,</hi> one that men would
<hi>hide their faces from,</hi> as the Prophet speaks of him, <hi>Isa.</hi> liii. 2, 3. to be
made such a one as this; we may all wonder indeed, Prophets and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
all of us, nay, be all amazed at it.</p>
            <p>I can shew you him yet lower, (5.) <hi>Lower then the Angels,</hi> that we have
told you; but they were good ones: but <hi>malis etiam,</hi> so S. <hi>Austin,</hi> lower
then the bad ones: Laid under their cruelty and fury in his death, and
not over them surely always in his life. When the Devil was permitted
to carry him from Mountain to Mountain, to the Pinacle of the Temple,
or where he pleases, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. <hi>This</hi> is stranger still.</p>
            <p>Yet this might be a glory, as a trial: but (6.) to be visited, that is
punished, and not after the visitation of all men neither, but even the
basest, to be a man raised up for punishment, made to be scourged, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and abus'd, <hi>A homo quoniam visitas, made man</hi> only to be <hi>punished;</hi>
the Son of man only to be under the power and lash of man, the worst of
men too, the basest of the people, scorn'd and spit upon, beaten and
buffeted, torn, and rent, and lash'd, and pierc'd by who would of them:
What wonder is there not in his <hi>thus</hi> being made the Son of man?</p>
            <p>But lastly to be as it were out of <hi>Gods</hi> mind the while, so visited by
him, as if he were no way mindful of him, as if he had clean forgotten
him, who he was, remembred not at all that he was his Son he us'd so,
that he was forc'd to cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> art
no more mindful of me? This is a <hi>quid est,</hi> beyond the very Text, a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that is above what is explicite there. Yet <hi>such</hi> a man he was made
too; so that we may justly now ask, <hi>quid est,</hi> in the highest key, what is
man? what is <hi>this</hi> man? what is the business, what the matter that all
this is done unto him? that God thus <hi>makes</hi> and <hi>unmakes</hi> him, and makes
him again we know not what.</p>
            <p>And we should more wonder yet, but for the following words (2.) that
all this is but to <hi>crown</hi> him with <hi>glory,</hi> and honour. But that affords us a
new wonder still, that God should so crown such a one as this <hi>he</hi> we
speak of. And to speak truth, his <hi>exaltation</hi> after all this, the exaltation
of our humane nature in him, as poor, wretched, and contemptible as it
is, a new work of wonder.</p>
            <p>Had it been a nature <hi>born</hi> and <hi>fram'd</hi> to glory, it had been none at all;
had it been a King, or of the Royal Lineage to have been crown'd, there
had been no strangeness in it: but to crown a <hi>worm,</hi> to crown the very
<hi>scorn of men,</hi> as he terms himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxii. 6. with glory, and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast
of the people</hi> with honour and worship, this is a <hi>quis enarrabit,</hi> who can
declare this generation; how it should come to a crown?</p>
            <p>Yet before we come to speak of that, let's go through the lower parts
of his exaltation: And as poor a thing as God made him (and that was
poor enough) yet did he not forget him. He was so mindful of him even
in his low estate, that he gave his <hi>Angels charge over him,</hi> would not let his
foot slip, or dash against a stone, would not suffer a bone of him to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or one tittle of his Covenant to fail him: sent his Angels too to
look after, to minister to him; a whole host of them to declare him this
day to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57113:67"/>
Nay, (2.) came and visited him <hi>himself, he</hi> and his Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> with
him at his <hi>Baptism, he</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> with him in the Mount, where
he gave testimony he was his Son, his <hi>beloved Son, in whom he was well
pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, (3.) that which might seem in one sort a diminution, was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
an exaltation: he made him but a <hi>little lower then the Angels,</hi> was an
exalting him, when it made even his <hi>Body</hi> little inferiour to their <hi>Spirit;</hi>
and that it did, when he could pass through a crowd of people as invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
as an immaterial Spirit, S. <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 30. Nay, before that, when he
came into the world without any blemish to his Mothers Virginity; as
if he had been a <hi>Spirit,</hi> not a <hi>Body:</hi> and after that, when he arose out of
his Tomb, the stone upon it, when he entred and the doors were shut,
when he vanish'd out of sight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they knew not how he went. <hi>Paulo
minus angelis</hi> indeed: this is little less then Angels I can tell you. But St.
<hi>Austin</hi> tells you more, <hi>Naturâ humanâ Christi Deum solum majorem,</hi> That God
only is greater then Christs humane nature. The <hi>Hypostatical</hi> union to the
Deity has made it so; and those infinite graces of his soul are somewhat
more then <hi>paulo minus,</hi> above the Angels rarest endowments.</p>
            <p>Yet this is nothing to the <hi>Crown</hi> that follows; for we see <hi>Iesus,</hi> says
the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Who was made a little lower then the Angels, for the
suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
so <hi>Enthymius</hi> thinks it may be read without a comma, above the Angels
with glory and honour hast thou crowned him, with a glory beyond
theirs. Indeed four Crowns he was crowned with, a Crown of <hi>Flesh,</hi> with
that his Mother crown'd him in his Incarnation, <hi>Cant.</hi> iii. 11. A Crown
of <hi>Thorns,</hi> with that the Souldiers crown'd him at his Passion, St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
xix. 2. A Crown of <hi>Precious Stones, De lapide pretioso,</hi> at his Resurrection:
The four endowments of glorious Bodies, <hi>Charity, Agility, Impossibility,</hi>
and <hi>Incorruptibility,</hi> were the Stones of it. And a Crown of pure Gold at
his Ascension, when he shone like the Son in <hi>gloria,</hi> and went up <hi>cum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi>
with a crown or ring of blessed Saints, into the highest Heavens.
With these two last God crowned him, these two were his exaltation,
and the crown or reward of the two other.</p>
            <p>And to make this Crown the more glistering and glorious, here's <hi>honour</hi>
added to it, <hi>A name given him above every name,</hi> that at the mention of it
<hi>every knee is now to bow, both of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things
under the Earth,</hi> Phil. ii. 9, 10. made <hi>better then the Angels,</hi> Heb. i. 4. so
much better that all things, even the Angels themselves, <hi>Authorities and
Powers, all sorts of Angels are made subject unto him,</hi> 1 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 22. and are
therefore bid all to worship him, says St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> i. 6. Such honour has
<hi>Christ</hi> after his humiliation; and we may expect some after ours: If we
humble our selves, we also shall be exalted, and crowned with glory. And
so it seems we are entitled to it by the sufferings of the Son of man, and
by his visiting us, our glory is much encreased by his Glory, our honour
higher by his Redemption, then in our first Creation; so that we may now
well take up the words again, and pronounce them with greater asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
still, that he should so remember, visit, and crown his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
people as he does.</p>
            <p>For what is man indeed that God should redeem him at so great a price?
what access can it be to God to raise him out of his ruines? might he
not more easily have made a new stock of men of better natures, than have
redeemed <hi>Adam</hi>'s?</p>
            <p>Or (2.) if he would have needs so much magnified his love as to have
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57113:67"/>
redeem'd him, because he had made him; would not a restoring of him
to his <hi>first</hi> estate have been well enough, but that he must raise him to a
<hi>higher?</hi> Without doubt it had, but that God in mercy thinks nothing too
much for him.</p>
            <p>It appears so by his remembring him. Man was a true <hi>Enos,</hi> and that
is <hi>obliviscens,</hi> a forgetful piece; yet God remembers him, and comes
down in the evening of his fall, a few minutes after it, and raises him
up with a promise of the seed of the Woman, to set all streight again.
There he did as well visit as remember him.</p>
            <p>And in the pursuance of this singular mercy, he still (2.) visits him
<hi>every morning,</hi> morning and evening too; visits by his <hi>Angels,</hi> by his
<hi>Priests,</hi> by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> by his <hi>Mercies,</hi> by his <hi>Iudgments,</hi> by his <hi>Son,</hi> by
his Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> by daily <hi>motions,</hi> and inspirations. These are the visits
he hourly makes us since he visited us by his Son, far more plentifully
than before; more abundant grace, more gracious visits; for if his Son
be once formed in us, he will never give over visiting till he crown us.</p>
            <p>Yet (3.) by degrees he raises us up to some Angelical purities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
before he crown us: our nature is much elevated by the Grace
of Christ; and what the <hi>Iew</hi> did only to the outward letter, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to do to the Spirit of it, to inward purity as well as the outward.
Thus and thus you heard of old, says Christ, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 21. but I say
more, not a wanton <hi>look,</hi> not a murtherous <hi>thought,</hi> not a reproachful
<hi>word,</hi> not the <hi>slightest</hi> Oath. He would refine us fain somewhat near the
Angels, to be pure as they.</p>
            <p>But (4.) we shall not do it <hi>gratis;</hi> he will <hi>crown</hi> us for it, quicken us
together with <hi>Christ, raise us up together, and make us sit together in heavenly
places,</hi> in Christ Jesus, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 5, 6. Honours us with the name of <hi>friends,</hi>
reveals himself unto us, fills us with the riches of <hi>Christ,</hi> adopts us to be
his Sons, makes us members of <hi>Christ,</hi> partakers of his Spirit, makes
himself one with us, and we with him; washes us by one <hi>Sacrament,</hi> feeds
us by <hi>another;</hi> comforts us by his word, compasses with the ministrations
of righteousness that exceeds in glory; pardons our sins, heals our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
strengthens our weaknesses, replenishes us with graces, urges us
with favours, makes us with <hi>open face behold them as in a glass, behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Lord, and changes us at last into the same image from glory to glory,</hi> Eph.
iii. 18. <hi>What is man, O Lord,</hi> or the Son of man that thou shouldst do thus
unto him? And what are we, O Lord, what are we that we are so insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of thy mercies? what base, vile, unworthy things are we, if we do
not now pour out our selves in thanks and wonder, in praise and glory
for this exceeding glory!</p>
            <p>Wonder we (1.) stand we and wonder, or cast our selves upon the
earth, upon our faces, in amazement at it, that God should do all this
for <hi>us;</hi> thus remember, thus visit, thus crown such things as <hi>we.</hi> That
(2.) he should pass by the <hi>Angels</hi> to crown us, leave them in their sins and
misery, and lift us out of <hi>ours.</hi> That (3.) he should not take their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at the least, and honour those that stood among them, but take up
ours, and wear it into heaven, and seat it there.</p>
            <p>And there is a <hi>visit</hi> he is now coming to <hi>day</hi> to make us, as much to be
wondred at as any, that he should feed us with his <hi>Body,</hi> and yet <hi>that</hi> be
in Heaven; that he should cheer us with his <hi>Blood,</hi> and yet <hi>that</hi> shed so
long ago: that he should set his Throne, and keep his Table and presence
upon the Earth, and yet Heaven his Throne, and Earth his Foot-stool:
that he should here pose all our understandings with his mysterious work,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57113:68"/>
and so many ages of Christians after so many years of study and assistance
of the Spirit, not yet be able to understand it. <hi>What is man,</hi> or the <hi>Son of
man,</hi> O <hi>Blessed Iesu,</hi> that thou shouldst thus also visit and <hi>confound</hi> him with
the wonders of thy mercy and goodness!</p>
            <p>Here also is <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> too, to be admitted to his Table; no where
so great; to be made one with him, as the meat is with the body: no
glory like it. Here is the crown of plenty, fulness of pardon, grace, and
heavenly Benediction. Here's the crown of glory, nothing but rays, and
beauties, Iustres and glories to be seen in <hi>Christ,</hi> and darted from him into
pious souls. Come take your crowns, come compass your selves with
those eternal circlings.</p>
            <p>Take now the <hi>cup of salvation,</hi> and remember God for so remembring
you: call upon the name of the Lord, and give glory to your God. If
you cannot speak out fully (as who can speak in such amazements as
these thoughts may seriously work in us) cast your selves down in silence,
and utter out your souls in these or the like broken speeches. <hi>What is man,
Lord what is man? What am I? How poor a thing am I? How good art thou?
What hast thou done unto him? How great things? What glory, what honour,
what crown</hi> hast thou reserved for <hi>me? What shall I</hi> say? <hi>How shall I suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
admire? What shall I do again unto thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shalt thou do? Why (1.) if God is so mindful of us men, Let
us be mindful of him again; remember he is always with us, and do all
things as if we remembred that so he were.</p>
            <p>2. Is he so mindful of us? Let us be mindful of our <hi>selves,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>what</hi> we are, that we may be humbled at it.</p>
            <p>3. Does he remember <hi>us?</hi> Let us then again remember <hi>him</hi> with our
prayers and services.</p>
            <p>2. Has he visited us? Let us in thankfulness visit him again, visit him
in his <hi>Temple,</hi> visit him at his <hi>Table,</hi> visit him in his <hi>poor</hi> members, the
sick, the imprisoned.</p>
            <p>3. Has he made us lower then the Angels? Let us make our selves low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and lower still in our own sights. Is it yet but a <hi>little</hi> lower then the
Angels? Let us raise up thoughts, and pieties, and devotions to be <hi>equal</hi>
with them.</p>
            <p>4. Has he <hi>crown'd</hi> us with glory? Let us crown his <hi>Altars</hi> then with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and his <hi>name</hi> with praise; let us be often in <hi>corona,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of them that praise him, among such as keep <hi>Holy-day.</hi> Let us
crown his <hi>Courts</hi> with beauty, crown our <hi>selves</hi> with good works; they
should be our glory, and our crown: And for the worship that he crowns
us with too, let us worship and give him honour, so remember, so visit,
so crown him again; so shall he, as he has already, so shall still remember
us last, and bring us to his own palace, there to visit him face to face,
where he shall make us equal to the Angels we are now below, and
crown us with an incorruptible crown of glory: through Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</p>
                  <p>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.</p>
                  <p>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Alvation cannot but be a welcome then at any time. I
know no day amiss. But in <hi>Die salutis,</hi> at such a time
as this, on <hi>Christmas-day</hi> especially. Then it first came
down to bless this lower world.</p>
            <p>But salvation so nigh as to be <hi>seen</hi> is more; much
more if we our selves have any interest in it, if it be
for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too, that <hi>we</hi> also may come in. Far
more, if it be such salvation, that our friends also may be saved with us,
none perish: if it be <hi>omnium populorum,</hi> to 'um all in whatsoever Nation.</p>
            <p>Add yet, if it be salvation by <hi>light,</hi> not in the night, no obscure delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
we like that better; and if it be to be saved not by running away,
but gloriously: Salvation with <hi>Glory,</hi> that's better still. Nay, if it be <hi>all,</hi>
salvation on a <hi>day</hi> of salvation, not afar off, but within <hi>ken,</hi> not heard
of, but <hi>seen,</hi> to us and ours, an <hi>universal</hi> salvation, a gladsome, a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
a notable, a glorious salvation, as it is without contradiction, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum

            <p>These make the Text near enough the <hi>day;</hi> and yet 'tis nearer. What
say you if this salvation prove to be a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi>
and that <hi>Christ</hi> new born, the first time that <hi>viderunt oculi</hi> could be said of
him, no time so proper as <hi>Christmas</hi> to speak of <hi>Christ</hi> the Saviour, born
and sent into the world. He it is, that is here stiled <hi>salutare tuum.</hi> Christ,
that blessed sight that restores <hi>Simeons</hi> decaying eyes to their youthful
lustre, that happy burthen, that makes <hi>Simeon</hi> grasp heaven before he
enter it.</p>
            <p>Indeed the good old man begins not <hi>his</hi> Christmas till Candlemas:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57113:69"/>
'Twas not Christmas-day with him, he did not see his Saviour till he
was presented in the Temple. The Feast of Purification was his Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.
<hi>This</hi> the Shepherds, the worlds, and <hi>ours.</hi> This day first he was
seen visibly to the world.</p>

about by the circling of the year, expects now the solemnities of our
joys and thanksgivings? You see the <hi>day</hi> it self is in the Text; and now
we have seen <hi>that,</hi> let's look into the occasion of it, what 'tis that makes
it <hi>Holy-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something seen or done upon it, what's that? <hi>Salutare tuum,</hi> says the
Text; a Saviour seen and a salvation wrought, nay, this seen too, for
<hi>viderunt oculi</hi> to both, if they be two. There is but one word for both,
and it may be they may be but one. However distinguish them we will
for a while, though we unite them in the upshot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salvation. Simeon</hi> might with as much ease have call'd him <hi>Saviour;</hi> but that
he thought too little. You would have blam'd his eye-fight had he seen no
more. <hi>Saviours</hi> there have been many. <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Ieptha,</hi> and
<hi>Samson.</hi> I cannot tell you how many, and they have brought salvation in
their times and sav'd their people; but none of all was ever made salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but this days Saviour, who is made unto us <hi>righteousness and salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Made to us; is that all? nay, is <hi>it</hi> in himself. Other Saviours when
they have saved others, themselves they could not save. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did still stand in need of being sav'd. <hi>Christ</hi> needs none other but
himself. He is <hi>Salvation,</hi> no Saviour so but <hi>he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>This</hi> Salvation. Many Saviours and Salvations too without doubt
had aged <hi>Simeon</hi> seen in the large circuit of his years without a <hi>Nunc di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittis;</hi>

world; his life grows tedious to him, he would be going. What means
this hasting to his Grave, when he folds salvation in his arms? Why;
this it is that gives it a pre-eminence above all beside. Death now it self
is conquer'd, and <hi>now first</hi> to die is to be saved. Salvation not only from
Death, but from the <hi>terrours</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Salvation is a deliverance, a deliverance is from some evil of sin or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
To be deliver'd from punishment, be it but the loss of goods,
of liberty, or health, is a kind of Salvation; and if the loss be great
we are deliver'd from, the salvation great: but if the punishment stretch
it self beyond the limits of fading time, if it be to be extended through
eternity, the deliverance then great without question, well deserves the

            <p>To be deliver'd from punishment and eternal punishment is no small
matter beyond all humane power: yet from sin is far beyond it. If we
be not sav'd from <hi>that,</hi> 'tis but an incomplete, a partial salvation from

               <hi>these</hi> eyes. No longer now the eyes of Prophesie, those are
grown dim, and almost out. <hi>Isaiah</hi> indeed could say <hi>is</hi> born, <hi>is</hi> given, so

to see it; one degree, <hi>this,</hi> above the <hi>infallibility</hi> of <hi>Prophesie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Time was when this <hi>Salutare tuum</hi> was inveloped in clouds: It was so
till this day came, a mystery kept secret since the world began; lockt
up in Heaven so close, that <hi>mine eyes have wasted away with looking for thy
saving health, O Lord,</hi> sighs <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> answers him with <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
disrumperes coelos, Break the Heavens, O Lord, and come down: O utinam,</hi>
O would thou wouldst! But now, as we have <hi>heard,</hi> so have we <hi>seen</hi> thy
salvation.</p>
            <p>Nor need we any extraordinary piercing eye to see it: so plain and
manifest is the object, that eyes almost sunk into their holes, eyes over
which the curtains of a long night are well nigh drawn, eyes veiled with
the mists of age, eyes well near worn out with looking and expectation,
the dimmest, aged'st sight may see it. <hi>Mine</hi> eyes, old Father <hi>Simeons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need the <hi>Manichee</hi> strain his eye-sight to discern it. He need not,
as is usual when we look on curious pieces, close one eye, that the <hi>visual</hi>
spirits being contracted we may see those things which else by reason of
their curious subtilty scape the seeing. 'Tis no such aiery phantasm, but
that we may with open face and eyes behold it; he may see it with
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both his eyes, without straining, without that trouble.</p>
            <p>But if our senses should play false with us, yet <hi>my eyes,</hi> the eyes of a
Prophet, a holy man inspir'd and detain'd a prisoner in the flesh on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for this spectacle, cannot possibly deceive us.</p>
            <p>Especially if you add but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, That he did not perceive
it only as a far off, <hi>Balaams</hi> sight, or had a glance or glimmering of it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>saw it plain,</hi> so plain, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>know</hi> it too. Saw it in his
arms and lookt near it, nay into it, by the quick lively eye of a firm
faith; for with both eyes he saw it, the eyes of his body, and the eyes
of his soul; the <hi>Saviour</hi> with the one, <hi>Salvation</hi> with the other: the child
with those, the <hi>God</hi> with these. And what greater evidence then that of
sight, what greater certainty then that of faith!</p>
            <p>If all this be yet too little, if <hi>viderunt</hi> be to seek, and <hi>oculi</hi> fail, and
<hi>mei</hi> be deceived; yet <hi>parasti</hi> cannot but list it above the weakness of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
put all out of question. It was not only seen, but <hi>prepared</hi> to be
seen.</p>
            <p>It came not, as the world thinks of other salvations, by chance, but
was prepared. <hi>Parasti, Thou</hi> hast prepared it, prepared by him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the world.</p>
            <p>Higher yet, <hi>parasti</hi> thou <hi>hast</hi> prepared; done it long since: the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
began not now, had a higher beginning, a beginning <hi>before</hi> the
face of all people, before the face of any people, before the face of the
waters, before the face of the world appeared. <hi>Chosen us in him,</hi> says St.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57113:70"/>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> then chosen and prepared him for us, <hi>before the foundation of the
world,</hi> Ephes. i. 4.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>parasti</hi> is not the blessing of this day. <hi>Parasti ab aterno,</hi>
so to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> too; but <hi>in conspectu</hi> before our faces, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in these last times, manifested in the flesh, <hi>that's</hi> the blessing
we this day commemorate. <hi>A body thou hast prepared me,</hi> that <hi>prepared,</hi>
then <hi>lo I come,</hi> he will be born presently, Christmas out of hand. <hi>Parasti</hi>
now compleat, this day he was first made ready and drest in swadling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>prepared.</hi> So it came not at mans entreaty, or desert. Nay when
he thought not of it. When <hi>Adam</hi> was running away to hide himself,
then the promise of the womans seed stept in between; and when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Devotion lay at the last gasp ready to bid the world adieu, then
comes he himself who had been so long preparing, and fulfilled the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
This a degree of certainty higher then our imaginations can follow
it, that relies wholly on <hi>Gods</hi> own <hi>parasti,</hi> without mans uncertain prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Yet something ado there was to bring this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, this <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be <hi>seen.</hi> A long preparation there was of <hi>Patriarchs, Moses</hi> and
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of Promises, Types, and Figures, and Prophesies for the
space of <hi>four</hi> thousand years. This long train led the triumph, <hi>then</hi> comes
the Saviour, then <hi>Salvation.</hi> Sure and certain it must needs be, to
which there are so many agreeing witnesses.</p>
            <p>This then so variously <hi>typified,</hi> so many ways <hi>shadowed,</hi> so often <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
so clearly <hi>prophesied,</hi> so constantly, so fully <hi>testified,</hi> so long <hi>expected,</hi>
so earnestly <hi>desired.</hi> This is the Salvation prepared for <hi>us.</hi> Whoever
looks for any other may look his eyes out, shall never see it. This <hi>Name
the only Name by which we shall be saved, the Name of Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding all that's said or can be said, 'tis but <hi>parasti</hi> still.
'Tis not <hi>Posuisti, prepared</hi> for all, not <hi>put, set</hi> up for all, as if all should be
saved. No, <hi>posui te in casum,</hi> set for the fall of many, those that will not
turn their eyes up hither, that care not for <hi>viderunt,</hi> neglect this sight,
slight this salvation. But however this dismal success often comes about,
<hi>Parasti</hi> it is, that cannot be lost, and in <hi>conspectu omnium populorum,</hi> for all
it is prepared, for all in general; none excluded this <hi>parasti,</hi> he that put
<hi>parasti</hi> into this good Fathers mouth, put in <hi>omnium populorum</hi> too. Not
only the <hi>certainty,</hi> but the <hi>universality</hi> of this salvation, that's the <hi>third</hi>
part of the Text, and thither are we come. <hi>Before the face of all people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prepared,</hi> that's a favour, and for the <hi>people,</hi> that's an ample one, and
one step to an universal. <hi>People</hi> are men, a great company of men, and
for men, and a multitude of men it is prepared, <hi>nusquam Angelos,</hi> not for
Angels, in no wise for them, not one of them. No they are still the Sons
of <hi>darkness, no day-spring from on high to visit them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For men, and not for the better or more honourable part of men alone,
but for the <hi>people</hi> too, the <hi>meanest</hi> sinfulest men in more favour with God
then the Apostate Angels.</p>
            <p>And not to some few of those people neither, but to all the people, the
<hi>whole</hi> people.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>conspectu totius populi</hi> it might be, for all one people, and the rest

            <p>2. Light of all motions has the most sudden, it even prevents the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest

3. And when our eye-lids are past those slumbers, then <hi>Lighten mine

A light to lighten them, a light to shew my self to my self; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
to reveal my inmost thoughts, to shew me the ugly deformity of my sins

to shew us the darkness we are in; our <hi>Salutare dispergens tenebras,</hi> salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that dispels the horrid darkness.</p>
            <p>4. And to do that, the enlightning of the <hi>medium</hi> is not sufficient. <hi>In

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, into it
it must be, <hi>Lumen penetrans oculum,</hi> salvation not only presented to the
eye, but to the sight, the eye fitly disposed to behold it.</p>
            <p>5. Every enlightning will not do <hi>that.</hi> It must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the light of
revelation. No other will serve the turn; not the light of <hi>nature,</hi> not
the dictates of <hi>reason,</hi> not the light of <hi>moral vertues,</hi> or <hi>acquired habits,</hi>
but something from above, something infused, such as comes from
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> divine inspiration. What light else? no remedy, but buried
we must be in everlasting night. Scriptures or revealed truth, the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> must save whoever shall be saved. <hi>No man can come to
me except the Father draw him,</hi> St. John vi. 44. <hi>No man lay hold upon the Name
of Iesus, or salvation, but by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Lumen divine
revelationis,</hi> salvation by the glorious light of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>6. There is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which yet wants an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> a Revelation,
that wants a Revelation, such as St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> a dark one. This an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
with a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a lightsome one, such as Revelations are when Prophesies
are fulfilled of things past, not things to come. <hi>Lumen Revelationis reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latae,</hi>
a light of salvation as clear as day.</p>
            <p>'Tis time now to ask whither it is this light and revelation lead us. I
shall answer you out of <hi>Zacharies Benedictus,</hi> S. Luke i. 79. <hi>They guide our
feet into the way of peace. Send forth thy light and thy truth, and they shall guide
me,</hi> Psal. xliii. 3. So <hi>David,</hi> guide me; whither? <hi>Psal.</hi> lvi. 13. <hi>To walk
before God in the light of the living.</hi> One light to another, the light of <hi>grace</hi>
to the light of <hi>glory.</hi> So <hi>Lumen dirigens,</hi> or <hi>salutare pertingens ad coelum,</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
leading up to heaven.</p>
            <p>Sum up all. Salvation to make us <hi>glad,</hi> a light, a light to <hi>comfort,</hi>
not a lightning to <hi>terrifie. The lightnings shone upon the ground, the earth
trembled and was afraid:</hi> no such, no lightning: Nor St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s light, a light
to <hi>blind,</hi> but to <hi>give</hi> light; nor to <hi>play</hi> about the <hi>medium</hi> only, but to <hi>open</hi>
and <hi>dispose</hi> the weak dim eye. Not by a weak glimmering of <hi>nature,</hi> nor
by a dusky twi-light, but by a <hi>clear</hi> Revelation: not an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> to
misguide us out of the way into <hi>bogs</hi> and <hi>quagmires,</hi> but to guide us to
peace and to <hi>salvation.</hi> Lastly, not a light to any to see only that they
are inexcusable, <hi>ut essent inexcusabiles,</hi> that <hi>seeing they might see, and not
understand,</hi> a light to light 'um down to Hell, that they might see the way
down through those gloomy shades with more ease, horrour, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
(that's the <hi>event</hi> indeed sometimes, the <hi>end</hi> never;) but thither
upward, from whence it comes to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> at the beginning of the Text, to
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> at the end. And can your thoughts prompt to your desires any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
benefits? can you wish more?</p>
            <p>And yet if we but consider in what plight the <hi>parties</hi> were upon whom
the rays of this light shone: the salvation will seem more beneficial.
They were in <hi>darkness,</hi> and could any thing be more welcome to them
that sit in darkness, and the shadow of death then a <hi>light to lighten?</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57113:72"/>
That was the miserable case the <hi>Gentiles</hi> now were in; <hi>Neither have the
Heathen knowledge of his laws:</hi> 'twas so in <hi>Davids</hi> time, and so continued
on till this days rising Sun scattered the Clouds: and <hi>now</hi> the case is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
<hi>Dedi te in lucem gentium,</hi> fulfilled in <hi>his</hi> time. The Gentiles now
enlightned.</p>
            <p>Enlightned, what's that? Those that are baptized are said to be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi>
Heb. x. So the <hi>Gentiles</hi> enlightned will be in effect the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
baptized. Baptized they may be with water, (and they had need of some
such cleansing element, to wash their black, dark, sullied souls:) but
there is another Baptism with the Holy Ghost, and fire, <hi>fire</hi> that's light,
so to be baptized with light, will be with the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> 'Twas heavy
midnight through the world. <hi>Iudea</hi> was the only <hi>Goshen,</hi> the land of light,
till he that was born this day breaking down the partition that divided
<hi>Palestine</hi> from the nations, gave way for the light which before shone on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there, to disperse its saving beams quite through the world. Then did
they whose habitations were pitcht in the region of death, whose dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in the suburbs of Hell, see a marvellous great light spring up, that's
<hi>salus personis accommodata,</hi> salvation fitted to the parties.</p>
            <p>Fitted, and <hi>tempestively</hi> too, to <hi>them</hi> it never could have come so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely.
The light of nature was almost quite extinguisht, a light to
lighten that again. The light of grace quite vanisht, an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for
<hi>that.</hi> The understanding darkened by ignorance, and errour. The will
darkened by hatred and malice. The most civilized <hi>Gentiles</hi> so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
from the beauty of moral vertues (if we believe their own hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories)
so strongly fetter'd with the bonds of that uncomfortable night,
as if they there lay exiled from the eternal providence, as the <hi>Wiseman</hi>
phrases it, all in <hi>umbrâ mortis,</hi> next door to utter darkness: when behold
this light appears, this Sun rises with healing in his wings. Figur'd in
the <hi>time</hi> of his birth, born when the days are shortest, most want of light;
in the <hi>dead</hi> of night, when the nights are darkest; all, to shew <hi>opportunita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
salutis,</hi> the opportunity of this salvation.</p>
            <p>And is not <hi>Gloria</hi> as fit for <hi>Israelis,</hi> as <hi>Lux</hi> for <hi>Gentium? Israel</hi> had a long
time walkt in light, and not a whit the better for't: that which must
convert a <hi>Iew</hi> must be <hi>gloria,</hi> so bright a splendour that must rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
then invite the eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gloria, glory!</hi> and indeed they needed it. So far now were they fallen
below their former credit and honour in the world, so much beneath their
antient port and state, under the proud tyranny of a strange power, that
nothing but glory could raise up their drooping heads.</p>
            <p>I ask though, why <hi>gloria Israelis?</hi> why so joyn'd? Briefly thus: of
<hi>them</hi> he came according to the flesh: to <hi>them</hi> especially was he promis'd,
amongst them he liv'd, preacht, and wrought his miracles. In respect to
him had all their glory, and all their prosperity was given 'um. In
a word, <hi>Salvation it self is of the Iew,</hi> St. John iv. therefore their
glory.</p>
            <p>Yet that <hi>Israelis populi</hi> should not lift up their crest too high, or despise
those whose weaker light comes short of glorious beams: 'Tis <hi>gentium</hi>
first, then <hi>Israelis,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the first place here, <hi>Israel</hi> in the last.
When the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is come in, then for <hi>Israel</hi> too, then <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
in excelsis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>gentium</hi> has the precedence of <hi>Israelis,</hi> so has <hi>light</hi> of
<hi>glory.</hi> God works by degrees, first <hi>Lux,</hi> then <hi>Gloria,</hi> first Grace,
then Glory. First, he excites, then co-operates, then infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57113:73"/>
then assists, then crowns. 'Tis a preposterous course to look for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
where the light of grace never had operation.</p>
            <p>But is glory so much the <hi>Iews</hi> peculiar; that the <hi>Gentile</hi> never shall rise
thither? It cannot be, yet so it seems at the first blush, <hi>Lumen gentium,
gloria Israelis,</hi> as if, to each their part. Indeed all have light, and light
sufficient; but it displays not into glory, to any but <hi>populi Israelis tui.</hi>
When they are become <hi>populi tui, thy people Israel,</hi> then the light circles
into rays: <hi>sufficiens</hi> into <hi>efficax,</hi> and they are saved. But if you mark it,
'tis not <hi>Israelis,</hi> but <hi>tui Israelis, Not Israel after the flesh, but the Israel of
God:</hi> there we first hear of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>there</hi> light rises into glory, and good
hope there is the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may prove <hi>populi tui</hi> thy people; <hi>vocavi populum
meum,</hi> he said so whose <hi>vocavi</hi> is enough to make it so: and if <hi>populi tui,</hi>
then <hi>Israelis tui,</hi> then they have prevailed with God; if thy people, then
thy <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> inheritors of this glory.</p>
            <p>Glory, and glory so near the end of the Text, makes me think of
something without end; the highest pitch of this salvation, the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity.</hi>
Glory is a word proper to that life to come: false and adulterate
glories they are that are below. The glory of the people, that's eternal.
<hi>Lumen</hi> and <hi>gloria</hi> both meet in the Text, and where they meet is eternity.
'Twas the complaint of old, that their Salvations and Saviours too gave
place at length to the necessity of Nature, and were seen no more. Here's
a Saviour never dies; <hi>that</hi> for himself; and <hi>is become the Author of eternal
salvation, that</hi> for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 9.</p>
            <p>For indeed what is salvation, and salvation prepared for all, <hi>Iew</hi> and
<hi>Gentile,</hi> and the light of salvation without glory? many lights there are
that go out and set in darkness, that when the matter, the wiek is worn
away, dye into dismal shades. If the light shines not into glory, we are
but in a poor case still.</p>
            <p>And so we should be, would not this salvation now prove to be a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Salutare tuum,</hi> be <hi>salvatorem nostrum.</hi> We told you in speaking of
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it was <hi>Gods</hi> peculiar. Now we tell you more, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
must be <hi>God.</hi> None can be salvation in <hi>abstracto</hi> but he; and none but he
crown light with glory. So you have the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature of this Saviour,
his God-head; and yet there is another word in the Text besides, for
<hi>that.</hi> That's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, light. And <hi>God is light,</hi> St. John i. 5.</p>
            <p>Ay, but sinned we had, and justice required that we should suffer: <hi>God</hi>
cannot. He that must save us by suffering for us, must be <hi>man;</hi> he is so.
<hi>Viderunt oculi,</hi> my eyes have seen it. No man has seen God at any time;
therefore man he was. And <hi>prepared;</hi> God cannot be so: and prepared
with a <hi>body,</hi> that's plain enough for <hi>factus homo,</hi> his Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>Now put both together, and you have the <hi>union</hi> of both natures, both

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all singular,
one single person in the <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are three persons there, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a contract, the Divinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
unto man: so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, light fetcht from light; a
person <hi>proceeding. God</hi> of <hi>God, light</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> proceeding by way of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>Lux lucem generat,</hi> one light begets another. So the second Person
in the Trinity, the Son begotten of the Father.</p>
            <p>But begotten a Son may be, and not coequal with his Father; a long
time after rather: <hi>Light</hi> that's coequal with the Fountain, as soon as a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57113:73"/>
light body, so soon light to an instant. The Son <hi>co-eternal</hi> with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that's <hi>egressus ejus ab aterno, His goings out from everlasting,</hi> Mich. v. 2.
His eternal generation.</p>
            <p>He has another, his temporal generation, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> before the face
of all people. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is down, so down he came, when he was prepared;
that was, when born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three remarkable differences between this generation of
his, and that of others, in the word <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Light is all diffus'd at once, not by parts; now this, then another;
and Christs Body was framed all at once, not <hi>membratim,</hi> one member
after another, as other infants.</p>
            <p>2. Light enters through solid bodies, as Glass, Crystal, or the like,
without either penetration of dimensions, or cracking the glass. So
Christ from the Virgin Body of blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> without the least hurt to
her Virginity.</p>
            <p>3. The light shines in the midst of noisom vapours, yet it self is kept
pure and sincere. In like manner the Deity of Christ joyn'd to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
mixes not with its corruption, nor is defiled by it. <hi>Marcion</hi> need
not fear the truth of his body, lest our corruption should pollute his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
when the light it self confutes him, and convinces him, by the
infinite distance between it self, and the power of the Creator.</p>
            <p>There wants but one thing more to compleat the mystery of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Saviour, that's his Offices; if we can find them too in the Text,
if we can bring them to <hi>viderunt oculi</hi> to be seen <hi>there,</hi> and stray no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we have lighted upon a happy Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> indeed, a salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and a Saviour to whom nothing can be added. Let's try.</p>
            <p>He is a <hi>King,</hi> there's one of his Offices, that from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thence the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> seems to gather it, <hi>Psal. 2. Yet have I set my King upon my
holy Hill of Sion.</hi> How proves he that? why, within a verse in comes, <hi>I
shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is a <hi>Priest</hi> next in <hi>gloria Israelis,</hi> there's another of his Offices. The
Priesthood the glory of the Jew. <hi>The glory is departed from Israel,</hi> cries out
<hi>Phinehas</hi> his dying Wife: why? because the <hi>Ark of God was taken,</hi> 1 Sam.
iv. 20. and because of her Father-in-law and her Husband, they dead
and gone; what were they? the Priests of the Lord; when the Ark,
and Priests are gone, the glory of <hi>Isoael</hi> is departed too. They rise and
fall together. A Priest then, but not to <hi>Israel,</hi> after the flesh alone, or
after the Order of <hi>Aaron;</hi> but <hi>Israelis tui,</hi> of the true <hi>Israel,</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
entituled to this glory, <hi>as being a Priest for ever, after the order of
Melchisedeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, he's a <hi>Prophet</hi> in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there's his third Office, his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;
the light of Prophesie is the light of Revelation. A Prophet
then he is, to reveal unto us Divine Mysteries, the will of his heavenly
Father, <hi>to give knowledge of salvation unto his people, by the remission of their
sins,</hi> S. Luke ii. 77.</p>
            <p>A compleat Saviour now. <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man, God begotten</hi> the <hi>Son, co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
with the Father, born into the world, of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> pure and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,
took our <hi>nature</hi> without sin, without <hi>imperfection,</hi> a King for the
Gentiles, a Priest for <hi>Israel,</hi> a Prophet for both: a <hi>King</hi> to defend us, a
<hi>Priest</hi> to purge us, a <hi>Prophet</hi> to instruct us.</p>
            <p>This the Saviour, God the Son. <hi>He</hi> our salvation too. Yet comes not
salvation from <hi>him</hi> alone, from all <hi>three</hi> Persons, the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> that.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, how's that but by the graces and gifts
of the <hi>Holy Spirit?</hi> there's the Holy Ghost opening and <hi>enlightening</hi> our eyes
that we may see him. All three plain enough in the Text, as in the day:
<hi>Viderunt oculi,</hi> your own eyes are witnesses.</p>
            <p>Here's a sight indeed might well make old <hi>Simeon</hi> now desire to close
up his eyes to see no more, <hi>Ne vitam hanc posthàc aliquâ contaminet aegritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi>
all objects henceforth would but defile his eyes.</p>
            <p>But what tell you me of <hi>Simeons</hi> theory? what of salvation, though
ne're so great? what of <hi>in conspectu omnium,</hi> though ne're so <hi>general?</hi> what
of light and glory, though ne're so <hi>excellent?</hi> if I may not back again to
<hi>viderunt oculi mei?</hi> if, I my self cannot perceive it? if it be so far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
off that I cannot lay hold of it by mine own eyes of Faith and
Hope? If I cannot see it to be mine, and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> apply it, <hi>Who
loved me and gave himself for me,</hi> Gal. ii. 20. <hi>Omnium populorum is too large,</hi> all
may, but all shall not be saved. <hi>Viderunt oculi mei,</hi> that's somewhat, when
mine own eyes can fix and dwell upon it.</p>
            <p>Nay, that's not full enough, if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, these <hi>very</hi> eyes, that so long
expected it, the eyes of my body shall not be partakers of it; if they
when they are fall'n into dust shall lie for ever folded up in eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if eyes that weep out themselves in devout tears with looking and
expectation shall not rise with these very bodies to that blessed vision:
what reward for all these sufferings? what recompence?</p>
            <p>I'le tell you how to see all, and stay no longer, nor go no further.
This is the day of salvation, salvation day; and if ever, to day he will
be seen. Cast but your eyes up to the Holy Table thither, your very
sense may there almost see salvation, behold your Saviour. There it is,
there <hi>he</hi> is in the blessed <hi>Sacrament.</hi> There it is prepared for you, a <hi>body
hast thou prepared;</hi> his body, flesh and blood, prepared well nigh to be
<hi>seen,</hi> to be <hi>tasted. O taste and see how gracious the Lord is,</hi> Psal. xxxiv. 8. Go
up thither, and with old <hi>Simeon</hi> take him in your hands, take him yet
nearer into your bowels. <hi>Take, eat,</hi> you shall hear one say so by and by.
But stay not there upon your sense, upon the outward element. Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him with your other eye, the eye of <hi>Faith;</hi> let it be <hi>viderunt oculi,</hi> let
it be both. Let it be <hi>viderunt mei,</hi> the applying eye of a special Faith.
And that you may be sure not to go away without beholding him, there's
<hi>lumen</hi> in the Text; and it would do well in your hands to search the dark
corners of your hearts, to examine them. While our hearts are <hi>darkened</hi>
with sins and errours we cannot see him. And if after strict examination
we be not found in <hi>charity,</hi> we are yet in <hi>tenebris.</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, do but
love your brother, <hi>He that loves his brother abideth in the light,</hi> S. John ii. 10.
The sum is, Faith must be the <hi>eye,</hi> Repentance and Charity the <hi>light,</hi> by
which you shall this day see your Saviour, and apprehend salvation:
the three requisites those to a worthy Communicant. So shall you <hi>there</hi>
find <hi>light</hi> to guide you out of the darkness of sin and misery. <hi>Glory</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
you in the adoption of the Sons of God. <hi>Salvation</hi> with <hi>Glory,</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
here, Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>And when you have satisfied your eyes and hearts with this heavenly
sight; Go, return home to your private Closets, shut up your eyes, never
set ope those windows to the vanities of the world again; but with a
holy scorn disdain these painted glories, and let a veil of forgetfulness
pass over 'um.</p>
            <p>For our <hi>viderunt</hi> must not end when the Eucharist is past; when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this sacred place. I will take the cup of salvation, says the <hi>Psalmist:</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57113:74"/>
there it is; do that here. But I will rejoyce in thy salvation; do so,
both here and at <hi>home. Et exultabo;</hi> and let me see you do so. Let not your
joy be stifled in your narrow bosoms, but break out into expression, into
your lips, into your hands. Not in idle sports, excess of diet, or vain
pomp of apparel, not that joy, the joy of the world, but the joy of the
Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>It is salvation that you have heard and seen, and are yet to see to day,
what's our duty now? If it be salvation, let us <hi>work it out with fear and
trembling.</hi> It is salvation to be seen, some eminent work: let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
we have seen strange things to day. A most certain sure salvation it
is, let not a sacrilegious doubtful thought cast a mist upon it. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
let us accept it; prepared for all, let us thank God for so fair a
compass, and not uncharitably exclude our selves or others. God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
the bowels of his mercy, let us not streighten 'um. It is a light, let
us arise and walk after it. It is a glory, let us admire and adore it.</p>
            <p>Was our Saviour seen? so should we be every day in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
was he prepared to day? let us be always shod with the <hi>preparation
of the Gospel of peace.</hi> Does <hi>he</hi> enlighten us, O let us never extinguish or
hide that light, till this light be swallowed up by the light of the Lamb,
till this day-spring from on high prove <hi>mid-day,</hi> till <hi>Gentium,</hi> and <hi>Israelis</hi>
be friendly united in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and no darkness to distinguish them, no
difference between light and glory, till the beginning and end of the
Text meet together in the circle of eternity, till <hi>viderunt oculi</hi> meet with
<hi>gloriam,</hi> till our eyes may behold that light which is inaccessible, that
light and glory which know no other limits but infinite, nor measure but
eternity.</p>
            <p>To which he bring us, who this day put off his glory to put on salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that by his salvation we might at length lift up our heads in glory,
whither he is again ascended, and now sits together with his Father and
the Holy Ghost. To which three Persons, and one God, be given all
praise, and power, and thanks, and honour, and salvation, and glory
for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>But he being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into Heaven,
and saw the Glory of God, and Iesus standing on the right hand of
God.</p>
                  <p>And said, Behold I see the Heavens opened, and the Son of man stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the right hand of God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Esterdays Child is to day you see become a man. He
that yesterday could neither stand nor go, knew not
the right hand from the left, lay helpless as it were in
the bosom of his Mother, is to day presented to us
standing at the right hand of God in the glory of
the Father: he whom earth yesterday entertained so
poorly and obscurely; heaven here this day openly
glories in. Now the horn of our salvation is raised up indeed: the Church
thus shewing us plainly to day what yesterday we could not see for the
rags and stable, that it was not a meer silly creature, a poor child, or
man only that came to visit us, but the Lord of Glory; so making him
some recompence, as we may say to day, for the poor case she shew'd him
in yesterday.</p>
            <p>But that's not the business. Yesterday was Christs <hi>Birth-day,</hi> to day St.
<hi>Stephens;</hi> for <hi>Natalitia Martyrum,</hi> the <hi>Birth-days of the Martys were their
death-days call'd:</hi> they then first said to be born, when they were born to
execution. A day plac'd here, so near to Christs, that we might see as
clear as day, how dear and near the <hi>Martyrs</hi> are to him; they lie even in
his bosom, the first visit he makes after his own death was to them, to
encourage them to theirs: The first appearance of him in heaven after
his return up, was to take one of them thither.</p>
            <p>And yet this is not all. <hi>Christs Birth</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs Death</hi> are set so
near, to intimate how near death and persecution are to Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
how close they often follow the Faith of Christ, so thereby to arm
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57113:76"/>
us against the fear of any thing that shall betide us, even Death it self,
seeing it places us so near him, seeing there are so fine visions in it and
before it, so fair glories after it, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s here will tell you.</p>
            <p>And if I add that Death is a good <hi>memento</hi> at a Feast, a good way to
keep us within our bounds in the days of mirth and jollity, of what sort
soever, it may pass for somewhat like a reason why St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s death is
thus serv'd in so soon at the first course, as the second dish of our Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-Feast.</p>
            <p>Nor is it for all that any disturbance to Christmas Joys. The glorious
prospect of St. <hi>Stephens Martyrdom</hi> which gives us here the opening of
Heaven, and the appearance then of Gods glory, and of Christ in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
may go instead of those costly Masques of imagin'd Heavens, and
designed Gods and Goddesses, which have been often presented in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times to solemnize the <hi>Feast.</hi> We may see in that infinitely far more
ravishing and pleasing sights than these, which all the rarity of invention
and vast charges could ever shew us. Here's enough in the <hi>Text</hi> to make
us dance and leap for joy, as if we would leap into the arms of him in
Heaven, who stands there as it were ready to receive us, as he was to
day presented to St. <hi>Stephen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may now, I hope, both to season and exalt our <hi>Christmas-Feast,</hi> bring
in St. <hi>Stephens</hi> story, that part of it especially which I have chosen, so
full of Christ, so full of glad and joyful sights, and objects, that it must
needs add, instead of diminishing our joy and gladness.</p>
            <p>And yet if I season it a little now and then with the mention of Death,
it will do no hurt. I must do so, that you may not forget St. <hi>Stephens
Martyrdom</hi> in the midst of the contemplation of the glory that preceded
it. That must not be, for the day is appointed to remember it. And
though we shall not designedly come so far to decipher it (having no
more then the <hi>praeludium</hi> of his death before us) we will not so far forget
it, but that we will take it into the division of the <hi>Text;</hi> in which we
shall consider these four particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His accommodation to his Death. His <hi>being full of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
that fitted and disposed him to it.</item>
               <item>2. His preparation for it. He <hi>looked up stedfastly into Heaven;</hi> so that
he prepared himself for it.</item>
               <item>3. His confirmation to it. He <hi>saw the glory of God and Iesus standing on
the right hand of God;</hi> that encouraged and confirmed him in it.</item>
               <item>4. His profession at it. <hi>Behold,</hi> said he, <hi>I see the heavens opened, and the
Son of man standing at the right hand of God:</hi> In those words he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
his faith, and proclaimed his vision of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>By this manner of considering it, we shall do St. <hi>Stephen</hi> right, and
<hi>Christmas</hi> no wrong; remember St. <hi>Stephens Martyrdom,</hi> and yet not
forget <hi>Christs</hi> being at it, celebrate St. <hi>Stephens</hi> memory, and yet no way
omit <hi>Christs.</hi> He being here to be lookt on as encourager of St. <hi>Stephens
Martyrdom;</hi> as much as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> for his Professor and <hi>Martyr.</hi> By
all together we shall fully understand the requisites of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> what is
required to make one such, to be <hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> to <hi>look up stedfastly
into heaven,</hi> to look upon Christ as there, and as boldly to profess it; to be
full of Grace and Spirit, full of Piety and Devotion, full of Faith and
Hope, full of Courage and Resolution; all proportionably requisite to
the spiritual Martyrdom of dying to the world, and leaving all for
Christ; requisite too, all of them in some measure to dye well at any
time, the very sum of the <hi>Text,</hi> to be learn'd hence and practis'd by us.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57113:76"/>
If I add all requisite to keep <hi>Christmas</hi> too, as it should be kept, with
Grace and Devotion, with Faith and courage also against all that shall
oppose it, that our <hi>Christmas</hi> business be to be filled with the Spirit, and not
with meats and drinks, to look up to Heaven, to look up to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and
never to be afraid or ashamed to profess it; there is nothing then in the
<hi>Text</hi> to make it the least unseasonable. I go on therefore to handle it part
by part. The first is St. <hi>Stephens</hi> accommodation to his <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> how
he stands fitted for it.</p>
            <p>And surely he could not be better. <hi>Full of the Holy Ghost;</hi> Ghost is Spirit,
and what more necessary to a Martyr, then a spirit? The dreaming sluggish
temper is not fit to make a Martyr: he must have Spirit that dares look
Death soberly in the face.</p>
            <p>Yet every Spirit neither will not make a Martyr; there are mad spirits
in the world (they call them brave ones (though I know not why) that
rush headily upon the points of Swords and Rapiers: yet bring these gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
fellows to a Scaffold or a Gibbet, the common reward of their foolish
rashness (which they mis-reckon'd valour) and you shall see how sheepishly
they die, how distractedly they look, how without spirit. The spirit that
will bear out a shameful or painful death without change of countenance
or inward horrour, must be holy. Where the Spirit is holy, the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
pure, the Soul clean, the man dies with life and spirit in his looks,
as if he were either going to his bed, or to a better place. 'Tis a holy life
that fits men to be Martyrs.</p>
            <p>But spirit, and a holy Spirit is not enough to make a Martyr neither;
though the Martyrs spirit must be a holy one, yet to dispose for martyrdom
the holy Spirit must come himself with a peculiar power, send an impulse
and motion into the soul and spirit that shall even drive it to the stake.</p>
            <p>And every degree of power will not do it; it must be a full gale of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wind that can cool the fiery Furnace into a pleasing walk, that can
make death and torments seem soft and easie. <hi>Full of the Holy Ghost</hi> it is,
that <hi>Stephen</hi> is said to be, e're we hear him promoted to the glory of a
Martyr. The Spirit of holiness will make a man die holily, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit make him die comfortably; but the fulness of him is required
to make him die couragiously, without fear of death or torment, cruelty
or rage.</p>
            <p>By this you may now guess at Martys, who they are: not they that
die for their folly and their humour: not they (2.) that die without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness:
not every one (3.) that dies, as we say, with valour and
spirit; not they that die upon the motion of any spirit, but the holy
one, that one holy Spirit; not they that die in Schism and Faction against
the unity of this Holy Spirit, the peace of his Holy Church; none of
these die Martyrs: die Souldiers, or valiant Heathen, or men of spirit
they may, but men of the holy Spirit, Martyrs they die not. They only
die such, that have lived holily, die in holy Cause, in a holy Faith, and
in the peace of holy Church, as in the Faith of one Holy Spirit, ruling and
directing it into unity, upon good ground and warrant, and a strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
so to do, without seeking for, or voluntarily and unnecessarily
thrusting themselves into the mouth of death.</p>
            <p>And yet there are strange impulses I must tell you of the spirit of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
which ordinary souls or common pieties cannot understand. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we must know that the spirit of Martyrdom is the spirit of Love, the
very height of love to God, which how that can consist with the spirit of
Schism, whereby we break the unity of Brethren, or how a man can so
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57113:77"/>
highly love God as to dye for him, and hate his Spouse the Church, or
his Brethren, is inimaginable. Some other engines there may be, as vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
an obstinate humour of seeming constant to a false principle, an
ignorant and self-willed zeal which may sometimes draw a man to die;
but if the fulness of peace and charity does not appear, there is no ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Holy Ghost, and they make themselves and their deaths but
Martyrs, that is witnesses, of their own folly. He that pretends to be a
Martyr, must have more then a pretence to the Spirit of charity.</p>
            <p>II. And not to charity only, but to devotion too. He must (2.) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
himself for it, stedfastly look up to Heaven, nay, into Heaven too,
fill his Spirit with divine and heavenly provision for it, with St. <hi>Stephen</hi>
here.</p>
            <p>Who (1.) looks up to Heaven as to his Country, whither he was a
going. He longs earnestly to be there. His soul, with holy <hi>David's,</hi> has a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and longing to enter thither. He that looks but seriously up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and beholds that glorious Building, those starry Spangles, those
azure Curtains, those lustrous bodies of the Sun and Moon, that vast
and splendid circumference of these glistering dwellings, cannot but
thirst vehemently to be there; soul and flesh thirst for it: O how brave
a place is Heaven! how brave even but to look on. But if he can look,
(as here it seems St. <hi>Stephen</hi> did) into heaven too, and contemplate the
happy Choirs of blessed Saints and Angels, the ineffable beauty of
those inward Courts, the ravishing Melody and Musick they make, the
quiet, peace, and happiness, that pleasure, joy, and fulness of satisfaction
and contentment there, the majestick presence and blessed sight of God
himself, with all the store-houses of blessedness and glory full about him,
his very soul will be even ready to start with violence out of his body to
fly up thither.</p>
            <p>He that looks thus stedfastly, looks into Heaven, cannot now but look
askew upon the earth: To look up into Heaven is (2.) to despise and
trample upon all things under it. He is not likely to be a Martyr that
looks downward, that values any thing below. Nay, he dies his natural
death but unwillingly and untowardly, whose eyes, or heart, or sences
are taken up with the things about him. Even to die chearfully, though
in a bed of Roses, one must not have his mind upon them. He so looks
upon all worldly interests as dust and chaff, who looks up stedfastly into
heaven; eyes all things by the by, who eyes that well. The covetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the voluptuous Gallant, the gaudy Butterflies of fashion will never
make you Martyrs; they are wholly fixt in the contemplation of their gold,
their Mistresses, their Pleasures, or their Fashions. He scorns to look at
these, whose eyes are upon Heaven.</p>
            <p>Yet to scorn there, but especially to fit us against a tempest or a storm
of stones, there is a third looking up to Heaven, in Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
It is not by our own strength or power that we can wade through
streams of Blood, or sing in flames; we had need of assistance from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
and he that looks up to Heaven, seems so to beg it. It was no doubt
the spirit of Devotion that so fixt his sight; he saw what was like to fall
below, he provides against it from above, looks to that great Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
to arm him against those which were now ready to shower upon his
head. It is impossible without our prayers, and some aid thence, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
one petty pebble.</p>
            <p>But to make it a compleat Martyrdom, we must not look up only for
our own interests; for we are (4.) to look up for our very enemies, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57113:77"/>
beg Heavens pardon for them. He that dies not in Charity dies not a
Christian; but he that dies not heart, and hand, and eyes and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
in it cannot die a Martyr. Here we find S. <hi>Stephen</hi> lifting up his eyes
to set himself to prayer; 'tis but two <hi>verses</hi> or three after that we hear his
prayer, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge:</hi> This was one thing it seems he
lookt up so stedfastly to Heaven for. A good lesson (and fit for the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
so to pass by the injuries of our greatest enemies, as if we did not see
them, as if we had something else to look after then such petty contrasts,
as if we despis'd all worldly enmities as well as affections, minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but heaven, and him that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw standing there.</p>
            <p>All these ways we are to day to learn to look up to Heaven: as (1.)
to our hop'd for Country: as (2.) from things that hinder us too long
from coming to it: as (3.) for aid and help to bring us thither: as (4.)
for mercy and pardon thence to our selves and enemies, that we may all
one day meet together there. The posture it self is natural. 'Tis natural
for men in misery to look up to Heaven; nay, the very insensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
when it complains, the Cow when it lows, the Dog when he
howls, casts up its head according to its proportion, after its fashion, as
if it naturally crav'd some comfort thence. 'Tis the general practice of
Saints and holy persons. <hi>Lift up your eyes,</hi> says the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> xl. 26.
<hi>I will lift up my eyes,</hi> says Holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cxxi. 1. And distrest <hi>Susanna</hi>
lifts up her eyes, and looks up towards Heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. Nay, Christ
himself sighing, or praying, or sometimes working miracles, looks up
to Heaven, who yet carried Heaven about him, to teach us in all distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to look up thither in all our actions, to fetch assistance thence. If we
had those thoughts of Heaven we should, I know how little of the eye
the earth should have. <hi>Vbi amor, ibi oculus, where the love is, there's the eye.</hi>
We may easiy guess what we love best by our looks; if Heaven be
it, our eyes are there; if any thing else, our eyes are there. 'Tis easie
then to tell you St. <hi>Stephens</hi> longings, where his thoughts are fixt, when we
are told he so <hi>stedfastly lookt up to heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is not so much the looking up to Heaven, as the sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and attentive doing it that fits us to die for Christ. 'Tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a
a kind of stretching or straining the eye-sight to look inquisitively into
the object. To look carelesly or perfunctorily into Heaven it self, to do
it in a fit, to be godly and pious now and then, or by starts and girds
will not serve turn; to mind seriously what we are about, that's the only
piety will carry it. <hi>Plus va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t hora fervens quam mensis tepens. One hour,</hi> one
half hour spent <hi>with a warm attention</hi> at our prayers, <hi>is worth a month,</hi> a
year, an age, <hi>of our cold Devotions. 'Tis good to be zealous,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
somewhat hot and vehement <hi>in a good matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it had need be a stedfast and attentive Devotion that can hold out
with this <hi>But.</hi> To stand praying or looking up to Heaven when our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are gnashing their teath upon us, and come running head-long on us,
to have no regard to their rushing fury, nor interrupt our prayers, nor omit
any ceremony of them neither, for all their savage malice, now pressing
fiercely on us, but look up stedfastly still, not quich aside: this looks surely
like a Martyr. The little Boy that held <hi>Alexander</hi> the candle whilst he was
sacrificing to his Gods, so long that the wick burnt into his finger, and yet
neither cried nor shrunk at it, lest he should disturb his Lords Devotions,
will find few fellows among Christians to pattern him in the exercise of
their strictest pieties. Let but a leaf stir, a wind breathe, a fly buzz, the
very light but dwindle, any thing move or shake, and our poor Religion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57113:78"/>
(alas) is put off the hinge; 'tis well if it be not at an end too. What
would it do if danger and death were at our heels, as here it was? Oh
this attentive stedfast fastning the soul upon the business of heaven were
a rare piety if we could compass it. This glorious <hi>Martyr</hi> has shew'd us
an example, the lesson is, that we should practise it.</p>
            <p>But all this is no wonder, seeing he was full of <hi>the Holy Ghost.</hi> That
Almighty Spirit is able to blow away all diversions, able to turn the
shower of stones into the softness and drift of Snow, able to make all
the torments of Death fall light and easie. If we can get our souls filled
once with that, we need fear nothing, nothing will distract our thoughts,
or draw our eyes from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Then it will be no wonder neither to see next the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
standing at the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call'd this point St. <hi>Stephens</hi> confirmation, or his encouragement to
his death. He that once comes to have a sight of God and Christ, of
Gods Glory, and Christ at the right hand of it, of either the one or the
other, much more of both, cannot want strength to die, be the death
of what kind it will. It was a gallant speech of <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was
disswaded from appearing before the Council (of <hi>Wormes</hi> I think it was)
that he would go thither, though all the tiles of the houses were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Devils. Had every stone that was cast at the <hi>Martyr Stephen</hi> been a
Devil, he would not after this vision have been afraid. <hi>The Lord is my light
and my salvation, whom then should I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life,
of whom then shall I be afraid?</hi> says <hi>David,</hi> Psal. xxvii. 1. and yet he saw
nothing like this sight. Gods presence is enough, whether it be seen by
the eye of sense, or by the eye of Faith, to keep us stedfast, to make death
hide its head for fear, while we stand triumphing over it.</p>
            <p>I conceive it impertinent to make it a business to enquire too solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously
what this glory was, and how St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw it. That it was some
glorious sight, some high resplendent light or brightness, such as God
used to appear in, as <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiv. 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> xiv. 10. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> viii. 10. to
<hi>Moses</hi> and his <hi>Prophets,</hi> there call'd his glory; or some apparition of Angels
in shining garments winging about a throne of glory, visibly appearing to
the eye of the <hi>Martyr Stephen,</hi> is the probablest to conceive, and the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> chap. vi. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. is
an evidence it was a visible appearance.</p>
            <p>But no doubt his understanding saw further then his eye into Heaven,
that lookt and saw a glory there of which the sense though elevated to
his height cannot be capable. <hi>Divinum lumen,</hi> says St. <hi>Gregory Nissen, the
inaccessible light. Spem in re,</hi> says St. <hi>Hilary, His hope already. Deum &amp; Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi>
says St. <hi>Austin, God and the Godhead. Imo Trinitatem,</hi> and that, <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
revelata,</hi> says he again, <hi>The blessed Trinity unveiled. Futurae vita gaudia,</hi>
says <hi>Bede, The joys of the other life.</hi> These all he saw say they, and we shall
make no scruple to say, in Spirit so he did, as far as humane nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this condition.</p>
            <p>But without question, Christ he saw in his body standing amidst that
glory; the words are plain for that, and that alone were enough to put
courage into the most coward heart.</p>
            <p>To see his Faith confirm'd by sight, and Christs Glory with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
visibly appear, to see whom he had trusted, and for whom he had
laboured and disputed now with his own eyes in glory, must needs make
him kiss the hands that would now send him so soon to him.</p>
            <p>To see him (2.) <hi>standing at the right hand of God,</hi> as if he were risen
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57113:78"/>
from his sitting there to behold the sufferings and courage of his <hi>Martyr</hi>
that stood below, now made a spectacle to Christ and all his Angels:
that's an honour he may well glory in.</p>
            <p>To see him (3.) <hi>standing</hi> amidst his hosts, as if he were coming down
to help him: that adds more spirit still.</p>
            <p>To see him (4.) <hi>standing at the right hand of God,</hi> as if he suffered with
him, and was therefore pleading for him, as friends and advocates used
to do with the accused party at the Bar. This infuses yet a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that notwithstanding all his sins or weaknesses he shall now easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prevail.</p>
            <p>To see him (5) <hi>standing</hi> as a Priest to offer him up a sweet smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to his Father that still increases it.</p>
            <p>To see him lastly <hi>standing</hi> like a judge of masteries at the end of
the race or goal to crown him with a crown of glory, cannot but make
him think long for the death that shall bring him to it.</p>
            <p>All these ways Christ may be brought in here as <hi>standing</hi> for us. In the
Creed we profess him sitting, thereby acknowledging his place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and his right to be our Judge: yet when his Saints and Servants
have need of him, he stands up to see what it is they want, how valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they behave themselves; he stands up to shew them who it is they trust,
he stands up to help and aid them, he stands up to plead and even suffer
with them, he stands up to present them to his Father, he stands up to
reward them with the garlands of Glory.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is, (oftner it has been when the beginning of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
needed it at first) that by some visible comforts and discoveries he
shews himself to the dying Saint. Often it is that the soul ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
feels some sensible joys and ravishments to uphold its failing spirits.
But he is never wanting with inward assistances and refreshments to those
who suffer for him. We must not look all of us, nor Confessors, nor
Martyrs now adays to see Visions and Revelations with St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> we
are set in a fixt way, where Reason and Religion so long prov'd and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
is able to give us comfort in the saddest distresses. God does not usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
confirm our reason by our sense in the revelation of himself, or what
he expects from us. It may be because the Devil, grown cunning now by
so many centuries of years, has taken up of late (as he is Gods ape) a
way to fetch off souls by some sensible delusions from the Faith; for he
can transform himself (nay, does so, says the Apostle) <hi>into an Angel of
light.</hi> For this it may be God sends us now to the word, and to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and leaves us to reason, tradition, and example of so many ages
to expound it. However this is sufficient that neither God nor Christ
will leave us wholly comfortless, but will surely stand by us when we
need, and supply us as there is.</p>
            <p>Indeed he cannot look for such a profession upon it as we find here from
St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> yet to a stedfast profession of our Faith, those assistances he
still allows us are sufficient. We will look a little upon <hi>Stephens</hi> though.</p>
            <p>And first, here is a kind of profession of the Blessed Trinity, the Holy
Ghost, here at the beginning of the first <hi>verse</hi> of the <hi>Text:</hi> God in the
middle, and Jesus at the end.</p>
            <p>Here is (2.) a profession of Christs manhood, whilst he calls him the
Son of Man.</p>
            <p>Here is (3.) a profession of his Faith in all of them by his so loud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming.</p>
            <p>Here is (4.) a profession of Gods ready help, Christs ready assistance
to his Saints in trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57113:79"/>
Here is (5.) a profession of Gods owning the Christians cause, and
gloriously standing up to confirm and maintain.</p>
            <p>Here is (6.) a profession of Christs opening Heaven to all Believers;
that Heaven is always open to us if we could see it; that Gods Glory
shines upon us to shew us the way thither; that Christ stands there to
make our way, to guide us thither.</p>
            <p>Here lastly is a profession of his confidence and resolution, that though
his enemies stand pressing now about him, and Death before him, he will
not eat his words, will not renounce his faith, will not slip the collar,
will not deny any thing of what he has said or done, disclaim any thing
that he believed, desert him whom he had trusted, but preach him to his
death, and die upon it.</p>
            <p>And now the heavens being open, 'tis good to make what haste we
can to enter it. <hi>Moneta</hi> a famous Doctor of <hi>Bononia,</hi> upon the hearing
these words, <hi>Behold I see the heavens open,</hi> preacht soberly upon that they
would be quickly shut if men made no more haste to enter, betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
presently, says his Story, to a Religious Order. I say nothing to that
particular, but yet must tell you the words are strong enough (if we
would look as stedfastly into them as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> did into Heaven) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
to a Religious Life. Heaven will not always be open to us. <hi>Patet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri

himself that the Bridegroom comes, and the doors are shut; there will
be a time if we continue in sin and negligence when Heaven it self, nay,
Christ himself will not let us in. Take we then our time whilst Christ
stands at the door. Heaven has this day been strangely open to us, and
Christ stood there in a glorious manner; though our eyes did not, our
Faiths I hope did see him there: 'Tis good taking this opportunity to
get in, we know not whether we shall live to the next opening. Prepare
we then our selves with St. <hi>Stephen</hi> here by stedfast looking upward into
Heaven, by disdaining and scorning all things below, by vehement ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
longings after things above, by setting our selves attentively and
constantly to our Devotions, and our Prayers, by holy Charity and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Christ, by a bold profession of our Faith and continuance in it, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <hi>Neither</hi> of them; they come well <hi>now</hi> to season our Mirth and Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they run not out too lavishly. For we find too oft there are sad

Children and our selves by disorders and excesses, for want of some
such serious thoughts: story and day stand fitly here to mind us of it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>besides</hi> they are well plac'd to teach us that we must not look only
for <hi>gaudy</hi> days by <hi>Christ;</hi> he says himself, he came <hi>to send a sword,</hi> St.
Mat. x. 34. Sent it to day amongst the <hi>little ones:</hi> sends sword and fire
too sometimes amongst the <hi>great ones</hi> in the midst of all their pleasure;
and we must expect it commonly, the closer we come to him. Nor <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
nor <hi>innocence</hi> can excuse us. We therefore not to think it strange
when it so falls out, reckon it rather a <hi>Christmas</hi> business, the matter of
our rejoycing, to suffer with these Infants for Christ, though we know
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57113:80"/>
not why, no more than they: never to think much to lose our <hi>Children</hi> or
<hi>our selves</hi> for him at any time, and so bring <hi>them</hi> up, that they may learn
to think so too. These Meditations I hope are not unseasonable, no, not
in <hi>Christmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet for all that, I ask <hi>again,</hi> Is it possible that there should be such a
thing in truth? such a wantonness in cruelty as to kill so many thousand
Children so barbarously in a time of <hi>peace?</hi> is it probable that men
should raise up <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies</hi> of their own, and make such innocent
Lambs pay for it? 'Tis <hi>Gospel</hi> you see, <hi>so</hi> true as that. Such a thing there
was in the days of <hi>Herod;</hi> and we have seen so much like it in our <hi>own,</hi>
that we may the easier believe it: Children and innocents slain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
for nothing but because some men with <hi>Herod,</hi> here, thought they
were <hi>mockt</hi> when disappointed of their projects, when <hi>Christus Domini,</hi> the
Lords <hi>Christ</hi> or Anointed had escap'd them, and the Wise men came not
in to hinder it: so they grew exceeding wroth upon it, and make poor
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> all of us still rue sorely for it.</p>
            <p>Well then, the <hi>Text</hi> being so true in it self, so pat to the time, and not

            <p>These are the <hi>Parts</hi> that make up the <hi>History.</hi> And if in the pursuing it
I shew you a <hi>mystery</hi> now and then, shew you there are more <hi>Herods</hi> and
more <hi>martyred</hi> children then we see in the <hi>letter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> that the story
is acted over still every day by <hi>our selves,</hi> you will be content I hope to
take it for an <hi>application,</hi> that brings all home. And it will not do amiss
even now at <hi>Christmas</hi> to mind us of it, that however we may not act it
then of all times else; never pollute our mirth with sinning against our
selves or others in it, or defile our joys with the cries of the oppressed,
never bring <hi>Herod</hi> so near Christ again, never make a <hi>Childermas</hi> of
<hi>Christmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To go on yet in the order of the <hi>Text,</hi> we begin with the <hi>Persecutor</hi> or
<hi>murtherer</hi> of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> whose day it is, and that here we find was <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there were <hi>under Officers</hi> that did the deed; for some such are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
when 'tis said <hi>he sent,</hi> and some such there will be <hi>always</hi> to do
the drudgeries of sin, for them that will employ them: but the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
yet is laid at the <hi>contrivers</hi> doors: that's insinuated when the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> notwithstanding is given to <hi>Herod</hi> by and by; <hi>he</hi> did but <hi>send,</hi> and
yet he <hi>slew</hi> them, says the <hi>Text.</hi> Let who will be the Executioner, the
<hi>plotter</hi> or commander is the <hi>Murtherer;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will brand him for it, be
he never so cunning, never so great. <hi>Herod</hi> with all his men of War shall
not escape it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57113:80"/>
But may we know what this <hi>Herod</hi> was? an <hi>Idumean</hi> first he was, you
may know it by his hands, <hi>red</hi> and <hi>rough.</hi> No such hands I hope in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
or in the dwellings of <hi>Iacob.</hi> They are strangers to <hi>that</hi> at least that
can be so cruel: and it had been happy for the <hi>sheep,</hi> happy for us of late,
if we had not known the voice of strangers, men of <hi>another</hi> Country
to help on our ruine, but kept close to our own <hi>Shepherds,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> tells
us his <hi>own sheep do,</hi> St. John x. 3, 5.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Herod</hi> was a man but of an obscure and private family. 'Tis <hi>such</hi>
commonly that build up their greatness upon blood and ruine; the <hi>noble</hi>
and generous soul abhors it.</p>
            <p>3. Yet <hi>thirdly,</hi> this private and mean condition his subtilty and cunning
had now advanc'd into a <hi>Throne;</hi> the less wonder still, that <hi>he</hi> should be
so savage. <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Vsurpers</hi> are so <hi>ever,</hi> jealous and suspicious, fierce
and bloody. <hi>They</hi> are they that dye their <hi>Purples</hi> in the gore of Innocents,
whilst <hi>Kings</hi> even <hi>undo</hi> themselves with their own mercies. 'Tis the <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother</hi>
that would have the Child <hi>divided;</hi> such only that are for <hi>divide,
&amp; impera,</hi> that are for Divisions to maintain their interest or their plea.
The true <hi>Mother</hi> had rather part with her Child and all she hath, then see
it murthered: But the ambitious design of power and greatness, the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on an advantageous interest, the keeping an unjust possession, are
things that slay <hi>all</hi> before them; nor the <hi>tears</hi> of Mothers, nor the <hi>cries</hi>
of Infants, nor the <hi>relations</hi> of nature, nor the <hi>obligations</hi> of friendship,
nor the <hi>charms</hi> of innocence can do any thing against those <hi>furies. Ahab</hi>
and <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and <hi>Zimri,</hi> and <hi>Iehu,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> are sufficient witnesses how
cheap the heads of all sorts are that <hi>seem</hi> but to stand in the way of their
designments; how easily <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iudicatories</hi> are packt against them,
notwithstanding reason and law stand whole for them.</p>
            <p>4. From such a one as I have hitherto presented <hi>Herod,</hi> we can perhaps
look for no other. But <hi>Herod</hi> I must tell you (4.) was a great <hi>pretender</hi>
to Religion, a high dissembler of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> throughout; none more
zealous and importunate to know <hi>Christ,</hi> and go and worship him, then he,
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. And is <hi>he</hi> the persecutor? yes he. It is not all Religion (my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
that is <hi>called</hi> so: nor are all for <hi>Christ</hi> that <hi>pretend</hi> for him. The
greatest <hi>Zealots</hi> have proved often the greatest <hi>persecutors.</hi> And the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte</hi>
either to a false Religion, or to the pretence only of a true (<hi>and one
of these was</hi> Herod) is commonly two-fold more the <hi>Child of Hell</hi> then he
that made him, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii, 15. We cannot, you see by <hi>Herod,</hi> trust <hi>all</hi>
pretenders. There are some that varnish over their very <hi>murthers</hi> with
that pretext of Religion; and whilst they pour out the blood of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
upon their <hi>Scaffolds,</hi> dare say they sacrifice at the Altar of the <hi>God</hi> of
<hi>Iustice.</hi> And had we not seen and felt it too from some <hi>huge Saints</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi>
I should have spar'd the <hi>note.</hi> But you see e're we were aware we have
discovered <hi>mysteries</hi> from the <hi>Text,</hi> and shew'd you (as I intimated I should)
<hi>other Herods</hi> there besides this <hi>one.</hi> I am afraid I shall shew you more <hi>anon.</hi> In
the <hi>interim,</hi> shall I give you <hi>Herods</hi> Character out of <hi>Chrysologus</hi> to conclude
the <hi>Point? Magister mali, Minister doli, Irae artifex,</hi> &amp;c. says he. He was a <hi>master</hi>
of mischief, a <hi>minister</hi> of deceit, an <hi>artist</hi> in cruelty, an <hi>inventer</hi> of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a <hi>contriver</hi> of villany, a <hi>destroyer</hi> of Religion, an <hi>enemy</hi> of nature, an <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor</hi>
of innocence, <hi>bad</hi> to all, <hi>worse</hi> to his own, <hi>worst</hi> to himself, from whom
<hi>Iesus</hi> fled, not so much that he might <hi>escape</hi> him, as that he might not <hi>see</hi>
him; a <hi>fiery Dragon</hi> by his name, <hi>Herodes jerud es,</hi> so <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologizes
it from the <hi>Syriack,</hi> a <hi>Dragon</hi> that devours all like fires before
him, spared not his <hi>own</hi> if they came but in his way, near a kin (sure) to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57113:81"/>
the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Revelations, Rev.</hi> xii. 17. that was wroth with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and her seed, did all he could to destroy it, even the <hi>promised</hi> seed
too, could he have found <hi>him.</hi> The fittest tempered man in the world,
<hi>this,</hi> to begin the persecution of the <hi>Church,</hi> and by whom we may learn
what sort of persons <hi>they</hi> are who are still raising or continuing it; <hi>Mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi>
of a sudden growth, men newly rais'd, men <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>ambitious,
proud</hi> and <hi>disobedient, traiterous</hi> and <hi>heady,</hi> men without <hi>natural affection,</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<hi>removed</hi> as I may say, as the <hi>Edomites</hi> from the <hi>Israelites,</hi> great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
<hi>though</hi> to <hi>godliness,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of it, yet <hi>without</hi> it. Such make
the <hi>perillous times</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2, 3, 4. or the times <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous</hi>
both to men and children. And now let's see what <hi>occasion</hi> they take
to do it. <hi>Herod</hi>'s here, was his <hi>conceiting himself mockt by the Wise men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. We cannot help mens conceits, though they help on our ruines, nor
cure a vain <hi>jealousie,</hi> though death attend it at the heels. We perish of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
by meer <hi>mistakes.</hi> The <hi>Wise men</hi> mockt not <hi>Herod, he</hi> only thought
so; nor wise nor good men use Kings or Princes so, though they be <hi>Herods,</hi>
as bad as can be: <hi>God</hi> calls them another way, and he takes it for an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,</hi>
that they paid not him the <hi>complement</hi> of a visit e're they returned.
A hard case, that the attendance upon a command of God's should prove
so prejudicial, that <hi>obedience</hi> should be a crime: but we can look for no
other, where an <hi>Herod</hi> is the interpreter of the action.</p>
            <p>And yet (2.) 'tis harder, a harder case to be undone for <hi>another</hi> mans
error or omission. It was so <hi>here;</hi> the <hi>Wise men</hi> offend, at least are thought
so, and the <hi>Children</hi> pay for't beyond an imagination. <hi>Delirant Reges ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuntur
achivi.</hi> The <hi>Wise men</hi> return another way; <hi>Herod</hi> fancies himself
neglected by it, and the <hi>innocent babes,</hi> who were concern'd in neither of
them, are punisht for the <hi>ones</hi> omission, and the <hi>others</hi> mistake.</p>
            <p>Nay and (3.) it seems <hi>Gods</hi> own <hi>contrivement</hi> too. And does the <hi>God</hi>
of Justice so little regard innocent blood, as thus to draw it on by the
way of a particular providence, we cannot understand the reason of?
'Tis enough <hi>God</hi> does. We have nought to do but to submit, and think
<hi>that</hi> best that <hi>God</hi> does, be it never so hard. Our own wisdom will mock
the wisest of us, more then <hi>Herod</hi> was by the Wise men, if we pry nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlier.</p>
            <p>For the only business we can see clearly here, <hi>is,</hi> how <hi>small</hi> a thing
men make an occasion to commit a <hi>villany.</hi> How great a matter does a
<hi>a little fire kindle?</hi> says St. <hi>Iames</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Lord!</hi> how easily do men raise
themselves into an anger? and in their anger fall presently upon the
next comes near them? dig down a wall too to come at them? Need we
had with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>cut off occasion</hi> from them that desire occasion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
xi. 12. do what we can to do it; for there are those that will take it,
even concerning the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Daniels</hi> adversaries serv'd him,
<hi>Dan.</hi> vi. 4. rather then want an opportunity to do mischief.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I know a mock, an affront, a bitter jest, a cutting word strikes
<hi>deep, wounds sore;</hi> (and I could wish men would be warier in that point
then <hi>sometimes</hi> we see them) <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> have been shatter'd by
it; but there are mocks as well as scandals that are <hi>taken</hi> and not <hi>given.</hi>
These I know not how to <hi>cure,</hi> and to <hi>fence</hi> less.</p>
            <p>Men think sometimes they are mockt, when disappointed of a <hi>sin,</hi> of
a <hi>project,</hi> of doing <hi>mischief. Potiphars</hi> Wife, when <hi>Ioseph</hi> would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with her lewd desires, she was mockt (<hi>forsooth</hi>) the <hi>Hebrew</hi> servant
came in to <hi>mock</hi> her, when he would not come in to <hi>sin</hi> with her; nay
and her <hi>Husband</hi> must bear the blame, as if <hi>he</hi> had done it, <hi>brought</hi> him
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57113:81"/>
to that purpose, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxix. 14. <hi>There,</hi> being <hi>disappointed</hi> of a <hi>sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was
being <hi>mockt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dalilah</hi> (forsooth) <hi>she</hi> is mockt too, she says, because <hi>Samson</hi> will not
discover where his great <hi>strength</hi> lay, <hi>Iudges</hi> xvi. 10, 13, 15. that she
might <hi>rob</hi> him of it, and <hi>destroy</hi> him by it. There being <hi>disappointed</hi> of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mischief,</hi> was being <hi>mockt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, Balaam</hi> he is mockt by the <hi>poor Ass,</hi> smites her with his staff, and
tells her so, when she falls down and would go no further, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxii.
29. hindering thereby the project he was going about, of <hi>enriching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the wages of unrighteousness.</hi> There the <hi>disappointment</hi> of a rich or
gainful <hi>project,</hi> is a being <hi>mockt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, sometimes the very <hi>denouncing</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> judgments seems to some
men a <hi>mocking,</hi> as it did to <hi>Lots sons in law,</hi> Gen. xix. 8. Sometimes the
very preaching a <hi>Resurrection</hi> does so too, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 32. I am afraid both
do so still to many now adays, whose <hi>Wits</hi> are more then their <hi>Religion,</hi> and
their <hi>parts</hi> greater then their <hi>graces;</hi> not to say their portions (too) in <hi>this
life</hi> fairer (I fear) then in the <hi>other.</hi> Sometimes (6.) when <hi>God</hi> bids one
thing, and <hi>men</hi> another, <hi>God</hi> sends us this way, and <hi>they</hi> call that; if we
obey <hi>Gods</hi> order, and not their <hi>ordinance,</hi> they are mockt, they think, and
slighted, and we must look to answer it with our <hi>peril,</hi> and the <hi>children
unborn</hi> perhaps may <hi>rue</hi> it. In a word, <hi>men</hi> will needs think they are
mockt sometimes, say here with <hi>Herod</hi> they see it too, unless you will
betray Christ and his Religion to them, that they may seize and order
them how they please. That's the brief of the business here, that <hi>Herod</hi>
so much <hi>stomacht,</hi> that the <hi>Wise men</hi> would not do so, would not tell him
where <hi>Christ</hi> was, that he might murther him.</p>
            <p>If now the being disappointed of a sin, of a project of doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
if the obedience to <hi>Gods</hi> command, if the protecting <hi>Christ,</hi> which
were all the cases here; or if the denouncing <hi>Gods</hi> Judgments against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or the preaching of the Resurrection, or the defence of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and not betraying it (which is almost the parallel case sometimes)
must pass with some <hi>great</hi> men, and <hi>men</hi> of wit, for a <hi>mocking</hi> of them and
a sufficient occasion for <hi>tyrannical spirits</hi> to bring on ruine and destruction
even upon the <hi>innocent,</hi> and a warrantable ground to justifie <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
rapine</hi> or <hi>injustice, God</hi> help us, and keep us upon all occasions, we
know not when we are safe. The comfort only is, <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>mockt,</hi> he
sees it, and disposes it. <hi>Christ</hi> is safe by the hand, and how ill soever it
falls out, man only is mockt, our enemies are so, and all is well.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>This</hi> for the occasion that brought this days <hi>Lambs</hi> to the slaughter.
But was there not some cause <hi>besides?</hi> had <hi>Herod</hi> no cause to do it? All
we find exprest is, that he was <hi>wroth, exceeding wroth:</hi> that's our third
particular.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>that's</hi> enough in some mens judgments to cast down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. Enough, we have found it; but <hi>cause</hi> I cannot call it, to call it
right. Mans own impetuous anger will not excuse the mischief it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.
<hi>Anger</hi> it self must have a <hi>cause,</hi> or it but aggravates the sin; is so
near a sin <hi>it self,</hi> that 'tis hard to discer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and discover when it is not. The
Apostle cannot mention being angry, but he adds with the same breath,
<hi>and sin not,</hi> Ephes. iv. 26. dares not leave anger to breath it self without
that caution.</p>
            <p>Yet supposing the anger not a sin, <hi>exceeding</hi> is. Though we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be angry, we must not be <hi>exceeding. Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> both paid for
it, <hi>Numb.</hi> xx. 10, 12. lost the enjoyment of <hi>Canaan,</hi> fell short of their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57113:82"/>
rest by it; and this same <hi>exceeding</hi> still disturbs our rest and quiet; nothing
more. <hi>Moses</hi> his just indignation at the <hi>golden Calf</hi> made him somewhat
oversee himself, when it made him cast down and break the <hi>Tables</hi> of the
<hi>Commandments</hi> which <hi>God</hi> himself had written with his own finger, <hi>Exod.</hi>
xxxii. 19. A shrewd intimation to us, that the <hi>violence</hi> of that passion,
even in a <hi>good</hi> cause sometimes, is very prone ever and anon to make <hi>us</hi> do
so too, <hi>do that</hi> in a moral and worse sense, break the <hi>Commandments</hi> worse
far then they were broken <hi>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>cause</hi> be bad, and the wrath <hi>exceeding,</hi> no wonder if it break
out into all excesses: Shall we examine what it was here? (for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of our angers are not always written upon our foreheads:) Was it
that the <hi>Magi</hi> neglected his commands, came not to him in their return?
<hi>that</hi> was somewhat, but <hi>that</hi> was not it. Was it that he truly thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>mock'd</hi> by their not returning by him? Then indeed it was, but it was
not <hi>that:</hi> that was the <hi>occasion,</hi> but not the cause. <hi>What</hi> was it think we
then? why, <hi>Christ</hi> he saw was now in a possibility to <hi>escape</hi> him, and by
a misconceit, his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he imagin'd, lay now at stake, seeing the <hi>King</hi>
of the Jews, whose birth he had lately heard of, and so much dreaded, was
now gotten he fear'd out of his reach. <hi>This</hi> was the business that so toss'd
him and turmoil'd him; and from <hi>it</hi> we learn these five particulars. (1.)
What <hi>strange</hi> fears and jealousies our interests and ambitions raise within
us. (2.) What <hi>unreasonable</hi> mistakes those fears and jealousies bring us to.
(3.) What <hi>hideous cruelties</hi> those mistakes make us run upon. (4.) How
hardly <hi>Christ</hi> himself escapes from them: (5.) Or if he does, how <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
wroth and angry we grow upon it.</p>
            <p>1. If <hi>interest</hi> or <hi>ambition</hi> possess our thoughts, how do we tremble at
the very <hi>whistlings</hi> of the wind, and start at every shadow? Let <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
but beg <hi>Abishag,</hi> and he is interpreted to beg the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
ii. 22. Let <hi>Abijah</hi> find <hi>Iereboam</hi> in the way, and foretel him the <hi>Kingdom</hi>
shall be his when <hi>Solomon</hi> sleeps with his Fathers, and <hi>Solomon</hi> cannot sleep
in quiet till he has driven him out of the land, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xi. 40. And</p>
            <p>2. When these fears have once seiz'd upon us, what <hi>mistakes</hi> run we
not into? <hi>Ahimelech</hi> gives <hi>David</hi> but a few loaves of bread, and a Sword
to <hi>defend</hi> him in the way he went, and he is presently <hi>mistaken</hi> by <hi>Saul</hi> for
a <hi>plotter</hi> against his <hi>life,</hi> for a <hi>traitor</hi> and a <hi>conspirator,</hi> 1 Sam. xxii. 13. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>such mistakes men have made of late, too late, I fear, to be yet forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet forgotten they would be easily, came they not (3.) attended with
<hi>cruelties</hi> at their heels. <hi>Ahimelechs</hi> being mistaken unhappily cost him and
his <hi>family</hi> all their lives, except <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s: <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women, Children</hi> and
<hi>Sacklings, Oxen</hi> and <hi>Asses,</hi> and <hi>Sheep, all</hi> to the Sword upon it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxii.
19. <hi>There is no stop nor bounds to the rage of that error and mistake which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and ambition raise or nourish for their own ends and purposes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were well <hi>Christ</hi> himself could escape them (4.) But <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
bear the blame as soon as any: And when I told you <hi>Ahimelech</hi> and
the <hi>Priests</hi> suffered so deep upon mistake, it was ready enough for you to
conceive Religion cannot always defend it <hi>self,</hi> or its <hi>Priests</hi> and Votaries,
from the fury even of an unfortunate Politician, <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Herod.</hi> And if
the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself, and known to be so, must be sought out, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
even by him who both knew it, and seem'd to desire it, there
are men it seems that for their interests can knew <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet <hi>persecute</hi>
him. No wonder then if they deal so with his Children and Servants,
and persecute them, though they <hi>know</hi> them such.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>lastly,</hi> if <hi>Christ</hi> himself by some peculiar providence be delivered
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57113:82"/>
from their rage, if the <hi>grounds</hi> of Religion escape sound, the lesser parts,
the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and lesser points of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Innocents,</hi> must
be <hi>massacred,</hi> (for we are exeeding angry) and though the Head escape,
the lesser members shall pay dearly for it; which though the great ones
do not, the little ones shall. <hi>Herod sends out and slays all the children that
were in Bethlehem,</hi> and <hi>the coasts about,</hi> as many as he can lay hands on.
His <hi>interests</hi> make him <hi>fear,</hi> his <hi>fears</hi> make him <hi>mistake,</hi> his <hi>mistake</hi> makes
him <hi>cruel;</hi> and though <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom be not of this world, nor <hi>Christ</hi>
an enemy either to <hi>Herod</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet the <hi>politician</hi> is bound in honour to
justifie his own fears, and rather than put up a <hi>fancied</hi> affront or slighting,
or confess a <hi>mistake,</hi> wreak his anger upon the helpless Innocents, and
make them both the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the witnesses of <hi>his</hi> own cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
<hi>Those</hi> are they I am next to speak of.</p>
            <p>IV. And I justly call them <hi>Martyrs;</hi> for if it be the <hi>cause</hi> that makes
the <hi>Martyr (and we say it is</hi>) and <hi>Christs</hi> cause be <hi>that</hi> which entitles them
more particularly to that name, I am sure they are no less; their <hi>cause</hi>
was <hi>Christs;</hi> for <hi>his sake they were killed,</hi> as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>all the day
long,</hi> accounted too, as <hi>sheep,</hi> or little <hi>lambs,</hi> appointed to be <hi>slain,</hi> Psalm
xliv. 22. And you may see them <hi>following the Lamb</hi> too under that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with the Fathers <hi>name written in their foreheads,</hi> Rev. xiv. 1. the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>first-fruits</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> ver. 4. the first that suffered,
that died for him. Who though they could not some of them speak at
all, and other of them but jabber at the most, yet they all speak out and
plain these fallowing <hi>lessons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That there is no age too young for <hi>Christs</hi> business <hi>one way</hi> or <hi>other.</hi>
They that cannot <hi>speak</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> can <hi>die</hi> for him. They that cannot <hi>come</hi>
themselves may be <hi>brought</hi> to him. They that cannot live with him, being
just going out of the world as they are coming in, may die with him in
holy <hi>Baptism</hi> e're they go. Even of such also is the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God, St.
<hi>Mat.</hi> x. 44. and it matters not whether they go by <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>Nor (2.) is any age too young to speak out <hi>Christs</hi> Glory neither. Out
of the mouths of <hi>babes</hi> and <hi>sucklings</hi> hast thou ordained strength, thou
hast <hi>perfected</hi> praise, says the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> viii. 2. S. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi. 16.
and never more eminently fulfilled then <hi>this day;</hi> their very <hi>cries</hi> were
songs of praise, <hi>Hosanna</hi>'s to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> blessed is he that cometh,
<hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in the ears of <hi>God,</hi> in whose name he cometh. None ever cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it louder, or proclaimed it higher.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Choire</hi> is a full one too; of all the children of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the
coasts about, to such an age; 14000. is the least that any <hi>say,</hi> 44. some. A
full <hi>Chorus</hi> indeed, a large <hi>first-fruits</hi> of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> to teach us, thirdly, not
to doubt of that which is attested by so many witnesses, the coming of
<hi>Christ,</hi> nor think strange of that condition, which entered with him,
which entred first with Christianity, whilst it yet was in the <hi>Cradle, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,</hi>
and <hi>Martyrdom;</hi> but to bear it patiently ever when it comes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Children</hi> themselves have undergone it here by <hi>thousands,</hi> and trod the
way before us.</p>
            <p>But they not only teach us <hi>patience</hi> by their martyrdom, but <hi>innocency</hi>
by their innocence: a fourth lesson that they give us. Let <hi>Herod</hi> and all
his Hosts, <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Herods,</hi> and <hi>Hosts,</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> of the world do what they
can, they cannot hurt us if we keep our innocence. <hi>Out</hi> of the world they
may thrust us, but <hi>into</hi> Heaven it is they drive us. <hi>Here</hi> if they please
they may truly see themselves <hi>mockt</hi> indeed, when against their wills they
<hi>undo</hi> us into a <hi>Kingdom, think</hi> they destroy us, but will find at last to their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57113:83"/>
confusion, that they have been the great instruments to us both of life
and glory. <hi>Rapiunter quidem,</hi> says S. <hi>Austin, à complexibus matrum, sed red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur
gremus angelorum:</hi> These Infants, says he, were snatcht indeed from
their <hi>Mothers breasts,</hi> but into the <hi>laps</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> were they carried, and
into the <hi>bosom</hi> of the Almighty. <hi>Quos feliciter nati,</hi> says he, <hi>again,</hi> How
happily were they born that were thus early born for <hi>Christ?</hi> how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
are they all born to whom it is given to <hi>die</hi> for him? <hi>Augustus</hi> was
deceived, very fouly out, when he cried it was better to be <hi>Herods</hi> Hog,
then <hi>Herods</hi> Child: that Child surely which died among these Innocents,
whatever his other were, was born to a Throne of Glory, to the only
Crown and Kingdom. Enough <hi>this</hi> to dry up <hi>Rachels</hi> tears, to stop the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
Mothers moans at any time, when she but thinks she hath brought
forth a Child to <hi>Christ,</hi> and placed him so soon in <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the thoughts of <hi>this,</hi> it cannot be grievous if I <hi>now</hi> tell you of
their <hi>Martyrdom</hi> or <hi>Murther;</hi> that as young, and innocent, and many as
they were, <hi>Herod sent forth and slew them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. You must not look that I should give you here the several <hi>ways</hi> and
modes of this bloody slaughter, the various <hi>arts</hi> of this horrid murther,
the diverse <hi>schemes</hi> of barbarous cruelty, the cunning <hi>sleights</hi> of those inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Butchers to delude the tender Mothers, and train the <hi>innocent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
to their deaths. You must not expect I should <hi>decipher</hi> to you the
horrible fury of that grand <hi>massacre,</hi> the terrible countenance of the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage</hi>
murtherers, the gastly faces of the astonisht <hi>Parents,</hi> the affrighted
postures of the amazed <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Allies,</hi> the <hi>frights</hi> and <hi>flights</hi> of the
little Children into <hi>holes</hi> and <hi>crannies,</hi> the sad lamentations of weeping <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
their <hi>dishevel'd</hi> hair, their <hi>wringing</hi> hands, their <hi>torn</hi> breasts and
garments, their <hi>wild</hi> frantick garbs, their <hi>fights</hi> and <hi>struglings</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their babes, the horrible screechings of the dying children, the
<hi>moans</hi> and <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> that filled all the corners of the streets; the
cries and roarings, and yellings that even <hi>rent</hi> the Heavens. You must
not think that I can tell you how those tender sucklings were some of
them in a <hi>wanton</hi> cruelty <hi>danc'd</hi> upon the tops of <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Spears;</hi> others
dasht savagely against the <hi>Walls,</hi> some thrust through with <hi>Swords,</hi> others
stabb'd with <hi>Poniards,</hi> some <hi>trampled</hi> to death upon the ground, some
<hi>strangled</hi> in their Cradles, some <hi>stifled</hi> in their Mothers arms, and others
<hi>torn</hi> in pieces to get them thence. You cannot imagine I should express
the <hi>tears,</hi> the <hi>blood,</hi> the <hi>wounds,</hi> the <hi>barbarousness,</hi> the <hi>cruelties,</hi> the <hi>confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
the <hi>consternations,</hi> the <hi>terrors,</hi> the <hi>horrors</hi> of <hi>that</hi> day. I am not <hi>skill'd</hi>
in the tracts of cruelty, nor so good an <hi>Orator</hi> to express it. Nor were it
perhaps a <hi>Rhetorick</hi> for <hi>Christmas:</hi> Only, I can tell <hi>you</hi> what the Text does
<hi>me,</hi> that slain they were, all the children that were in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and
the <hi>coasts about, from two years old, and under;</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did it.</p>
            <p>Not himself I confess. There are <hi>sins</hi> we are asham'd to commit our
<hi>selves,</hi> as well as sins we <hi>cannot</hi> commit without company to help us. And
such was this; so <hi>horrid,</hi> he was asham'd to stand by to <hi>own</hi> it; so <hi>great,</hi> he
could not act it, but by involving almost an <hi>host</hi> of <hi>men</hi> in the guilt and
mischief. A murther which neither the <hi>greatness</hi> of the one, nor the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
of the other, neither his jealousies nor their obedience, neither his
<hi>command,</hi> nor their <hi>trade</hi> of life shall be ever able to excuse, nor any <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi>
ever find a plea for.</p>
            <p>VI. But though I cannot be exact in the <hi>relation,</hi> I must needs say in
the <hi>last place, Herod</hi> was in the <hi>transaction</hi> so exact, that (1.) <hi>Bethlehem</hi> he
thought too narrow a <hi>Stage</hi> for this new <hi>Tragedy;</hi> he takes in all the <hi>coasts</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57113:83"/>
about; though the <hi>Prophet</hi> had plainly cold <hi>Christ</hi> should be born in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi>
and the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nhedrim</hi> had so resov'd it to him, and his main business
was to murther <hi>him:</hi> yet to make all sure, he stretches out his fury to
the neighbouring <hi>towns.</hi> By the way, give me leave to observe, <hi>Great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are sometimes ill neighbours;</hi> they too often destroy our children by the
contagion of their mischiefs, and ruine the young <hi>heirs</hi> of the <hi>Towns,</hi>
and <hi>Mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi> that are near them, by the company that the infernal
<hi>Herod</hi> sends out thither daily to that purpose. But I retreat, and tell
you,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Herod</hi> was so exact in the designs of cruelty, that he extends the
<hi>time</hi> as well as the <hi>place</hi> beyond what he had learn'd of the <hi>Wise men. Christ</hi>
was now but a <hi>year</hi> old at most, (and more probably not so much.) <hi>Herod</hi>
stretches out his design for <hi>two.</hi> What's the reason? why! the <hi>bloody</hi> man
and the unjust possessor never think they are safe, till they are beyond all
reason. For if <hi>Christ</hi> was now about two years old, why are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of but <hi>two</hi> days slain? if but <hi>two</hi> months or thereabouts, (as
<hi>some</hi> place this business not long after his being presented in the
<hi>Temple</hi>) why are the children of <hi>two years</hi> old demanded to the
slaughter?</p>
            <p>At least (3.) how comes his <hi>own</hi> Son into the number? so <hi>Macrobius</hi>
relates the story, and <hi>Augustus</hi> alluded to it in his witty speech. This too,
to shew us how exactly wicked some men are, that spare neither <hi>Kindred</hi>
nor <hi>Children</hi> to fix themselves.</p>
            <p>And to give you <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty here <hi>full:</hi> According to the time he had
diligently enquired of the Wise men it was also, says the <hi>Text.</hi> Very
<hi>inquisitive</hi> about it he had been it seems, and he miss'd not a point of it:
so whether <hi>Christ</hi> was born when <hi>first</hi> the Star appeared, or whether he
was then only first <hi>incarnate</hi> and conceived in the Womb, he would be
sure he thought to have him; a year <hi>under</hi> or <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver</hi> would be sure to reach
him: so <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>punctual</hi> is the cruel and ambitious nature to <hi>defend</hi> its
own interest and greatness, that it cannot rest till it have stopt all <hi>ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi>
and <hi>cranies</hi> of fear, and satisfied them to a nicety; and it boggles
not at any age or time, or relation, or diligence, or inquisitiveness to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it. But 'tis time now to look home.</p>
            <p>Yet if any now should be so inquisitive to ask a reason why <hi>God</hi> should
thus suffer these innocent Infants thus to be cruelly massacred, though we
are not his counsellors, yet we may say, it might be to shew the <hi>absoluteness</hi>
of his <hi>Dominion,</hi> that he is <hi>Lord</hi> of life and death, gives and disposes them
as he will. It may be (2.) to teach us that <hi>innocence</hi> it self is not always
a <hi>fence</hi> against death, or violence. It may be (3.) to instruct us what
<hi>they</hi> must look for from the first, that have any relation to <hi>Christ</hi> at all. It
may be (4.) it was, that by this strange accident and occasion the Birth
of <hi>Christ</hi> might be <hi>proclaimed</hi> through the world. And yet fifthly, add
but the consideration, that they were the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> where
Christ could get no lodging, where he was fain to make the <hi>Stable</hi> his
<hi>Chamber,</hi> and the <hi>Manger</hi> his <hi>Cradle:</hi> and it will not seem unreasonable
that God should thus punish the Fathers in their Children for it, and leave
some of them scarce a Child for their <hi>houses,</hi> who would not leave him a
<hi>house</hi> for his <hi>Child.</hi> But lastly, God's thus advancing the deaths of these
little Infants into a <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> giving them the first honour to die for
<hi>Christ,</hi> and as it were redeem his life with theirs, so early bringing them
to Heaven by suffering, there is no reason of complaining; nothing to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57113:84"/>
cloud our <hi>Christmas</hi> joys, or disturb our rejoycing. Those little ones are
singing in the Heavens about the <hi>Lamb, Rev.</hi> xiv. 3. And 'twill do well
that we here upon earth should sing <hi>Blessing,</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> that God
has so exalted them, and comforts us; make it one of our <hi>Christmas Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rols,</hi>
our songs of joy.</p>
            <p>Yet somewhat to <hi>allay</hi> your joy, that your mirth run not too high, I
shall after this long story tell you a <hi>tale</hi> in your ears will make them glow.
<hi>Herod</hi> is not <hi>dead,</hi> nor <hi>sleepeth.</hi> We are all of us <hi>Herods,</hi> or <hi>Herodias</hi>'s, men
and women, <hi>one way</hi> or <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have been as deep <hi>dissemblers</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> some among us, as ever <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod;</hi>
many as <hi>bloody</hi> too, upon it. Many sad <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>mistakes</hi> have many
of us made, and many a <hi>thousand</hi> souls have miserably <hi>perisht</hi> by them.
<hi>Angry</hi> men have been <hi>exceeding</hi> angry, that the <hi>Magi,</hi> many a wise man and
good, would not comply with <hi>their</hi> interests and projects, or communicate
with <hi>their</hi> sins. Angry, some I am afraid <hi>still,</hi> that <hi>Christ,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> is
escap'd their fury, that <hi>their</hi> kingdoms are not establisht, though it was
<hi>Christs</hi> that was by <hi>them</hi> pretended, but just as the <hi>Worshiping</hi> him was
by <hi>Herod.</hi> And I cannot tell but there may be yet some projects of
sending out to <hi>slay men</hi> and <hi>children</hi> to begin <hi>Herods work anew, the War
afresh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am sure, though we cannot <hi>reach</hi> that mystery, there is <hi>one</hi> you
will easily understand, shall serve for an <hi>application</hi> to drive all home. Our
<hi>own children</hi> are daily murthered by us, their very <hi>souls</hi> destroyed: a <hi>sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cruelty than</hi> Herods.</p>
            <p>Not to tell you that the <hi>Mother</hi> kills them often in the <hi>Womb</hi> by the
<hi>folly</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of a <hi>dress,</hi> by an unruly <hi>humour,</hi> by a <hi>disordered appetite,</hi> by
a <hi>heedless</hi> or <hi>giddy motion;</hi> nor that the <hi>nurse</hi> kills them at the <hi>breast</hi> by her
intemperance and <hi>excess,</hi> though it be too true: Yet it is a less murther,
<hi>that,</hi> than to <hi>kill</hi> the <hi>soul,</hi> and yet this done oftner. And I'le assure you
first, they venture their Children hard that deny them <hi>Baptism: I'le say
no more.</hi> But after that they are smothered, some in their Mothers <hi>lap,</hi>
kill'd with <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>indulgence;</hi> stabb'd through with <hi>poniards,</hi> others,
undone with <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>unkindness; trampled</hi> to death <hi>others,</hi> and perish by
their friends <hi>carelesness</hi> and <hi>neglect.</hi> Some are <hi>dasht</hi> against the <hi>Walls,</hi> their
<hi>brains</hi> beat out at least, wholly corrupted by false principles from their
<hi>cradles:</hi> Some we <hi>trail</hi> along the streets, and destroy them by our ill <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi>
some we <hi>choak</hi> with <hi>intemperances</hi> and <hi>excesses,</hi> even in Christmas too;
some we destroy our <hi>selves,</hi> others we send out <hi>servants</hi> and <hi>companions</hi> to
destroy, give them such to tend them as teach them <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>scorn,</hi> and
<hi>anger,</hi> and <hi>frowardness,</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>wantonness,</hi> e're they understand
them; such as teach them to <hi>bestow</hi> a <hi>curse,</hi> e're they can <hi>ask</hi> a <hi>blessing,</hi> and
to speak <hi>ill</hi> e're they can <hi>well</hi> speak. And as if we were resolved to make
all sure, we send them abroad to be bred sometimes to places of <hi>licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
and <hi>debauchery,</hi> that they may be sure to be <hi>gallant</hi> sinners, because
forsooth 'tis pedantick and below a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be a thorow <hi>Christian,</hi> to
suck in the <hi>tame</hi> and <hi>conscientious</hi> principles of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and all upon
<hi>Herods</hi> mistake, that <hi>wise men</hi> will <hi>mock</hi> us for them, when 'tis only that
they are wisely <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>mistaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now shall we cry out of <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty, and do worse our <hi>selves?</hi>
shall we complain he kill'd the <hi>Innocents</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> and we make nothing <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
day to destroy even <hi>innocency</hi> it self? A less, far lesser cruelty it would
be to take these tender blossoms and shake them off the tree, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57113:84"/>
them to grow up to fruits which we can but curse our selves, and
others will curse the tree from bearing them. Nay, a greater mercy it
were to the poor children, to <hi>dash</hi> them against the <hi>stone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> to <hi>smother</hi> them
in the <hi>Cradle,</hi> to <hi>overlay</hi> them in the <hi>bed,</hi> to <hi>dispatch</hi> them any way <hi>innocent</hi>
into the other world, than to <hi>nurse</hi> them up to our <hi>own follies,</hi> than to <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>
them with our <hi>debaucheries,</hi> than to <hi>corrupt</hi> them with <hi>atheistical</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi>
principles, than to <hi>defile</hi> them with <hi>lusts,</hi> than to train them up
to be wicked, or meerly vain and unprofitable, breed them up to Hell, to
eternal ruine. Yet the tender and delicate woman, that can scarce endure
to set her foot upon the ground for <hi>niceness,</hi> thus daily <hi>murthers</hi> her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>darling</hi> without <hi>scruple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed, do men and women pray for Children as a <hi>blessing,</hi> that
they may only turn them into a <hi>curse?</hi> only <hi>desire</hi> them, that they may
<hi>destroy</hi> them? surely one would think they did so, that sees how great a
<hi>study</hi> it is to make them <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>proud,</hi> and <hi>envious,</hi> and <hi>lewd,</hi> and <hi>wicked.</hi>
Our <hi>Herods</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi>'s cut off the <hi>baptized</hi> Infants heads, as they of old
did the <hi>Baptists.</hi> We even <hi>dance</hi> them to death, and compromise them to
Hell as soon almost as the <hi>baptismal</hi> waters are <hi>dried</hi> upon them. And must
old <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> only bear the blame of murdering <hi>Innocents,</hi> and we
that do it over and over scape without an accusation? In this too, worse
then <hi>Herod:</hi> He only slew the Children from <hi>two</hi> years old and under, we
<hi>under</hi> and <hi>above</hi> too, from their first day upward, till we have rendred them
incorrigible to age, and past recovery. The subtilest policy of the Devil,
<hi>this,</hi> thus to kill poor Children from their infancy, when they neither
know who hurt them, nor how they came in the confines of that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
death they dwell in; can only say, they were so dealt with in the
<hi>house of their friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall we say my beloved, when these murther'd Children shall
cry out against us, out of their miserable Cells at last (for they will do
then at least as these did from under the Altar long ago) <hi>How long, O Lord,
how long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
that spilt it, on our Fathers, and on our Mothers, and on our friends,</hi> that thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
sent us <hi>hither,</hi> when we might otherwise have come <hi>to thee?</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall we turn, what shall we answer? or rather because we cannot
answer, let us take heed we handle the matter so, that we come not to
it. We pretend to <hi>love</hi> our Children, and thereupon we strive to make
them <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>fine,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>honourable:</hi> why do we then beggar
them from their Childhood, with bringing them up to those vanities
that will undo them? why do we deform them with sins and vices, les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
them with education, make them dishonourable by training them up
in ignoble and dishonest principles? why do we in all these ruine them
from the first? At least why do we not love our selves who (for ought I
know) must needs perish <hi>with them,</hi> and perish <hi>for them,</hi> for thus destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them?</p>
            <p>Were we but kind to our <hi>own</hi> souls, we would be to <hi>theirs:</hi> But to fill
up the measure, we play the <hi>Herods,</hi> and act the murtherers <hi>lastly</hi> upon <hi>our</hi>
selves. We daily stifle those heavenly <hi>births</hi> of <hi>good desires</hi> and thoughts
that are at any time begotten in us by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and walk on confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to death and darkness.</p>
            <p>But we have acted <hi>Herods</hi> part too long, and I fear I have been too long
upon it. To be short now, let's turn our <hi>slaughtering hands</hi> upon our <hi>sins</hi>
and <hi>vices,</hi> kill them, mortifie them, and henceforward act the part of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57113:85"/>
the <hi>blessed Innocents;</hi> set our selves from this day to better practices, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the two grand lessons of the day, <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Patience; Innocence</hi> in
our lives, and <hi>Patience</hi> in our deaths, or rather patience in them <hi>both.</hi>
Study them our selves, teach them our Children, and continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them in those happy ways, that when we shall have serv'd our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
generations, and go hence, we may all meet at last, <hi>Fathers,</hi> and
<hi>Mothers,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> at the great Supper of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and together
with these blessed <hi>Innocents</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> follow the <hi>Lamb</hi> for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

Circumcision.</head>

               <bibl>2 COR. v. 17.</bibl>
               <q>Old things are past away, behold all things are become new.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S face in water answers face, so does the face of the
<hi>Text</hi> the face of the <hi>Church</hi> in the times we live in,
where old things are past away, all things become new.
But as where the faces are like, the minds often are
not so, so the sense of the <hi>Text,</hi> and the sense of the
<hi>Times</hi> are as unlike as may be, however like the words
be to them. Old <hi>legal Ceremonies</hi> and old corruptions
past in the <hi>Text;</hi> Old corruptions, and old heresies and errors renewed in
the Times. The glorious Gospel of Christ newly appearing with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
answerable to it in the <hi>Text;</hi> A Gospel I know not whose, not of
Peace, but of War, not of Love and Unity, but of Faction and Schism,
with affections and courses according, in the <hi>times.</hi> New things, such
as belong to the new Man, righteousness and true holiness, passed over,
as unnecessary or unprofitable, all good order antiquated and out of date,
cast away as old things, all good things quite ruin'd and decay'd.</p>
            <p>It were to be wish'd (but 'tis but meerly to be wish'd, scarce hop'd, I
fear) that the sense as well as the words might fit us, that the new things
in the <hi>Text,</hi> were the new ones of the <hi>Times;</hi> that the old ones here, were
the old ones there; That the <hi>new year</hi> but lately entred, might bring us
this news.</p>
            <p>But however, I may wish and hope too, I hope, that we in particular
will take occasion from it to renew our hearts with the year, and begin it
in newness of life and conversation, to live the new year like new men,
better than of old.</p>
            <p>And though the new <hi>times,</hi> as now they are, will not agree with the
<hi>Text,</hi> no more than these new men of the times their Sermons do in words
only, at the most; yet, because I love to speak seasonably as well as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
a <hi>Text</hi> in season, if I may have leave to fit the <hi>Text</hi> to the old
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57113:86"/>
time of <hi>Christmas,</hi> there can be nothing more suitable to both the words
and meaning of the Text, than this holy <hi>Feast,</hi> and the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>From this <hi>Feast,</hi> from Christs birth it was that all old legal ceremonies
had their pass, to pass away; from hence all things both in Heaven and
earth are reconciled, by him all things made new, by him the old man
abolished, and the new man created in us; the old Law abrogated, the
new Law come in place; the old Law of Works anulled, the new Law
of Faith established; all <hi>old things past away, all things become new,</hi> through
his coming into the world.</p>
            <p>And the use and moral of the whole <hi>Feast,</hi> and the three solemn <hi>great
days</hi> in it, is no more than that we would let old things pass, old worldly
affections die, lay off the old, and become new men all; Be (1.) rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
in our spirits, and new born with him upon <hi>Christmas-day.</hi> Have
our old man (2.) circumcised, our old fleshly members mortified upon
<hi>Circumcision-day;</hi> and be wholly renewed in all our parts upon the same, as
<hi>New-years-day.</hi> Begin (3.) the publick profession of our renovation, and
new service with the <hi>Wise men, worshipping, adoring,</hi> and <hi>presenting</hi> him our
<hi>gifts</hi> upon the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or <hi>Twelfth;</hi> so changing our old Master, and the
service of sin, for our new Master and his service; forgetting the old, and
pressing on to the new.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a perfect <hi>Christmas Text,</hi> and more evidently a <hi>New-years</hi>
one; yet both, both in words and sense. I have given you the whole
sense of it from the <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>Christmas,</hi> and both told you their meaning,
and the <hi>Texts;</hi> what the several days of the <hi>Feast</hi> teach you, and what
all the parts of the <hi>Text</hi> would have you learn: of which this is the sum,
That through Christ all old things, the old Law, the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the
old corruptions of Nature, the law of sin are past away, done away, and
abolished, and a new law established, new grace brought to us, new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
created in us; all through him, and by his coming: and that
whosoever is in Christ, in whom he is come, in him old things are past
away, all things are become new, he is a new creature quite, in the
words that usher in the Text: so the parts of it will be <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>What since Christs coming is become</hi> of all things? What is the state of
the Gospel? And</item>
               <item>2. What upon that is become of those that are in him?</item>
            </list>
            <p>For to understand the <hi>Text</hi> fully, we are to consider it, (1.) as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
proposition, concerning the state of the Gospel of Christ, that <hi>old
things</hi> in general <hi>are past away, and all things</hi> altogether <hi>become new,</hi> through
it, and him. (2.) As a particular application made to any man that is in
<hi>Christ,</hi> it is truly in that state, that in him <hi>old things are past away, all things
become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Now in the general, <hi>old things are past away,</hi> that's become of them,
of all old things, since Christs coming; and <hi>all things</hi> else <hi>are become new,</hi>
that's become of them, or so are they become.</p>
            <p>2. In particular, this is become of them in whom Christ is, or who are
in him, true sons of the Gospel; <hi>old things are past with them,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi>
in them <hi>become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall add, a third as the proper Use both of <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>time</hi> of
the <hi>old days</hi> and the <hi>new year;</hi> what is most becoming us, for whom also
Christ came, to whom still he daily comes, even to cast away all old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and in all things to become new.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>Text</hi> as it may be applied to the general state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Gospel, where we shall consider it first respectively, then
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57113:86"/>
absolutely: (1.) In comparison with the estate of things, both under
the old Law, and under the Gentile infidelity; that the Gospel is a state
where both all those old legalities are abolished, and heathen errors done
away. (2.) In it self, that the Gospel is a new state of affairs and things,
where <hi>all things are become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Old things, those must be first; and they may all be reduced to these
two heads, God's way of dealing with the <hi>Iews,</hi> and his way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> With the <hi>Iews</hi> first, where both the old way of his
<hi>Service,</hi> and the old way of his <hi>Providence,</hi> those two grand things that
include all the rest, are to be examined how they pass.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> consisted (1.) in <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and they are done; no more
blood of Bulls, or Lambs, or Goats; they could not <hi>make the comers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
perfect,</hi> Heb. x. 1. so they are gone.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (2.) consisted in outward <hi>washings, Heb.</hi> ix. 10. but they
could wash no further than the flesh, cleanse no more then the outward
man: <hi>Not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 S. Pet. iii. 21.
that's nothing, for that's but a vanity to stand on, vain, and to so little
purpose, no wonder if that way of serving God be vanish'd too.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (3.) was much then in <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks, Heb.</hi> ix. 10. this
they might eat, and that they might not; but all to perish with the using:
Why are you any longer subject to those ordinances about them? says St.
<hi>Paul, Col.</hi> ii. 20, 22. <hi>For meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God
shall destroy both it and them,</hi> says he again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 14. so they pass too.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (4.) stood much in <hi>Holy-days, new Moons, and Sabbaths,</hi> Col.
ii. 16. but they were but shadows of things to come, <hi>the Body is of Christ,</hi>
ver. 17. 'twas time they should be packing, when the reality of things
were come.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (5.) was especially notified by <hi>Circumcision;</hi> but <hi>Circumcision
is nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 19. that is passed away indeed to purpose, the
greatest passing, to pass into nothing.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (6.) was confin'd to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to that only
<hi>Altar</hi> there: but it was but a figure, for the time then present, says St.
<hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> ix. 9. and you see how the present time is past; there was no
way into the holiest, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. whilst that was standing, 'twas but neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that also should pass away, <hi>&amp; neque in hoc neque in illo,</hi> the time was
coming that they should neither worship in this nor that, nor that at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizim,</hi>
nor that at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. No, there should not be left so
much as <hi>one stone upon another,</hi> says Christ, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 2. that's pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
away indeed.</p>
            <p>His <hi>service</hi> (lastly) was in a manner all <hi>type</hi> and <hi>shadow,</hi> Heb. x. 1. Not
so much as the image of things themselves. And the shadows must needs
away, when the Day-spring begins to visit us, and the Sun arises. Away
shadows, get you behind us; we see our Sun of Righteousness up, and
risen on us: and 'tis fit we should turn our backs upon our shadows, and
worship and adore him. The <hi>Persians</hi> did so superstitiously to the Sun in
Heaven, we must do it devoutly to the spiritual and eternal Sun of
Glory.</p>
            <p>For how much are we bound to Christ, to God in Christ, that he has
freed us from those imperfect, yet costly Sacrifices, those troublesom ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinences,
those unprofitable washings, those strict severities of <hi>new Moons</hi>
and <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> that painful Rite of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> those long Journeys to
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship those empty <hi>shadows,</hi> and given us full perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks,</hi> and all things else; the doing whereof is no
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57113:87"/>
real profit, and brought home his <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> to our doors, our
happiness into our bosoms. Though all those old things be pass'd away,
let not his goodness in passing them away ever pass out of our memories,
nor a day pass without praises to him for it, nor the relation of it pass out
of our lips without all thankfulness and humility.</p>
            <p>And there will be more reason for it, if we reflect now upon the course
of his old <hi>providence,</hi> altered towards us. In the old way of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and dispensations with the <hi>Iews,</hi> He first led them only with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
promises, fed them only with such hopes, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxviii. no other to
be found the whole old Bible over. We must not now look for the same
dealing, we; Afflictions are made our glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 9. and we blessed by
them, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 11. our hopes higher, our promisses better, <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 2. So
let the other pass, no matter.</p>
            <p>He awed them, secondly, with temporal punishments; they could not
sin but they were presently punished for it; sometime a Plague, another
while the Sword, then wild Beasts and Serpents, now Dearth and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
sometimes a fire from heaven, another time a gaping of the earth
and swallowing all; seldom but some exemplary or sudden death, or
some strange visitations, were the method God used to bring the rest into
order and obedience. Such things are rare among us, whom God ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
with the threats of future judgments, that we might have the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
time for our repentance and amendment; his providence is now much
fuller of patience and long suffering to bring us to it, his anger and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is passed away.</p>
            <p>He comforted them, thirdly, by only obscure and dark Prophesies, so
dark that he often that spoke them did not perfectly understand them.
All those Prophesies are now plain to us, and those shadowy expressions
lightned and cleared by Christ. He opened his Disciples understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
St. <hi>Luk.</hi> xxiv. 45. that they might understand them, and from them we
have all those former Praedictions clear as the midday Sun: Those
obscure things, or the obscurity of those things, are also passed
away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The old way then was, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> a sad Covenant of
Works, which yet we were not able to perform. That is done away in
Christ, and the Covenant of Faith come in the room, <hi>Iustus ex fide,</hi> to
live by that an easier way for us.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Gods way then with them was by Rites and Ceremonies,
old things which <hi>neither we, nor our</hi> old <hi>fathers were able to bear,</hi> if
we believe St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> xv. 10. these, to be sure, a good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for us that they were among the things that were done away,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 7, 11.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The very subject, as we may say, of his <hi>Providence,</hi> is altered
too. In the days of old it was commonly none but the rich and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
very few else that were imployed in the great services of the Law,
insomuch as it was a <hi>Proverb, Spiritus Sanctus non requiescit super animan pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris;
The holy Spirit never lights upon the poor mans soul.</hi> But now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the poor are preach'd to, and the poor preach
too, and <hi>Blessed are the poor.</hi> The way of Gods dispensation is strangely
changed, that old way past too.</p>
            <p>What can we then do less than pass our selves into his <hi>service,</hi> under
his protection? Than pass our souls and spirits out of our lips in praises
and thanksgiving? That all those beggarly Elements, as the Apostle
calls them, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 9. those temporal promises and threats; that heavie
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57113:87"/>
slavish servitude, that dealing with us as with untoward children under
the rod, or as slaves and servants is past from us; that we are now at
the liberty of Sons, and the honour of being the friends of God, such
to whom God is now pleased in Christ to reveal his secrets and mysteries
so long <hi>hidden,</hi> even <hi>from the beginning of the world,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks,
<hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 9. and into which <hi>the Angels desire to look into, 1 Pet.</hi> i. 13. That he
hath now <hi>revealed them unto babes, Mat.</hi> xi. 25. That no condition now, be
it never so poor, or mean, or weak, but is made partakers of his grace
and glory in the face of Jesus Christ. How great a comfort and glory is
it to us, that all old things are thus past away, and all things become
new? Yet there are worse old things behind, the old things of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
which we are to consider now, both what they are, and how they too are
past away. The old errors, and the old sins of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they are the
old things of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and they are past.</p>
            <p>1. The old heathen ignorance and error; They were in a shadow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the very <hi>shadow of death, Luk.</hi> 1. 70. a thick black darkness, the very
Region of death, and Land of darkness, saith the <hi>Prophet;</hi> they <hi>knew
not God,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> i. <hi>having their understanding darkned, because
of the blindness of their heart, Eph.</hi> vi. 18. All these shaddows are disperst,
all this darkness past away when <hi>Zacharies day spring</hi> rose upon them;
they are not now what they were before Christ came, they are much
enlightned.</p>
            <p>2. Nor appear their sins now of so deep a blackness, since Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for them also. Before we read of nothing but the Idolatries, the
Vanities, the Abominations of the Heathen: that they were alienated,
wholly <hi>alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that was in them,
Eph.</hi> iv. 18. walking after their own lusts, and in the vanities of their
wicked mind, being delivered up to the Prince of the air, who wholly
ruled and worked in them, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 2. But these things were passed over
by the mercy of God in Christ, and even they also received the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace and Pardon.</p>
            <p>And in the second place, the way of Gods <hi>Providence</hi> towards them
also, as well as towards the <hi>Iews,</hi> past into another mode. It was in old
time, but a <hi>Iob,</hi> but an <hi>Vriah,</hi> but an <hi>Ittai,</hi> but a <hi>Iethro,</hi> but a <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>man</hi>
in an Age; an <hi>Vzzite,</hi> a <hi>Hittite,</hi> a <hi>Gittite,</hi> a <hi>Midianite,</hi> a <hi>Syrian</hi> but now
and then; <hi>Israel</hi> was the only <hi>Goshen,</hi> the only Land where the light shone
free. The case is altered now by Christ. Indeed for a while, till the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were first served, or at least first offered meat, it was, <hi>Go not into the way
of the Gentiles,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 5. But when Christ had now compleated his work,
and was going up to heaven, then <hi>Go and preach to all Nations</hi> was the stile;
and <hi>Lo I send thee far unto the Gentiles, Acts</hi> xxii. 21. was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and others after him. So the <hi>Partition Wall</hi> is now past through,
and the distinction of <hi>Iew and Gentile,</hi> that old difference, past
away.</p>
            <p>Nay, secondly, the other branch of Gods dealing with them is so too.
In those <hi>times of ignorance God winked at them,</hi> tolerated, or at least not
punished them, saies St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> xvii. 30. <hi>But now he commandeth all
men every where to repent,</hi> says he; the old course is past, Gods way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them now is become new.</p>
            <p>Thus we have another ground of thanks and praise, that God has not
only freed us from the <hi>servitude of the Law,</hi> but from the slavery of <hi>Satan;</hi>
not only from the dusky shadows of the <hi>Iewish,</hi> but from the dismal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Gentile Coasts.</hi> Let not this pass further without a Song of praise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57113:88"/>
               <hi>But how shall we now worthily praise him for the next, for making all
things new:</hi> Novus Rex, &amp; nova Lex, a new King, and a new Law. Novus
Grex, &amp; novum Regnum; a new Church, and a new Kingdom. Novum Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,
&amp; novum Sacramentum: new Covenants, and new Sacraments:
Novum Sacrificium &amp; novus Sacerdos; a new Sacrifice and a new Priesthood: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Templum, &amp; novum Altare; a new Temple, and a new Altar. Novus
Spiritus, <hi>and</hi> nova vita, a new Spirit, and a new kind of life: <hi>All new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Novus Rex,</hi> a new King; we have no ordinary one neither: a King
with an <hi>Ecce, Ecce venit,</hi> both in <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Evangelist; Behold thy King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi>
says <hi>Zachary, Zach.</hi> ix. 9. and S. <hi>Matthew</hi> xxi. 5. says the same. A
King worth beholding: The <hi>Wise men</hi> came I know not how far to see
him, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> ii. 2.</p>
            <p>2. And with a new Law he came, a <hi>new Commandment,</hi> S. John xiii.
<hi>A perfect Law,</hi> S. James. i. 25. <hi>A Law of liberty,</hi> chap. ii. 12. <hi>A royal Law,</hi>
ver. 8. of the same <hi>Chapter, The Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus,</hi> Rom.
viii. 2. The old Law was a bondage, this new one makes us free, as it
follows there.</p>
            <p>3. A new Church he came to gather, much different from the old: A
Church purchas'd by his Blood, a costly one, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 28. <hi>A glorious Church,
not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,</hi> but <hi>holy and without blemish,</hi> Eph.
v. 27. much larger than the old; an universal Church, all the Gentiles
also new come in, the utmost parts of the earth, the confines of it,
<hi>Psal.</hi> ii.</p>
            <p>4. A new Kingdom there is come too; a Kingdom above all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> S. Mat. iii. 2. A Kingdom of Grace; and
a Kingdom of Glory; a Kingdom never heard of before Christs coming
with it: no news, no hopes, no mention of the Kingdom of Heaven all
the old Scripture through; those <hi>exceeding great and precious promises</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for us, 2 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 4. They under the Law were led like Children
with the nuts and rattles of temporal promises and rewards: Christ first
promis'd a Kingdom for the recompence of reward; a Kingdom too
wherein we are all <hi>Kings,</hi> Rev. i. 6.</p>
            <p>This new Kingdom (5.) brings a new Covenant, <hi>novum Testamentum;</hi>
take <hi>Testamentum</hi> how you will, for a Covenant or a Writing; and <hi>novum</hi>
either for the Covenant of Grace, or for a new <hi>Schedule</hi> of Scripture that
contains it: we find both new now, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 15. <hi>I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
says God, <hi>Ier.</hi> xxxi. 31. And he did so, says the <hi>Apostle, Heb.</hi> viii.
6. But what was it? <hi>I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in
their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities
will I remember no more,</hi> ver. 10. 12. a Covenant of pardon and remission,
such as the Sacrifices of the Law could not give, were not able. And new
Books we have it written in, as <hi>authentick</hi> as those old ones in the <hi>Iewish
Canon,</hi> where we may find all seal'd by the testimony of the Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi.
the Author of the new <hi>Testament</hi> as well as of the old.</p>
            <p>6. The new <hi>Church</hi> has its new <hi>Sacraments. Ite &amp; Baptizata,</hi> for <hi>Ite &amp;
Circumcidite; Baptism</hi> for <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper for</hi> the <hi>Passeover;</hi>
in both which of ours there is more than was in theirs, in those legal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies;
not only <hi>outward signs</hi> as they, but <hi>inward graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. New <hi>Sacrifices, the calves of our lips,</hi> instead of Calves and Goats;
the sacrifices of Praises and Thanksgivings, nay the sacrifice of a contrite
heart, and humble spirit, the sacrificing of our lusts, and the offering
up of <hi>our souls and bodies, a living, holy, acceptable Sacrifice,</hi> Rom. xii. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:57113:88"/>
8. A new <hi>Priesthood</hi> to offer them, <hi>an unchangeable Priesthood</hi> now, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii.
24. Christ our High-Priest, and the Ministers of the New Testament,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6. as so many under-Priests to offer them up to God. Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himself a Sacrifice, offers up also our Prayers and Praises to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
has left his Ministers in his Name, and Merits to do it too: and
this a lasting <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to last for ever.</p>
            <p>9. We have a new <hi>Altar</hi> too; so St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> xiii. 10. <hi>an Altar that
they which serv'd the Tabernacle have no power to eat of.</hi> Take it for the <hi>Cross</hi>
on which Christ offered up himself; or take it for the <hi>holy Table,</hi> where that
great Sacrifice of his is daily commemorated in Christian Churches:
<hi>Habem,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle;</hi> such an one we have, and I am sure 'tis new.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Temples</hi> we have many new; the Temples of our bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi.
19. those both to offer in, and offer up: and (2.) <hi>Churches</hi> many, for that
one <hi>Temple</hi> so long since buried in dust and rubbish.</p>
            <p>11. There is above these <hi>a new Spirit, Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 26. not <hi>the spirit
of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Rom. viii. 15. the spirit of love, and not of fear; the spirit of Sons,
and not of Servants; a spirit that will cause us to walk in Gods Statutes,
keep his Commandments, and do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 27. a new thing
indeed, that can make the Beasts of the Field to honour him, as the
<hi>Prophet</hi> speaks of it, <hi>Isa.</hi> xliii. 19. the Dragons and the Owls to do so,
the most sensual, fierce, cruel, and dullest natures bow unto him, that gives
waters in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desart, <hi>Isa.</hi> xliii. 19. 20. that
blows but with his wind, and these waters flow, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlvii. 18. this is a
new spirit that is so powerful.</p>
            <p>And from this spirit it is that we (12.) receive new life and vigour,
that we walk not under the Gospel so dully and coldly as they under the
Law, where the outward work to the letter serv'd the turn; but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the spirit, in the inward purity of the heart, as well as in the
outward purity of the body.</p>
            <p>To which, lastly, there is a new inheritance annexed, a new Heaven,
and a new Earth, which we may look for according to his promise, 2 St.
<hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 13.</p>
            <p>And are not these new things all good news, worth our rejoycings?
Can we be ever old that enjoy such mercies? are they not enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the dying spirit, nay to raise the dead one to set forth his praises,
who thus renews us as the Eagle renews his mercies to us every morning,
makes us <hi>Kings and Priests,</hi> gives us easie Laws, and pleasing Covenants,
effectual Sacrifices, and saving Sacraments; turns our bodies into his
Temples, and our hearts into Altars; makes us a glorious Church, and
builds us Churches; inspires us with a new Spirit, and gives us a second
life, gives us a Kingdom, gives us Heaven and all? This is the new state
under Christ, since his coming ended and renewed our years unto us. And
therefore says our <hi>Apostle,</hi> just before the Text, <hi>If any man be in Christ, he
is a new creature;</hi> all this new work is done upon him: that's the second
way we are now to consider the words, That in the Christian, truly such,
all old things are past away, and all things become new.</p>
            <p>He <hi>is dead to sin,</hi> Rom. vi. 2. and he <hi>is dead to the Law,</hi> Rom. vii. 4. or
if you will, sin and the Law are both dead to him, they can hold him no
longer, he <hi>is alive unto God,</hi> Rom. vi. 11. new created in righteousness and
true holiness.</p>
            <p>Will you have it more particular? Why first then, the Heathen ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and error that is past with them, they are enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57113:89"/>
they know God, and are known of him; they are light in the Lord, the
very children of it. The Heathen sins they are past with them: in them
they walkt once, <hi>Ephes.</hi> ii. 2. such they were some of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 11.
but <hi>now</hi> they <hi>are washt,</hi> but <hi>now they are sanctified,</hi> but <hi>now</hi> they <hi>are justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are they now (2.) under so slender a providence as the poor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
were: God visits them often now, and not only now and then, and
suffers them not to go on, or fall back again into the old ways of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>But they are not only out of the <hi>Heathen</hi> condition, but out of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> too; no more in bondage to the Law. The sacrificing of Rams
and Goats, of all sensual affections, is done already; the unreasonable
part is mortified in them; they have been washt, and need be wash'd no
more; they are oblig'd to no <hi>differences of meats;</hi> no <hi>Iewish Sabbatizing,</hi> no
<hi>Circumcision,</hi> no one particular place of Worship, no <hi>legal</hi> Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
Christ having <hi>abolished in his flesh the Law of Commandments,</hi> says S.
<hi>Paul, contained in ordinances,</hi> Ephes. ii. 15. We are now at liberty, he has
made us free.</p>
            <p>And we are now (3.) under a new course of providence. God leads
us now by spiritual and eternal promises, he threatens spiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
punishments, guides us by a clearer light than Prophesie, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Word and Spirit, ties us not up to the Covenant of Works,
nor empty Ceremonies; these things are past: Makes us not rich that
he may accept us, but accepts us as we are: He reckons not of us by our
wealth, or honour, or learning, or our parts, we <hi>know no man</hi> so now, <hi>ver.</hi>
16. not Christ so now <hi>according to the flesh;</hi> we value not any man now for
any thing but holiness and righteousness, for so much as he is in Christ.
Nor does the Christian value himself now for any thing but for that of
Christ which is in him: riches he contemns, honour he despises, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he submits; all outward and externall priviledges and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he lays at the foot of Christ, devotes them to his commands; these
are all old, worn, tatter'd things, not worth the taking up; nothing now
worth any thing but Christ, nothing but Christ, and those new things
those graces are in him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>old things are past</hi> with the true Christian; but (2.) <hi>all things</hi> also
<hi>are become new in him.</hi> He has a new heart, and a new spirit; he has no
more a heart of stone, but a heart of flesh; a soft, tender, pliable heart,
a meek and well disposed spirit, a loving spirit; he is no more what he
was, the old <hi>ego,</hi> he has a new understanding; things look not to him
as they did of old, he vilifies the world and worldly things. His affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
new, he affects not what he did before; he contemns all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
He is a King, and rules over his passions; he is a Priest, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
them with his Prayers: he lives under a new Law, the Law of
the Spirit, and not the Flesh; he makes every day new Covenants with
God: A Member of the Church he is, and the Kingdom of God is now
within him. He is a great adorer of the Sacraments of the Church, and
daily offers up himself a Sacrifice to God, his Soul and Body, and all he
has, and pours out his praises. His Body is the Temple of the Holy
Ghost, and the Altar of his Heart burns with the continual fires of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Charity. He now lives no more, but Christ lives in him, that's
the new life he leads, and it leads him into glory. A new thing of
which he has a glimpse, and a kind of antipast here, that makes him
relish nothing else, but cast all behind his back as old rags and dirt, <hi>to
press forward to the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:57113:89"/>
Phil. iii. 14. This is the new Creature, the new man, in whom old things
are past away, and all things become new.</p>
            <p>And shall <hi>all things become new,</hi> and not we? shall all old things pass
away, and we remain in our old sins still? every thing be cloth'd with a
new lustre, we only appear in our old rags still? Certainly we cannot judge
it reasonable. Better use I hope we will make of this <hi>days Text,</hi> of this
<hi>New-years</hi> lesson. Put off, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> concerning the <hi>former conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in the spirit of our minds,</hi> and <hi>put on that new man which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness,</hi> Eph. iv. 22, 23, 24. 'Tis his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
must be our practise. <hi>The time past of our life may suffice us,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,
1 Pet.</hi> iv. 3. <hi>to have wrought the will of the Gentiles.</hi> It is sufficient, it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
'Tis time now we unlearn our old lesson, unravel our old work,
leave off our old course of life, and begin a new to live henceford to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and not to sin; to God, and not to men. The <hi>new</hi> entred <hi>year</hi>
calls for it, the <hi>Text</hi> calls for it, the Blood of Christ spent at his <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi>
lately past, which yet this day (and some days still to come) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate,
cries for it, that we would no longer <hi>count the blood of the new
Covenant an unholy thing,</hi> but betake us to it, and live by it after a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
in newness of life. I call you not to legal washings, but the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Baptism and Repentance; not to <hi>Iewish Feasts,</hi> but <hi>Christian Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals;</hi>
not to sacrifice Lambs and Sheep, but your Souls and Bodies;
not to old Ceremonies, but the new substance, the Righteousness of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Let him now begin his new reign in you, let his new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of Love be obeyed by you, his Church, purchased so dearly,
not be cowardly deserted by you; keep his Covenant, frequent his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
adorn his Altars, reverence his Priests, follow the guidance of his
Holy Spirit, when he inspires good motions into your hearts; amend your
lives, and become all new men in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And when all these old things shall pass away, and the new Heaven
and Earth appear, when he that sits upon the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 5. shall
make all things new, then shall we be all made new again, even these
old decayed ruines of our bodies too, and both souls and bodies clothed
with the new Robes of Glory, that shall never pass away, but be ever
new, ever glorious for evermore.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd to <hi>Day</hi> it was that He <hi>was called</hi> so, <hi>when eight days
were accomplished</hi> for his circumcising. And they did
well to call him so, for it was the <hi>Name</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi>
named him <hi>before he was conceived in the womb.</hi> And he
could be called by no better: For <hi>Nomen super omne
nomen,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul</hi> of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>A name it is above
every name, for above all principality, and power, and might,

which is to come, Eph.</hi> i. 21. A <hi>Name</hi> that has all things in it; that brings
all good things with it; that speaks more in five letters, than we can do
in five thousand words; speaks more in it than we can speak to <hi>day,</hi> and
yet we intend to <hi>day</hi> to speak of nothing else, nothing but <hi>Iesus,</hi> nothing

            </p>
            <p>The sooner then we begin the better. And to begin the sooner, we
shall set upon it without either the Circumstances before or after in
the <hi>verse,</hi> or the Ceremonies either of <hi>Preamble,</hi> or of <hi>Division</hi> of the
words.</p>
            <p>Only for <hi>Method</hi> sake, and memory, I shall shew you the fulness and
greatness of this <hi>Name</hi> in these seven Particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Truth and Fidelity.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Might and Power.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Majesty and Glory.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Grace and Mercy.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Sweetness and Comfort.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Wonder and Admiration.</item>
               <item>'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Blessing and Adoration.</item>
            </list>
            <p>A faithful, mighty, glorious, gracious, comfortable, admirable,
blessed <hi>Name</hi> it is, given Him to <hi>Day</hi> to be called by; but to be called by,
and to be called upon by us for ever, that we also may be filled with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57113:90"/>
the truth, and power, and glory, and grace, and sweetness, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and all the blessings of it. This is the sum of what we have
to say of this Great <hi>Name;</hi> and now we go on with the <hi>Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Name</hi> it is first of veracity and fidelity, of faithfulness and truth.
This <hi>Iesus</hi> is but the old <hi>Ieshua</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so much mentioned, so often fortold,
so long expected all the Scripture thorow. The <hi>Greek</hi> termination (of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>)
only added, that we might so understand that all those Types, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and Promises were now terminated, and at an end in this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in
this <hi>Iesus:</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> taken in too, to fulfill all that had been
before named or spoken any way concerning him. <hi>The testimony of Iesus
is the</hi> very <hi>spirit of Prophesie, Rev.</hi> xix. 11. Prophesie had neither life nor
spirit without it; and the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> is the very <hi>Amen</hi> to it, <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 14.
<hi>All the Promises of God,</hi> too, <hi>in him are yea, and in him Amen,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,
2 Cor.</hi> i. 20. His very name is the <hi>Amen, Rev.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>The faithful and true
witness</hi> in the same <hi>verse.</hi> Absolutely <hi>faithful and true, Rev.</hi> xix. 11. Nay,
This same Name <hi>Iesus,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to save, was rightly given him in this
sense, first, that it saved the honour of God, and the credit of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
that their words fell not to the ground, but were all accomplished
and made good in his blessed Name. A good <hi>Name</hi> the while, for us to
hold by, for our souls to rest on, for our hopes to anchor on, that is so
faithful and true to us, will not fail us in a word or tittle.</p>
            <p>II. And indeed it need not, for it is (2.) a <hi>Name</hi> of Power. A <hi>Name</hi> (1.) at
which the Devils roar and tremble, <hi>Iesu, thou Son of God, what have we to
do with thee?</hi> A <hi>Name</hi> (2.) that not only scares the Devils, but casts
them out, and unhouses them of their safer dwellings. A <hi>Name</hi> so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
(3.) that pronounced even by some that followed not Christ with
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 49. that were not of so confident a faith, or so
near a relation to him, it yet cast them out. So mighty (4.) that in it
many of those also cast out devils, did many wonderful works, St. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xvii. 22. to whom he will profess he never knew them, who must therefore
at last depart down to those Devils they cast out; A name, it seems, that
though in a wicked mouth, has oft done wonders. So powerful (5.) that
no disease or sickness, no ach or aile, no infirmity or malady could stand
against it. His <hi>Name,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter, hath made this man whole whom ye see
and know, Acts</hi> iii. 16. His name made that man, makes all men whole.
So powerful (6.) with God himself, that he cannot stand against it,
cannot deny us any thing that we ask in it. <hi>If ye shall ask any thing in my
name, I will do it,</hi> says Christ, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xiv. 14. whatsoever it be, <hi>verse</hi> 13. and
my Father will do it too, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xv. 16. In a word, <hi>Iesus</hi> signiffes a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and a Saviour is a <hi>name</hi> of power. He that saves either himself
or others must be no weakling; The stronger man in the Gospel at least,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 22. mighty to save, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> lxiii. 1. But
he that saves us from the powers of darkness must be the strong and
mighty God too; and so is his <hi>name, Isa.</hi> ix. 6. or the devil will be too
strong for him. O thou God, who art mighty to save, save thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
from him; save us from all the evils and mischiefs he plots against
us, that through thy Name we may tread them under that rise up against
us.</p>
            <p>III. So will this <hi>Name</hi> be glorious too: so it was, and so it is we are to
shew you next, a <hi>Name</hi> of Majesty and glory.</p>
            <p>Take it from the reason the <hi>Angel</hi> gives of the Imposition, St. <hi>Luke</hi> i. 31,
32, 33. <hi>Thou shalt call his Name Iesus.</hi> Why? Why, <hi>he shall be great, and shall
be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give him the Throne of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57113:91"/>
his Father David; and he shall reign over the house of Iudah for ever, and of
his Kingdom there shall be no end.</hi> The whole together nothing, but the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
comment upon the <hi>name Iesus,</hi> nothing but the interpretation of the
<hi>name:</hi> where we consider first, that 'tis a <hi>royal name,</hi> the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>King;</hi>
not of any King neither, but a <hi>King</hi> by succession; not any new upstart
King, but of a <hi>King</hi> from the lineage of ancient Kings: not of any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
or successive King neither, but of one from the <hi>Kings of Iudah,
Kings of Gods</hi> own making; none of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> lineage, or any others of
the peoples setting up: more glorious than so. And yet more of a <hi>King,
whose Kingdom shall have no end;</hi> that's a glorious King indeed. All other
Kings die and leave their Kingdoms and their names behind them half
wrapt up at least in dust and rubbish: this has an everlasting Kingdom,
and an everlasting <hi>Name;</hi> he lives ever, and that lives so too. But <hi>of his
Kingdom there shall be no end,</hi> hath another sense too. All the ends of the
earth shall come in unto him, there shall be no particular end or bound of
his Dominion. Upon his holy hill of Sion indeed it is God sets him, <hi>Psal.</hi>
ii. 6. But so there, that he gives him <hi>the Heathen for his inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession,</hi> ver. 8. that he may rule them
thence. He is both an everlasting and an universal King. Nay lastly, <hi>the
King of Kings,</hi> his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>written so upon his thigh,</hi> Rev. xix. 16. So glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a <hi>Name</hi> has he, such a <hi>superexaltavit</hi> there is upon it, so highly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
is this <hi>name Iesus,</hi> Phil. ii. 9. So highly, that some <hi>Commentators</hi> and
<hi>Grammarians</hi> would have it the same with the <hi>Name Iehovah;</hi> then surely
'tis full of Majesty and Glory: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> only, say they, is added either to make it
effable, which was before ineffable; to make it possible and lawful to be
uttered, which was before scarce either; so infinite was the Majesty of
that great <hi>Name:</hi> Or (2.) to intimate to us that God now is become man,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> taken out of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies a man, and put into his own <hi>Name</hi>
of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> so making it <hi>Iehosuah,</hi> or <hi>Iesuah,</hi> which is our <hi>Iesus,</hi> and the
<hi>Name</hi> now given us to be saved by. Whether this <hi>Criticism</hi> will hold or no,
the name <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> which, says S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> was fulfilled in this of <hi>Iesus,</hi> so
fulfilled that the <hi>Evangelist</hi> quotes the <hi>Prophets</hi> words of calling him <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi>
fulfilled in the calling of him <hi>Iesus,</hi> S. <hi>Matih.</hi> i. 21, 22, 23. as
if both were the same; that name (I say) has Gods Name in it to be sure;
<hi>El</hi> is one of his, so with us it is there joyn'd; enough to render it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
and the <hi>Angel</hi> telling us in his interpretation and reason of the
<hi>Name,</hi> that he was the <hi>Son of the Highest,</hi> intimates it was a <hi>Name</hi> of the
highest Majesty and Glory. And what can we say upon it less than burst
out with the <hi>Psalmist</hi> into a holy exclamation, <hi>O Lord our Governour, O</hi> Lord
our <hi>Iesus, how excellent is thy name in all the world!</hi> It is all cloth'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Honour, it is deckt with light, it spreads out it self in the
Heavens like a curtain, it lays the beams of its chamber in the waters,
it makes the cloud its Chariot, it comes riding to us upon the wings of
the wind, the Holy Spirit breaths it full upon us, it makes the <hi>Angels</hi> its
Spirit to convey it, it makes the Ministers of it a flaming fire, it laid the
foundation of the earth, it covers the deep with its wings, covers Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth with the Majesty of its glory.</p>
            <p>IV. Yet so it might, and we ne're the better, but that, fourthly, 'tis a
<hi>Name</hi> of Grace and Mercy, as well as Majesty and Glory. <hi>Iesus</hi> is a word of
which I may more justly say, as <hi>Tully</hi> says of the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that it contains
so much <hi>ut Latino uno verbo exprimi non possit, It cannot be exprest in any one
Latin</hi> or English <hi>word,</hi> or any one indeed besides it self. Mercy and Grace
dwell in it; it engrosses all, and without it there is none any where to be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57113:91"/>
found; no Mercy out of <hi>Iesus,</hi> no Grace but from <hi>Iesus, no Name under
heaven given by which we can be saved,</hi> but the Name of <hi>Iesus, Acts</hi> iv. We
are Baptized in the <hi>Name of Iesus, Acts</hi> xix. 5. We receive remission of
our sins in the <hi>Name of Iesus.</hi> Ye are justified in the <hi>Name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
1 Cor.</hi> vi. 11. Ye are sanctified in the <hi>Name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> in the
same <hi>verse.</hi> We are glorified by the <hi>Name of Iesus,</hi> in that <hi>Name we live,</hi>
in that <hi>name we die.</hi> To <hi>Iesus</hi> it is we run for grace and assistance whilst we
live. To <hi>Iesus</hi> we cry for Grace and Mercy when we die. To <hi>Iesus</hi> we
commit our spirits when we breath them out. We can neither live nor
die without our <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy name,</hi> says the Spouse, <hi>is oyntment poured forth,</hi> Cant. i. 3. Now Oyl
has three special uses, for light, for meat, for medicine. We have all
in <hi>Iesus,</hi> (1.) He is <hi>the light that lighteth every one that comes into the world,</hi>
St. John i. 9. (2.) He's <hi>the meat that never perishes,</hi> S. John vi. 27. and
feeds us up to everlasting life, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> vi. 54. (3.) He's the cure and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
of all our maladies. He wants nothing that has <hi>Iesus,</hi> and he has
nothing that wants him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Omnia Iesus nobis est si volumus,</hi> &amp;c. says St. <hi>Ambrose. Iesus is all things to
us if we will. Curari desideras medicus est, si febribus aestuas fons est, si gravaris
iniquitate justitia est, si auxilio indiges virtus est, si mortem times vita est, si ire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideras
via est, si tenebras fugis lux est, si cibum appetis alimentum est. Dost thou
want health? he is the great Physician. Art thou fried in the flames of a burning
Fever? he is the well-spring to cool thy heat. Art thou over-laden with thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?
he is thy righteousness to answer for thee. Dost thou want help? he is ever
ready at hand to succour thee. Art thou afraid of death? he is thy life. Wouldst
thou fain be going any whither? he is the way. Art thou in darkness and</hi> fearest
to stumble? <hi>he is a light to thy feet, and a lanthorn to thy paths. Art thou hungry,
or thirsty? he is nourishment,</hi> and food, and meat, and drink, the truest. What
is it that thou desirest, that he is not, that this name will not afford thee?
Why, it heals our sicknesses, it supports our infirmities, it supplies our
necessities, it instructs our ignorances, it defends us from dangers, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
temptations, it inflames our coldnesses, it lightens our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
it rectifies our wills, it subdues our passions, it raises our spirits, and
drives away all wicked spirits from us; it ratifies our petitions, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
our blessings, and crowns all our prayers. In this <hi>name</hi> they end all
that end well, <hi>through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> In thy <hi>name, O blessed Iesus,</hi> we
obtain all that we obtain, through it we receive all that we receive; so
that say we may well with that holy <hi>Father, Iesus meus &amp; omnia, Iesus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
&amp; omnia, Iesus is my all,</hi> Jesus he is and all. I have nothing else but him,
I will have nothing else but him, and I have all if I have him.</p>
            <p>V. And well may we now say fifthly, 'tis a name of sweetness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
too, a seet name indeed: oyntment we told you it was, and a sweet
oyntment it is, that fills all the house with its precious odour; insomuch
as it makes the Virgins therefore love thee, says the Spouse there, in the
fore-cited place of the <hi>Canticles, Mel in ore, in aure melos, in corde subilus,</hi>
says S. <hi>Bernard, 'Tis honey in the mouth, 'tis musick in the ear, 'tis melody in the
heart.</hi> The soul, and all its powers; the body, and all its members, may
draw sweetness thence. O how sweetly sounds the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> or a
Saviour to one in misery, to one in danger, to one in any calamity or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress!
how does it rejoyce the heart, and quicken the very bones! <hi>Gyra
&amp; regyra, versa &amp; reversa,</hi> says the devout S. <hi>Bernard, &amp; non invenies pacem
vel requiem nisi in solo Iesu. Quapropter si quiescere vis pone Iesus ut signaculum
super cor tuum, quia tranquillus ipse tranquillat omnia. Turn you, and turn you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57113:92"/>
again, which way you will, which way you can, you can never find such peace and
quiet as there is in Iesus, you will find none any where but in him. If you would
fain therefore lay you down to rest in peace and comfort, set the seal of Iesus upon your
heart, and all will be quiet:</hi> no dreadful visions of the night shall affright
you, no noon days trouble shall ever shake you. In the midst of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
storm of sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es about St. <hi>Stevens</hi> ears, he but looking up and seeing
<hi>Iesus,</hi> falls presently into a quiet slumber, and sweetly sleeps his last up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a hard heap of pebbles, more pleasantly than upon a Bed of Down or
Roses. For 'tis remarkable that the holy <hi>Martyr</hi> there calls out upon the
<hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> rather than that of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if that only were the name
to hold by in our last and greatest agonies. Nor is it to be forgotten that
this <hi>Name</hi> was set upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> over our Saviours head, to teach us that
'tis a <hi>Name</hi> which set upon the head of all our <hi>Crosses</hi> will make them easie;
the thought of <hi>Iesus,</hi> the reference to that holy <hi>Name,</hi> the suffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that, will give both a sweet odour, and a pleasant relish to whatever
it is we suffer. This looking unto <hi>Iesus,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> advises, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2, 3.
will keep us from being weary, or fainting under them, will make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,
<hi>more than conquerours,</hi> Rom. viii. 37. sure of our reward to sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
all: For <hi>neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature
shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> ver. 38, 39.
This same <hi>Iesus</hi> at the end fixes and fastens all: the love of God in <hi>Iesus</hi>
will never leave us, never forsake us: keep but that devoutly in our hearts,
and piously in our mouths, and we need fear nothing. Come what can, it
sweetens all. Methinks St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to find a kind of delight and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the very repeating it, he so often uses it, begins and ends his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
with it, garnishes them all through with it, scarce uses the very name
of <hi>Christ</hi> without it; as if it even sweetned that, at least made it sweeter,
and made the Oyl and Chrism with which Christ himself was anointed,
run more merrily and freely to the very skirts of his clothing. So that
now, is there any one sad? let him take <hi>Iesus</hi> into his heart, and he will
take heart presently, and his joy will return upon him. Is any one fallen
into a sin? let him call heartily upon this <hi>Name,</hi> and it will raise him up.
Is any one troubled with hardness of heart, or dulness of spirit, or deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of mind, or drowsiness in doing well? in the meditation of this
<hi>Name Iesus,</hi> a Saviour, all vanish and flie away. Who was ever in such
fear that it could not strengthen? who in any danger that it could not
deliver? who in so great anxiety that it did not quiet? who in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
that it could not comfort and revive? That we are not sensible of
it is our own dulness and experience. If we would but seriously meditate
upon it, we should quickly find it otherwise. Nothing would please us
where this <hi>Name</hi> were not; No discourse would please us where it was
not sometimes to be heard; No writings delight us if this <hi>Name</hi> were
left out. All the sweetest <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and neatest eloquence would be dull
without it; our very prayers would seem imperfect which ended not in
this very <hi>Name.</hi> Our days would look dark and heavy which were not
lightned with the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Son of Righteousness;</hi> Our nights but sad
and dolesom which we entred not with this sweet <hi>Name,</hi> when we lay
down without commending our selves to God in it. Our very years would
have been a thousand times more unhappy than even those which we
have seen of late, would be nothing but trouble, discontent, and misery,
did they not begin in this <hi>Name,</hi> were they not yearly usher'd in under
the protection of it. Were not this, <hi>His Name was called Iesus,</hi> proclaimed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57113:92"/>
to <hi>day,</hi> to begin it with, we might call the year what we would, but
good we could not call it. This setting forth <hi>Iesus</hi> a Saviour in the front,
is that which saves us all the year through, from all the unlucky and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
days that men call in it. All the ill Aspects of Heaven, of all
the Stars and Planets grow vain and idle upon it, and our days run sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and pleasantly under it. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> seems thus to prophesie and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
it, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxv. 12. <hi>Thou crownest the year with thy goodness, and thy clouds drop
fatness.</hi> This <hi>day</hi> crowns the year, this <hi>Name</hi> crowns the <hi>day,</hi> all our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
would be but a sad wilderness all the year without it; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and laugh, and sing, Hills and Vallies too, being thus blest in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the year with this happy <hi>Name.</hi> I end this point (though so
sweet that I part with it unwillingly) with a stave or two of devout <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi>
Jubile or Hymn upon it.</p>

<hi>Wonderful</hi> is one of the names the Prophet calls him by, <hi>Isa.</hi> ix. 6. And
<hi>Cabalistical</hi> wits have pickt wonders out of it from every letter in all three
languages.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> there are four letters <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and from the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these letters rise the mystery. <hi>Iod</hi> signifies a <hi>hand, Schin</hi> a <hi>tooth,
Vau</hi> a <hi>nail</hi> or hook, and <hi>Ain</hi> an <hi>eye:</hi> the hand is the instrument of power,
the teeth one of the instruments of voices and words, the nail an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his passion, and the eye an instrument or great discoverer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and pity. By all these he is our <hi>Iesus;</hi> by his power he overthrew our
enemies, which would have slain us; by his word he revives our souls
when they were slain and dead: by his Passion he redeemed us from our
sins, and for his own mercy sake he did all these.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Greek</hi> there are six letters <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which according to the old
device of vailing names in numbers, amount to the number of 888. the
first letter is 10. the second 8. the third 200. the fourth 70. the fifth
400. and the last 300. which put all together, make up that number: and
by reason that eight is the number they say of the Resurrection, that
falling out the eighth day, the day after the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57113:93"/>

to eternal quiet. The name of <hi>Antichrist</hi> is covered in the <hi>Revelation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the number of 666. Now the six days are days of labour, pain, and
trouble; the seventh is but a short day of rest whilst we are here, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the eighth day that follows after all, which must close up all in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

shall his name consist of, and the number of them be, eight unites, eight
tens, and eight hundred, that is, 888. So here's wonder upon wonder,
to make it wonderful.</p>
            <p>3. In the Latin we have five letters, <hi>IESVS,</hi> and by the old short
way of writing among the Romans, of the first letter for the whole
word, the subtle fanciers of the <hi>Cabala</hi> will tell us these five letters in the
<hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> intimate the fulness of its perfection, that it is <hi>jucundum,
efficax, sanctum, verum, salutiferum,</hi> that it is <hi>full of joy, efficacy, sanctity, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and <hi>salvation.</hi> Thus you see we have so rendred it as to find the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
in English name, that it is a sweet and joyful Name, an efficacious
and powerful Name, a sanctifying and justifying Name, a Name verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Types, and Prophesies, and Promises, and a salutiferous and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
name too. Five glories to himself, five benefits to us by it; or as
I may have otherwise as fully exprest them, Justification, Election, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
Victory, and Salvation.</p>
            <p>And now let the <hi>Iew</hi> come with his <hi>Rasche Theboth,</hi> with his first letter
for a word, and write <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

name will surely be blotted out of the Book of Life, who goes about
to abuse this, or who has not his portion in the Name of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should add one Mystery more, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is in the <hi>Hebrew Name</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
is, say they, a letter with three equal fangs joyn'd all together, and
may denote the <hi>Trinity,</hi> where the <hi>three Persons</hi> are equal and all united.
And then we have a mysterious <hi>Name</hi> indeed, the whole God-head, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Vnity</hi> in it; and yet a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> besides (as we told you before) for the
Humanity. So a perfect Saviour of both Natures, expressed perfectly in
his <hi>Name.</hi> God and Man, and all the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> employed in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our salvation. A wonderful Name indeed.</p>
            <p>But (2.) 'tis also wonderful without a <hi>Cabala,</hi> full of plain wonders, as
well as of mysterious.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis <hi>a new Name,</hi> and yet <hi>Ioshuah</hi> the Prince, and <hi>Iosuah</hi> the Priest,
and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> or <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> had the same name all; and is it

not then a wonder that it should yet be new? But theirs were given them

our salvation and deliverance.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A name that no man knew</hi> but himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 12. No man can
tell the wonders of it. No man can pronounce it right neither, without
an immediate assistance from above, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 3. <hi>No man can say, the Lord
Iesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The wonders that are wrought by it make it truly wonderful, that
in it, or by it, or through it, such mighty things both are and have been
done, even by men that only outwardly profest it, and only sounded the
letters of it, as you have heard already.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderful (lastly) sure, that it should force even the Devils to
bow down to it; not only depart their Lodgings to give it room, but
even be compelled themselves to worship it: yet so we find it, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 10.
Those things under the earth, that is, the Devils also, so doing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing.</p>
            <p>And shall we now think much to do as much, to do what all things in
Heaven, and Earth, and under it, even in Hell too, do to it? bow the
knee and worship it? It is a <hi>Name,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> given him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for us to pay our duty and homage to, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and adoration, says our last point, <hi>Venerandum nomen Iesu,</hi> a <hi>Name to
be blessed and adored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then, bless we God for his holy <hi>Name,</hi> for the benefits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we receive by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bless we</hi> (2.) the <hi>Name it self, praise, and magnifie, and glorifie, and give
thanks unto it.</hi> They are the expressions of the <hi>Holy Pen,</hi> Psal. cxlv. 2.
cxxxviii. 2. lxxxvi. 9. cxl. 13. they are not mine: so you have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enough to do it, if you think the Holy Ghost knows how to speak.</p>
            <p>Bless we (3.) our selves in this <hi>Name,</hi> when we lie down, and when
we rise up; when we go out, and when we come in: for in thy <hi>Name, O
blessed Iesu,</hi> shall we tread them under, that rise up against us: Nothing
shall be able to hurt or damage us, when we put our selves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of it. If afflictions and troubles press hard upon thee, and embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all thy days, this <hi>Name</hi> is the tree whose wood will sweeten the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
waters, cut down a branch of it and throw it in. Do thy sins and
conscience rent and tear thee? this <hi>Name</hi> is the Oyl to lenifie and cure
them, pour it out upon them. Art thou to encounter death it self? in
this <hi>Name</hi> thou shalt overcome it, deliver up thy soul but in it. 'Tis a
<hi>Name</hi> of truth and fidelity, thou canst not distrust it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of
might and power, thou mayest rest upon it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Majesty and
glory, thou must exalt it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of Grace and Mercy, thou must
praise him for it, and commit thy self unto it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of sweetness
and comfort, thou must rejoyce and be glad in it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of wonder
and admiration, thou must admire and declare it. 'Tis a <hi>Name</hi> of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thou must now adore it too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bow the knee,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> or bow down at it. <hi>Holy and reverend is his
Name,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> cxi. 9. And if reverend, it may be rever'd,
it may be worshipped. I speak not of the syllables and letters, but of the
sense. When we hear the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> I suppose there is none so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Christian but that he will confess, I may lift up my heart and praise
him for the mercy and benefits that I remember, and am put in mind of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57113:94"/>
by it; and where I bow my soul, may I not bow my body? The
<hi>Text</hi> is plain enough, <hi>That at the Name of Iesus every knee should bow,</hi> Phil.
ii. 10. Should, though they do not, or else shall when they will not; and
where they would not, when they come among those that are under the
earth: and was ever more need to do it than in an age where 'tis doubted
whether he be or God or Saviour? where it is question'd so often, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were ever such a <hi>Name</hi> to be sav'd by, and we not rather sav'd
every one in his own? Is it not high time to revive this honour to it, that
the world may know we acknowledge him to be God, to be the Lord,
and are not ashamed to confess it? But to sift the matter, and speak
home, Is this doing any other, than only one particular way of praising,
glorifying, and magnifying of the <hi>Name?</hi> and are not all the Scriptures
expressions so for doing that, and for declaring it? and is this any more?
How ordinary are the phrases of exalting, and blessing, and praising, and
sanctifying of his <hi>Name,</hi> and making of it to be glorious, of a <hi>glory due
to his Name,</hi> Psal. xxix. 2. of the honour of his <hi>Name</hi> to be sung forth,
<hi>Psal,</hi> lxvi. 2. And sure the Scripture knows how to speak. And though
the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> be not I confess directly and immediately meant in
those places, but the Name of God; yet thus much we have certain
thence, that (1.) the honour done to his <hi>Name,</hi> be it by words or any
expression else, (for all our outward expressions have the same ground
and reason) are duties of the <hi>Text:</hi> And that (2.) the <hi>Name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
being now the <hi>Name</hi> of God, it can be no superstition to do the same
to that. Now the Jews, I must tell you, never mentioned the Name of
God without an adoration, and a <hi>Benedictus;</hi> when ever they mentioned
it, they bowed themselves, and added always, <hi>Blessed for ever,</hi> or <hi>blessed for
evermore,</hi> as you have St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. i. 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> i. 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
i. 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 15. nay, doing no less to the Name of Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 5. mentioning him there with the same words after it. So that
it is but reasonable to suppose the Christians should do as much to the
<hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> thereby to possess themselves that he was God, and to
possess others against those rising Heresies that were then starting up to
rob him of the honour of his God-head. And I cannot but fear that such
as obstinately deny this worship to it, do as inwardly grudge at that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith that believes him to be God; and are little better in their
hearts than old <hi>Arians,</hi> or new <hi>Socinians,</hi> or well looking towards them.
But I add no more, only remember you, that we daily cry out in the <hi>Te
Deum, We worship thy Name ever, world without end:</hi> and if we do not, why
do we say so?</p>
            <p>But say that or not, say good of it however I hope we will; and as
<hi>David</hi>'s phrase is, <hi>speak good of his Name: omnia bona dicere, say all the good,</hi>
speak of all the good we receive by it.</p>
            <p>Say good of it, and make others (3.) say good of it; not give others
occasion to speak ill of it, to blaspheme that holy <hi>Name by which we are
called;</hi> not blaspheme it our selves, neither by our words nor by our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
not blaspheme it by Oaths and Curses, not blaspheme it by our
evil lives, not use it irreverently, not speak of it slightly, not cause
others to say, Lo, these are your <hi>Christians,</hi> these your professors to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>Iesus,</hi> men that cannot so much as speak well of his <hi>Name,</hi> which
they pretend to be saved by! Carry our selves we will I hope as men that
have a portion in Jesus, a share in salvation.</p>
            <p>Praise his <hi>Name</hi> (4.) and give thanks to it; that sure no body will
deny him, praise and thanks for what he has done by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:57113:94"/>
And (5.) love his <hi>Name</hi> we must too, love to think of it, love to be
speaking of it. 'Tis reported of the holy <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that the <hi>Name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was so frequently in his mouth, that it was even found written in his
heart when he was dead, found written there in golden Characters:
And 'tis affirmed by good Authors. Oh that this sweet <hi>Name</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our hearts too while we are living; that it were daily meditated
upon, and heartily lov'd by us as it should.</p>
            <p>We would then (6.) call upon it oftner than we do, be ever calling on
it. We have a promise to be heard for whatever we ask in it, St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
xiv. 13, 14. And we have an authentick example, Christs first Martyr,
so to do, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 59. Be we not afraid then of the tongues of foolish
men, but open we the morning, and shut in the evening with it, begin
and end our days with it in our months.</p>
            <p>Nay lastly, begin and end all our works and actions with it, <hi>do all in the
name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> Col. iii. 17. <hi>whatsoever</hi> we <hi>do in word or deed,</hi> says
the <hi>Apostle</hi> there: we can neither begin nor end better. How sweet is the
<hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> or a Saviour, at the on-set of our work, to save and keep
us from all miscarriage in it! How sweet is it again when we have done,
if we can say <hi>Iesus</hi> again, that we have sav'd by it, been saved in it, and
shall one day be saved through it; that <hi>Iesus</hi> runs through all with us!
So then remember we to begin and end all in <hi>Iesus;</hi> the New Testament,
the Covenant of our Salvation begins and ends so. <hi>The generation of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
so it begins; <hi>and come Lord Iesus,</hi> so it ends. May we all end so too,
and when we are going hence, commend our spirits, with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> into
his hands; and when he comes, may he receive them, to sing Praises and
<hi>Allelujahs</hi> to his blessed <hi>Name,</hi> amidst the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Kingdom for ever.</p>

               <q>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young Child with

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> 
               <hi>Day,</hi> this, of the luckiest Aspect; a <hi>Text,</hi> this, of the
happiest success that ever Travellers met with: Never
had Journey better success, never pains more happily
bestowed, than in the <hi>Text,</hi> and on the <hi>Day. Christ,</hi> the
end of all our travel, the full reward of all our pains,
was here this <hi>Day</hi> found by the <hi>Wise men</hi> after a twelve
days Journey. And what wise man would not think
himself well paid for all his labour, were it not so many days, but years;
not so many years, but ages; so that after all he might bless his eyes with
this happy sight?</p>
            <p>Well may these fortunate Travellers in thankfulness <hi>fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and offer presents.</hi> Wise men could do no other: and we, if we be wise,
will do no less. For ordinary and common blessings we bend our knees,
and present our offerings to the <hi>Father of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> but for
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ himself,</hi> 'tis not bending, but <hi>falling down;</hi> not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all praises only, but praises and offerings of all, our selves, and
all we have, which can any way look like a thankfulness correspondent
to so great a benefit.</p>
            <p>This is a mercy not to be forgotten, this <hi>Day,</hi> especially so falling out,
affordeth us by its double holiness, as our <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and our <hi>Lord Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi>
an invincible occasion to remember and praise him in it.</p>
            <p>Double holiness said I? trebble I may say, and more. Three <hi>Epiphanies</hi>
the Church reckons upon this <hi>Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ,</hi> three sundry and divers ways
<hi>manifested to the world.</hi> (1.) The first to the <hi>Wise men,</hi> Strangers, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57113:95"/>
by a <hi>Star.</hi> (2.) The second to the <hi>Iews</hi> by a <hi>voice from Heaven;</hi> and
<hi>the Holy Ghost descending thence in form of a Dove upon him</hi> at his Baptism.
(3.) The third to his own Country-men of <hi>Galilee,</hi> at the Marriage at
<hi>Cana,</hi> by his <hi>first Miracle.</hi> All three commemorated upon this <hi>Day;</hi> the
first in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the other two in the two second <hi>Lessons for the Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these we have pitched upon the first, as most <hi>concerning</hi> us,
who once were <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as they, who this <hi>Day,</hi> by the conduct of a
<hi>Star,</hi> were brought into the <hi>house,</hi> and into the presence of their <hi>new-born
King and Saviour.</hi> We then, as men concerned in these first fore-runners of
our Faith, the first fruits of us <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> are to take notice of
their good behaviour, as well as their good fortune; as well how they
carried themselves to <hi>Christ</hi> when they had found him, as how they found
him; as well how they carried themselves towards <hi>Christ,</hi> as how they
were brought to him.</p>
            <p>Four points we have of it: <hi>They came, They saw, They worshipped, They
offered.</hi> This is the sum of this <hi>Days</hi> solemnity, of the <hi>Wise mens</hi> Religion,
and should be of ours. Such service was done then, such service is due
still to <hi>Christ the Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So four parts we have of the Text.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The</hi> Wise mens <hi>coming,</hi> And when they were come into the house.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Their seeing,</hi> They saw the Child with Mary his Mother.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Their worship,</hi> They fell down and worshipped.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Their offering,</hi> When they had opened their treasures, they presented to
him gifts, Gold, and Frankincense, and Myrrhe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Their <hi>coming,</hi> their <hi>seeing,</hi> their <hi>worshiping,</hi> their <hi>offering,</hi> are the parts
of the <hi>Text,</hi> and shall be of my comment and discourse. I enter first up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>Intrantes,</hi> and <hi>When they were come into the house.</hi> Their <hi>coming,</hi>
that first; where we are to consider: (1.) The parties, <hi>who.</hi> (2.) Their
coming, <hi>what.</hi> (3.) Their place, <hi>whither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who they were, the <hi>first verse</hi> expresses, <hi>Wise men from the East.</hi> Wise
men, and come so far to see a Child in his Mothers arms! certainly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Child is some extraordinary great personage, whose birth also
much concerns them, or they have lost their wits, to take so long and
troublesom a Journey to so little purpose. A great personage indeed, and
this the wisest act that ever yet they did in all their lives. The <hi>King of
the Iews</hi> they stile him, the <hi>Messiah</hi> they meant; one indeed that should
be <hi>born King of the Iews,</hi> but should be made <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too. <hi>In
him shall the Gentiles trust, saith the Prophet;</hi> rule over them as well as those
he should, protect and <hi>save them too from their enemies, out of the hands of all
that hate them.</hi> And to get interest in him betimes, to get to be among the
first of those that submit to him, and bring him presents, was the wisest
piece of all the wisdom of either <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wise men</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls them, <hi>Wise men</hi> this act proves them, had
they never done any thing wise before; and Wise men they shall ever be
in holy Language (whatsoever the world esteem or style them) who at any
time think no pains or cost too much to come to <hi>Christ,</hi> to come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Greek</hi> names them. A word which latter ages have always,
or most commonly taken in the worser sense, for men addicted to unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arts, as we sometimes in our own tongue also call such Wise men,
whom we deem little better than <hi>Wizards.</hi> The word had not that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
from the first, 'twas time, and some mens ill practices that
corrupted it; but be it what it will, this we may learn by it, that (1.)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57113:96"/>
God, <hi>qui suaviter disponit omnia, the sweet disposer of all things,</hi> does often
draw a testimony to his truth, even from the mouth of falshood, makes
even the Devils to confess it. That (2.) he sometimes calls men to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the violence of their own principles, be they true or false; makes
some Star or other sometimes guide those great doaters on <hi>Astrology</hi>
beyond what is right; as here, to <hi>Christs Cradle;</hi> so at other times to his
<hi>Chair,</hi> to learn of him, and become Disciples: makes them sometimes
<hi>burn their Books</hi> to study his: Makes the Heretick sometimes to confute
himself by his own wandring principles into the truth again; makes the
perverse and obstinate man weary himself at last into. Christian meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and moderation, by the wearisomness of his own perverseness. Thus
the wisest may be caught in his own net e're he is aware (if God please
to do him so much good) and wound into a truth or a piece of piety,
which he so much struggled to avoid. Nay (3.) by these <hi>Wise mens</hi> coming,
such kind of wise-men from the <hi>East,</hi> you may see there is no sin so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
of so orient a dye; no practice or trade of it so strong, though taken
up at the <hi>East,</hi> or Sun-rise of our days, which Grace cannot overcome;
no sinner so great from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> but the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
draw, or win, or catch, or force to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antiquity</hi> delivers these <hi>Wise men</hi> for Kings, or some great personages to
us. <hi>Magi</hi> both in <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> was a name of honour, and the men
<hi>Princes</hi> at the least. So that, as before we told you, sinners, great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
might by their example come to <hi>Christ;</hi> God often brought them:
So we now must tell you, that persons of honour, the greatest persons
must not think much of a little pains, or a few days Journey upon <hi>Christs</hi>
errand, or to do him service, nay, but to pay their worship to him. He
that shall consider our days, and our addresses now to God and his Son
Christ, and compare them with what these <hi>Wise men</hi> did here, will say, we
are the Heathen, these the Christians; we, meer <hi>Arabians, strangers from
the Covenant of Grace,</hi> men born and bred in the Wilderness of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
where there is nothing but perpetual drought, no heavenly shower of
grace ever comes: these only Believers. We the great persons that <hi>Christ</hi>
himself must wait upon, if he will be seen; these the humble servants
that will undertake any thing to see him.</p>
            <p>And here it seems (if we now secondly examine their coming) they
thought much of no pains or care to find him out. They came into the
house.</p>
            <p>Many a weary step had they trod, many a fruitless question had they
askt, many an unprofitable search had they made to find him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
yet they will not give over. Twelve days it had cost them to come
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> through the <hi>Arabian Desarts,</hi> over the <hi>Arabian Mountains,</hi>
both <hi>Arabia Deserta &amp; Petraea;</hi> the difficulty of the way, through Sands,
and Rocks; the danger of the passages, being infamous for Robbers,
the cold and hardness of a deep Winter season, the hazzard and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of so long, so hard, so unseasonable, so dangerous, and I may
say so uncertain a Journey, could no whit deter them from their purpose:
to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they will through all these difficulties. But after all this pains,
to lose the Star that guided them, to hear nothing at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of him
they sought, to be left after all this at a loss in that very place they only
could expect to find him, and hear nothing there but a piece of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Prophesie without date or time, to be left now to a meer wild-goose
search, or a new Knight-errantry, and yet still to continue in their
search, is an extream high piece both of Faith and Love, that considers
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57113:96"/>
no difficulties, that thinks much of no pains, that, maugre all, will set
afresh upon the pursuit, that will be overcome with nothing, is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
come what will, to find what they believe and desire; such a piece
of faith and love that we later <hi>Christians</hi> cannot <hi>Parallel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How would a Winter journey scare us from our faith? A cold or rainy
morning will do it; a little snow, or wind, or rain, or cold will easily keep
us from coming to the <hi>house</hi> where <hi>Iesus</hi> is, from coming out to <hi>worship him.</hi>
How would so long a voyage make us faint to hear of it? How would
the least danger turn us back from the <hi>House of God?</hi> Alas! should it have
been our cases, which was theirs here, if we could not presently have
found him at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Royal City,</hi> or had we lost the <hi>Star</hi> that led us,
how had we sate down in sorrow, or returned in despair? We would
have thus reasoned with our selves. Alas! we are come hither, and
have lost our labour: Certainly, had this <hi>King</hi> been born, it would have
been in the <hi>Royal City,</hi> or there certainly the news had been; but there
we hear of no such matter, there neither any believes, or regards, or
thinks of such a birth: What then do we do here enquiring, seeing his
own people so much neglect it? Surely the <hi>Star</hi> that led us hither was
but a false fire of fancy, and we are quite misled: Nay, and it appears
no more, so that if we would still go on our wandrings, we know not
whither, we had best return. Thus should we have reasoned our selves
from <hi>Christ,</hi> fainted, and given over quite. 'Tis the fashion with us
thus to reason our selves out of our Devotion and Religion. 'Tis the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
too, to object any thing to save our pains in <hi>Christs</hi> business. Others
Customs, or others Negligences, or others Ignorance, are sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
to authorize ours: and if perchance we want a guide (though
every man now thinks himself sufficient to guide and direct himself in all
Points of his Religion, yet even this he cares not for, this he refuses
and rejects) shall yet serve him for an excuse for his negligence and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
nay, God himself shall sometimes bear the blame, his taking
away, or else not giving us a <hi>Star</hi> and light to guide and lead us; his not
giving us sufficient grace, shall be pretended the cause why we come not
to him. When, did not our own coldness more chill our joynts than the
cold of Winter; were we not afraid of every puff of wind when we
are called to do any good; did not the fear of I know not what, only
fancied and imagined dangers, make us cowards in our Religion; did
we not fondly reason our selves out of our patient expectance of <hi>Christ;</hi>
did we not guide our selves more by the Fashions, Customs, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of others, than by the constancy of that which is only just and
good; did we not forsake our guides, while we prefer our own carnal
reasons, interests, and respects, and lose the <hi>Star,</hi> the Guide that heaven
had sent us to conduct us, by going to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> by addicting our selves
to the vanity and fashion of Court and City, by asking counsel of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> meer Politicians and Pretenders of Piety

these our doings and compliances with flesh and bloud, the <hi>Star</hi> would
not fail to guide us, Gods grace would shine unto us, <hi>the day star would
arise in</hi> all <hi>our hearts,</hi> and conduct us happily and safely too into the <hi>house</hi>
where we should truly find <hi>Christ.</hi> The truth is, if our coming to <hi>Christ,</hi>
if our Religion may <hi>cost</hi> us <hi>nothing,</hi> nor pains, nor cost, nor cold, nor
heat, nor labour, nor time, nor hurt, nor hazard, nor enquiry, nor
search, then it may be we will be content to give <hi>Christ</hi> a visit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57113:97"/>
his <hi>Faith and Worship,</hi> but not else; if it may not be had, nor <hi>Christ</hi>
come to without so much ado, let him go, let all go; so we may sit at ease
and quiet in our warm nests, come of <hi>Christs Worship,</hi> and of his <hi>house</hi> what
will.</p>
            <p>Yet thither it is (3.) to his <hi>house</hi> that these <hi>Wisemen</hi> make with all
their eagerness. Many stately Buildings, and Royal Palaces, no doubt,
they had seen by the way, fitter far for a <hi>King</hi> to be born in than the <hi>Inn</hi>
they <hi>found</hi> him in; but at these they stay not; <hi>they</hi> and <hi>their Star</hi> rest not
any where but at this <hi>house;</hi> here indeed they may, both heaven and
earth, set up their rest; this <hi>house</hi> truly the <hi>house of God,</hi> which now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<hi>the God of heaven and earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To teach us that we are not to <hi>look to outward appearances,</hi> nor judge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
according to sight. <hi>Christ</hi> may lie in the poorest <hi>Cottage,</hi> in the
meanest <hi>Inn,</hi> as soon as in the highest Palace: Nay, in the low <hi>humble
soul,</hi> in the Beggars soul as well as in the Kings, whose bodily presence,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, is weak, and whose speech contemptible, you shall
sooner find him, than under the gilded roofs of a vain-glorious vertue, on
a self-conceited and boasted Religion and Piety.</p>
            <p>Indeed where ever the <hi>Star</hi> stands, whatever house the heavenly light
encompasses, there must we alight and enter; we must not think much
of the meanest dwelling that heaven points out, of the poorest condition
that God designs us to. That house is glorious enough that <hi>Christ</hi> is in;
that habitation and condition happiest, how poorly soever it appear,
which the <hi>finger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> directs us to, and <hi>the light of his countenance shines on</hi>
and encompasses. <hi>O my soul! enter</hi> there always, O my soul, where God
points out unto thee, where the heavenly light shines over thee, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
earth look on thee: Thou shalt find more contentment in a <hi>Stable,</hi>
amongst beasts, in the meanest imployment, than in the highest Offices of
state and honour; in an <hi>Inn</hi> amongst strangers, than with thy brethren and
kinsfolk at home; in a thatcht Hovel, in the poorest, hardest lodging,
meanest dwelling, and lowest condition, than in the fairest house, the
sweetest seats, the softest bed, the most plentiful estate, if God by his
special finger, or <hi>Star</hi> of providence guides thee to it out of his secret
wisdom, and <hi>Christ</hi> be with thee in it.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder <hi>Interpreters</hi> make this <hi>house</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> It is the
<hi>Gate</hi> and <hi>Court of Heaven</hi> now <hi>Christ</hi> is here; <hi>Angels</hi> sing round about it, all
Holiness is in it, now <hi>Christ</hi> is in it; Here all the Creatures, reasonable and
unreasonable, come to pay their homage to their <hi>Creator;</hi> hither they come,
even <hi>from the ends of the earth,</hi> to their devotions; a <hi>house of Prayer</hi> it is for
all people, <hi>Gentiles</hi> and all; hither they come to <hi>worship,</hi> hither they come
to pay their <hi>Offerings</hi> and their <hi>Vows;</hi> here's the Shrine and Altar, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Virgins Lap, where the <hi>Saviour of the World</hi> is laid to be <hi>adored</hi> and
<hi>worship'd;</hi> here <hi>stands the Star</hi> for tapers to give it light; and here the
<hi>Wisemen</hi> this <hi>Day</hi> become the Priests, <hi>worship and offer,</hi> present prayers and
praises for themselves, and the whole world besides, all people of the
world, high and low, learned and ignorant represented by them.</p>
            <p>This <hi>House</hi> then is a place well worth the coming to; here might the
<hi>Wisemen</hi> well end all their Journeys, sit down, and rest where the <hi>eternal
Wisdom</hi> keeps its residence; here may the greatest Potentates not disdain
to stoop and enter, where the <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords</hi> vouchsafes
to make his Lodging. Here only in this blessed <hi>Inn,</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> is
lodged, can the soul truly rest; no Wisdom but what is here, no Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
but what is his, no house but what is sanctified by his presence, no
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57113:97"/>
bed but where his <hi>right hand</hi> becomes our <hi>Pillow,</hi> and his <hi>left</hi> our <hi>covering,</hi>
can <hi>satisfie the wearied soul,</hi> or give so much as one wink of rest, or quiet,
or contentment to it. Well may the <hi>Wisemen</hi> pass by all other houses
tocome to <hi>this;</hi> slight all the magnificent Palaces in the earth, to
take up a lodging in this <hi>Inn;</hi> leave all other sights for this blessed
<hi>sight,</hi> and count nothing worth the seeing till they see <hi>him,</hi> nothing but
<hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wise men will do so still, esteem <hi>Gods House,</hi> how mean soever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
above all houses; his sight above all that can be seen, <hi>count all
things dross and dung so</hi> they <hi>may gain Christ,</hi> one glance of him, one beam
of his glorious brightness. Any place shall be worth being in where
he is; no journey tedious, that at last brings to him; no way trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
that leads to him; Rocks and Mountains easier than flowry plains
and Meadows; Sands and Desarts pleasanter than the <hi>Spicie Gardens of
the East,</hi> and the <hi>Hesperian Orchards;</hi> Ice, and Snows, and rain, and hail,
and stormy weather, the greatest hardships that all these lower Regions
can pour upon us, more delightful than continual Summers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Springs, than uninterrupted sun-shines and gawdy days, if by
those endurances we may at length arrive at the <hi>feet of Christ.</hi> All the
injuries and inconveniences that can befall us here, are not worth the
naming so they bring us to our <hi>Saviour. O my God,</hi> let me loose all so I
may find him, let me want any thing so I want not him, let me have
nothing so I may have him. He is the only thing the <hi>Wise men</hi> sought,
and he it is that thus seeking they found, and saw at last, <hi>And when
they were come into the house, they found the young Child with Mary his
Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he was a thing worth finding. And found he would be, because
they sought him; will be so of us, if we seek him diligently, carefully,
and constantly as they did here: For the vvords here may as vvell carry
the title of a revvard for their pains, as of a posture of their faith.

               </gap> 
               <hi>invenerunt, they

of their labour in the search. <hi>Others,</hi> they say, as <hi>ancient</hi> read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>viderunt, they saw the Child,</hi> which our <hi>English</hi> follows; and though there
be no great difference, or matter of distinction, yet being authorized by
our <hi>Church,</hi> we are willing to make use of, as being of a larger capacity,
as well somewhat expressing the <hi>Wise mens carriage</hi> as their <hi>success.</hi> For we
intend to handle both.</p>
            <p>1. As it presents to us their <hi>success.</hi> A success sufficient to encourage
us all to turn perpetual travellers to <hi>find Christ in the flesh. Christ a Child,</hi>
to find him as soon almost as he can be found, a <hi>young Child,</hi> not yet full
a fortnight old; to find him <hi>with his Mother</hi> too, <hi>Christ</hi> and the devout
soul together, <hi>Christ</hi> and the soul united; to find him and <hi>Mary</hi> together,
<hi>Christ</hi> exalted in our hearts, (for so <hi>Mary</hi> signifies exalted) his Kingdom
and Power set up and exalted in our hearts; to find all this, all this for
one poor journey, for the pains and labour of so small a number of days
and hours, is a success than which no journey, no undertaking can have
better: yet all these are here.</p>
            <p>1. They <hi>found,</hi> first, an <hi>incarnate God,</hi> their <hi>Saviour in the flesh,</hi> a sight
that the very <hi>Angels desire to look into, Bow down to look into,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter,
1 Pet.</hi> i. 12. A sight which all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> still <hi>desired to see,</hi>
but could not: A sight which made the very Angels leave their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57113:98"/>
to come down and see, and seeing, sing for joy; A sight which made
the Stars rejoyce in their courses, and wait upon poor mortals steps that
they might be admitted to behold it. For indeed, what wonder ever saw
they like it? He that <hi>spans the Heavens</hi> become a span breadth himself.
The <hi>eternal word</hi> without a word to say, the <hi>infinite wisdom</hi> become childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the <hi>incomprehensible greatness wrapt up in swadling-bands.</hi> He that <hi>fills
heaven and earth,</hi> not big enough to fill a Virgins arms. He that <hi>opens his
hand</hi> and <hi>fills all things living with</hi> his <hi>plenteousness,</hi> sucking himself a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
milk out of his <hi>Mothers</hi> Breasts to live by; He poor himself who
makes all rich: God a man! Eternity a child! who would not travel
the world over to see this miracle, and think his time and pains never
spent so well as then?</p>
            <p>2. But secondly, to have the first sight almost as it were of so happy a
wonder, adds something to the glory of the <hi>success,</hi> to be admitted among
the first into <hi>Christs</hi> presence, to be so honour'd as to be of the number of
his first attendants, to be with him whilst he is yet a <hi>child,</hi> to wait upon
this new-born <hi>King,</hi> and have relation to him from his <hi>Cradle,</hi> to meet
with him so <hi>young,</hi> so tender, so pliable, so easie to be approach'd and
dealt with, is a <hi>success</hi> of so much honour and obligement, that we may
expect any thing from his hands, being of his first followers and servants
in so tender a condition towards us.</p>
            <p>3. Thus far the Journey seems sufficiently successful; yet not only to
find a <hi>Saviour in the flesh,</hi> so near allied unto us, and so soon almost as he
is so made to us, but also thirdly to find him in his Mothers arms, fast
claspt within our souls (for every faithful soul is <hi>Christs</hi> Mother, as well
as blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> conceives, and brings him forth, and nourishes him, as
well as she, the soul spiritually, as she naturally) to find, I say, <hi>Christ</hi>
thus conceived and brought forth in our own souls, this Child in our
own arms too, <hi>Christ with us,</hi> is that indeed which makes this finding
worth the finding, this sight worth seeing. Should we only know <hi>Christ
after the flesh,</hi> though amongst the first that knew him; had we no more
than an outward sight, did we not see him with his Mother in a mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sense, in the soul and spirit, born in our souls, they also made his
Mothers (as all that believe and do Gods will, he himself calls so, St.
<hi>Mark</hi> iii. 34, 35.) unless we thus see him, our <hi>success</hi> will be but lame and
poor, no better than those <hi>Iews</hi> that saw and perished.</p>
            <p>4. Yet the <hi>success</hi> here is one degree beyond it, <hi>They saw the young Child
and Mary his Mother. Mary</hi> signifies exalted, to see him with his <hi>Mother
Mary,</hi> as to see his exalted Mother, the soul exalted by his presence, his
Power and Kingdom exalted in it, to see this <hi>King</hi> in his Kingdom, to
see <hi>Christ</hi> reigning and ruling in us, this new-born <hi>King</hi> triumphing in
our souls, our understandings, wills, affections, and all our faculties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to him: and this is a good sight where e're we see it. This is then
the sum of the success we shall find of our travel after him. (1.) The
perfect sight: And (2.) the easie knowledge of him: (3.) Our union
with him: (4.) Our exaltation by him. He will reveal himself to them
that seek him, discover himself betimes to them that carefully search for
him, unite himself and be with them that follow after him, and set up
his throne and excellency in them that find him.</p>
            <p>2. Indeed this, now secondly, is worth the seeing, worthy the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
They <hi>saw</hi> it (1.) they <hi>saw</hi> it and <hi>admired</hi> it: their seeing him, it was
<hi>the Lords doing,</hi> and could not but be <hi>admirable in their eyes.</hi> They could
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57113:98"/>
not certainly but admire and wonder to see the <hi>Star</hi> had pointed out the
<hi>Child,</hi> so poor a <hi>Child;</hi> a King in rags: so glorious a <hi>Child,</hi> so blessed a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in so poor a plight. <hi>Saw</hi> it and <hi>fell down</hi> (say the next words) <hi>fell down</hi>
in amazement and astonishment it may be, as well as any way else, to see
so great a mercy, so strange a sight.</p>
            <p>2. Yet <hi>saw</hi> it, secondly, and <hi>believed:</hi> saw by the eye of faith, as much
as by the eye of sense; believed presently it was the Child they sought,
and therefore <hi>fell down and worshipped;</hi> which certainly they would not
have done, had they not believed. Indeed the strange guide that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them, the resolution for the place at least (<hi>Bethlehem</hi> by name) which
they met with at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the new return of their lost <hi>starry Leader</hi> as
soon as they were got out of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the very standing and fixing of it
self (which all the while before was in perpetual motion) over this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place where they found this <hi>Child,</hi> might sufficiently assure them that
it was his <hi>Star,</hi> that he was the <hi>Lord</hi> whom this <hi>Star</hi> attended: so that
they might not only believe out of credulity, or an impatient desire to be
at their journeys end, or at home again; but out of prudence, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
wise men, who lay all together e're they fix their Faith. <hi>Saw and
believed,</hi> that's the second.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Saw it and were glad</hi> too; that's a third adjunct of seeing such a sight.
If the seeing of the <hi>Star</hi> again, in the <hi>former verse,</hi> made them to <hi>rejoyce
with exceeding great joy,</hi> which could only confirm their hope to find him,
how <hi>exceedingly exceeding great joy, gaudio valde, valde magno,</hi> must it needs
be they rejoyced with when they found him?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Saw and worshipped,</hi> that should be a fourth; but it is the third and
next part of the Text, which the time and season now forbids me to look
into. Only this to recapitulate the rest and apply it home.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Behold we,</hi> first, <hi>and admire this sight,</hi> the mercy and goodness of our
<hi>Saviour,</hi> thus for us to become a <hi>Child,</hi> to take upon him the infirmities and
inconveniences of our nature, even from its first weaknesses; to make
himself so accessible to us, so easie to be approacht, to vouchsafe to be
daily conceived again, and born in our souls and spirits; to take upon
him besides the rule and guidance over us; to set up his throne in so poor
a place as our unworthy souls, amidst so much frailness and unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
souls more filthy and stinking when he first comes to them, than the
very Stable he was born in, amidst the dung and ordure of the Beasts.
Behold, and see if there were ever goodness like this goodness, <hi>see and
admire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>See,</hi> secondly, <hi>and believe it</hi> too. The most incredulous among the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he once saw, he soon believed. See but how
the <hi>Star</hi> moves and fixes, and even points us to him; how readily the
<hi>Wise men</hi> entertain the sight, and <hi>fall down and worship:</hi> see how all the
<hi>Prophesies</hi> concur and meet in this <hi>young Child,</hi> see how the world is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
with this Faith, and has so many hundred years continued it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
so many persecutions, and I shall not need to perswade you
to play the Wise men too, and upon so many testimonies and evidences
believe the same.</p>
            <p>3. Yet I exhort you (3.) <hi>to see it and be glad. Heaven</hi> rejoyced at it,
and the <hi>Earth</hi> was glad. <hi>Angels</hi> sung proper <hi>Anthems</hi> for it. The <hi>Shepherds</hi>
joyfully tell it out, The <hi>Wise men</hi> here scarce know how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for joy, open all their <hi>treasures,</hi> and fling about their <hi>gifts</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their gladness; only <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Iews, Herodian Iews, Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57113:99"/>
Iews,</hi> men addicted wholly to the pomps, and pride, and vanity of
the City, are troubled at the birth of so humble <hi>a Saviour.</hi> It is a <hi>Day</hi> of
rejoycing, this. 'Tis the <hi>Lords Day, the day which the Lord hath made, let us
rejoyce</hi> (says the Psalmist) <hi>and be glad in it.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Day</hi> of shewing himself
to us <hi>Gentiles who sate in darkness, and the shadow of death.</hi> 'Tis fit therefore we
should be glad for so great a blessing. 'Tis the <hi>Day</hi> he was Baptized in,
and that ever useth to be among us a joyful day; great joy and feasting at
it. It is a Marriage <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> he wrought his first <hi>Miracle</hi> upon, when he
<hi>turned Water into Wine,</hi> on purpose to make us merry; the water of tears,
into the wine of joy. So many blessings together, so many <hi>good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
in one day, so many glorious things, so bright a <hi>Star,</hi> so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a <hi>Child,</hi> so blessed a <hi>Mother,</hi> so miraculous a <hi>Baptism,</hi> so chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a <hi>Miracle,</hi> so triumphant a <hi>Resurrection;</hi> all together on one day,
must not, cannot be found out, cannot be seen of Christians so much
concerned in them all, without perpetual Songs of gladness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
            <p>I should leave you here, but that we must needs yet see a little, one
step farther. <hi>See and learn:</hi> Is <hi>Christ our Saviour</hi> here <hi>a Child?</hi> see then that
we <hi>become like little children,</hi> in humility, and innocence; we shall not see
Heaven, nor him in it else (he tells us) S. <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 3. Is he so <hi>little?</hi>
let not us then think much to be accounted so, to be made so. Is he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to lie in his <hi>Mothers</hi> lap? let not us grudge then if we have no where
else to lie than upon our Mother earth. Is he content to partake our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses?
let not us then be impatient when we fall into sicknesses and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
Is he <hi>a Child to be adored and worshipped?</hi> let us then be careful in
all places, and at all times to <hi>adore and worship him.</hi> Will he accept our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents?</hi>
let us <hi>present</hi> our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies,</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> and all to his service;
lay all our <hi>treasures</hi> at his feet, <hi>worship</hi> him with all that is precious to
us, think nothing too precious or good for him. In a word, is he
to be <hi>found,</hi> is he so easie to have access to? Call we then upon him
whilst he is near, and seek we him while he may be found, seek we him
how he will be found, for always he will not, nor every way he will not.</p>
            <p>Follow therefore the <hi>Wise mens</hi> steps, so soon as ever <hi>the Day-star arises
in our hearts,</hi> so soon as ever any heavenly light of holy inspiration shines
into us; begin we to set forward, get we out of our own Countries, from
our sins, arm our selves against all temptations, against the pleasures, the
perfumes and spices of <hi>Arabia Faelix,</hi> of prosperity and honour; against
the sandy Desarts of <hi>Arabia Deserta,</hi> against driness, and dulness, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the first temptations that we meet with in our way to Christ,
that make us to have little or no relish of it; against the rocky and
thievish passages of <hi>Arabia Petraea;</hi> against the rocks of temptations,
and afflictions; against the subtleties, and treacheries, and violences
of the suggestion of ill companions, wherewith the Devil doth way-lay
us. Get we up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the <hi>Holy City,</hi> enquire we there of the word
of God, and <hi>at the mouth of the Priest</hi> (which God hath said <hi>shall preserve
knowledge</hi> for others good, what-ever for his own.) Ask I say, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
there how we shall find out Christ; rejoyce we ever in the light of
Heaven, walk by it, make much of it, of all holy motions and inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
continue in it; and let neither the tediousness of the way, nor
the frailty of our own flesh, nor any stormy or tempestuous weather,
any cross or trouble, nor any Winter coldness of our own dull bosoms,
nor sometime the loss even of our guides, (those heavenly and spiritual
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57113:99"/>
comforts which God sometimes in his secret Wisdom withdraws from us)
nor any carnal reason or interest deter us from our search after this Babe
of Heaven, after Christ the Saviour; but go on constantly, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
through all these difficulties to the <hi>House of God,</hi> to the <hi>Church
of Christ;</hi> then shall we be sure to find him, find him <hi>with his Mother,</hi>
our souls find him, our affections embrace him, then will he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
in us, and exalt us from this House, the <hi>Church Militant</hi> below,
to that above, <hi>the Church Triumphant</hi> in the Heavens; this Child make
us grow from grace to grace, till we come to the perfect stature of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
here of Grace, and hereafter of Eternal Glory.</p>

a <hi>Star appearing.</hi> Who is it then that are so much
rejoyced at it? may we not call their wisdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
question? their joy into dispute? For the men,
they were <hi>Wise men</hi> I can tell you, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Wise men
from the <hi>East, great</hi> Wise men: and for their <hi>rejoycing,</hi>
'tis the wisest action they ever did, because it was the best sight they ever
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the luckiest <hi>Aspect</hi> they ever beheld in <hi>Heaven:</hi> the happiest <hi>Star,</hi>
that thus led them out of the region of darkness into the land of light,
that thus conducted them to <hi>Christ</hi>'s abode and presence; the greatest
reason in the world to be glad at.</p>
            <p>Ye hear much talk of a late Star or <hi>Comet,</hi> and much ado about it;
but no <hi>great joy</hi> as I can hear. It comes they tell us upon a sad errand, is
sent to us with heavy tidings: <hi>no such</hi> but is, that I believe; though I
have no confidence of their wisdom that pretend to tell us its intent, and
business. But those <hi>They</hi> in the Text, I know were truly wise, because
the Letter tells us so; especially guided and directed into the knowledge
and meaning of the <hi>Star</hi> they are so glad at. And the <hi>Star</hi> comes with
the best news that ever came, is but a Ray of the <hi>Star</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the
<hi>Morning-Star</hi> to usher in the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or our usher to him.
Other <hi>Stars</hi> do commonly but befool their <hi>Students,</hi> delude their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and make them sad: This makes us wise, and glad, and glad to
<hi>salvation</hi> too. The other too often <hi>tend</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> cause men to forget
him; take away the faith and trust that is due to him, to put it to a
wandering <hi>Planet,</hi> its <hi>Aspect</hi> and <hi>Position. This</hi> brings us to him, brings us
to <hi>Iesus</hi> and his holy habitation. And because it does so, we will look
upon it and be glad, follow it and be exceeding glad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:57113:100"/>
For to us still the <hi>Star</hi> shines, and we may see it in the Spirit, in the
spiritual sense and meaning. And indeed that's the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>only</hi> seeing.
The eye of <hi>sense</hi> could not in these <hi>Magi,</hi> that saw it then in being, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in us, that see it now only in the notion, work the joy the <hi>Text</hi>
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses.
There was an <hi>inward</hi> light, that made the <hi>outward</hi> then so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable;
the meer light of a <hi>Star,</hi> though never so glorious, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
else have done it; cannot now if it should appear <hi>again.</hi> It was some
internal light and revelation then concerning it made them so glad, will
make <hi>us</hi> as glad as <hi>they,</hi> if we so look upon it as well as they. And they
and we are but the <hi>same,</hi> of the same <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>kin, Gentiles</hi> both, both
equally concerned in the <hi>Star,</hi> and in the <hi>joy;</hi> they only the <hi>first-fruits,</hi>
we the <hi>lump;</hi> they saw it in the heavens, we see it in the word; a thing
as clear and firm, every <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of it, as the heavens, and we as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as they had to be glad.</p>
            <p>So both the sum and division of the <hi>Text</hi> will be comprehended in these
<hi>two particulars.</hi> The <hi>ground of their joy and ours,</hi> and <hi>the extent of it.</hi> The
<hi>ground</hi> and <hi>occasion</hi> of their joy and ours, what they did then, what we
are still to rejoyce in. <hi>When they saw the Star they rejoyced,</hi> when <hi>we see it,
we must do so too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>extent</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> of this rejoycing both theirs and ours, joy in
the <hi>positive; great</hi> it was, if compared with other joy, above other joy
in the <hi>comparative,</hi> and <hi>exceeding</hi> great joy, the greatest joy in the <hi>superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
as high as may be. <hi>They rejoyced with exceeding great joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Star,</hi> any <hi>Star</hi> or light that leads unto <hi>Christ,</hi> is a just occasion and
ground of <hi>joy;</hi> and when such an one we have, when such an one we see,
we cannot be too glad, we cannot exceed, though it be exceeding. This
the <hi>sum,</hi> these the <hi>particulars</hi> of the <hi>Text.</hi> I begin with the <hi>ground</hi> of our
joy, and theirs, that we may rejoyce the more, that our joy may be the
greater, when we see how great the ground is, that <hi>their</hi> joy was not for
nothing; nor will <hi>ours</hi> be, if it be for nothing but what <hi>theirs</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Yet before we enter upon either, 'tis requisite we consider the <hi>persons,</hi>
look upon <hi>them,</hi> before we look upon the <hi>Star,</hi> that we may see how this
<hi>They,</hi> may become <hi>We;</hi> how we are interested either to look or rejoyce
with them.</p>
            <p>The first verse tells us who they were, <hi>Wise men from the East:</hi> four
points we may have thence, and all so many grounds of joy.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Gentiles</hi> they were. And that to <hi>them a door is opened unto life,</hi> Acts
xiv. 27. that to them that sate <hi>in darkness and the shadow of death, light is
here sprung up,</hi> is a good ground of joy: to such the light is comfortable.
And to us also upon the same account; for <hi>we were Gentiles,</hi> nay, and
<hi>darkness</hi> too, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 8. good reason to rejoyce, that now we are not, that
we are come into the light.</p>
            <p>2. If <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then <hi>sinners</hi> too: I know not then who can be out; for
if heaven notwithstanding our sin and wickedness vouchsafe so to look
upon us, nor <hi>they</hi> nor <hi>we,</hi> no body sure, but must needs be glad.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Great</hi> men they were, foretold in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> under the notion of the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Saba bringing gifts,</hi> Psal. lxxii. 10. This is more cause
of joy then you would think at first. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Not many noble, not many
mighty are called,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 26. were enough to startle and amaze the rich
and great men of the world; and, <hi>how hard is it for a rich man to enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Our <hi>Saviours</hi> words might very well trouble us,
spoil all our mirth, all our joyes, but for this, that the <hi>Magi,</hi> great <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and rich and honourable have an interest in <hi>Christs</hi> Star, for all that, as
well as any</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:57113:101"/>
4. They were <hi>learned</hi> too. <hi>Magi,</hi> Wise men is the name the story
gives them. And the <hi>Apostles, Not many wise, not many learned,</hi> again
might well amaze us, and make us more than sad; but for this They,
that such as they, are not yet such, but that they may come one day to
see <hi>Stars</hi> under them, and in the mean time have their part and portion
in the <hi>Star</hi> that leads to <hi>Christ.</hi> A sound cause of joy, that however the
new <hi>lights</hi> count of <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> men, as enemies to him
whose this <hi>Star</hi> was; yet this <hi>Star</hi> shines to them too, them before any,
was lighted up for them above all the rest. <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<hi>People</hi> are not to be taught or led by <hi>Stars,</hi> they understand not
their voice and language, that's for the wise and learned, to guide them.
Mean and ordinary capacities must have other ways, other guides and
<hi>lanthorns</hi> to lead them to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from the <hi>persons</hi> we have four grounds of the great joy we hear,
that neither Heathen <hi>Ignorance,</hi> nor Heathen <hi>Learning,</hi> nor Honour, nor
Greatness; neither great temptations, nor great sinfulness, no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or quality how sad or cumbersom, but this <hi>Star</hi> rises for, and is ready
to attend into the presence of <hi>Christ;</hi> all may have a portion in the <hi>Star,</hi>
and in the <hi>Ioy.</hi> And good reason we have to rejoyce for our selves, and
our relations, that no persons or condition is debarr'd it.</p>
            <p>Proceed we yet deeper into the grounds of this joy. Three there are,
that they (we speak of) <hi>saw:</hi> (1). Saw somewhat to <hi>speak of.</hi> (2.) <hi>Saw
the Star.</hi> (3.) Saw it at <hi>that time,</hi> when they were even at a loss, had but
a while before quite lost the fight, that's, <hi>when they saw it,</hi> the time
when they saw it in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> point is, that <hi>see</hi> they did, and a point worth noting; that
notwithstanding their great distance from <hi>Iudea,</hi> the only Nation that
then sate in light, that had the knowledge of his Laws, these yet came
<hi>seeing:</hi> That <hi>God</hi> hath some particular persons all the <hi>world</hi> over to whom
he hath given eyes to see him. No Nation indeed, no <hi>whole</hi> people but
the <hi>Iews</hi> were seeing, yet <hi>Iob</hi> in <hi>Vz,</hi> and <hi>Iethro</hi> in <hi>Midian,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> in
<hi>Iericho,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> in <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ittai</hi> in <hi>Gath,</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> in <hi>Sheba,</hi> and
the <hi>Widow</hi> in <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and <hi>Naaman</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> some in every Nation that
could see the light of Heaven and rejoyce in it.</p>
            <p>Corporal sight then of the eye, is one of the greatest temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
our life is capable of; we lose the chiefest of joy and pleasure of a
mortal life, when we are deprived of that. 'Tis worth rejoycing then,
worthy rejoycing in the <hi>Lord</hi> too, that <hi>that</hi> we have, that we can see, that
we are not blind.</p>
            <p>But there is a spiritual, and <hi>immaterial</hi> eye, and seeing with it; the
eye of <hi>Faith,</hi> and our believing by it, that is far beyond the <hi>bodily</hi> sight
and seeing. 'Tis that by which <hi>we live, Heb.</hi> x. 38. 'tis that only by
which we truly see Heaven, or behold <hi>Stars,</hi> that's a great ground of joy.</p>
            <p>Especially if we add <hi>hope</hi> to it, the other eye of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
within the vail, that sees all the joys and pleasures of beatitude,
with affection and delight, that does, as it were, bring <hi>Heaven,</hi> home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
not our eyes only, but our bosoms. The hope of Heaven, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
<hi>happiness,</hi> how glad and jocund will it make the heart; more than
when the Corn, and Wine, and Oyl increase, a better sight by it, than
all the riches and pleasures of the earth, all the profit and assistance of it,
all the beauties and glory of it, can afford us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> sight of Hope, and <hi>that</hi> of Faith, were they the <hi>Wise men</hi> had. It
was thus they saw the <hi>Star,</hi> believed it was the <hi>Star</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57113:101"/>
only guide to their new-born <hi>Saviour,</hi> their convoy to him; and that such
an one there was, they should come to by and by; this they saw by the
eye of <hi>faith.</hi> Thereupon they proceed to <hi>hope,</hi> to see their hopes also in
him; hope ere long to be admitted to the sight and service of him: hope
this <hi>Star</hi> will now bring even them to its <hi>Master,</hi> and give them a place
hereafter with him among the <hi>Stars,</hi> that they may one day <hi>shine in glory</hi>
like them.</p>
            <p>Thus you see <hi>Videntes</hi> will easily enough be brought home to us. We,
even at this day, <hi>thus</hi> see the <hi>Star</hi> by the <hi>two eyes</hi> of faith and hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what here they saw, that such a thing there was, a <hi>Star</hi> lighted up
on purpose to lead the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Christ; hope</hi> what here they felt within
them, some spiritual ray and guidance to him; both believe and hope
that as an outward visible <hi>Star</hi> there was to them; so an inward and
invisible <hi>Star</hi> still there will be to us, by the light of which we may all
come to the knowledge of <hi>Christ.</hi> We are next to <hi>see</hi> it <hi>what it is;</hi> what it
is to <hi>them,</hi> what it is to <hi>us;</hi> how this <hi>star</hi> looks to them, how it looks to
us.</p>
            <p>To them this Star was a <hi>material</hi> Star: to us 'tis a <hi>spiritual,</hi> and <hi>both</hi>
bring their joy with them. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> seems to be ravish'd with joy
upon the sight of the <hi>Stars</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> when he considered the <hi>Heavens
the works of Gods fingers, the Moon and the Stars that he had ordained,</hi> Psal. viii.
3. Then in a kind of <hi>Extasie</hi> he cries out, <hi>Lord, what is man that thou art
mindful of him?</hi> That thou thus <hi>spanglest</hi> the Heavens with Stars for him?
That thou thus <hi>visitest</hi> him by the <hi>Stars?</hi> Methinks the very beholding
of that golden <hi>Canopy,</hi> now our covering, hereafter to be our footstool; the
casting up of our eyes to <hi>heaven</hi> in a bright starry night, and considering
that all those <hi>glorious</hi> Lamps are for the use of us <hi>poor</hi> men here, and for
our <hi>glory</hi> too hereafter, cannot but raise a sweet delight and pleasure in
the devout and pious soul, and force out an <hi>ejaculation</hi> of thankfulness
and joy to <hi>God</hi> that made them for us. Sure I am, that when neither Sun
nor Stars appeared, <hi>Acts</hi> xxvii. 20. it follows presently, that <hi>all hope of
being saved was then taken away:</hi> O the joy of a Star <hi>then!</hi> the appearing of
a Star would have made them <hi>then</hi> have leapt for joy. We see them
commonly, that makes us so little to regard them. If we behold them
seriously, we would sing together with them, as <hi>Iob</hi> says, <hi>they do together,</hi>
Job xxxviii. 7. and praise him together, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, with those
<hi>stars of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet if we should have a Star made on <hi>purpose</hi> for us, we would be
gladder, that <hi>God</hi> should descend to so immediate and special a care of
us, as to light up one of those bright <hi>Candles</hi> for some particular intent
and service to us; and such an one this is; great reason therefore sure to
rejoyce in it. So much the <hi>more,</hi> in that commonly the new raised <hi>Stars</hi>
portend <hi>mischiefs</hi> and misfortunes to us; but this was, as all the <hi>Astrologers</hi>
and <hi>Wise men</hi> then observed, a healthsom, gladsom star, that brought health,
and happiness, and saving in its wings; never any such, or like it, before, or
since. When <hi>God</hi> thus vouchsafes to make heaven dance attendance on us,
make all the <hi>Stars</hi> and Lights speak good to us, some of them more than
others; those heavenly Creatures thus wait upon earth &amp; dust, who is now
so dull and earthy as not to rejoyce and glory in it? Yet if the star not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
portend happiness, but <hi>eternal</hi> happiness besides; if it foretell not only
earthly, but <hi>heavenly</hi> blessings too; if it be a Star that leaves us not till
it have brought us to the Child <hi>Iesus,</hi> till it hath brought us to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
there is matter indeed of great <hi>exceeding</hi> joy. So a fourfold ground
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57113:102"/>
of joy you have in this very <hi>Star;</hi> First, <hi>Gods general</hi> providence over
man, to make even the heavenly Creatures serve him. Secondly, <hi>God's
special</hi> Providence in it, now and then sending a Star, some special token
to forewarn or guide him. Thirdly, <hi>God's comfortable</hi> Providence in so
doing, sometimes to bless and comfort us, to uphold and chear us.
Fourthly, <hi>Gods saving Providence,</hi> thus to make all things, though never
so distant from us, signally instrumental to our eternal happiness and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
making the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Heavens</hi> thus minister unto us. For these
four we may well take up St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s resolution, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 18. <hi>We therein do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
yea, and will rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet I must give you a <hi>fifth</hi> ray of this Star, God's particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
over the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> strangers from the <hi>Covenant of Promise, aliens
from the Comman-wealth of Israel,</hi> men without promise, without hope;
that had neither promise, nor hope of mercy, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 12. that to <hi>them</hi> this
Star should appear, for <hi>them</hi> be made and sent, is such a ground of joy to
<hi>us,</hi> that are of the same stock and lineage, that without it <hi>we</hi> had had no
joy at all, <hi>who ever</hi> had. 'Tis upon this title we have our share in this
happy Star; upon this particular dispensation of thus gathering the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> to him by it, as by a <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Ensign</hi> for them to flow in unto
him, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> Phrases it. This is the <hi>fifth</hi> ray of the material Star,
and it may go for a <hi>sixth,</hi> That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> not then only, but even to this
day <hi>still</hi> enjoy the benefit of that <hi>Star,</hi> have oftentimes material and
<hi>sensible</hi> convoys unto <hi>Christ;</hi> are often by the things of sense, by sensible
blessings, drawn and perswaded to his service. Thus you have the six
Rays of the <hi>Star,</hi> six comfortable Rays to ground our joys upon in the
material Star.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>mystical</hi> or spiritual, those Stars and Lights
which yet remain, even to this day, to guide us to the same <hi>Iesus!</hi>
For more than one there is of this sort, and all sufficient grounds of
<hi>Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The first sort of <hi>Stars</hi> are devout and <hi>holy</hi> men, shining, as <hi>Daniel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
them, <hi>like the Stars,</hi> Dan. xii. 3. <hi>Stars</hi> they are in this world whilst
they live; burning, and shining Lights, the very light and life, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the earth, while they are upon it; and <hi>Stars</hi> they shall be in the
heavens when they come thither. Here they go before us with the light
of good examples to lead us to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his righteousness, to all holy
and heavenly conversation; And for it they shall one day shine as <hi>Stars</hi>
for ever and ever. A ground of joy it is to us, that <hi>this Star</hi> we have,
that such guides we have, by whose examples to conform our selves to
the obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> in whose light to walk to him.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>Stars</hi> are the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For,
however men now reckon them, or however now much darkned in their
heaven, in this <hi>our</hi> Church, in our <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> Stars they are in the hand
of <hi>Christ,</hi> Rev. i. 16. in his <hi>right</hi> hand too, the vision so interpreted, <hi>v.</hi> 20.
the seven Stars, the <hi>seven Angels of the Churches;</hi> the Church it self
crown'd with <hi>twelve such Stars,</hi> Rev. xii. 1. the twelve Apostles. All
crowned Churches, all that are compleat and perfect, are crowned with
such <hi>Stars,</hi> with <hi>Bishops, Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> And a solid ground of joy
it is, that we have such <hi>Stars</hi> to guide and direct us into the knowledge of
<hi>Christ,</hi> into the ways and means of salvation. Let <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi>
think their pleasure, an exceeding joy it is, to all that either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Religion, or practice it, that <hi>God</hi> still allows us the glory of
these <hi>Stars,</hi> though one differing in glory from another; that he hath
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57113:102"/>
not yet totally darkned our heaven upon us, nor removed our true, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and faithful <hi>Pastors</hi> clean away; that we wander not from Sea to
Sea, and from the <hi>North,</hi> even to the <hi>East;</hi> that we run not to and fro
to seek the Word of God, to see a <hi>Star,</hi> and cannot find it, but have
them yet standing over us and directing us. It will be a thousand to one
but we miss of <hi>Christ</hi> when we lose this <hi>Star;</hi> a thousand to one that we
go into the wrong house instead of his when we lose our <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
<hi>Teachers,</hi> the days we now see tell us so already. For his <hi>House</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Church not to be seen or found, but by
the light and brightness of <hi>successive Bishops</hi> and Ministers, who are the
Churches glory, and its Crown and joy, nothing but sad and giddy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
can be expected where they are not.</p>
            <p>A <hi>third Star</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and there, first, the sure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
a light, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> stiles it, <hi>shining in a dark place,</hi> to which he
tells us we do well if <hi>we take heed, 2 Pet.</hi> i. 19. Then secondly, the sure
Promises of the Gospel of Grace, and Truth, and Pardon, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and glorious light by which we are led to the knowledge of <hi>Christ;</hi>
full glad and merry with the hopes of such pardon and forgiveness, of
such grace and favour.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fourth Star</hi> is inward Grace, the light of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> by which we
are not only led to the place of this new-born Child, but this Child it
self even new-born in us. This is a <hi>Star</hi> that rises in the very heart, the
<hi>Day-star rising there,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 19. without which we should sit in perpetual
shades, the day never dawn upon us. All the former <hi>Stars,</hi> good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
and Instructions, and spiritual Predictions, and Promises, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
and Teachers, can teach little without this <hi>Star.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> may
plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, and no increase; the Preachers speak and
preach into the air, nothing stay behind; good example be spilt as water
on the ground, divine Prophesies and Promises only strike the outward
ear, to little purpose all of them together, unless the <hi>Spirit</hi> speak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and warm and lighten the soul with its <hi>fiery</hi> tongue, and comfort it
vvith invvard light and heat. Hence is the joy that is unspeakable, and
full of glory, which the Apostle speaks of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 8.</p>
            <p>A <hi>fifth Star,</hi> which is <hi>heavenly glory,</hi> a bright morning Star it is, that
<hi>Christ</hi> promises to give him, that <hi>continues and holds out unto the end,</hi> Rev. ii.
28. I will give him <hi>the morning star,</hi> that is, eternal life, the Star of glory.
This is a <hi>Star</hi> will shew us <hi>Christ</hi> as he is; bring us to him, not in his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
but in his Throne; not in his <hi>Mothers</hi> lap, but in his <hi>Fathers</hi> bosom:
A <hi>Star</hi> that will lead us, both here and hereafter, to his presence. Here
the great Star that most surely brings us, and most effectually perswades
to <hi>Christ,</hi> and Christian Piety, is the hope of Heaven, the promise of
Glory. In the strength of this hope we suffer any thing for him; we
hunger and thirst, endure cold and nakedness, poverty and scorn, whips
and fetters, halters and hatchets, racks and tortures, ignominy and
death, whilst this <hi>Star</hi> seems to open heaven unto us: thus it brings us
to him here, and hereafter it fills us with the beatifical vision of him for
ever. I need not tell you this is a very sufficient ground of the greatest
joy, it self being almost nothing else.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a <hi>sixth Star,</hi> the Star that was foretold should come out
of <hi>Iacob,</hi> Num. xxiv. 17. <hi>I am the bright morning Star,</hi> Rev. xxii. 16. I
<hi>Iesus,</hi> says he himself, am the root and off-spring of <hi>David,</hi> and the
bright and morning Star. <hi>He</hi> the <hi>Star</hi> that leads us to himself; his own
<hi>beauty,</hi> the great <hi>attractive</hi> to him; his mercy the sure convoy to himself;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57113:103"/>
his humility, his being the root, so low and humble, the conduct to his
Highness; his Incarnation and Nativity, his becoming the off-spring
and Son of <hi>David,</hi> being made man, the only way above all to bring us
unto himself. Here's the ground, the very ground indeed of all our
joy and comfort, that he thus came into the World to save Sinners, thus
clouded his eternal brightness, his <hi>starry</hi> nature, his glorious <hi>Godhead,</hi>
with the dark rays of flesh and matter, appearing at best but as a subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> of our souls, that we might so the easier come
unto him, and be comforted, not confounded, in his brightness.</p>
            <p>Thus we have multiplied the <hi>Star</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> by the perspective of the
Spirit into Six, or shew'd you the six spiritual rays which issue from it,
which reach to us, and even shine (<hi>God</hi> be thanked) still, though that
be gone, or shut up in the Treasuries of the <hi>Almighty;</hi> all of these signal
grounds of true Christian joy; Good <hi>Examples,</hi> good <hi>Teachers,</hi> a good
<hi>Word of God,</hi> the good <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> the good <hi>hope of glory,</hi> the good of
<hi>goods,</hi> our <hi>good and gracious Saviour;</hi> so good Stars, and so good occasion
of rejoycing, that there can be no better.</p>
            <p>3. And yet a degree may be added, from the <hi>third</hi> Consideration of
the time <hi>when</hi> this Star appeared. Indeed it had long before <hi>this</hi> day
been seen; had led the <hi>Wise men</hi> all the way, comforted and cheer'd them
up all their long journey through; only at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> there it left them,
there where one would think the Star should shine the <hi>brightest.</hi> But
(1.) What need <hi>Star-light,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteousness is so <hi>near?</hi> Or
what (2.) should need a <hi>Type,</hi> when the <hi>Substance</hi> was so hard by? Or
what necessity (3.) of a <hi>Star,</hi> when they were now in a surer and <hi>brighter</hi>
light, so says St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 19. the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> at hand to point
out him they sought? Or how (4.) should we expect any special favour
from the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven, while we stay in <hi>Herod</hi>'s Courts, in <hi>Satan</hi>'s terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
in wicked company? Or why (5.) should we think the <hi>Star</hi>
should stay upon us, when we leave it? That <hi>God</hi> should help us, when
we, as it were, renounce his direction, to enquire for mens? Go to the
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> for it? How should we but lose <hi>God's</hi> grace, if we neglect
it?</p>
            <p>'Tis the great ground here then of their rejoycing, that after they had
lost it, they here recover it; that they are now got out of <hi>Herods</hi> Court,
a place of sin and darkness, and are now refresh'd again with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Light. No joy in the World like that of recovering Heaven,
when it is almost <hi>lost.</hi> No joy to the womans for finding again the <hi>Groat</hi>
that she had lost. No rejoycing like the Shepherds for the <hi>lost</hi> sheep
when he has found it. The joy reacheth up to heaven, says Christ;
the very Angels rejoyce at it, when a sinner is returned from the error
of his way, when <hi>God</hi> lights anew this <hi>Star</hi> to him. Truly, when we
have lost any of the afore-mentioned <hi>Stars,</hi> and afterwards recover them,
whether they be the <hi>Examples</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> that have unluckily slipt
out of our memories; or our <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> that have been <hi>forced</hi> or
driven from us; or the <hi>truth</hi> of the holy <hi>Word,</hi> which false <hi>glosses</hi> and
corrupt interpretations have hidden from us; or the inward comforts of
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which our sins have for some time robb'd us of; or the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of <hi>heavenly</hi> joy, and eternal happiness, which hath a while been lost
by reason of our delighting our selves wholly in sensual pleasures or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
or lastly, the beauty of this <hi>holy Child,</hi> which has been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
clouded from us, through our weakness and infirmity in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
it, which soever of them it is that we have first lost, and then
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57113:103"/>
recovered; when we either recover our memories, or our Ministers, or
the truth, or the holy Spirit, or the sight of heaven, or the beauty of
<hi>Christ</hi> into us; the joy is far greater than it was at the beginning, <hi>Carendo
magis quam fruendo intelligimus,</hi> because we never throughly understand the
comfort and benefit of any of them, till we see the distress we are in
with out them.</p>
            <p>And (2.) their seeing the <hi>Star</hi> again when they were, as it were, in
most distress, and when they were more like to be at a greater loss than
ever amongst the Cottages of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> like utterly to be confounded
by the horror of poverty, and the sight of nothing but unkingly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
this it was that so rais'd their joy. And it will do <hi>ours</hi> at any
time, to have help and succour come timely to us, to be delivered and
raised in the midst of distresses and despair. 'Tis the very nick of time
to enhance a joy.</p>
            <p>'Tis not less neither (3.) to creatures compounded of flesh and bloud,
to have even some <hi>sensible</hi> comforts renew'd to stir us up. To see a <hi>star,</hi>
to behold comfort with our <hi>eyes,</hi> to have the inward comfort augmented
by the outward, to be led to <hi>Christ</hi> by a Star, by <hi>prosperities</hi> and blessings,
rather than a <hi>cloud,</hi> by <hi>crosses</hi> and distresses, this is more welcome, more
gladsom, to the heart; and so it seems to the <hi>Wise men</hi> themselves, that
<hi>God,</hi> though he had given them inward guidances, and back'd them with
Prophetical instructions out of his own <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> had not yet
deserted them of his outward assistance, but even added that also to all
the former. Now then thus to have star upon stat, material and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
time after time, when we most desire it, when we greatliest need
it, to want no guide, no opportunity, no occasion at also to advance our
happiness and salvation, how can we but, with them in the Text, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
now, and that with <hi>exceeding great joy? Three</hi> degrees you see are
apparent in the words, all to be spent upon the <hi>Star</hi> that leads to <hi>Christ.</hi>
We can never be too glad of him, or of his Star; any conduct or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to come to him: <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> joy, and <hi>exceeding</hi> great joy is but
sufficient.</p>
            <p>Nor is any joy but <hi>spiritual,</hi> that which is for <hi>Christ,</hi> really capable of
those degrees; that only is truly called joy; the joy in <hi>Christ</hi> only dilates
the heart, all other joys straiten and distress it, fill it up with dirt and
rubbish; worldly joyes can never fill it otherwise: 'Tis only then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
when it opens up to <hi>heaven,</hi> earthly comforts do but fetter and
compress it.</p>
            <p>That joy (2.) is only <hi>great.</hi> Earthly ones are petty and inconsiderable,
for petty things: <hi>Heaven</hi> only hath great things in it; <hi>Christ</hi> the only
<hi>great</hi> one.</p>
            <p>That only (3.) is <hi>exceeding.</hi> That's the joy that <hi>passes</hi> understanding,
that exceeds all other, that exceeds all measure, that exceeds all power,
none can take it from us; that exceeds all words and expression too, no
tongue whatever can express it. So you see our joy, that a spiritual joy it
is, because so great, so exceeding.</p>
            <p>Yet being so exceeding, it will exceed also the narrow compass of the
<hi>inward</hi> man, will issue out also into the <hi>outward,</hi> into the tongue and heads;
Joy is the dilatation, the opening of the heart, and sending out the
Spirits into all the parts. And if this joy we have, it will open our
hearts to praise him, open our hearts to <hi>Heaven</hi> to receive its influence,
open our hearts to our <hi>needy brother,</hi> to compassionate and relieve him;
it will send out life, and heat, and spirit into all our powers; into our
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57113:104"/>
lips to <hi>sing</hi> unto him, into our fingers to <hi>play</hi> to him; into our feet even
to <hi>leap</hi> for joy; into our eyes perpetually to <hi>gaze</hi> upon him, into our hands
to <hi>open</hi> them for his sake plentifully to the poor; into the whole body to
<hi>devote</hi> it wholly to his service. This is the <hi>Wise mens</hi> joy, great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
Give me leave to fit it to the parts, to apply the joy to the
several grounds, <hi>Gaudium</hi> to <hi>videntes, magnum</hi> to <hi>stellam, valde</hi> to the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi>
of the Text. They <hi>saw,</hi> and so rejoyced with <hi>joy.</hi> They saw the <hi>Star,</hi>
and so rejoyced with <hi>great</hi> joy <hi>when</hi> they saw it; saw it so <hi>opportunely,</hi> they
rejoyced with <hi>exceeding</hi> joy.</p>
            <p>Let us then (1.) rejoyce with them, with a single joy for both the <hi>seers,</hi>
and their <hi>seeing;</hi> make it our joy, that neither our ignorances, nor our
sins can keep us always from <hi>Christs</hi> presence; that our riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
our learning and wisdom may rather help than hinder us in the
search of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And rejoyce we then again that <hi>God</hi> hath given
us eyes and sight to see the ways and means of salvation. This will at
least deserve our joy in the <hi>positive</hi> degree.</p>
            <p>But the Star, or <hi>Stars,</hi> we mentioned, will add this <hi>magnum</hi> to it. Let
us then (2.) rejoyce greatly, or with great joy, that <hi>God</hi> thus vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
to lead us to his Son both by outward and inward means; That he
hath given us so many lights of good <hi>examples</hi> to walk by; That he hath
lighted up his Stars, <hi>Pastors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> to direct and guide
us. That he continues to us the light and brightness of his <hi>truth;</hi> That
he enlightens us daily inwardly by his <hi>grace;</hi> That he fills our hearts with
<hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>glory;</hi> That he is ready more and more to shew us <hi>Christ</hi> in all
his beauty, to give him to us with all his benefits, to bring us to him in
all his glory. Great joy is but little enough certainly for such great things
as these.</p>
            <p>And (3.) <hi>exceeding</hi> it must and will be, if we but consider the time
<hi>when</hi> such great things are done, or doing for us. 'Tis when we had, in
a manner, diverted from him, gone aside out of our way, left his <hi>Star</hi> for
<hi>Herod.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> then to renew his mercy to us, to shine upon us in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
beauty, to point us even to the very house, and place to find <hi>Christ</hi> in;
to do it then when we had wilfully departed from his conduct, is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
a grace and favour, that no joy of ours be it never so exceeding,
can <hi>exceed</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Wise men,</hi> for the direction of that <hi>singl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Star, were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
affected with joy and gladness, how infinite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y should we be for
so many? Alas, they saw nothing then in comparison of us. The Child
was <hi>then</hi> but in rags and swadling cloaths: he is <hi>now</hi> in robes of glory.
He was then lying in an earthly <hi>Cottage,</hi> he is now sitting in an heavenly
<hi>Palace.</hi> All the ways of Salvation were then but mysteries, they are now
revealed. Salvation then was but in its <hi>Clouts,</hi> 'tis now in its <hi>perfection.</hi>
They saw <hi>Christ</hi> but once, we daily see him: See him and all his <hi>Stars,</hi>
see him amidst his <hi>Stars,</hi> walking with some of them in his hands; the
Stars or <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> amongst other of them his <hi>Saints,</hi> with
them in glory, creating <hi>stars</hi> daily in our hearts, shining to us every day in
his Word and Sacraments, there opening his glory unto us, and us a door
into it, and all the while the material stars even under his feet.</p>
            <p>Seeing all these so much above what they here saw, our joy should be
much above what they rejoyced with. But theirs being exceeding, ours
can be no more, when we have said all we can. And that it may be so,
I shall only tell you, It must exceed the joy we take in <hi>earthly</hi> things, we
must more rejoyce in <hi>Christ,</hi> and in his <hi>Star,</hi> than all the World besides;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57113:104"/>
more in the holiness of a <hi>Saint,</hi> than in the highness of a <hi>Prince;</hi> more
in a faithful <hi>Pastor,</hi> than in any Worldly <hi>Counsellor;</hi> more in the Word of
<hi>God,</hi> than in all the Writings of men; much more in the History of
<hi>Christ,</hi> than in all the <hi>Romances</hi> and Histories of the earth; more in the
Promises of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than in the promises of all earthly <hi>pleasures,</hi> and
felicities; more in the <hi>inward</hi> work of grace, and the inward comforts
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> than any <hi>sensual</hi> satisfactions and contentments; more in
the meditation of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and heavenly Glory, than in all the glories of
the <hi>World;</hi> more in <hi>Christ,</hi> than in all things, or hopes together; It must
<hi>exceed</hi> them all.</p>
            <p>And when it so exceeds, it will bring us to an exceeding high condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
make us exceed in grace, exceed in glory; do great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things by the power of grace to express our thankfulness, and bring
us by it to the reward of exceeding glory, where we shall need no more
<hi>Stars</hi> to guide us, nor Sun or Moon to give us light; but this <hi>eternal</hi> light,
now pointed at by the <hi>Star,</hi> shall give us light both day and night, shall
fill us with joy, such as neither heart can imagine, nor tongue express;
that exceeds all we can speak or think; give us joy for joy, great for
great, exceeding for exceeding, in his blessed Light and Presence for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

            <p>To come into the house else where <hi>Iesus</hi> is, and there to see him, to
stand and look upon him only, and no more, is a journey and sight to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose. The <hi>Oxe</hi> and the <hi>Ass</hi> saw him; and many no doubt to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpose, upon the <hi>Shepherds</hi> report, and the rumour of these <hi>Wise mens</hi>
coming from the <hi>East,</hi> came to see and gaze upon him. It is this <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
that sanctifies, prospers all our journeys; we begin them but unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and finish them but unluckily without it. If we fall not down
upon our knees before we go out, and bow not our selves, and worship
not in thankfulness when we come in, we cannot assure our selves of
any great good, either of our goings out, or of our comings in, how suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
soever they seem at first, even to have obtained their ends, even
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57113:105"/>
found <hi>Iesus</hi> too. This same <hi>worshipping</hi> is both the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>blessing</hi> of all our
journeys, if they be blest; nor see we, or understand we any thing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
or comfortably where that is wanting, where the worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> is not both the aim and endeavour of all our
motions.</p>
            <p>Wise men <hi>they</hi> were here, that now for these <hi>twelve</hi> days have made it
<hi>theirs;</hi> And the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch,</hi> Acts viii. 27. a great Counsellour, made
it the only business of <hi>his</hi> Journey to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to worship <hi>only,</hi> and so
return. And in the devouter times of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the devout Christians,
when their haste was such they could not stay out a <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Collect,</hi>
would yet never pass a <hi>Church,</hi> but they would in and bow themselves,
and <hi>worship,</hi> and be gone. <hi>Tantiest adorare;</hi> so weighty a business it is to
worship, though but in <hi>transitu,</hi> to prosper any thing we are about.</p>
            <p>It was so thought <hi>then:</hi> it would be so now, did we not more study to
make enquiries about <hi>Christ,</hi> than to serve him; to dispute about Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
than to practise it: Christianity here begins with <hi>it.</hi> These first
Christians <hi>I may call them,</hi> thus profest their service to their <hi>Saviour,</hi> thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
themselves to the faith and obedience of <hi>Christ;</hi> and were there no
other reason in the world to perswade it, it were certainly enough, that
the <hi>first</hi> Faith in <hi>Christ</hi> was after this fashion, thus acknowledged and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three</hi> acts there are of it in the <hi>Text,</hi>

the <hi>second</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> the <hi>third</hi> of our <hi>goods:</hi> With these three,
our Bodies, our Souls, our Goods, we are to worship him; with all these
his worship is to be performed, without them <hi>all</hi> it is but a lame and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Sacrifice, neither fit for <hi>Wise men</hi> to give, nor <hi>Christ</hi> to receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two</hi> points of the <hi>Text</hi> we are gone through: the Wise mens <hi>Iourney</hi>
and <hi>success;</hi> their <hi>coming</hi> and their <hi>seeing;</hi> their <hi>labour</hi> and their <hi>reward.</hi>
Three now we have to go through, <hi>Procidentes, Adorârunt, &amp; Obtulêrunt;</hi>
the three acts, or parts, or points of Worship we are to perform to <hi>Christ:</hi>
each in its order as it lies, and first of <hi>Procidentes,</hi> their <hi>Prostration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is we first hear of any worship done to <hi>Christ,</hi> and this falling
down, this prostration; the <hi>first</hi> worship, as if no other, no lesser ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
could serve turn after so great a blessing as the sight of a Saviour:
as if his taking on a body, challeng'd our whole bodies now; his coming
down from Heaven, our falling down upon the earth; his so great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
our greatest expression of our humility.</p>
            <p>Many sorts of adoration have been observed, greater and lesser, <hi>Bowing
the head,</hi> Exod. i. 10. <hi>Bowing the body,</hi> Gen. xviii. 2. <hi>Bending the knee,</hi> Isa.
xlv. 23. <hi>Worshipping upon the knee,</hi> Psal. xcv. 6. <hi>God</hi> thus worshipped by
them <hi>all.</hi> And falling down before him is no news to hear of, neither in
<hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity;</hi> whatsoever niceness, or laziness, or profaneness
of late have either said or practis'd against it.</p>
            <p>They were <hi>Wise men</hi> here that did it; yet it is well that the <hi>Scripture</hi>
calls them so. I know who have been counted <hi>fools,</hi> superstitious fools,
for as little a matter, for the <hi>same:</hi> though I cannot but wonder to see as
much done in a <hi>complement</hi> to a <hi>thing</hi> worse than a reasonable man, whilst
<hi>God</hi> himself is denied it. Indeed it may be if we compare the persons, we
shall quickly see the reason: These in the Text were Wise men, of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and reputation, men of some quality, men that understood them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and knew the language of Heaven; and can turn the Stars to
their proper uses, that think not much of much pains, to find a <hi>Redeemer,</hi>

that know how to use a <hi>King,</hi> and serve a <hi>God;</hi> that run readily at the
first call of Heaven to pay this worship: <hi>Your selves</hi> can inform you what
they are that deny it, I shall not tell you.</p>
            <p>Poor ignorant <hi>Shepherds</hi> may perhaps through ignorance or astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
omit the Ceremony and be pardon'd, so they go away praising and
rejoycing; but great learned <hi>Clerks</hi> cannot be excus'd if they pretermit
it: but neither the one nor the other, if they <hi>deny</hi> it. Ignorance will be
no sufficient plea for the one, nor a distinction or a pretence of scandal
for the other, in a point so plain, as perpetual <hi>custom</hi> from the beginning
of the world, and plain words of <hi>Scripture</hi> make it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham falls upon his face</hi> in a thankful acceptance of <hi>Gods</hi> promise,
<hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 17. His servant <hi>Eleazar bows down and worships.</hi> Gen. xxiv. 26.
Old <hi>Iacob</hi> did as much as he could towards it <hi>on his bed,</hi> Gen. xxi. 31. And
the people of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> iv. 31. and this before the <hi>Law</hi> was given. And
<hi>Moses</hi> before the Law was written, fell down before the Lord, as he tells
the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> ix. 18. So it was no <hi>Iewish</hi> Law or custom then, but
even a point of the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> though practis'd also by the <hi>Iew,</hi> by
<hi>David,</hi> Ps. v. 7. by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 Chron. vi. 13. by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ch. xi. 13. by <hi>Daniel,</hi>
ch. vi. 10. by all the Prophets, by all the people; all the children of <hi>Israel</hi>
together bowed <hi>themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
and worshipped and praised the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. vii. 3. <hi>Christ</hi> himself allows
the people to do as much to him; takes it, and takes it <hi>kindly</hi> from them.
<hi>Iairus</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue <hi>falls at his feet,</hi> St. Mark v. 20. <hi>Mary</hi>
does as much, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xi. 31. Others often do the same, and none <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
it: <hi>nay,</hi> he himself does it to his <hi>Father,</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 35. <hi>fell</hi> down
and <hi>prayed;</hi> and do <hi>we</hi> then think much to do it? The very <hi>Saints</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where there is nor shadow certainly nor <hi>Ceremony,</hi> fall <hi>down before
him,</hi> even before the <hi>Lamb. Rev.</hi> v. 8. and xi. 16. and xiv. 4. and are <hi>we</hi>
too good to do it? Is the practice of <hi>all</hi> ages, of <hi>Heaven,</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> and
<hi>Christ</hi> too, not strong enough to bow our stubborn necks? Is there <hi>Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism</hi>
and Superstition in Heaven, in <hi>Christ</hi> too? Oh then let <hi>me</hi> be supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
I am content to be so, to be called so by any generation upon
earth.</p>
            <p>But to make it yet more evident, if it can be: nature it self in the midst
of its corruptions keeps yet this impression undefac'd, and more plainly
professes this <hi>Reverence</hi> due to the <hi>Deity,</hi> than even the <hi>Deity</hi> it self. Never
did any the most blind and foolish Heathen yet acknowledge a <hi>God,</hi> but
presently they worshipped him with their <hi>bodies.</hi> Nay never did any ever
pretend either honour or respect to man, but he exprest it some way by
his body, by some gesture or other of it. And must God that made it,
and <hi>Christ</hi> that redeemed it, only go without it? must man be reverenc'd
with the body, and the <hi>Devil</hi> serv'd with it, and <hi>God</hi> be put off with the
worship of the soul, which yet neither can express it self, nor think, nor
do any thing without the body whilst it is in it? It was thought a good
argument by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to glorifie <hi>God</hi> in our body as well as in our spirits
(and in old Manuscripts I must tell you, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not found, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
the body only, is) because they are <hi>God's,</hi> he hath bought them with a
price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20. good reason then that he should have them. <hi>The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is for the Lord,</hi> ver. 13. of that Chapter; Who then should have it
but he? 'tis for no body else: he only can claim it, others do but borrow
it, or usurp it: let him therefore have it, 'tis his own, and it cannot be
bestowed better: he knows best to use it, how to keep it, fear we not:
Indeed it is so unreasonable to deny it him, so unprofitable to the very
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57113:106"/>
body to keep it from him, that I know not why we should expect to have
it either safe or well, when we deny it him. Who can keep it better?
who can easier lift it up when it is down, raise it up when it is fallen, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it in health and strength than <hi>he?</hi> And are we such fond fools then,
not to present it always to his protection, and lay it at his feet, who if
he tread upon it, does yet do it good?</p>
            <p>Though we were <hi>Hereticks</hi> of the highest impudence, and denied his
<hi>God-head,</hi> yet confessing his <hi>humanity,</hi> we can do no less than give the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of our bodies to him; We can give him nothing less. I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach of charity, I fear, suspect that this generation that are so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
against the worship of the body, will e're long neither confess his
<hi>God-head</hi> nor his Man-hood, turn <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Manichee</hi> both together, and
prove a kind of mixed <hi>Hereticks</hi> unheard of hitherto, beyond all the
wickedness and folly of all their former predecessors, come so far at last, to
think all done in a fancy, or a dream, make all the work of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
come to nothing. For certainly, did they either seriously think him
true <hi>God</hi> or true <hi>man,</hi> we should see it by their bodies, especially seeing
we cannot see any thing by their spirits to the contrary. Even men us'd
to be <hi>thus</hi> worshipped, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> i. 31. and <hi>Prophets, 2 Kings</hi> ii. 15. So that
did they confess him <hi>any thing,</hi> they would certainly fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, not <hi>deny</hi> it to be sure, whether do it or no.</p>
            <p>For all falling down is not <hi>adoration.</hi> It is the mind that makes <hi>that;</hi>
the intention of the soul, that turns this outward expression of the body
into adoration, that makes it either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, either a religious or
a civil worship, as it pleases.</p>
            <p>This is the reason together with the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin,</hi>
St. <hi>Leo,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and others, that I make <hi>adorârunt</hi> here, this
word worship, to relate to the soul, as <hi>procidentes,</hi> falling down, to the
body. Though I am not ignorant that both in the <hi>School,</hi> and <hi>Grammar</hi>
sense it is seldom or never found without the interest and posture of the
body, yet must it of necessity most refer to the soul, <hi>that</hi> being able on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to specifie the worship, and give it both its nature and its name, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intending it religiously as to <hi>God,</hi> or civilly only as to a creature,
where it gives it; the outward posture being oft the same indifferently
to <hi>God</hi> and man.</p>
            <p>That these <hi>Wise men</hi> intended it as an act of <hi>Devotion</hi> and Religion, as to
an incarnate <hi>God,</hi> not a meer carnal man, is the general opinion of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and not without good ground. For first, <hi>Wise men,</hi> who ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
some end to all their motions, would not have undertaken so long,
and tedious, and troublesom a journey to have seen a child in a Cradle,
or in the mothers lap; no not a Royal babe: they were <hi>Kings</hi> themselves;
so the <hi>Antients</hi> delivered them to us: and the 72 Psalm foretells them by
that name; and they had often seen such sights, in as much pomp and
glory as they could expect it in <hi>Iudea.</hi> At least <hi>cui bono?</hi> what good
should they get by it? (<hi>that's a thing Wise men consider</hi>) by any <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea?</hi>
what was such an one or his child to them, who had nor dependance
nor commerce with him; or if they had, needed not make such a needless
journey themselves, to no more purpose than in a <hi>complement</hi> to visit him?</p>
            <p>But (2.) They tell us they had seen his <hi>Star;</hi> now we and they knew
well enough that the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth, though they have the <hi>Spangles</hi>
of the Earth, have not the <hi>Spangles</hi> of the Heaven at their command;
though they have Courts and Courtiers beset with sparks of <hi>Diamonds</hi>
and <hi>Rubies,</hi> they have not yet one spark of Heaven in their attendance.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57113:107"/>
No King of <hi>Stars,</hi> but the King of <hi>Heaven;</hi> none under whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or dominion they move or shine, none that can call them <hi>his,</hi> but
<hi>God</hi> that made them; to worship one then who not only can alone call all
the Stars by their names, but by his own too, is certainly, in any <hi>Wise
mans</hi> language, to worship <hi>God.</hi> Our very Star-gazers, who confess no
<hi>King,</hi> and for ought we can see, worship no <hi>God,</hi> will yet confess, that in
the <hi>Latin</hi> they have <hi>regit Astra Deus,</hi> that the Stars are only <hi>Gods;</hi> and
though a Wise man may by his wisdom divert their influence, he can in
no wise either command or direct their motion.</p>
            <p>3. They tell us too they came to worship, their whole business was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; and we would think they had little indeed, if they came so
far only to give a <hi>complement</hi> to a child that could neither answer them
nor understand them; We must certainly take them not for <hi>Wise men,</hi> but
very <hi>fools</hi> to do so. And if worship be the end of their coming, we may
quickly understand by the phrase of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it is <hi>divine</hi> worship that
is meant. Of worship indeed and adoration we may read in other senses
there, but it is never made a business, said to be any ones aim or purpose,
but when it is referr'd to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>House.</hi> The <hi>Eunuch</hi> is said to come to
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and worship, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 27. <hi>David</hi> invites us to <hi>fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
Psal. xcv. 6. St. <hi>Paul</hi> comes to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship, <hi>Acts</hi> xxiv. 11.
and certain <hi>Greeks</hi> are said to come up to <hi>worship,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 20. but all
this while it is to worship <hi>God,</hi> never made a work to worship man. To
fall down before, or bow, or reverence to any man, how great soever, is
but an <hi>occasional</hi> piece of business, on <hi>set</hi> purpose never. When we come
before <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> we do it, but never come before them to this <hi>end</hi>
only for to do it.</p>
            <p>4. Had they conceived no other of him than as <hi>man,</hi> or a Child of man,
that poor contemptible condition, and unworshipful pickle they found
him in, the <hi>rags</hi> of poverty, the <hi>place</hi> they saw him in, would have made
them have forborn their worship quite, they would have been so far from
<hi>procidentes adorârunt,</hi> that it would have been <hi>dedignantes abiêrunt;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of falling down and worshipping, they would have gone their
ways, disdaining at him. But so powerful was his <hi>Star,</hi> and so had the
<hi>day-Star</hi> risen in their hearts, so had the eternal light shined to them, that
they could see what others could not; <hi>in carne Deum, God</hi> in the Child:
He that led them without, taught them within, both <hi>whom</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
and <hi>how</hi> to worship.</p>
            <p>And indeed, he that knows and considers <hi>whom</hi> he worships, will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
both in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in <hi>truth,</hi> with his <hi>soul</hi> and with his <hi>body,</hi> in <hi>truth</hi>
else he does not worship. <hi>Adorare,</hi> adoration consists of both, nay, cannot
be well conceived, if you take away either the one or the other. The
word it self in its <hi>primitive</hi> signification is, <hi>manum ad os admovere,</hi> concerns
the body, and is no more than to kiss the hand, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is
just the same. So was the fashion of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to worship, and it seems
ancient through the <hi>East;</hi> for it is an expression of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. xxxi.
21. If <hi>I have beheld the Sun when it shined,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or, my mouth hath kissed my
hand,</hi> that is, if he had worshipped any other <hi>God.</hi> But it falls out with
this as with other words, they enlarge their signification by time and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom;
and so adoration is come to be applied to all <hi>worship of the body,</hi> bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the head, bending the knee, falling on the face, kneeling at the feet,
according as each particular <hi>Country</hi> perform their reverence. Time yet
hath enlarged it further, and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that eternal word, and
therefore the best <hi>Expositor</hi> of any word, hath applied it also to the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57113:107"/>
soul <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 23. nay more, calls them the truest
worshippers that worship in <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>Spirits,</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> part is the chiefest, the worship of the
body is but the <hi>body</hi> of worship. The soul that is it that enlivens it, the
spirit and soul of it that completes it, the <hi>inward</hi> intention, direction,
submission, and reverence is that which makes all to be accepted. To fall
down in humility with the body, and lift up the soul with pride; to give
an outward respect to him, and <hi>inwardly</hi> neglect him; to do the worship
cursorily, or in a complement, without <hi>attention</hi> or good meaning, is to
use <hi>Christ</hi> as the Souldiers did, worship him in a mockery, cry, <hi>Hail King,
and smite him;</hi> to give a Crown of Thorns, and a Scepter of a reed: to
make a puppet, or a may-game of him, or with <hi>Herod</hi> pretend to worship,
and mean nothing less: seem devout, forsooth, in all haste, but nourish
profane and murtherous, that is, sinful, careless, or <hi>Atheistical</hi> thoughts
against him.</p>
            <p>They do <hi>best joyn'd: God</hi> hath joyned them, and one <hi>word</hi> hath joyned
them; and when joyned, we best understand them; and soul and body
being so nearly <hi>joyn'd,</hi> why should we go about to <hi>separate</hi> them? The
Prophesies foretel them both, as to be solemnly performed to him: <hi>All
Kings shall fall down before him, all Nations shall do him service,</hi> Psal. lxxii.
11. and <hi>ver. 15. Prayer shall be made ever unto him, and daily shall he be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
The <hi>Gospel,</hi> that assures it was done: and the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>God</hi>
had so ordained it should be, given <hi>him a name, which is above every Name,
that at the Name of Iesus every knee should how, of things in heaven, things in
earth, and things under the earth,</hi> Phil. ii. 9, 10. If all things in heaven and
earth do do it, then spirits and bodies too. For bodies are things, and
spirits are things; and in heaven and under the earth, there be no bodies,
in earth there is both: so there sure to be done by <hi>both.</hi> And this name
had not been <hi>long</hi> given before these wise men come to do it reverence;
before it was given they came not, presently after they come; not <hi>before,</hi>
that they might know <hi>how</hi> to call him they were to worship: yet present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, that we might know it was <hi>in his name only that the Gentiles were
to trust,</hi> at which to <hi>bow and worship.</hi> To worship him, to worship his
Name, or at his Name, is but the same in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or little difference.
Yet if we owe him worship, we owe also a respect unto his Name; we
are not to take it vainly, or count it light, but pay a reverence to it, as
to <hi>his;</hi> for therein also we worship <hi>him.</hi> As we worship his Humanity, as
it is united to his Divinity, so his Name too we may well worship, that
is, reverently esteem and speak of it, and so express it; spiritually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
too at the hearing of it, without fear of <hi>Superstition</hi> or <hi>Idolatry.</hi> We
else but poorly and lamely worship him, <hi>God</hi> knows, if we give no respect
at all to his Name, or any thing that belongs to him. We may as well
be afraid to worship him at all, now since he hath taken on a body, lest we
should commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> to it, being a creature, as to fear <hi>Superstition</hi> in
worshipping at his Name before his foot-stool, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> sometimes
speaks; when the adoration on both hands is only directed to, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in his <hi>Godhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any then, as alas too many be so little <hi>Christians,</hi> as to give to <hi>Iesus,</hi>
or his holy Name, or his holy Altars and Sacraments, no more reverence
than does a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> let not us for <hi>Christs</hi> sake bear them company:
we have better examples here before us; nay, we have <hi>Angels</hi> too before
us at the work. When <hi>he brought his first-begotten into the world, he said, And
let all the Angels of God worship him,</hi> Heb. i. 6. and certainly they do it, they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57113:108"/>
fulfil his command, and do his pleasure. And are we then too holy to do
it? Is it a command upon them, whom the benefit does no way so much
concern; and is it left at our pleasure, who have the most reason in the
world to do it, to whom chiefly this <hi>Christ</hi> was born and given? may
we choose whether we will worship him or no? and yet be the greatest
gainers by it, and the more holy by not doing it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith's</hi> the business they tell us, no matter for any thing besides: only
<hi>believe</hi> and <hi>all</hi> is done. Well, but is Faith the business? and is it not a
strong belief indeed, this, that can bring men out of their own Country,
and that a far one too, through <hi>Arabian</hi> Desarts in the depth of Winter
only to worship? and is it not as high a piece of Faith, notwithstanding
that poor, outward, contemptible, appearance of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet to fall <hi>down
and worship him,</hi> and believe him to be their <hi>God</hi> and Saviour, and to trust
the guidance of a Star, or the word of an obscure Prophesie, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
motion from Heaven, before their own eyes, and all sense, and
reason? To leave his Country, and to believe against hope and reason,
was counted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> xi. was so to these <hi>Wise men</hi> of the
<hi>Text,</hi> will be to all that follow their example. Our Worship is but the
expression of a Faith, <hi>fides facta,</hi> or <hi>fides faciens,</hi> Faith done. We wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
therefore we believe, or, we believe, and therefore worship.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>thirdly, offer too.</hi> Open our treasures, the treasures of our
Faith, and present our gifts: <hi>And when they had opened their Treasures,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> have here observed both <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Mystery;</hi> and I
am no wiser, I shall do so too. The Letter is plain enough to tell us, that
God looks to be worshipped with our <hi>Goods</hi> as well as with our <hi>Bodies,</hi> and
our <hi>Souls;</hi> and that those whom he leads by his <hi>Star</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> any that will
come to <hi>Christ,</hi> must no more come empty handed, than those that come
to <hi>God, Exod.</hi> xiii. For <hi>God</hi> he is, and <hi>God</hi> he gave us them; God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
every person in the <hi>God-head,</hi> to be served with them: the first-fruits
it should be in all reason, and in justice, <hi>all</hi> it might be; but some <hi>part</hi> or
offering out of them howsoever. I shall open the <hi>Wise mens</hi> treasures, and
shew you them, the out-side of them, the <hi>Letter</hi> first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Treasures</hi> they are called before they are <hi>opened,</hi> that we may learn <hi>God</hi>
is not only to be served with mean things and ordinary ware. Nothing
can be too good for him; the treasures of our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the treasures
of our <hi>Cabinets</hi> and <hi>Coffers</hi> are never better opened than for him. <hi>David
would not offer what cost him nought,</hi> and <hi>Araunah</hi> when he does but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>God's</hi> business toward, <hi>gives like a King,</hi> 2 Sam. xxiv. 23. The <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
hard hearted <hi>Israelites,</hi> are yet so tender of <hi>Gods</hi> Service, that
they pluck off their Jewels and golden Ear-rings for the Service of the
<hi>Tabernack.</hi> The first Christian <hi>Emperours</hi> give their stately <hi>Halls</hi> to make
<hi>Churches,</hi> and nothing is thought too costly by pious souls for <hi>God's</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Are the treasures and precious things of the earth for <hi>men</hi> only, and
not for <hi>God?</hi> that were strange indeed, and a bondage and usurpation the
creature indeed might well groan under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gifts</hi> they are stiled when they are presented (2.) to tell us that God
expects <hi>gifts</hi> as well as <hi>dues.</hi> Falling down and worshipping are due upon
command: the second <hi>Commandment,</hi> that forbids it to an <hi>Idol,</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
thence infer it due to <hi>God;</hi> and if we do no more than pay our
dues, what thank have we? <hi>God</hi> loves a <hi>free-will</hi> offering, and expects it
too; unless we can suppose the <hi>Iew</hi> more bound to him than are we: our
selves know how we value a voluntary service above any; and think we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57113:108"/>
that <hi>God</hi> less accepts it? he accepts of the will when there is <hi>nothing</hi> else,
so much he esteems it; and will he not accept it when he sees it pour out
it self with fulness upon him?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrhe</hi> they prove when they are opened;
such best presents as the Country affords, and the best of them: that we
may know there is no Country so barren, no man so poor, but may afford
<hi>something</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> service. Nor the Rocks of the one <hi>Arabia,</hi> nor the Sands
of the other so dry and fruitless, but that they yield some fruit for <hi>Christ.</hi>
They have but little indeed, that have not to offer a <hi>Turtle,</hi> or a <hi>Pigeon;</hi> if
they have no <hi>Gold,</hi> they may have <hi>Francincense</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> no such great
cost: Even the poor Widow hath a Mite or two, something at least to
bestow on <hi>God,</hi> to present him with, that none may plead excuse.</p>
            <p>Yet (4.) as they are such as the Country yields, proportinable to <hi>that;</hi>
so they are, as it falls out, very proportionable for <hi>them</hi> that offer them.
<hi>Gold and perfumes,</hi> fit presents for <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> and persons of Estate
and Honour, to <hi>present,</hi> or be <hi>presented</hi> with; they are things either costly or
delicate: and such is fittest for them to present to <hi>Christ,</hi> to offer up their
golden Crowns, and readily part with all their sweetnesses and delicacies
for his honour and service. <hi>Great men must not give mean presents;</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of them.</p>
            <p>Not mean ones said I? (5.) Not <hi>few</hi> neither: here's three together
for one present at a clap; and three is all: 'Tis the perfectest number,
and intimates all. Of every thing we are to give <hi>God</hi> somewhat; 'tis as
it were a grace to sanctifie the rest: Nor can we methinks promise our
selves a blessing upon any thing we enjoy, till we have first offered it, or of
it, to <hi>God.</hi> Certain it is, I dare assure him, he loses nothing of any thing,
that gives any of it to <hi>God,</hi> but encreaseth best by that diminishing.</p>
            <p>6. Yet proportionable only to our <hi>condition</hi> are we required to offer:
every one cannot offer <hi>Gold.</hi> These <hi>Wise men</hi> therefore, the <hi>Type</hi> of all the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> that were to come in to offer, not only offer like <hi>Kings,</hi> but like
persons of <hi>meaner</hi> condition also; <hi>Frankincense</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> things of a
lower value, that we may know, <hi>God</hi> accepts all, any thing, so we offer
it <hi>willingly. Turtles and Pigeons,</hi> as well as <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Bulls; Mites</hi> as well
as <hi>Talents; Prankincense</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe</hi> as well as <hi>Gold;</hi> the poor mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
as well as the greatest Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>God</hi> as he loves men should keep proportion to their <hi>abilities,</hi> not that
they should be burthened; yet he loves also that they should keep some
proportion to <hi>himself.</hi> We must have regard to <hi>God's</hi> honour, as well as
our own low estate; not offer <hi>lame,</hi> or maim'd, or refuse things. To
<hi>Christ</hi> here Gold comes very fitly to relieve his necessity, his poor Mothers
<hi>Poverty: Frankincense</hi> does well to perfume the <hi>Stable,</hi> and Myrrhe comes
seasonable to strengthen and confirm his <hi>infant</hi> limbs. He gives twice, that
gives in season. No gift so welcome as that which comes in the time of
necessity, when we have most need. Cast we about hence, ever to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
our presents to <hi>God's convenience,</hi> and the <hi>Churches;</hi> to supply it in
want with our Gold and Silver; in contempt, and under the ill scent of
scorn and ill report, to defend it with the sweet incense of Good Works;
in weakness and declining, to uphold it with the myrrhe of our Patience
and Courage.</p>
            <p>8. Do we it <hi>lastly, largely,</hi> with open hearts, and hands, and purses;
open <hi>all</hi> our treasures, spread them all before him, bid him please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
take what he will, <hi>all</hi> if he will, reserve nothing, detain nothing,
no part nor portion from him, as did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> who paid dearly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57113:109"/>
indeed for being so close handed, <hi>Acts</hi> v. but open we all our treasures
to him, keep we nothing from him; knowing this, that he that <hi>soweth
plentifully, shall reap plentifully,</hi> and he <hi>that gives most, shall yet never lack.</hi>
And where he takes it not himself, let us our selves <hi>pick</hi> the <hi>choicest</hi> out of
all; and with these wise and happy souls present them to him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of our <hi>Gold,</hi> our abundance and <hi>superfluities;</hi> somewhat out of
our Frankincense, our <hi>competencies</hi> and conveniencies; somewhat out of
our Myrrhe, our <hi>necessaries</hi> that are to uphold nature: And as Myrrhe does
the dead body, keep it from stinking. Somewhat out of all I say, the
<hi>more</hi> the better; but <hi>some</hi> at least, some of all three. Our goods indeed,
as says the Psalmist, <hi>are nothing unto thee, O God,</hi> nothing unto thee, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of thee, the <hi>chiefest good:</hi> our riches nothing to thine; thou
needest them not neither; yet for all that, give him them we must: for
he needs not our <hi>prayers</hi> neither, our <hi>souls</hi> neither; nothing of <hi>ours</hi> indeed
at all: Yet does he lay his claim to <hi>all,</hi> and require <hi>some</hi> of all. You will
understand better what he requires, if we open the treasures a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
go on to the <hi>Mystery,</hi> what <hi>Antiquity</hi> hath conceived infolded in
the treasury of the <hi>Text;</hi> what is the <hi>mystery</hi> of this three-fold present,
<hi>Gold, Frankincense,</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For why <hi>these</hi> rather than any <hi>other?</hi> or why so specified, being no such
rarities in <hi>Iudea?</hi> somewhat certainly there is in it; a double <hi>mystery,</hi> say
the <hi>Fathers:</hi> an <hi>allegory</hi> and a <hi>moral;</hi> an <hi>allegorical,</hi> and a <hi>moral</hi> sense. The
<hi>Allegory</hi> is to teach us what to think or believe of <hi>Christ.</hi> In offering <hi>Gold</hi>
they acknowledged him for a <hi>King,</hi> and so paid him <hi>Tribute.</hi> In offering
<hi>Frankincense,</hi> or Incense, they confest him to be a God. It is to the <hi>gods</hi>
only that even the <hi>Heathen</hi> offer <hi>Incense.</hi> Yet (3.) In offering <hi>Myrrhe,</hi>
they yet profess he should <hi>die</hi> like men: Myrrhe hath little other use than
in <hi>Sepultures</hi> and <hi>Embalmings.</hi> So the sum of the <hi>Wise mens</hi> Faith, or the
<hi>Magi's</hi> Creed is thus profest, that this Child they thus adored was the
<hi>King, Messiah, God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> who should die for them.</p>
            <p>I shall take leave to expatiate and enlarge their Creed out of the same
<hi>oblations</hi> yet a little further, seeing the <hi>Fathers</hi> have led the way, and
point them out, how they thus doing seem to believe all that is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
of <hi>Christ. First,</hi> his <hi>two</hi> natures, his <hi>God-head</hi> by the <hi>Incense,</hi> his
<hi>Manhood</hi> by the <hi>Myrrhe.</hi> (2.) His <hi>Offices,</hi> his <hi>Kingly</hi> Office by the <hi>Gold,</hi> the
very matter of the <hi>Crown</hi> that makes him King. His <hi>Priestly</hi> Office by
Incense, the <hi>Priests</hi> Office being to <hi>offer</hi> Incense, S. <hi>Luke</hi> i. 9. <hi>Levit.</hi> xvi.
13. His <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office by the <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> representing the bitter and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
life</hi> of a Prophet. (3.) Here's his Birth, his Life, his Death, and
Resurrection all acknowledged. His <hi>Birth</hi> fitly resembled unto <hi>gold,</hi> the
purest metal; his birth the purest without any sin at all, of a Virgin <hi>pure</hi>
as the most refined Gold; his <hi>Life</hi> well represented by the <hi>Incense,</hi> being
nothing but a continual service of <hi>God,</hi> and a perpetual doing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
business. His <hi>Death,</hi> the very manner of it evidently pointed at by
the <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which in his Passion was given him in Wine to drink: the
usual draught of those that died upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> And his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough understood by the same <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> whose chief use is to preserve
the dead body from Corruption, out of an hope of a Resurrection; and
was even litterally done unto him by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who brought a mixture
of <hi>Myrrhe and Aloes to embalm him,</hi> St. John xix. 39.</p>
            <p>So now we see what it is to present <hi>Gold, Francincense,</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe</hi> to
<hi>Christ,</hi> even no less than to believe him to be <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> and
<hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> without stain of sin, living in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57113:109"/>
without blame, and dying for us; yet not seeing Corruption, but
<hi>rising</hi> again to Incorruption. This is the Faith we are to offer up, this
triple Faith. Fear we not any adversaries or calamities, he is our <hi>King</hi> to
protect us; <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 15. Despair we
not though we be grievous sinners; he is our <hi>Priest,</hi> our High-Priest to
offer for us, and reconcile us. Let not even Death affright us; by his
death, Death hath lost its sting: the <hi>Myrrhe</hi> of his embalming will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us, and by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> he will revive and raise us up. Let us
thus think of <hi>Christ,</hi> and trust upon him, and we still offer this same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of <hi>Gold, Frankincense,</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Allegory,</hi> the <hi>Moral</hi> is behind: and in the <hi>moral</hi> sense we
offer Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrhe, who present <hi>God</hi> with those <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
that resemble them.</p>
            <p>First, He offers <hi>Gold,</hi> who patiently and constantly suffers for his Faith,
which is <hi>far more precious,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter,</hi> than <hi>of Gold that perisheth, though
it be tried with the fire,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 7. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> flames are brighter than
Gold, and the constant Faith will endure the fire better than the Gold it
self.</p>
            <p>He (2.) offers <hi>Gold</hi> who sets himself to keep Gods Commandments,
which in the <hi>Psalmists</hi> account, <hi>Psal.</hi> xix. 10. are more <hi>desirable than Gold,
yea, than the finest Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He (3.) offers <hi>Gold</hi> who disperses it abroad, and gives it to the poor;
he that gives <hi>Alms,</hi> properly offers Gold; to the poor indeed he gives it,
but to <hi>God</hi> it is he offers it: an offering of a sweet savour to him.</p>
            <p>2. He offers <hi>Frankincense</hi> who offers <hi>Prayers,</hi> whose Prayers ascend like
Incense: 'Tis holy <hi>David's</hi> expression, <hi>Prayers set forth as Incense,</hi> Psal.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xli. 2. no Incense so sweet, so acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> as the devout Prayers
of his servants.</p>
            <p>He (2.) presents <hi>Incense</hi> whose hope is only in the <hi>Lord his God,</hi> whose
desires and hopes are always ascending upward.</p>
            <p>He (3.) presents <hi>Incense</hi> who presents humility and obedience: the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Frankincense</hi> is binding and restringent, well imitated by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and humility; the best binders and restrainers of our wills and
passions.</p>
            <p>3. And lastly, he offers <hi>Myrrhe</hi> who mortifies his affections, which
are upon the earth. <hi>Myrrhe is a mortifier.</hi> One quality of Myrrhe is to
kill <hi>Worms;</hi> he that kills these worms of our inordinate desires, that come
crawling on us, those covetous desires that lie gnawing us; those wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
motions of any lusts that are ever tickling, disturbing us, he offers
<hi>Myrrhe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He presents <hi>Myrrhe</hi> that presents his body chaste and pure. <hi>Iudith</hi>
that chaste Matron is said to wash her body and <hi>anoint it with Myrrhe,</hi>
Judith 10. as it were a preservative against lust, and the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> so fair, so pure, so undefiled, is much delighted with <hi>bundles of
Myrrhe;</hi> her very hands <hi>drop sweet smelling Myrrhe.</hi> It is so great an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
against all impurity and corruption.</p>
            <p>3. He presents <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> who though he hath not perhaps altogether
kept his body pure, or his affections in order, yet begins now at last to
take his <hi>Wine a little mingled with Myrrhe,</hi> that takes of the bitter potion
of repentance, who in the bitterness of his soul repents him of his sins.</p>
            <p>You know now how you may still offer <hi>Gold, Frankincense,</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe,</hi>
a <hi>constant Faith,</hi> a <hi>regular Life;</hi> Charity and Alms is as good as <hi>Gold,</hi> devout
<hi>Prayer,</hi> a lively <hi>Hope,</hi> an humble <hi>Obedience</hi> will pass for <hi>Incense,</hi> a chaste <hi>body,</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:57113:110"/>
mortified <hi>affections,</hi> and true <hi>repentance</hi> will be accepted instead of <hi>Myrrhe.</hi>
See we to it then, that we have them always ready to present to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there is one <hi>mystery</hi> more to be observed, when they <hi>had opened their
treasures,</hi> says the <hi>Text,</hi> and it says it that we may know, we are to <hi>open</hi>
our treasures as well as <hi>offer</hi> them. Now to open them before him, is, as it
were to say, take what he will, we are content. A voluntary resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our selves and all that is ours to his choice, order, and disposing,
to deny and renounce our selves, and all that is ours; our own <hi>desires,</hi>
our <hi>goods,</hi> our <hi>good deeds,</hi> our <hi>merits:</hi> or to leave all to follow him, if he so
will have it, is the most perfect of all our offerings, and the perfection of
them all. It is both the beginning and end of <hi>Christianity;</hi> so we begin
our Christianity with the same resignedness, we must continue it to the
end.</p>
            <p>And we may yet observe <hi>how</hi> to offer here as well as <hi>what</hi> to offer. Open
we our treasures first, do it <hi>freely,</hi> that we do, <hi>all</hi> our treasures. (2.) Do
it <hi>plentifully,</hi> and <hi>largely, Dorcas-like,</hi> full of good works, and alms-deeds:
let our good works and graces glitter like the refined Gold. (3.) Do them
<hi>pure</hi> and <hi>sincerely.</hi> (4.) That they may ascend like <hi>Incense,</hi> do them <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously</hi>
and <hi>devoutly.</hi> (5.) Let them be wrapt up in Myrrhe, to keep them
from <hi>corouption.</hi> (6.) Let them all be like sweet smelling Myrrhe of good
<hi>odour</hi> and <hi>report.</hi> (7.) Let them also be imbittered with Myrrhe, with the
bitter tears of repentance, that we have presented <hi>God</hi> so little good,
and the tears of sorrow that we can present no <hi>better.</hi> (8.) Let them be
done in <hi>order,</hi> our incense in the middle, our prayers wing'd on the one
hand with the golden wing of <hi>Faith,</hi> on the other with purity <hi>white</hi> (as
is says <hi>Pliny</hi>) the purest <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> a faithful heart, and pure hands, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
on the one side with Alms, on the other with Mortification and
Fasting: First believe, then pray, then practise. First believe <hi>Christs</hi>
word and promises, then pray for his assistance, then practise his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And <hi>lastly</hi> all our doings, all our offerings must be presented by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down, with humility, and prayer. So we began the Sermon, and so
we end it.</p>
            <p>So will he who accepted the <hi>Wise men</hi> and their <hi>gifts</hi> accept us and ours,
and for our gifts give us better; for our earthly, heavenly treasures; for
our <hi>Gold</hi> the Crown of Glory; for the incense of our prayers that we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
here, the honour to offer there, the holy odours of eternal praises;
for our bitter Myrrhe we suffer here, the full sweetness of all pleasure
there; and for our falling down shall one day raise us up again to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
glory, to worship him that sits upon the Throne, and the Lamb
for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

St. Paul's Day:
Preached at St. Pauls.</head>

               <bibl>NEHEM. xiii. 14.</bibl>
               <q>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the Offices
thereof.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd even to remember our selves concerning <hi>this,</hi> of the
good deeds done to <hi>this</hi> House of <hi>God,</hi> and to the
Offices thereof have I chose the <hi>Text</hi> to day.</p>
            <p>A day, by all probable conjectures from the ancient
great <hi>solemnity</hi> we find upon it, the Feast of the <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of this reverend and aged Pile, either at the
first or second building of it, when it was first presented
to God to be remembred by him. A Day <hi>here</hi> observed, not only in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Conversion, but of the Conversion also of this place
(now St. <hi>Pauls</hi>) either at the first from the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> to the
House of <hi>God;</hi> or of this <hi>Part</hi> of it wherein we are, some hundred of years
after from common use, and the renewing of the rest of it out of ashes to
the vast proportion it now carries.</p>
            <p>And it falling out this Year to be a <hi>Day</hi> crown'd with so honourable an
Assembly, I hope it may fall out happily to remember you of some kind
offices, some <hi>good deeds</hi> to it. Now after a <hi>third</hi> Conversion of it from a
Stable, a Magazine, a Market, a Meeting place of Schism and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
to a <hi>Church</hi> again, and the <hi>Holy</hi> Offices in their beauty, to set to
your pious hands to help it out of dust and rubbish, and raise it up to its
first lustre and glory.</p>
            <p>But if the day should have no such reflection, no day could be amiss
to remember either our selves, or you, of such good works as <hi>God</hi> here is
not only content to be remembred of, but pleased to remember, puts
here upon record too, that <hi>we</hi> also may remember them; Remember
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57113:111"/>
what good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and other pious souls have done in their several
times to the House of <hi>God,</hi> and forget not our selves to do the
like.</p>
            <p>We have a command from St. <hi>Paul</hi> (whose day it is) to <hi>charge</hi> them
that are rich to do so, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 18. to be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> are
these. We have a good warrant for it <hi>hence;</hi> We have a good Pattern
<hi>here,</hi> and the works put, all, as it were, upon <hi>Gods</hi> score to pay for
<hi>Thrice</hi> it is so in the Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and 31. as well as in the <hi>Text;</hi> as
if <hi>God</hi> were little less than bound to recompence and reward them. And
he <hi>will,</hi> if we carry not our selves too high upon them; if we do them
with sincerity, and reflect upon them with humility. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> does
so. For how good soever the <hi>works</hi> were, the <hi>words</hi> are but a modest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of them to <hi>God</hi> when they were done, with an humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to Him to accept them. An excellent Precedent to Us, <hi>what</hi> to do
in the Case, and <hi>how</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>That we may the better understand <hi>his,</hi> and do our <hi>own,</hi> we make the
<hi>Text</hi> into two <hi>generals.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Nehemiahs good deeds done to the House of God. <hi>And,</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. His Petition to him to remember and accept both him and them, and not
blot out either himself or them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Or to be more distinct, we shall draw those Generals into these Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
and consider,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. What it was that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did to the House of <hi>God,</hi> and to the
Offices, that he would have remembred; the <hi>good deeds that he
did.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. That such things done to the House of <hi>God,</hi> or to the Offices,
though but <hi>Ceremoniis,</hi> are <hi>good</hi> deeds; good indeed, and so to be
reputed and remembred.</item>
               <item>III. That as good as they are, <hi>such</hi> (yet) they are as <hi>God</hi> may in rigour
of justice wipe out, and not remember; such as we had need still,
with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> pray him not to wipe out, but remember.</item>
               <item>IV. That, yet notwithstanding, they are such <hi>too,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> may, and
will be, easily entreated to remember, and not wipe out; That he,
God, <hi>does</hi> remember them, and sets them here upon <hi>Record</hi> for such.</item>
               <item>V. And not only remember <hi>them,</hi> but the person also for them; <hi>Him</hi>
that does them, <hi>Remember Me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>VI. But then (6.) <hi>This</hi> must be remembred too, <hi>why</hi> they stand here;
that this <hi>Scripture,</hi> as well as others, was written for out learning,
to <hi>remember</hi> us, that (1.) <hi>still</hi> such a House there is, a House of <hi>God,</hi>
with many Offices belonging to it, and good still to be done to It
and <hi>Them.</hi> That (2.) <hi>good</hi> it is to do so still. That (3.) <hi>God</hi> even
now also will remember such good deeds; and <hi>such</hi> also (4.) as
shall do them. Would have us (5.) do so too. Would have us
(6.) <hi>remember</hi> sometimes our selves to do them. But be sure (lastly)
when they are done, to beg of him not to touch too hard upon them,
lest he wipe them out. <hi>Remember,</hi> &amp;c. you have both the <hi>Sum,</hi> and
the Particulars of the <hi>Text.</hi> I go on with the <hi>First</hi> of them, What
it was that was here done to the House of God; and there, first,
shew you the <hi>Person,</hi> then his <hi>good deeds.</hi>

            <p>I. For the <hi>Person;</hi> our Book tells us it was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> but the <hi>Text</hi> has
only a plain <hi>Me</hi> to decipher him. That's enough too, so <hi>God</hi> but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
him. For <hi>God</hi> is not taken with our titles. The <hi>less</hi> we make of our
selves, the <hi>more</hi> always he makes of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:57113:111"/>Indeed, there is not much said any where of his <hi>Genealogy,</hi> and no
where so much what he <hi>was,</hi> as what he <hi>did.</hi> The best reckoning Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
is that of <hi>Noahs,</hi> Gen. vi. 9. <hi>These are the Generations of Noah; Noah
was a just man, and perfect in his Generations, and Noah walked with God.</hi> This
shall be <hi>Nehemiahs. Nehemiah</hi> was a good man, pious in his Generations,
and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did good to the House of God. He's of the noblest House
who is thus near allied to the House of <hi>God;</hi> that thus comes closest to
it.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was no mean man, neither Cup-bearer to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> Chap. i. 11. the <hi>Tirshatha,</hi> Chap. viii. 9. or <hi>Governour of
Iudea,</hi> Chap. v. 14. had honour and eminence enough; but stands upon
record <hi>most</hi> for his Piety. <hi>That</hi> out-vies all Names of Honour. The
Repairer of <hi>Gods</hi> House a better Title to be remembred by in <hi>Gods</hi> Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of <hi>Nobility,</hi> and in the Court of <hi>Heaven;</hi> than the greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<hi>Cup-bearer,</hi> or the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> nay, of <hi>Emperour</hi> of East and
West.</p>
            <p>This only by the <hi>way,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> forgets himself, and <hi>God</hi> will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him, who thinks his Honour and greatness exempt him from
the service of <hi>Gods</hi> House, or values any beyond it. <hi>King David</hi> himself
had rather be a <hi>door-keeper</hi> there, than dwell any where else; <hi>One day there
better,</hi> says he, <hi>than a thousand,</hi> Psal. lxxxiv. 9, 10. And one poor <hi>Me</hi> is
worth as many <hi>Worships</hi> and <hi>Honours;</hi> that single Syllable, of as few Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as you can make it, with a few good deeds to back it, better than all
glorious Titles without them.</p>
            <p>But enough of so small a Particle. Enough too here of the Person
considered in himself, because I shall speak of him all the way in his
<hi>good deeds.</hi> To which now I pass, and enquire (1.) What he did to the
House of <hi>God;</hi> and then (2.) What to the <hi>Offices</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>And the several readings give us them under <hi>two</hi> Heads: <hi>Misericordias</hi>
and <hi>Beneficentiam.</hi> His Mercy and his Bounty to them both; both House
and Offices.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Mercy</hi> to the House, that I begin with; and <hi>that</hi> take in these
particulars: In his <hi>Compassion</hi> towards it, his <hi>Petitioning</hi> for it, his <hi>Repairing,</hi>
his <hi>Cleansing,</hi> his <hi>Protecting</hi> it. Give me leave to trace the <hi>Story,</hi> as 'tis
fit I should, and I shall shew you them in some or other of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chapters</hi> as they rise.</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>Compassion</hi> towards it, <hi>that</hi> we may easily see in his sitting down
and weeping over the ruines, in his fasting and sadly praying for it,
<hi>Chap.</hi> i. 4. For 'tis not <hi>Hierusalem</hi> only, or principally either, (though
first mentioned) for which he does so, but <hi>Sion,</hi> the place that <hi>God</hi> had
chosen to put his Name there, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. For <hi>that</hi> it is; because of the <hi>House</hi>
of the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God</hi> that he thus seeks, O <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to do thee good.
<hi>David</hi> plainly professes so for himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxii. 9. And for <hi>Sion, Thy
servants,</hi> says he, <hi>they think upon her stones, and it pittieth them to see her in
the dust,</hi> Psal. cii. 14. All good men still it does as much, they more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the ruines of <hi>God's</hi> houses than of their own. Alas! <hi>Hierusalem</hi> is
but a sad dwelling without <hi>Sion,</hi> no more than any other City, any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Heathen</hi> City; not the City of the great <hi>King,</hi> or a sure refuge
without that. Even a Fox as <hi>Tobiah</hi> the <hi>Ammonite</hi> jeer'd it, <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. 3. if he
go up shall break down the wall, if the wall of the <hi>House</hi> be not joyn'd to
it, and built with it. 'Tis for this principally <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mourn's, and
maks as it were a <hi>Cement</hi> for it out of the rubbish by the mixture of his
tears. 'Tis a <hi>Tender mercy;</hi> that <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:57113:112"/>2. But he does not meerly and dully sit down and weep, end the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>there;</hi> Up he gets (2.) and to the <hi>King</hi> he goes, and petitions him
for a <hi>Commission</hi> to repair it, <hi>Chap.</hi> ii. 7. Begs of him some supplies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
towards it. <hi>Good</hi> it is to do good to the House our <hi>selves,</hi> but 'tis
doubled when we can work <hi>others</hi> to it too; when we promote it with
our friends, and put our selves, as it were, to the blush to beg for it.
'Tis yet a mercy we need not blush <hi>at,</hi> a holy impudence in doing good;
a very serviceable mercy, a mercy not ashamed of any thing to do good
to <hi>Gods</hi> house, or any thing that is his. That's a <hi>second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. These yet are but the <hi>Proems</hi> of his mercy. He, <hi>thirdly,</hi> sets closely
to the work: provides necessaries and materials for the <hi>House,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
the repairs, completes the unfinished <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Turrets,</hi> not of the
City only, but the <hi>Temple</hi> too, where ere they wanted, <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. It had
been begun to be re-edified by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Ezra vi. Where, by the way,
take notice they <hi>began</hi> their building with <hi>Gods</hi> House then; yet it seems
it was not fully finished. Great <hi>works</hi> are not the business of a <hi>little</hi> time,
not of days, but years. (Above forty years in building was <hi>this</hi> House
wherein we are.) Nor are such <hi>Houses</hi> at any time so perfect at the last, but
that a religious hand will easily find somewhat or other always to be
added to their beauty and glory. And <hi>this</hi> is a point of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> mercy
too; A mercy that thinks no pains too much, no time too long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
doing good to the House of God: a <hi>laborious</hi> and <hi>continued mercy.</hi>
That's the <hi>third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Nay, sometimes it seems (and <hi>we have found it by our own experience</hi>)
that the <hi>House</hi> is not fully finished, yer it is afresh polluted. <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
(4.) is fain to cleanse it. <hi>Tobiah,</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> his houshold-stuff was
gotten into the House, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. 5. The <hi>High Priest,</hi> his Allie, had brought
it thither. When the <hi>Priest</hi> himself profanes the House, lets the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>
come in, or suffers it, <hi>God</hi> help us. God help us indeed to some good
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> to throw out that stuff, as you may see ours does, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. 9. A
cleansing, purifying mercy the House needs sometimes, needed it we
remember too long. Such is <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> too. A <hi>clean, pure mercy.</hi> That's the
<hi>fourth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And yet the <hi>Ammonite</hi> is not so easily cast out. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> must
stand to what he has done, and still protect it, or <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah,</hi> and
<hi>Geshem,</hi> the <hi>Horonite,</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> and the <hi>Arabian,</hi> all Sects, Schism,
Atheism, and Prophaneness will in again. If the <hi>Princes</hi> Authority, and
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> Sword do not protect, as well as recover it from unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
hands and Offices; 1. From corrupt <hi>Priests,</hi> such as <hi>Eliashib,</hi> ver. 7.
2. From false ones, such as cannot prove their <hi>succession,</hi> Chap. vii. 64.
3. From such as pollute it with <hi>strange marriages,</hi> as one of the Sons of
<hi>Ioiada,</hi> ver. 28. strange mixtures, (suppose the waters of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> the
<hi>Frith,</hi> or the <hi>Leman Lake</hi> with the <hi>Springs</hi> of <hi>Sion.</hi>) 4. From strange <hi>Levites</hi>
too, so strange that we know not whence they came, nor what their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree;
even in those mercies of the most <hi>Highest,</hi> which he hath lately
shewed us, contrary to the <hi>Psalm,</hi> we shall all miscarry. 'Tis the highest
Commendation of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> mercies, that he does not forsake the
House, but strill protects it both from open enemies, and from treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
friends; the one, by his <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Spear,</hi> Chap. iv. 16. the other, by
the restoring <hi>good order</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> Chap. xii. 24. And this is a <hi>couragious</hi>
and <hi>constant mercy;</hi> The <hi>Fifth</hi> Commendation of <hi>Nehemiahs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you have his Mercies to the <hi>House</hi> it self, His <hi>compassion</hi> on
the <hi>Ruines,</hi> his <hi>soliciting</hi> the <hi>Repairs,</hi> his setting <hi>himself</hi> upon the <hi>work,</hi> his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57113:112"/>
               <hi>delivering</hi> the house from <hi>prophanation,</hi> his <hi>protecting</hi> it from the <hi>prophaners;</hi>
1. a tender, 2. active, 3. laborious, 4. pure, 5. constant goodness to the
House of <hi>God.</hi> These are the first branches of those <hi>Mercies</hi> which <hi>God</hi>
here commends to us, to be shewn by his to his <hi>House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> sort are those to the <hi>Offices.</hi> And <hi>Misericordias in Custodiis, in
Observantiis, in Ceremoniis,</hi> the several translations of the words again
shall serve to head them. <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> good deeds, First, To the <hi>Officers;</hi>
Secondly, To the <hi>Offices;</hi> Thirdly, To the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the House; these
<hi>three</hi> shall be the Heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Misericordias in Custodiis,</hi> taking the <hi>Abstract</hi> for the <hi>Concrete,</hi> His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to the <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Keepers</hi> of the House, those who are set to watch
and keep it, them we take the first. And indeed the Officers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<hi>they</hi> had need of <hi>them</hi> first and last; need all the mercies that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
or any of you can shew them. For not only, unless the <hi>Lord keep
the House,</hi> but unless <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> do so too, (you the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Iudges,</hi> you the <hi>renowned Governours</hi> of the <hi>City</hi>) the Watchmen,
the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> will all labour but in vain. <hi>Tobiah,</hi> by his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and alliance, <hi>Sanballat,</hi> by his subtilty and pretences, <hi>Geshem,</hi> by
his wealth and power, will down with the Walls ere they be well dry,
and out with the <hi>Officers</hi> ere they are warm in their work and business.
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> therefore, like a stout <hi>Governour,</hi> sticks to them against those
enemies of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> of peace and order, whether open or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
ones; The first of them, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. the other here, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Against
all that have ill will at <hi>Sion,</hi> that envy the prosperity of the House of <hi>God,</hi>
he stands to them and protects them.</p>
            <p>He, <hi>Secondly,</hi> disposes and settles them in their proper places, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.
of this Chapter, descends to take care even of the <hi>Singers,</hi> and <hi>Porters,</hi> or
<hi>Vergers</hi> of the house, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 45.</p>
            <p>He calls home, <hi>thirdly,</hi> the poor <hi>Levite,</hi> who had been forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the house for want of maintenance, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 11. delivers him from
the oppression of such whose policy it was then, and we know is still, to
starve the Levite or Minister out of the House, that so they may either
have no Minister at all, and so scandalize the <hi>Government;</hi> or none but
such as will say and do what they would have them, and so <hi>preach</hi> it down
again.</p>
            <p>He, <hi>fourthly,</hi> restores them all to their <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>dues,</hi> establishes them
to them too by a Law for time to come, <hi>Chap.</hi> x. 32. and so on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> For <hi>their</hi> better maintenance, and the readier performance of
of the holy Office, he commands the holy things and Vessels, <hi>meat-Offerings</hi>
and <hi>Oblations,</hi> to their proper Chambers, <hi>in custodias,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in their several Wards, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. 9. And these in brief are <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs
Misericordiae in Costodiis,</hi> his good deeds to the <hi>Officers</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> of
the House of <hi>God:</hi> He <hi>defends</hi> them against their Enemies; He <hi>confirms</hi>
them in their Places; He <hi>delivers</hi> them from their Oppressors; He <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes</hi>
them in their Rights; He <hi>Orders</hi> all things to their best conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Mercies never to be forgotten; and I would <hi>our</hi> Age would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them.</p>
            <p>2. Yet not <hi>them</hi> only, but <hi>these</hi> that follow too. And <hi>Misericordias in
Observantiis</hi> are the next. His Mercies to the <hi>Offices</hi> themselves. Trace we
him, as we did before, and we shall find him (1.) restoring the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the solemn <hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>Feasts</hi> in their due seasons, <hi>Chap.</hi> viii. 9, 10, 14.
Vindicating (2.) the <hi>Sabbath</hi> from prophanation, <hi>Chap.</hi> xx. 19. Making
them (3.) a solemn <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> Chap. ix. 5. Setling (4.) solemn
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57113:113"/>
               <hi>Musick, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Anthems</hi> of thanksgivings, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 27. Setting up
(5.) the publick reading and teaching of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> Chap. viii. 1. and
ix. 3. Re-establishing (6.) the whole <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> Publick Worship and
Service according to the commandment of <hi>David,</hi> the man of God,
<hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 24. according to the ancient form and fashion.</p>
            <p>3. Follow we him a little further, and you will see him (3.) at <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordias
in Ceremoniis</hi> too, how he behaved himself in the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> what
good then. And if you consider how <hi>reverently</hi> his people demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at holy work; how devoutly they all <hi>stand</hi> up at the <hi>reading</hi> of the
Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> viii. 5. how unanimously they answer <hi>Amen</hi> at the Prayers and
Blessing; how they <hi>lift</hi> up their hands, and <hi>bow</hi> their heads, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the <hi>Lord</hi> with their faces to the ground, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. how content they are
to be bound to the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Iudgments</hi> as well as the <hi>Commandments</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Ceremonials,</hi> and <hi>Iudicials,</hi> (for so the words Statutes
and Judgments do import) as well as to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and how he
solemnly binds them to it by an oath, <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 29. You cannot but say
he has wrought a good work indeed upon them, and by this <hi>Mercy</hi> kept
them from <hi>disorder</hi> and <hi>confusion. Mercy</hi> I say, for there is none greater
than to preserve the Sheep within the Fold, than to keep all in peace and
order, and oblige men by Laws and <hi>Oaths</hi> to do their duties, to attend
the holy Offices diligently in a comely <hi>uniformity,</hi> who otherwise would
some of them never think of it, and others, under pretence of Christian
<hi>Liberty,</hi> run every day into all unchristian licentiousness and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and wander up and down in eternal errors, and perish in them. And
sure, to save them, though against their wills, is a mercy they need not
quarrel with.</p>
            <p>These now are the several <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to the House of <hi>God,</hi> and
to the <hi>Offices</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>You will understand them better by his <hi>Bounty. Misericordias</hi> fuller by
<hi>Beneficentiam,</hi> which is the second sort of his good deeds.</p>
            <p>And the first kind of his Bounty is his own and his servants labour
<hi>freely</hi> bestowed upon the Work. (For 'tis no matter now whether we
divide or joyn the <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Offices.</hi>) In effect it is no less than the <hi>whole</hi>
Revenues of his Command and Government; whilst refusing the Pay of
the <hi>Governour,</hi> Cha. v. 15, 18. he suffered it so to run on towards the repairs.
It seems he was resolved not to enrich himself (however) by the <hi>Church,</hi>
but (as the Phrase is) rather lay out himself upon it.</p>
            <p>The second Expression of it is, the free entertainment of one hundred
and fifty of those that laboured in the Work at his own Table, at his
<hi>own</hi> charges, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of that cited Chapter. He would neither grow
rich upon the <hi>Churches</hi> charge, or spare his own to enrich, or at least reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>that</hi> to its former greatness.</p>
            <p>The third Manifestation of his <hi>Bounty</hi> is his voluntary gift of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Drachmes</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> to the <hi>Treasury of the House,</hi> Chap. vii. 70. a kind of
springing stream of supplies unto it.</p>
            <p>Add now the fifty Basins (and Gold or Silver they must be) the <hi>five
hundred</hi> and <hi>fifty Priests Garments,</hi> (and they were no little cost, as the
<hi>Priests</hi> Garments then were made, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxviii. 40. for beauty, all, and
glory) the charging himself, besides, and all the people, with a yearly
Tax, or Publick Revenue for the repair and service of the <hi>House,</hi> and you
will confess it a bounty beyond expression.</p>
            <p>Especially, if you consider not only <hi>that</hi> and <hi>what,</hi> but <hi>when</hi> and
<hi>how,</hi> as the Story will inform you, you will say <hi>Misericordias</hi> and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57113:113"/>
               <hi>Beneficentiam</hi> are lean and meagre words to tell you what he did.</p>
            <p>For to undertake this business when <hi>all</hi> others had given it over, and
left it in the <hi>rubbish,</hi> Chap. i. 2. when their <hi>enemies</hi> without the Walls
eagerly opposed, and as scornfully derided it; and false <hi>friends</hi> within
as subtilly undermined it, <hi>Chap.</hi> vi. 17. when some of their <hi>Nobles</hi> disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
drew back for fear or interest, <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 5. <hi>then</hi> in a time so <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi>
so <hi>dangerous,</hi> so <hi>troublesome;</hi> then so vigilantly, so couragiously, so
industriously to pursue it, as not so much as shift themselves, from weeks
end to weeks end, till all was finished, <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. 23. to be so bountiful to
it, too, in a time of <hi>dearth</hi> and <hi>scarcity,</hi> as it seems it was, <hi>Chap.</hi> v. 3. when
they had scarce money to buy <hi>bread</hi> for themselves and families, then to
draw both great and small, the chief <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>meanest people</hi> to
great Contributions to it, <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. 71. is so many good deeds together,
and so good together, that 'tis nor <hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Hebrew,</hi> nor <hi>Latine,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Original, nor Translation can express the goodness. I am sure I have all
this while but injured it.</p>
            <p>And if we <hi>sum</hi> up all his <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Bounties,</hi> all together; his <hi>Tears</hi> and
<hi>Prayers</hi> over the desolations, and ruines of <hi>Gods</hi> House; his <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi>
for the repairs; his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> in the Work it self; his <hi>Zeal</hi>
and <hi>Courage</hi> in the cleansing and protecting it; his <hi>Friendship</hi> and <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to the Officers and Ministers; his <hi>Iustice</hi> to settle them in their
Office; his <hi>Mercy</hi> to deliver them from such as would disturb them in it;
his <hi>establishing</hi> them in their <hi>Rights,</hi> and his studying all <hi>Conveniences</hi> for
the holy <hi>Office;</hi> his restoring the <hi>whole</hi> Service of the Church for <hi>days,</hi> for
<hi>Forms,</hi> for <hi>State,</hi> for <hi>Beauty,</hi> for <hi>Order,</hi> for <hi>all Solemnity.</hi> Methinks I might
spare you the trouble of the next <hi>Particular</hi> I am to give you, to prove
them <hi>good.</hi> Yet, because there are some that are not willing to believe it,
I must do it.</p>
            <p>If we would yet but believe the very <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> we should need
go no further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Misericordias</hi> the <hi>Text</hi> calls them, <hi>Mercies;</hi> and Acts of mercy are <hi>good</hi>
sure. We say so when we want it, and call it a doing us good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beneficentiam,</hi> (2.) Bounty it styles them too, and <hi>that</hi>'s good; <hi>Bonum
benè,</hi> good well done; so is <hi>benefacere;</hi> makes him so good that does
them, that one would even die to do <hi>him</hi> good again; for a <hi>good</hi> man,
that is, for a merciful, bountiful man some would even dare to die,
<hi>Rom.</hi> v. 7.</p>
            <p>If (3.) you examine the <hi>Object</hi> of these actions, <hi>that</hi>'s good, for 'tis
<hi>God.</hi> That which is done to his House, is done to him: for if the robbing
<hi>It</hi> be robbing <hi>Him,</hi> as he tells us 'tis, <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 8. the doing good to <hi>it</hi> must
then be the doing good to <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you (4.) enquire the <hi>intention, that</hi>'s good too. 'Tis in <hi>Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis</hi>
and <hi>Ceremoniis,</hi> for <hi>Gods Service</hi> all; that he may neither <hi>dwell</hi> slovenly,
nor be <hi>served</hi> so.</p>
            <p>Will you have (5.) a point of <hi>faith</hi> to sanctifie it further? Why, <hi>Deus
meus,</hi> is the very cloze of faith; the believing God to be <hi>his</hi> God, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reason <hi>he</hi> is so good to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>His.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To put all out of question. Deeds of this nature <hi>God</hi> himself styles
<hi>good. David</hi> had it but in his heart to build <hi>God</hi> a House, and <hi>God</hi> sends the
<hi>Prophet</hi> purposely to tell him, he did well to <hi>think</hi> on't; <hi>Forasmuch as it was
in thy heart to build a House to my Name thou didst well,</hi> 2 Chron. vi. 8. Our
<hi>blessed Saviour</hi> himself says as much in the case, of <hi>Maries</hi> anointing him,
(<hi>a work which all the Fathers reckon of the same sort with these we speak of) she
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57113:114"/>
had wrought a good work,</hi> St. <hi>Mar.</hi> xiv. 6. Indeed, <hi>Iudas,</hi> and some that he
had seduced, with a pretence that it might have been bestow'd much
better, <hi>they disdained at it,</hi> ver. 4. and thought it waste; but remember,
I pray, that 'twas but <hi>Iudas</hi> thought so, and some few that he had <hi>abused;
Christ</hi> says, the doing good to the poor (which was the pretence against
it) might stay a while, and must <hi>give way to it,</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Charity</hi> must give
way to <hi>Piety;</hi> Charity to <hi>them,</hi> veil to Piety towards him. Nay, so far
is is from a waste that is so spent, that <hi>Christ</hi> seems to justifie the very
wasting our selves upon it, whilst he so highly commends the poor Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
that had cast into the <hi>Treasury</hi> of his house all that she had, even
<hi>all her living,</hi> St. <hi>Mar.</hi> xii. 44. Indeed, it was but two Mites in all, yet
<hi>that</hi> he accepts; the least that is done to him: but 'twas <hi>all</hi> she had, and
that it was which made him prefer it above the richest gifts and presents
that were cast in by all the rest. After all this I must tell you, he affects
these works so well, (<hi>and then they must needs be good</hi>) and loves the House
so much, that he sets us a pattern of some of them himself; he will not
suffer any <hi>Vessel</hi> to be carried thorow it, St. <hi>Mar.</hi> xi. 16. and in indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whips the buyers and sellers out of the very <hi>out-parts</hi> of it, St. <hi>Luk.</hi>
xix. 45. <hi>Twice</hi> he did so: First, after he came up from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
ii. 15. And again when he went up from <hi>Bethphage</hi> and the <hi>Mount</hi> of
<hi>Olives,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxi. 12. Nay, and he cast out all their Seats, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,
and Moneys; would not suffer the least marks of prophane
or common use be left upon it. I wish we would learn to be so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
in the point, for now you see no reason to scruple their being
good.</p>
            <p>III. Yet good though they be, they thirdly stand in need of <hi>Gods</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to remember them, as great mercies as we have shewn them, they
yet want his <hi>mercy</hi> to expound them, a <hi>Secundum multitudinem miserationum
tuarum,</hi> and a <hi>magnitudine bonitatis,</hi> as 'tis expresly, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. a verse paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to this, to construe and accept them. Our works are not so perfect
but they require it. <hi>Verebar omnia opera mea,</hi> says holy <hi>Iob</hi> viii. 28. He was
afraid of the best of them. Nay, though he were <hi>righteous,</hi> he would not
<hi>answer God,</hi> ver. 15. nor pretend to answer for them. No more will holy
<hi>David, I have walked innocently,</hi> O Lord, says he indeed, but yet be <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to me</hi> for all that; <hi>both</hi> in the same verse, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxvi. 11. <hi>That</hi> must be
the <hi>Plea</hi> when all is done. And he that here cries out, wipe them not
out O Lord, or remember me concerning them; and <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Spare me
O <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nive super me,</hi> wink at me a little; and <hi>ver.</hi> 33. Remember
them for good, intimates plainly enough, they are not so good but they
may do well to be wink'd at, may <hi>want</hi> a pardom, or fear <hi>cancelling,</hi> or be
as well forgotten, or be remembred for evil as well as good.</p>
            <p>Yet good notwithstanding we will allow them. But by <hi>Gods</hi> grace it
is they are so: Good but by the Covenant of the Gospel, not the rigour
of the Law. Good by an Evangelical <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Gods</hi> favourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and acceptance, not by the strictness of worth and merit. Good,
but overpoised with many bad ones. <hi>Davids Delicta sua quis,</hi> &amp;c. Who
knows how oft he offends? Enough to remember us, we may offend when
we think we are doing good; may do best therefore, and shall do safest,
not too much to remember them <hi>our selves,</hi> but leave <hi>God</hi> in his goodness to
remember them.</p>
            <p>IV. And <hi>that</hi> we may do, without any presumption, put <hi>God</hi> in mind
of them now and then. 'Tis my <hi>Fourth</hi> Particular plain in the <hi>Text.</hi> And
plain too it is, <hi>other</hi> good men have done so as well as <hi>Nehemiah, Hezeki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

does so, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xx. 3. <hi>I beseech thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord, remember how I have walked
before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good
in thy sight.</hi> Some of it was good deeds to <hi>this</hi> House we speak of. Holy
<hi>David</hi> particularizes <hi>his, Psal</hi> cxxxii. 1, 2, and so on. Lord (says he) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>David:</hi> Why! What of him? Why! <hi>How he sware unto thee, O
Lord, and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Iacob.</hi> Well, What was that?
Why, That <hi>he would not come within the Tabernacle of is house, nor climbe up
into his bed, he would not suffer his eyes to sleep, nor his eye-lids to slumber, nor
the Temples of his head to take any rest, till he had found out a place for the Temple
of the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Iacob.</hi> This he prays there
that God would remember <hi>him and</hi> all his troubles for it, how he was
troubled till he had found it. Him <hi>in</hi> all his troubles, too, whensoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he should come in any to deliver him out of all, because of the good he
had vowed and intended to the <hi>House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. But is it only a <hi>Prayer</hi> that God <hi>would</hi> remember, Is it not a <hi>Record</hi>
too (5.) that he <hi>does?</hi> He truly does; you see it here upon Record he
does, in the books of his eternal Remembrance. It is here remembred
in every Chapter. Your memories cannot be so short but they can tell
you it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gospel</hi> will tell you it too, tell you <hi>God</hi> remembers all such deeds
as these. <hi>Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preacht</hi> (and it shall be as long as
there is any preaching) <hi>there also that which this woman has done shall be told
for a memorial of her.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 13. Told, and told again;
every body shall speak of it; and it shall never shall be forgotten. The
<hi>Beam</hi> out of the Roof, and the <hi>Timber</hi> out of the Wall shall tell it. The
<hi>Ointment</hi> upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head shall run down upon his beard, to wet even
the skirt of his cloathing, and the <hi>dust</hi> it self shall not be able to lick it
up.</p>
            <p>If we speak of the <hi>House</hi> it self, <hi>that</hi> stands an everlasting monument
of the Founders <hi>Piety.</hi> The very Walls of holy buildings, that scarce
now raise their heads so high as to be seen, speak yet plainly forth
their Founders and Benefactors. <hi>God</hi> raises up some good soul or other
even in the worst of times to revive their Names, (and blessed be they
for it.) If we speak of the <hi>good</hi> done to the <hi>Offices</hi> of it; those very
Offices are but so many Records therefore from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Not a <hi>Rams,</hi> not a <hi>Goats,</hi> not a <hi>Badgers</hi> skin offered to the building
of the Tabernacle, but stands upon <hi>Gods</hi> File. Not a <hi>Cherubs</hi> head, not
a <hi>Lilly,</hi> a <hi>Flower,</hi> or <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> not a foot or Inch in the sacred Fabrick,
not a <hi>Farthing,</hi> not a <hi>Mite</hi> to the Treasure of it falls to the ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remembred,
un-numbred. Nay, even Sacriledge and Atheism, after so
many Centuries of thriving wickedness, have not yet had the power to
obliterate the memories of the Houses of <hi>God</hi> in the Land. So are the
good deeds <hi>themselves</hi> remembred.</p>
            <p>Nor shall <hi>they</hi> that have ever done them, or shall ever do them, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
Remember <hi>Me,</hi> prays <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and he was heard in what he
pray'd. And you not only see it here, but in the Catalogue made by the
Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> and long since added near to the very Book of <hi>Gods</hi> own
remembrances. <hi>Among the Elect</hi> (says he) was <hi>Nehemias, his renown is
great, who raised up for us the Walls</hi> (and some of them were to the house
of God) <hi>that were fallen, and raised up our ruines,</hi> Ecclus. xlix. 13. There
are <hi>others</hi> reckoned there upon the same account, <hi>Zorobabel was a Signet
the right hand, so was Iesus the Son of Iosedec, who in their time builded the House,
and set us an holy Temple to the Lord which was prepared for everlasting glory,</hi> v. 11,
12. there's a memorial <hi>indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:57113:115"/>And if you would know what this, <hi>to be remembred</hi> is, the parallel
verses will tell you three things of it: <hi>Connive super me,</hi> and <hi>parce mihi;</hi>
Wink at and pardon me, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>Memento in bonum,</hi> remember me for
good, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. To have our weaknesses <hi>winck'd at,</hi> our sins <hi>pardon'd,</hi> and
our good with <hi>good rewarded;</hi> these <hi>three</hi> make up <hi>Gods</hi> remembring us.
And he shews it particularly to those who do good to the place where his
honour dwelleth.</p>
            <p>1. Many a default had <hi>Iacob</hi> made, and done some more than <hi>justifiable</hi>
sleights in his transactions with his <hi>Brethren,</hi> but one vow for <hi>Bethel,
Gen.</hi> xxviii. 22. sets all straight again, and makes God go on his journey
with him. There are weaknesses <hi>wink'd</hi> at, and no reason so probable as
<hi>Bethel</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>David</hi> had some faults, and great ones, yet <hi>God</hi> says, he turned not
aside save only in the matter of <hi>Vriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> 1 Kings xv. 5. <hi>Save that,</hi>
save many other that we could tell you of, but that we will not <hi>rake</hi> up
those sins that <hi>God</hi> passed by. But why is <hi>God</hi> so tender in the point?
Why! <hi>David</hi> was <hi>tender</hi> over <hi>Sion,</hi> could not pray for the very pardon of
his sins, in that great Penitential Psalm of his, but he must needs in the
same breath, as it were, remember <hi>Sion,</hi> Psal. li. 18. <hi>O be gracious unto Sion,</hi>
as if <hi>God</hi> else could not be gracious unto <hi>him;</hi> or as if otherwise, either
the pardon of his sins would do him little good, or else there were no
readier orsurer way to get them pardon'd than by remembring <hi>Sion.</hi> Ther's
the <hi>pardon</hi> of sins upon the score.</p>
            <p>3. Would you have a remembrance for your <hi>good,</hi> as well as a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for your <hi>evil?</hi> Would you have <hi>God</hi> remember you with a blessing
too? Why, your kindness to his house will do it. <hi>God blessed the house of
Obed Edom, and all that appertained unto him, because of the Ark of God, 2 Sant.</hi>
vi. 12. All that appertained? 'Tis good dwelling nigh such a man as he.
Again, <hi>David</hi> would fain have been building God a house, had gotten
many materials, and much money ready for it; and <hi>God</hi> promises him
upon it, that <hi>He will build him a House for it, and establish him a throne for ever,</hi>
2 Sam. vii. 11, 12, 13. <hi>God</hi> will be behind hand with none that do good to
his Habitation, or really intend or go about it. Nay, the very <hi>Sparrow</hi> is
blest, and the <hi>Swallow</hi> is blest that love but his House, that sing their
Mattens and Vespers at his <hi>Altars;</hi> the devout <hi>Prophet</hi> even envies them
for it, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxiv. 3. So great are the blessings of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
so ever are those persons under his eye, so in the eye of blessing, whose
good deeds are there continually putting God in mind of them.</p>
            <p>If you would but remember how <hi>God</hi> forgets his mercy, (or which is
the same) how he remembers them in <hi>Iudgment</hi> who do ill to his <hi>House</hi> or
to the <hi>Offices;</hi> how he strikes <hi>Vzzah</hi> dead for an irreverent <hi>touch</hi> of the
Holy <hi>Ark;</hi> how he smites <hi>Vzziah</hi> with a leprosie for an <hi>encroachment</hi> upon
the sacred <hi>Office,</hi> 2 Chron. xxvi. 19. and turns <hi>Saul</hi> out of his Kingdom for
the like fault, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 14. How he thrusts <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> out of doors,
<hi>Dan.</hi> iv. 33. because he had burnt up his Houses in the Land, 1 King. xxv. 9.
'Tis just, indeed, he should have no House who will let God have none.
How he despoils <hi>Belshazzar</hi> of his Kingdom, because he had spoild his
Temple, and was now prophaning those holy spoils, <hi>carouzing in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
bowles,</hi> Dan. v. 30. How he quite forgets all mercy to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
casts them out as soon as they prophaned his holy <hi>Temple,</hi> and abused his
Messengers, <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> 2 Chron. xxxvi. 14. and professes he could
hold no longer when they had arrived at that height of insolent wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
How he makes the Heavens forget their dew, and the earth her
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57113:115"/>
fruit, because <hi>they let his house lie waste,</hi> Hag. i. 9, 10. you will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
how he remembers those that raise the Walls, and repair the
Ruines, and reverence the Sanctuaries, and love the Priests. If <hi>them</hi>
with Curses, then <hi>these</hi> with Blessings; if <hi>them</hi> with diseases, then <hi>these</hi>
with <hi>health;</hi> if <hi>them</hi> with exile, <hi>these</hi> with quiet dwellings; if <hi>them</hi>
with scarcity, <hi>these</hi> with plenty, <hi>Vbertate Domus,</hi> the plenty of his
house; if <hi>them</hi> with desolate and decaying Families, <hi>these</hi> with happy
and full Posterities; if <hi>them</hi> with death, <hi>then</hi> these with life even for ever
and ever.</p>
            <p>VI. But 'tis time now to remember our <hi>selves.</hi> And many things we are
here to be remembred of.</p>
            <p>That (1.) We have a <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as well as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to do good to.
Many houses of <hi>God</hi> in the Land <hi>now,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> lxxiv. 9.
<hi>This</hi> above the rest, whose decay'd <hi>Towers,</hi> and ruin'd <hi>Pinacles,</hi> and ragged
<hi>Walls,</hi> and open <hi>Windows,</hi> and falling <hi>Roofs,</hi> and broken Pavements, call
loud for a <hi>Repairer of the breaches.</hi> And 'tis not <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> Mercy and
Bounty, nor the <hi>Levites</hi> thin revenue added, that can do it. Blessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be <hi>God,</hi> that he hath put it into the heart of the <hi>King</hi> to begin, and
offer so freely to the Work. But I hope we shall ere long have reason to
bless him for your <hi>offerings</hi> too.</p>
            <p>This House is <hi>Gods:</hi> all <hi>such</hi> houses <hi>Gods,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Bethel,</hi> or
that of <hi>Sion,</hi> or those <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> stiled several times his
houses. That they are so, the solemn Dedications always of them to
his Name with so much glory say enough. And if <hi>Domus orationis</hi> be <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
mea,</hi> the House of Prayer be <hi>Gods</hi> (and <hi>Christ</hi> says it is, and sure he
knows both what is his own, and how to call it) the daily celebration
of that Publick Worship there will give a second proof. That some such
there were even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, some house besides such as we eat
and drink in, that must not be so used, must not be so despised, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. and that it was then called the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in
the same verse, is to tell you in plain English our <hi>Churches</hi> are <hi>Gods
houses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>God</hi> has in our days own'd them for his own. That signal preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them in the heat of War and Plunder, rage and fury, when men
were so wrathfully displeased at them, and so implacably set against
them. That protecting them (2.) through all the Triumphs of a <hi>godly</hi>
Atheism, and a sacriledge out of <hi>Conscience, both</hi> as unsatisfied as the
grave, so miserably greedy that they would violate their Fathers Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,
and scatter their ashes in the air and wind, for an inconsiderable
piece of lead, or brass, or stone; That miraculous restoring them (3.) to
all the holy <hi>Offices;</hi> this <hi>Church</hi> in particular destined to a <hi>sale,</hi> and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
only to see who would give most, are evidences of it, too great to
be disputed, that <hi>God</hi> has vindicated his right, and kept it for himself.
And I hope you will all remember it, and now help him in it, Court and
City, both of you.</p>
            <p>And remember, (2.) These <hi>Houses</hi> have their <hi>Officers,</hi> their <hi>Offices,</hi>
their <hi>Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as well as that here in the <hi>Text. Offices</hi> to be performed,
<hi>Officers</hi> to perform them, and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to perform them with. Your
countenancing, your encouraging, your protecting them, are the good
deeds you may do to them.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore (3.) I beseech you that you do so. <hi>Three</hi>
arguments there are in the <hi>Text</hi> to perswade it. (1.) <hi>Good</hi> it is to do
so, good deeds they are. <hi>God</hi> (2.) will remember them when
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57113:116"/>
they are done. <hi>God</hi> (3.) will remember <hi>you</hi> for doing them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Good</hi> they are, remember <hi>that.</hi> And good works are a <hi>good foundation,
1 Tim.</hi> vi. 19. a foundation upon which you may lay hold on <hi>eternal life,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul</hi> there; and can you desire a better?</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Iudas</hi> tells us, it would do better upon the poor. But had he
had the selling of the Ointment <hi>then,</hi> or when some of his Disciples had
the selling of it <hi>since,</hi> Were the poor ever the better for it? Were not
thousands sent a begging by it? Sure, sure, he that can be content to see
the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>ruines,</hi> will not much pass to see the <hi>poor</hi> in <hi>rags.</hi> He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
the <hi>Church-mans</hi> wealth, will never pity the <hi>poor</hi> mans want; and he
that one time sells the <hi>Church,</hi> will next time sell the <hi>poor,</hi> if he can
get by him. But we will not set good deeds together by the ears. 'Tis
enough that these are good: but 'tis <hi>more</hi> (2.) that <hi>God remembers them;</hi>
that he takes a particular notice of them.</p>
            <p>2. I may say, too, a notice of the particulars. The <hi>Scrowles</hi> of them
are laid up for an <hi>everlasting</hi> remembrance. <hi>Feasts</hi> of Dedication have
been always kept for a <hi>memorial</hi> of them; and <hi>Christ</hi> himself vouchsafed
to be present at them, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> x. 22. And if the <hi>Syriac</hi> Translator may
be allowed to read the last verse of the Chapter, <hi>Et ad oblationes, &amp; ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra
temporibus &amp; Festis Statutis memoriam hujus rei mihi serva;</hi> we see these
good deeds were solemnly remembred in those solemn Feast; and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
expected <hi>his</hi> should be so. Their persons have anciently been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in the Christian <hi>Dypticks.</hi> And you see to day we have revived the
Custom here.</p>
            <p>3. But 'tis not a meer remembring them for <hi>honour,</hi> but also a real remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
them, and them that do them for a <hi>blessing,</hi> all sorts of blessings.
So that would I commend to my dearest friend a Trade to make him rich
and happy, it should be doing <hi>good</hi> to the House of <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis an old Jewish
saying, <hi>Decima ut dives fias;</hi> Pay thy Tyths if thou wilt grow rich. Build
God a House, say I, and he will build thee one again; Do good to <hi>His</hi>
House, say I, and he'll do good to <hi>thine;</hi> and a wicked Son shall not be
able to cut off the Entail. For 'tis worth the notice, that when <hi>God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>David</hi> a House upon this account, he tells him, that though his <hi>Son</hi>
commit iniquity he would not <hi>utterly take his mercy from him.</hi> I know there
are that to be excused, talk much of unsetled times. <hi>This</hi> is the way to
<hi>settle</hi> them: When <hi>God</hi> and man shall see we are in earnest for the House
of <hi>God,</hi> and the Offices thereof, all your <hi>Sects</hi> will cease to trouble you,
and vanish. Some cry, the State must be setled first. Why! <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
ejus in montibus Sanctis,</hi> says the <hi>Psalm;</hi> the <hi>foundations</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> are
upon the <hi>Holy Hills.</hi> Lay your foundations there, and you shall never be
removed, <hi>God</hi> of his goodness will make your <hi>Hill so strong.</hi> No better
way to fix the House of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or your <hi>own,</hi> than to begin with <hi>His.</hi>
Others (to get loose) tell us of the <hi>decay</hi> of Trade. Why! how can it be
other, says God, <hi>Hag.</hi> i. 9. <hi>You looked for much, and it came to little, and when
you brought it home,</hi> (and 'twas scarce worth bringing home) <hi>I did blow upon
it; blew it into nothing.</hi> And why was it says the <hi>Lord of Hosts? Because of
my house that lieth waste, and ye run every man to his own house.</hi> You dwell in
Cedars, and you lap your selves in Silks and Silver, and you have all
neat and fine about you; but the House of God, <hi>that</hi> lies in the dust and
rubbish. But <hi>is it time for you</hi> (O ye, says he, for I know not what to call
you) <hi>to dwell in cieled houses, and my house lie no better?</hi> Did <hi>God,</hi> think you,
make Gold and Silver, Silks and Purples, Marbles and Cedars, for us
only and our houses, and not for himself also or his own? Or do you
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57113:116"/>
think to thrive by being sparing to it, or holding from it? No, says <hi>God,</hi>
from the day that the Foundation of the <hi>Lords</hi> Temple was laid, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, from this, <hi>that day will I bless you,</hi> Hag. ii. 18, 19. And prove him
so (say I, for he bids so himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 10.) and see if <hi>he will not pour you
out a blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, he has been <hi>before</hi> us with it. He has brought us home, and
<hi>stablisht</hi> our Estates, and <hi>restor'd</hi> our Religion; done more to us, and to our
<hi>houses</hi> than we durst desire or hope; and is it not all the reason in the
world we should do good to <hi>his</hi> again? Hang up our remembrances upon
the <hi>Walls,</hi> pay our acknowledgments upon his <hi>Altars,</hi> and bless all the
<hi>Offices</hi> of his house for so great blessings? <hi>God</hi> will remember you again
for what ever it is. If you would yet more engage him to you, know
<hi>God loves the Gates of Sion more then all the dwellings of Iacob,</hi> Psal. lxxxvii. 2.
must needs therefore love <hi>these</hi> most, that most love <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I doubt not but we shall find many here that do so, many too, that
will <hi>so</hi> express it. Yet not according to what a man has not, but to what
he has, says our St. <hi>Paul,</hi> does <hi>God</hi> accept him. We cannot expect that all
that <hi>love</hi> most can <hi>express</hi> most. Yet according to their abilities they will
do it. A cup of cold water, I confess, to a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in the name of a <hi>Prophet,</hi>
shall not lose the reward, no more shall a single <hi>Mite</hi> to the house of <hi>God</hi> as
<hi>his.</hi> Every one however may do somewhat towards it. They that cannot
give much, may give a little, they that cannot <hi>pay,</hi> may yet <hi>pray</hi> for it. And
to wish it well, and to rejoyce in the prosperity and welfare of it, the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and adorning of it, are two <hi>mites</hi> that any one can give, and <hi>God</hi> will
accept where there can be no other. Only, where there is <hi>most,</hi> we must
present it with humility, as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxix. (<hi>What am I, O Lord,
that I should be able after this sort to offer,</hi> thus to do it?) And where there
is but little, we must present it with a regret that we can do no more.</p>
            <p>Will <hi>God</hi> remember and accept us; remember and pardon us; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and bless us, with blessings of the right hand, and blessings of the
left; remember us in all places, both at home and abroad; in all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
both in the days of our prosperity, and in the time of trouble; in
our goings out, and in our comings in; in our Persons, and in our Estates;
in our selves, and in our Posterities, with them shall remain a good inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and their children shall be ever within the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And when
all <hi>earthly</hi> glances shall be forgotten, that which we have done to the <hi>House</hi>
of God shall be <hi>still</hi> remembred; when our bodies shall lie down in dust,
our names shall live in heaven; when a cold stone shall chill our ashes, our
bones shall flourish out of their graves; when time shall have eaten out
our <hi>Epitaphs,</hi> our righteousness shall not be forgotten, <hi>God</hi> will remember
it for ever. And though the <hi>general</hi> conflagration shall at last <hi>calcine</hi>
these glorious structures into ashes, we shall dwell safe in buildings not
made with hands, <hi>eternal</hi> in the heavens, where the <hi>Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and the <hi>Lamb</hi> shall be the <hi>Temple,</hi> and we sing the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> with
<hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Archangels,</hi> and all the holy Spirits, with joy and gladness for
evermore.</p>
            <p>To which glorious House and Office God of his mercy bring us in our
several times and orders through, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND when. That <hi>When</hi> was as this <hi>day. When the days</hi> of
the blessed Virgins <hi>Purification, according to the Law of
Moses, were accomplished</hi> forty days after Christs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
this <hi>day</hi> just, then <hi>they brought him to Ierusalem to
present him to the Lord,</hi> ver. 22. Then blessed <hi>Mary</hi>
and <hi>Ioseph brought,</hi> then devout <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Anna, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi>
and if we be either <hi>Maries,</hi> or <hi>Anna's, Iosephs,</hi>
or <hi>Simeons,</hi> holy men, or devout women, we too, will this <hi>day</hi> bless God
for the blessing of the <hi>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this <hi>day</hi> also of his <hi>presentation,</hi> as well as those other days of his
<hi>Birth, Circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Manifestation, Candlemas-day</hi> as well as <hi>Christmas-day,
New-years-day,</hi> or <hi>Epiphany,</hi> is a day of blessing; a day of Gods blessing us,
and our blessing of him again: of Christs being presented for us, and
our presenting to him again; of his presenting in the Temple, and our
presenting our selves in the Church, to bless God and him for his presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
his <hi>presentation-day,</hi> and our <hi>Candlemas,</hi> our little candles, our petty
lights; our souls reflecting back to this great light, that was this <hi>day</hi>
presented in the Temple, and then darted down upon us,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Shepherds</hi> blessed God in the morn of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> the <hi>Wisemen</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Epiphany, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> to <hi>day.</hi> All conditions before, all sexes to
<hi>day;</hi> ignorant <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and learned <hi>Clerks;</hi> poor Country-men, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57113:117"/>
great Princes: no condition out before, and both Sexes in to day. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
both of Jew and Gentile; men that most stood in need of a Saviour
before, just and righteous souls to <hi>day,</hi> that we might know there is none
so good but stands in need of him one day or other, that will want a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
if not at <hi>Christmas,</hi> yet at <hi>Candlemas;</hi> if not among sinners, yet
among the righteous, either first or last. <hi>Mary</hi> the blessed, <hi>Ioseph</hi> the
just, <hi>Simeon</hi> the devout, <hi>Anna</hi> the religious, all in to <hi>day,</hi> secular and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
of all sexes and orders; all come in to <hi>day,</hi> as at the end of <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi>
like the <hi>Chorus</hi> to the <hi>Angels</hi> Choire, to bear a part in the <hi>Angels</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them,
to make up a full choire of voices to glorifie God for this great
present, which brings peace to the earth, and good will among men.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>day</hi> first is it given into our arms. In all the former Festivals
he is either in his Mothers lap, or in his Cradle, or to be sure not out of
doors; there only, or within only is he to be seen. This <hi>day</hi> first he comes
abroad to be handled by us. Before indeed he might be thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
us somewhat: Now first, are we made sensible of it, when we may
take him into our own arms, and kiss him, in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
kiss this Son of the most high, as he lies in our arms.</p>
            <p>He was made man at his <hi>birth,</hi> made under the Law at his <hi>Circumcision,</hi>
made manifest to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at his <hi>Epiphany,</hi> but all this while at a kind
of distance from us. This is the <hi>day</hi> of a nearer application to us, when
he is first made a present and offering for us; for us, who were none of
us, I am sure, in any case to be presented for our selves; not pure, not
clean, not whole, not holy enough any of us to be presented before God,
till he was first presented to make us accepted. When he is (2.) made a
present and offering to us, presented and offered to us to be taken, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and offered up again by us, to make all our offerings and our
selves accepted in this beloved.</p>
            <p>For this it is in the sum, that we are this <hi>day</hi> to bless God (as I hope we
have done on other days for the other) that this beloved of his would thus
still, again and again, more and more, undergo the condition of men, make
himself of no more account than an ordinary man, be valued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
at the ordinary rate of the poorest Child, as this <hi>day</hi> he was.
That (2.) he would let his Mother too, be reckoned in the rank of the
meanest women that were not able to offer beyond a pair of Turtles, or
young Pigeons, and go for one that had need of Purification as well as
other women; as if she were no better than the rest after this great
Child-birth, though without the least spot or impurity in the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
both of Conception and Child-birth: In a word, that he would
thus condescend, and descend too into our very arms to be offered for us,
and offered by us.</p>
            <p>There are four remarkable passages of the day. (1.) The blessed <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
Purification.</hi> (2.) Our <hi>blessed Saviours Presentation.</hi> (3.) Good <hi>Simeons
Exultation.</hi> And (4.) Religious <hi>Anna's Gratulation.</hi> There are but two of
them in the <hi>Text, Christs Presentation,</hi> and <hi>Simeons Exultation;</hi> The other
two are not now within our compass; some other time they may. These
two will at this time be enough; especially being not only to consider
what was done then, but what must be still; not only what by others,
but also what by us; our own duty as well as Christs Parents, and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons</hi>
performances; what they did for him <hi>then</hi> after the custom of the
Law, what we for him <hi>now</hi> after the Law is out of custom, and fashion,
after the fashion and custom of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For does blessing or blessedness
belong only to the Law? do they not more to the Gospel? certainly much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57113:118"/>
more. <hi>Simeon</hi> only was the <hi>Precentor,</hi> began the Song which is to continue
to the end of the world. And though <hi>Simeon</hi> be departed according to
his wish, yet has the Church throughout it taken up the <hi>Hymn,</hi> and sings
it every evening, as a perpetual memorial of this days <hi>Benediction.</hi> So
our blessing to continue, as well as God's; ours to him, as well as his to
us: and his is such, that it will never fail, but extend the vertue of
this <hi>days</hi> great <hi>present</hi> unto all generations.</p>
            <p>I have already divided you the <hi>Text,</hi> whilst I told you two of the
great remarkables of the <hi>day</hi> were in it, <hi>Christs Presentation,</hi> and <hi>Simeons
Gratulation: Christs Presentation</hi> to God, and his acceptation by man. Christ
presented in the Temple according to the Law, Christ received into the
arms according unto Faith.</p>
            <p>The first of these in the 27. verse, which runs thus, <hi>And when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
brought in the Child Iesus, to do for him after the custom of the Law.</hi>
There's his <hi>Presentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second of the points is in the 28. verse, <hi>Then took he him up in his
arms, and blessed God.</hi> There's his <hi>Reception,</hi> or <hi>Simeons Acceptation</hi>
of him, or <hi>Gratulation</hi> and <hi>Exultation</hi> over him.</p>
            <p>Of each of these first in reference to them, then afterward to our
selves. First, to inform you what was done, then to teach you what
to do. I begin with what was done, and first with <hi>Christs Presentation,</hi>
where we are to pass thorow these particulars. The presenters, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
the time, the place, the manner of presenting this great present.</p>
            <p>The Presenters were the <hi>Parents,</hi> the Presented was the <hi>Child Iesus,</hi> the
time was <hi>when the days of her purification were accomplished,</hi> the place, the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and the manner <hi>according to the custom of the Law:</hi> all according to
order, and that also keep we now.</p>
            <p>The presenters first in <hi>that,</hi> first in order, and first in fitness too. Who
fitter to present the Child then its own <hi>Parents. Ius liberorum,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the Child is properly theirs. Nature makes it so; they give it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and therefore surely have most right to it when it is in being, and
whilst it is so; till God by a second Law either take it to himself, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to another, for which it naturally almost leaves its Parents to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it self.</p>
            <p>Upon the first title, of Gods claim to it they here bring it to him; but
so they receive it back again with greater comfort: we lose nothing that
we give to God, we do but bring it to him only for a blessing to it, and
depart with both. The Parents never can be surer of the Child, then
when they first give it unto God: Fathers and Mothers may learn by
these good folks thus to sanctifie, as it were, their Children from the
breast.</p>
            <p>Both Parents agree here, nor the tenderness of the one, nor the auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the other think much of Gods demands, though it seem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
much upon their right, their very natural right. Nature it self
must veil and submit where God pleads interest: even that eternal and
inviolable law of preserving our selves, and ours, is circumscribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits of Gods prerogative, and we must do neither, but with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to his pleasure to dispose of us and ours.</p>
            <p>Yet Parents here under the notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, seems very strange. <hi>Ioseph</hi>
having no part in his geniture; yet so the law sometimes calls both the
Step-father and Step-mother: No wonder then to hear <hi>Ioseph</hi> so entitled,
who in the eye of the world, and term of law (that reaches not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries,
nor provides words for miraculous conceptions) was counted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57113:118"/>
father in the very proper acception. Only this to be said. Common
fame may be deceiv'd, and names affix'd where not deserv'd. And titles
often to be accepted too rather than venture an harsh and untimely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon our selves or them, that are very near us, by the discovery of
an unseasonable truth.</p>
            <p>Truth it was that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was not his Father, that both <hi>Ioseph</hi> himself
and the <hi>Evangelist</hi> well knew. Yet would the one speak after the vulgar
language rather than cross received terms at the first in the recital of a
story which might lose its credit by so early a discovery of a mysterious
truth, but might with little offence be corrected in the progress: nor
would the other proclaim himself no Father, lest that most pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
<hi>Virgin</hi> should run the hazard of lewd tongues, and the great
wonders of the most high be blasphemed, and his Son dishonoured with
a name, which these late sons of Hell only durst belch out.</p>
            <p>Call we them both then, still, if we think good, the <hi>Parents</hi> of this
<hi>Child:</hi> However a Foster-father <hi>Ioseph</hi> was, and by that relation had a
title to this <hi>presentation,</hi> and we by it another lesson to take care of those
we undertake for, as for our own, to present, and offer them also to God,
to consecrate them also betimes to Gods service. Seasonable words
hence remember we ever to observe (2.) not upon every hint to cross the
road of speech. (3.) To conceal a while unseasonable truths. (4.) To
take care of the same and honour of others. (5.) To perform our duties
with all tenderness to our charges, and however dedicate them to the
disposal of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Thus much we may learn by the <hi>Presenters</hi> and their title, and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
times make us the readier to make another note to take notice of
this happy juncture, where both <hi>Parents</hi> agree about the Child, both
bring him. Our divisions are so encreas'd upon us, that those whom God
has nearest joyn'd are so wide separated in this business, that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Child is kept from being presented unto God: God deprived of
his right, and the Child of the benefit by the perverseness of the one or
other of the Parents; the Child neither brought to the Church, nor
God, done for neither, according to Law nor Custom, but debarr'd
Christianity, denied to God at first, and in danger to be denied by him
at the last, through the division of the Parents in Religion and Sect. A
joyful sight it is methinks to see them here united for the Childs good;
the more for that our dissentions of Parents look so ugly, and are so
deeply prejudicial to Gods honour, and the Childs both benefit and right
which it has to be presented to God in holy <hi>Baptism.</hi> It may yet prove
worse in the education, if the difference still continue between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
and the Child which unbaptized cannot be conceived to have
any greater assistance of inward Grace, than the Child of a <hi>Heathen</hi> or a
<hi>Iew,</hi> being both by nature; and 'tis to be feared by the Parents irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet further punished by a leaving it meerly in that state, proner far
to evil than good, to error than truth: Such a Child it cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in reason, but that it should adhere to the worser part: and as it
lost its Baptism at the first, so at the last miss its Religion too. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
denied it when he would have it, and calls for it to have it brought
to him, we can have no great confidence that he will at another time
accept it, when it is grown out of that number of little ones, whom he
calls, become greater in its corruption, and the first-fruits of his age de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to another Master. God send better agreement among Parents,
say I, be it for the Childrens sake, that they may be presented to the
Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57113:119"/>A <hi>Child</hi> it is that is presented in the <hi>Text,</hi> and in the <hi>day,</hi> and the <hi>Child
Iesus;</hi> such a Child is both example and authority enough for us to bring
ours also to the Lord, whilst they are such: unless we think our Children
are holier than he, want less than he, can be without God better than
he, more above the Law than he.</p>
            <p>But he calling for them himself, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,</hi> St.
Mat. xix. 14. It seems to me both ingratitude and impudence to keep
them from him; to say nothing of the infidelity in so doing: as if we
believed him not, that he meant it when he called, or we thought he
could do them no good if they came; or that he would not, or that they
were as well without him as with him, without his blessing as with it. It
may be they will tell us he call'd them indeed, but not to Baptism, did
not Baptize them when they came. Poor silly men! would they have
him Baptize the Children before their Fathers, before they themselves
were fitted for it; by whom only the Children have right to it? or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize
them when they were not brought by them to that purpose? Is it
not enough that Christ desires, and accepts the Children that are brought
to him, that come to him? And how come they now to him, but by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism?
How has the Universal Church from that day to this brought
Children to him? Has it not been to Baptism, in all Catholick Doctrine
and Practice to this day? Have we now at all found any better way to
bring them to him? None at all, alas! and is that better?</p>
            <p>Their Children (forsooth) are holy, because their Fathers are, alike
I think, that is, under the bondage of corruption; their Fathers holy!
I would we could see it once: But suppose them so, were there no holy
Fathers among the Jews, that their Children must all receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Circumcision, to which our Baptism succeeds to hollow them?
Ay, but God now has promised to be the Father of them, and of their
seed; and did he not so to <hi>Abraham</hi> first, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 7. and yet must his
Children be Circumcised. What is it (trow) that these men would have?
Must the <hi>Iews</hi> dedicate their Children, and must not the <hi>Christian?</hi> were
the Jewish Children Gods right, and are not the Christians? Do not
we owe ours as much to him as they theirs? Or must their Births be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
by an early Consecration, and ours not? theirs in a better condition
under the wing of the Almighty, ours in a meer natural state in our own
meer protection? theirs seal'd for Gods own, ours without seal, or any
thing but their Fathers sin to know them by, challeng'd wholly to our
selves; as if God had neither part nor portion in them. Certainly did
men but thus consider, Children would not be so much injur'd by their
Parents frowardness; and could Children and sucklings understand it,
they would complain of so great an injury done to them, the most imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that can be done to that tender age, thus to be deprived of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and taken out of the protection, as much as lies in their Parents
power, of their God and Saviour.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have considered only Gods right, and the Childs good in
being brought into the Temple. See we now the Parents Devotion, and
God honoured by it.</p>
            <p>They brought in the <hi>Child;</hi> and what better present can they bring,
can any Parents bring and offer than a Child? how can they express
their Devotion more to God, than by offering what is dearest?</p>
            <p>Now he brings his Child to God, that brings it to be Baptized, to be
instructed, to be brought up in the fear of God, and the practice of true
Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:57113:119"/>He (2.) brings him more peculiarly that devotes him to some peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
Service of the Church, as <hi>Anna</hi> did <hi>Samuel,</hi> to the service of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He (3.) brings him to God, that commends him daily in his prayers
to God for a blessing; as <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Ismael</hi> in that Petition, <hi>O that Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael
might live before thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He (4.) brings him to God, that resigns him wholly at any time to
God's disposal both in health and sickness, both in plenty and want, for
any fortune or condition that God thinks fit or convenient for him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there was a strange offering of a Child prescribed to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi>
xxii. 2. to Sacrifice him on an Altar; and God sacrificed this Child at
last, his Son upon the <hi>Cross</hi> for us: but he requires not that we should do
so with ours. Yet this he does, that with <hi>Abraham</hi> we should so resign
the dearest of them to God, that if at any time for his Service he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them from us, and please for the profession of his Name or Truth,
to sacrifice them to the flames, or to the Cross, any way understood, we
should not think much to be so bereaved of them to their greater glory.</p>
            <p>All these ways the Child is brought to God, according to the
Letter; but in the Mystery, he also brings his Child even who has
none, that brings what is dearest to him, and submits it to Gods pleasure.
He (2.) that blesses all his actions at the beginning with his prayers. He
(3.) that devotes his first morning thoughts to Heaven. He (4.) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
his first thoughts, motions, and intentions, the first-born of his
soul to Gods honour and glory. So we may offer Children, that have no
Children, bring a Child, who have no Child. Nay more, we may
bring the Child, that is, the best of Children, above all Children, the
<hi>Child Iesus;</hi> as well the barren Maid, as the most fruitful Mother, may do
this. It may be better too; they that have no other Child may best tend
upon the <hi>Child Iesus:</hi> they that have none other to care for, have the
more care to bestow on him; they that have no other to nurse or bring
up, may the easier and fuller apply themselves to nurse him up in their
souls, till he be grown up in them to a <hi>perfect stature;</hi> and having no
other to bring to the <hi>Temple,</hi> may every day bring him. He was brought
here by a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and I know not how he can be brought by any better.
Yet by a <hi>Virgin</hi> Mother here, that both Virgins and Mothers, Parents
and others, all conditions might have an interest to present him.</p>
            <p>And sure no greater present, none more acceptable, no Child to this,
to the <hi>Child Iesus.</hi> Bring him with us, and come and welcome; welcome
at any time with him. 'Tis in him that all our offerings are accepted;
his Cross the Altar that sanctifies our gifts: he the <hi>beloved</hi> Child <hi>in whom
alone God is well pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Parents brought him in without a figure: brought he was before
in the type only; and the shadow prefigured in <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
<hi>Iosiah,</hi> and in the offerings and sacrifices of the Law. The great light
or candle of this day first dispers'd those shadows; all legal Purification
days turned into so many <hi>Candlemas's</hi> by the bringing in of this eternal
light, this bright only Child of the <hi>Father of lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are our candles all put out? ceremony and substance vanish'd too?
is it not <hi>Candlemas</hi> still with up? are we returned to that former darkness,
and no light left us to offer up? no <hi>Child Iesus</hi> to offer still? Yes, still
we have? 'tis an eternal light that this <hi>day</hi> sprung up beyond the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of the Lamps of the <hi>Temple.</hi> We offer <hi>Christ</hi> even to this <hi>day</hi> still.</p>
            <p>He offers Jesus, that forms himself to the <hi>image of Iesus,</hi> by putting
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57113:120"/>
him on as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks in righteousness and holiness, by meekness,
patience, obedience, charity, and brotherly love, growing up by what
degrees he can to the <hi>stature of Christ,</hi> so presenting himself before God:
and he that does it in his youth at the first spring of his understanding
days, brings the <hi>Child Iesus,</hi> the most acceptable, because the most early
and timely offering.</p>
            <p>2. He brings and offers <hi>Iesus,</hi> who when he has done all he can, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all he is able, given all he had, yet renounces all as unworthy; claims
nothing by them, thinks them not worth acceptance, but wraps them all
up in Christs Mantle, presents his Merits as the only offering, his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and abundant satisfactions to sanctifie all his other presents,
stands to none, pleads nothing, claims by nothing but only him.</p>
            <p>3. He offers <hi>Iesus,</hi> that in a thankful remembrance of his love, offers
him up in the holy Sacrament, as the only sacrifice of Thanksgiving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all other possible praises; and for an atonement and reconciliation
for his own sins, and the sins of all the world. 'Tis time we set aside
some time for such an Offering, and in the <hi>Text</hi> we find it, though not
explicitely, yet necessarily implied. For, <hi>When the Parents brought in the
Child,</hi> will easily tell us, that, a <hi>when,</hi> a time there was, and is a kind of
relative conjunction, that by joyning the context will quickly be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
within a few years backward, <hi>vers</hi> 22. to be <hi>when the days of her
Purification,</hi> the Mothers purification, <hi>were accomplished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law would not sooner suffer the Mother to come near the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,
so scrupulous did God seem to be of the pollution of his <hi>Temple,</hi> that
he would not accept his own dues and offerings from a hand of that body
which had but on it the least semblance of impurity, though it was no
other than a meer natural course which himself had made. Nature it
self it seems when its motions are but meerly natural, must have nothing
to do at the Altars of Holiness. God made all things good, makes
many good things which yet he thinks not good enough to approach his
holiness, without a previous purification. <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi>
and their followers may cry out, <hi>the whole Congregation is holy,</hi> all holy
enough, any thing good and pure enough for the Temples, Altars, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
Services, ministrations of the Lord and his Christ: but it seem'd
they wanted fire to cleanse them and their Censers; and God sent it
with a vengeace: They would not keep apart from holy Offices, but
God parts the earth to sever them from his Altars: and when our sins
are sufficiently punished, their followers will find some strange purging
fires for thus boldly daring, without purifying their hands, after the law
or custom of the Church, to lay them to Christs plough, before their
days be out, either themselves or their days accomplished, not their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apprentiships out, some of them; so presumptuously intruding into
holy Offices, Functions, Offerings, and places: such mens <hi>damnation
slumbers not,</hi> though it tarry, it will come sure at last. The holy <hi>Virgin,</hi> who
needed no purification for this Child-birth (as not conceiving, as the
<hi>Text</hi> runs, <hi>Lev.</hi> xii. 2. <hi>suscepto semine</hi>) must be purified before she come,
though to bring an offering as pure as purity it self. So is Gods method
and order, so he requires it, <hi>after the custom of the Law,</hi> it is said here; and
were there no reason else, Church-law and custom in Church business in
all reason should carry it.</p>
            <p>And it being holy business, purification cannot but be a necessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to it; some kind of separation to prepare for it. There is a
legal separation, and it did well when it was in use. There is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57113:120"/>
still in force, an external and an internal both. Holy things not
to be medled with, but with holy hands, hands separated from civil and
secular employments: none to offer as Priests, but those that are so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
with that kind of separation. And none to present neither
any thing to be offered, but such as have holy hearts, accomplished with
inward purity: Unsanctified hearts and unhallowed hands are not fit to
bring in <hi>Iesus;</hi> nor touch the offerings of so pure a God: Not the word,
not the Sacraments, not the Services, none of them to be either offered
or taken by any he whoever, that hates to be reformed, who is not puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and disposed rightly before he comes.</p>
            <p>Forty were the days of this Purification: something there may be in
the number. So many days <hi>Moses</hi> prepared for the receiving of the Law,
<hi>Exod.</hi> xxiv. 18. So many <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ah</hi> in his advance to the Mount of God,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 8. So many <hi>Christ</hi> himself before he entred upon his Office,
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. 2. So many the <hi>Church</hi> designs for a preparation to <hi>Easter,</hi> as
a purification of our souls and bodies, by Prayer and Fasting, against
our <hi>Easter</hi> offerings. Whether this number tell us by ten, four times
multiplied, that the Decalogue of <hi>Moses</hi> is in the four <hi>Evangelists</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,
the <hi>Law</hi> perfected by the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Or that these bodies we bear
about us consisting of four Elements, are by the observation of the ten
Commandments accomplished with all vertues, and thereby best puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
or that the tenth parts of all our years, to which forty days do
well near draw (so many being but little more then the tenth portion of
a year) are hereby required to be spent in Gods Service, the purifying
of our souls and bodies for his use. Whether it be for the one reason or
the other, or the third: for this sure it is, that we may understand a
large and considerable portion of our days, is to be always spent in good
preparations, purifications, and retirements. Christ can never be too
much provided for, nor we too much purified, when we come to take or
offer him.</p>
            <p>Nor is the place (3.) for that's the next point, where we are to offer,
though a great way off, to be complained of for its distance. If it be the
place where God has set his name, and appointed for his worship, as far as
Mount <hi>Moriah</hi> from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tents, or the uttermost borders of <hi>Iudea</hi>
from the <hi>Temple;</hi> go we must thither, and not think much of it. They
brought him in, says the <hi>Text,</hi> that is, into the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
From <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is a pretty walk to go with a young Child to
offer: but where God commands there is no gain-saying. There is no
burthen neither to such souls as just <hi>Iosephs</hi> and blessed <hi>Maries;</hi> and the
Child will get no cold by the way it goes to God. Our niceness makes
the trouble, and betrays us to the fear. The Child gets no hurt by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried to the <hi>Font;</hi> nor did it in devouter times when it was wholly
dipt, no more than so great a pain as <hi>Circumcision,</hi> hurt the Infants health.
Our tenderness and fooleries, who have not Faith enough to trust God,
with them, or to submit mildly to God's Ordinances, are the only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all miscarriages in holy business, where we will be wiser than God,
tenderer than God, and more careful than God would have us. The
greatest argument for this generation not turning <hi>Iews,</hi> is, I think, for
fear of <hi>Circumcision;</hi> lest they should put themselves to any pain, or fear
to lose their Children by that bloody Sacrament: else I fear they are too
well disposed towards it. One thing would much perswade (I am sure) if
they might so pull down all our Churches, and have but one to go to once
a year: So godly is the age we live in, so well are we reformed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:57113:121"/>
Yet the fittest place sure for Gods offerings, are God's houses; his
own Altars for his own Service: holy places for holy works, for holy
offerings: <hi>Templum Domini,</hi> for <hi>Dominum Templi,</hi> as devout <hi>Bernard, The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord the fittest place for the Lord of the Temple;</hi> that the fittest, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
to find him in. So the prophesie, so the desire, call it which you please,
of holy <hi>David</hi> fulfilled, <hi>Suscepimus misericordiam in medio Templi,</hi> Ps. xlviii. 8.
<hi>We have found,</hi> or we wait for <hi>thy loving kindness in the midst of thy Temple.</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it self there this day found. We may pray any where and offer, and offer
any where either our own Children, or <hi>the Child Iesus,</hi> if necessity so be:
but the best souls love the best places, holy souls holy places. <hi>David</hi>
professes so, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxiv. 3. Nay the very Sparrows he observes will
build as near the Altars as they can; and it may be for that kind of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and natural piety, they particularly, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove other creatures are said
by Christ not to fall, one of them, to the ground, without Gods more
peculiar providence.</p>
            <p>I shall make no further note upon this particular, it is but implicitely
implied, though yet so necessarily in the Text: They brought him in,
in whither? Into the <hi>Temple</hi> it was: and the very words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before, in that very verse, express it. Yet being but so express'd,
so briefly and implicitely, I take leave to be brief too, because there is
still so much of the <hi>Text,</hi> and so little of the time behind. And the
point next behind is the manner and form of Christs presentation, or
the cause, or reason why he was presented, why they brought him in;
<hi>to do for him after the custom of the Law.</hi> And three points of it there were to
be observed upon such occasions to offer him, to ransom him, to offer for
him.</p>
            <p>He was the <hi>first-born,</hi> and therefore to be offered, and presented. The
first-born was Gods, <hi>all the first-born are mine,</hi> says he, <hi>Numb.</hi> viii. 17.
both of man and beast. And Christ, he is <hi>the first-born of every creature,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. i. 15. So in him they are offered all together, man and
beast, all sanctified by him: men that live like men, and men that live
like beasts, <hi>Qui computruerunt sicut jumenta in stercore suo,</hi> who wallow
in their own dung, in their own sins, like the beasts that perish: for the
righteous and for the sinner both is he offered, that both might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to God through him. That (2.) man and beast too, according to the
letter might, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> says, be saved, that is, blest and preserved
through him.</p>
            <p>He was the <hi>first-born</hi> (2.) of his Father, the first and only begotten
Son of God, so to be presented upon that title.</p>
            <p>He was (3.) the <hi>first-born</hi> of his Mother, the first and only Son, first
born, though not begotten there: but first born was sufficient to entitle
him to God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> calls him (4.) <hi>The first-born among many brethren,</hi> Rom. viii.
29. He our elder, and we the younger brethren.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Apostle</hi> (5.) calls him the <hi>first-born of the dead,</hi> Col. i. 18. So
that now being the <hi>first-born</hi> both by Father and Mother, both in Heaven
and Earth, of quick and dead, of every creature; no great wonder to
hear of his presenting to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Yet for himself neither was he offered, but for us; he needed no such
sanctifying, but for <hi>us,</hi> to sanctifie us, as the first-fruits to sanctifie the
whole lump; as the true <hi>Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world;</hi>
as the first-born in relation to his brethren to rule over us as a <hi>Prince,</hi> and
offer for us, and bless us as a <hi>Priest;</hi> the two appendices of a <hi>primogeniture.</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:57113:121"/>
Thus is he made to us our <hi>morning Sacrifice,</hi> as he was after our <hi>evening
offering,</hi> when he was offered upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> Thus both offered for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>after the custom of the Law,</hi> and for us in the interpretation of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>custom of the Law</hi> was next to ransom him; <hi>five shekels</hi> was his
price, the ordinary rate, <hi>Numb.</hi> xviii. 16. a goodly price for the first<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>born
of God to be valued at! <hi>O blessed Iesu,</hi> how little hast thou made thy self
for us? of how little value? How can we sufficiently value thee, for thy
thus undervaluing thy self? And why should we now (my beloved) so
overvalue our selves, as to think no honour sufficient for us, nothing too
good for us, no riches enough, no respect answerable to our deserts? If
Christ be valued but at <hi>five shekels,</hi> the best of us, all of us, the whole
world of us,; and if there were a world of worlds were not all worth
five farthings. Let us but think of this, and no disrespect, or disesteem,
or slighting from the very meanest and unworthiest hand will ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us again, certainly.</p>
            <p>Well, ransom'd he was, yet, with it, as little as it was, but it seems
it was but to pay a greater, the price of his life to ransom us. No ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
would redeem him the second time, because his business was not to
redeem himself, but us. He was redeemed now for a little, but he was
sold for less than <hi>thirty pence;</hi> and yet would not be redeemed by any sum.
He made himself of no estimation again and again, and dealt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as if he were not worth a ransom only, that he might ransom us,
and set us high in God's esteem.</p>
            <p>The ransom mony here was the <hi>Priests:</hi> And holy <hi>Mary,</hi> as poor as
she was, would pay her dues. And <hi>Iesus</hi> would she should, his Mother
should; and then sure all his brethren too, would be therefore offered
and redeemed. 'Tis a good example for Church duties, when such pay
them; and may amount to a kind of precept: for if he who is the <hi>great
High-Priest</hi> himself, and from whom it was not due, pay as he did tribute
afterward, that he might not offend. I can see little of Christ where
the Church or Priest is robb'd, or little Christianity where such offences
are not heeded.</p>
            <p>Christ would break no Law, for <hi>he came to fulfil it;</hi> nor Custom, for
you see he observes it, did so all his life, kept the Feasts, kept the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms.
He follows not Christ that does other, who e're he follows.</p>
            <p>Nay, Christ himself commutes too, breaks not the custom of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
One of the most questionable points of custom is commutation,
to exchange one for another, to pay with the purse instead of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Yet such was law and Custom, and Christ disputes it not; nor is
reason against it, to change one thing for another, when both are good;
one vow into another, one penance into another; where reason, not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
respect to the condition, or inability of persons, not partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
make the exchange. In such cases we are to submit, not dispute, or
cry out as some do; if for mony, why not without it? If God will not
accept my person, why my mony? If I may have or do it for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a little sum, why is it not lawful to me without it? 'Tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
enough to reasonable men, or devout Christians; so God, so
Law, so Custom will have it, and it is no sin to do it.</p>
            <p>There is yet one thing more to be done <hi>after the custom of the Law,</hi> an
offering to be offered, <hi>a lamb,</hi> and a <hi>Turtle Dove,</hi> or <hi>young Pigeon</hi> for the
<hi>rich,</hi> or <hi>two Turtles,</hi> or <hi>two young Pigeons</hi> for the <hi>poorer</hi> sort, <hi>Lev.</hi> xii. 6, 8.
And it was so done here. 'Tis thought by them that dare determine
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57113:122"/>
which, that it was the latter, the pigeons, as cheaper and easier to be
gotten, where there was so much poverty as this child was born to.</p>
            <p>Be it which it will, it was the poors offering that from henceforth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
might look chearful to the <hi>Christian,</hi> that was so horrid to the <hi>Iew,</hi>
become his happiness which was the others great affliction, the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
offering that it might sanctifie poverty to the poor, and offer it
henceforward as an acceptable service unto God.</p>
            <p>That (2.) the Christian might hence know what to offer <hi>gemtus turtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
&amp; columbarum,</hi> a sorrowful and contrite heart, bewail themselves
like Turtles that have lost their mates, and mourn sore like Doves; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up chast and harmless souls, the chastity of the Turtle, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the Dove.</p>
            <p>That (3.) we might no more hereafter censure poverty, even when it
falls to the great mans share, seeing Blessed <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of the <hi>seed
Royal,</hi> both, are become so poor, that they can offer no more than this;
nay, though they should have no more to offer than their own sighs and
moanings.</p>
            <p>That (4.) we might learn now, that God will accept even the least
and poorest presents, two Turtles, two Pigeons, two Mites, where there
is no more with convenience to be spar'd. Yet somewhat he will have
offered, be it never so little, that all might acknowledge his right, none
at all excepted.</p>
            <p>Thus this offering concerns us, but how it concerns the <hi>Child Iesus</hi> is
to be enquired. The one Turtle could not possibly, the sin-offering to
be sure; but the other might: It was a burnt-offering that, a kind of
thanksgiving only for his safe birth, as well as for his Mothers safe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
It was to have been a Lamb, could the womans poverty have
reach'd it, though the sin-offering for no woman, at her purification, had
been above a Turtle: it may be to tell 'um that they are to give thanks both
for themselves and their Child; great thanks, more than double, though
they offer but little, and single, for their own natural imperfections; a
Lamb for them both, though but a Turtle for themselves: The Childs
original guilt to be purged with another kind of sacrifice, better sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
than those. Yet, besides, he taking on him our persons, the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering
might also so far concern him as he concerned us.</p>
            <p>And if so, the greater sure is our obligation to him, that he would
not only take on him <hi>the form of a servant,</hi> but go also under the fashion
of a sinner: that he would be brought into so dishonourable appearance,
to be thus done for <hi>after the custom of the Law;</hi> not only offered himself,
but himself offered for; as if he needed an offering to cleanse him. But
so it was not, for <hi>that</hi> it was not; that he thus submitted to the Law of
offerings, but for these ensuing reasons: and so we consider the reason
of the doing.</p>
            <p>1. To avoid scandal, not to offend the <hi>Iews,</hi> to teach us to be very
scrupulous how we offend our brother, that we use neither but our own right,
nor our Christian liberty with offence.</p>
            <p>2. To teach obedience, not to dispute commands, nor plead priviledges
too much against Laws and Customs.</p>
            <p>3. To be a pattern of humility, not to exalt or cry up our selves, or
think much to be accounted like other men.</p>
            <p>4. To shew his approbation of the Law, and that however he might
seem, yet indeed he did not come to <hi>destroy the Law, but to fulfil it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That he might thus receive the testimony of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57113:122"/>
be made manifest from his very beginning, who he was, that he might
appear to the world what before he did only to the <hi>Wise men</hi> and the
<hi>Shepherds, to be a light to the Gentiles,</hi> and the glory of his people Israel, and
to be this day so proclaimed by the spirit of Prophesie in both the Sexes.</p>
            <p>6. He was done for <hi>according to the Law,</hi> that he might redeem us from
the bondage of the Law, offered as the first-born, as a son of man, that
he might thereby make us the children of God.</p>
            <p>7. He that needed no offering for himself, was thus offered, that we
might with holy <hi>Iob</hi> suspect the best, and perfectest of our works; and
though we be never so righteous, not answer, nor know, but despise our
selves, and make supplication to our judge, <hi>Iob</hi> ix. 15, 21, 28.</p>
            <p>Lastly, He was thus presented to God, that so he might be embraced
by man, that <hi>Simeon,</hi> not for himself only, but for us, might take sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of him, and we be thus put in possession of a Saviour. For so it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
as on purpose, <hi>Then took he him up in his arms and blessed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have done with <hi>Christs offering.</hi> Come we now to our receiving:
his <hi>Parents</hi> presented him to God, <hi>Simeon</hi> received him for us. And these
the particulars of the receiving, <hi>Suscipiens, suscipiendi modus, susceptionis
Tempus, &amp; suscipientis benedictio.</hi> The <hi>Receiver, Simeon,</hi> he, (2.) The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of taking or receiving him, <hi>took him up in his arms.</hi> (3.) The time
then, <hi>when he was brought into the Temple.</hi> (4.) The thanksgiving for it,
and <hi>blessed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our receiving takes me from <hi>Simeons,</hi> I must defer his till anon,
till after ours: only I shall glance at it as I speak of ours. For which I
would to God we were all as well prepared as he for his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same</hi> man <hi>was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and
the Holy Ghost was upon him,</hi> ver. 25. I would I could say so of us here, this
<hi>day, Sed nunquid hos tantum salvabis Domine,</hi> says holy <hi>Bernard, Wilt thou, O
Lord, save only such;</hi> and answers it out of the <hi>Psalm, Iumenta &amp; homines
salvabis Domine. Thou Lord shalt save both man and beast.</hi> Us poor beasts too,
wandering sheep at best, but too often, as unreasonable, as sensual, as
groveling downward as any beast, dirty and filthy as Sows, churlish as
Dogs, fierce as Lions, lustful as Goats, cruel as Tygers, ravenous as
Bears. Accomplish <hi>we</hi> but the days of our purification, purifie we our
hearts by Faith and Repentance, bring we this <hi>gemitus columbae,</hi> sorrow
for our sins, though we cannot this <hi>simplicitatem columbae,</hi> innocense and
purity, the mourning of the Turtle, though we cannot the innocence
of the Dove, and notwithstanding all shall be well.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Candlemas</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> so called from the lighting up of Candles, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, consecrating them, and bearing them in procession; a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom

years ago; or as others say, <hi>Pope Gelastus, Anno</hi> 496. or thereabouts,
to shew that long expected light of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was now come, was
now sprung up, and shined brighter than the Sun at noon, and
might be taken in our hands: let the Ceremony pass, reserve the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
light up the two Candles of Faith and good Works, light them
with the fire of Charity: bear we them burning in our hands, as Christ
commands us; meet we him <hi>with our lamps burning;</hi> consecrate we also
them, all our works and actions with our prayers; offer we them then
upon the Altars of <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> to his honour and glory, and go we
to the Altars of the God of our salvation, <hi>bini &amp; bini,</hi> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi>
speaks, as in procession, <hi>two and two,</hi> in peace and unity together; and
with this solemnity and preparation we poor oxen and asses may come
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57113:123"/>
and approach to our Masters Crib. The Crib is the outward elements,
wherein he lies wrapt up. They are the Swadling-cloths and Mantles
with which his body is covered when he is now offered up to God, and
taken up by us. Take them, and take him: the candle of Faith will
there shew you him, and the candle of Charity will light him down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your arms, that you may embrace him. We embrace where we love,
we take into our arms whom we love; so that love <hi>Iesus</hi> and embrace <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi>
love <hi>Iesus</hi> and take <hi>Iesus;</hi> love <hi>Iesus</hi> and take him into our hands,
and into our arms, and into our mouths, and into our hearts.</p>
            <p>Take him and offer him again, take him up, and offer him up for our
sanctification and redemption, to redeem us from all our sins, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all our righteousnesses; for without him nothing is righteous, nothing
is holy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>day</hi> was his offering day, is to be ours. Offer we then him, offer
we our selves; take we him up into our arms, into our hands and hearts;
having first lighted a candle, and swept our houses to receive and entertain
him: and having humbly, and chearfully, and devoutly, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received him, bless we God.</p>
            <p>God be gracious unto us, and purifie our hearts and hands, that we
may worthily receive him; strengthen our arms that we may hold him,
open our mouths that we may bless him for him; accept our offering,
and Christs offering for us, his perfect sacrifice, for our imperfect offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
that we may receive all the benefits of this great sacrifice, the
remission of our sins, the cleansing of our souls, the refreshing of our
bodies, the fulness of all graces, the protection of our souls and bodies
in this Kingdom af Grace, and the saving them in the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
that as we this <hi>day</hi> bless him here, so we may bless, and praise, and
glorifie him hereafter for evermore.</p>

SERMON

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. LUKE ii. 28.</bibl>
               <q>Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd we have also this <hi>Day</hi> taken him, and are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
again to bless God. Taken him we have in
our hands, in our mouths, <hi>Et dulcedine replentur viscera,
and our bowels are filled with his sweetness,</hi> filled as the
Moon at the Full, and we cannot hold our peace; we
must needs give thanks after this holy Supper for so
royal a Feast.</p>
            <p>Indeed, were the business either of the day, or the taking or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done as soon as we had taken him up in our arms, or down into our
bowels, <hi>Simeon</hi> might have spared his blessing, and both you and I all
further labour: But receiving so glorious great things at the hands of
God, we cannot for shame but return him somewhat, a Thanksgiving
Sermon, or an <hi>Anthem;</hi> and being in the strength of this meat to walk
not only forty days before we thus eat again of this kind of bread, or
drink of this rock, but forty years; perhaps some of us, and all of us
all our lives in the power and strength of this food, in the vertue of this
grace this <hi>day</hi> afforded us, by the efficacy of the offering this <hi>day</hi> offered
for us, we cannot after it be such unclean beasts but that we'll chew the
cud, the meat that this <hi>day</hi> we have taken, and relish our mouths again
with the taste and savour of this days food; refresh our souls and selves
with a thankful remembrance of this days mercy, and offer our
Evening Sacrifice of thanksgiving as we have already done our
morning.</p>
            <p>So that it will not be amiss to take Christ again into our arms, though
but to look upon him, and see what we have taken, what we have done;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57113:124"/>
that if we have taken him somewhat untowardly, as people that are
not used to handle children seldom but do; as people that are not enough
acquainted with <hi>the Child Iesus,</hi> as many do him, as the best handlers of
him amongst us cannot altogether excuse our selves from much imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the doing, we may by a review amend what is amiss, and what
is past in much weakness in the time of receiving, or before it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
towards it, may be corrected for the future by a continued ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him into our arms in a holy life and conversation.</p>
            <p>For many ways there are of taking him, and that is one which above
all is not to be forgotten, as without which all other taking him, is to no
purpose but to play with him, or to mock him. But I must first remember
where I left, and come to that in order as I go.</p>
            <p>Four Particulars I pointed at in the words, four parts of this second
General of <hi>Christs Reception,</hi> or <hi>Simeons gratulatory Acceptation</hi> of him.
<hi>Suscipiens, suscipiendi modus, susceptionis Tempus, &amp; suscipientis benedictio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Taker or Receiver, <hi>Simeon, He.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of taking or receiving him, <hi>Took him up in his arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of this taking, <hi>Then,</hi> when he was brought into the Temple,
and presented there.</p>
            <p>The Takers or Receivers Gratulation, or Thanksgiving for it, <hi>and
blessed God. Then took he,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Taker or Receiver of Christ, <hi>He</hi> comes first to be taken notice of,
and <hi>Simeon</hi> was <hi>He.</hi> The common and most received opinion of him is,
that he was a <hi>Priest.</hi> For the Priests Office it was to receive the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Lord; and behold here, <hi>He</hi> it is that takes him into his arms,
and receives him at the hands of his Parents, as <hi>Eli</hi> did <hi>Samuel</hi> of <hi>Elkanah</hi>
and <hi>Anna,</hi> 1 Sam. i. 25. And (2.) their Office it was to bless the people,
<hi>Aarons</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Num.</hi> vi. 23. and that does <hi>Simeon,</hi> ver. 34. Takes
the Child, and blesses the Parents, <hi>He:</hi> But the Christian Priests does
more, blesses the Child too. No Priest of the <hi>Law</hi> could do that. 'Tis
the Minister of the <hi>Gospel</hi> only that can do that, that has that Authority,
to consecrate, and bless, and take, and all. He it is that blesses the
dead Elements, and quickens them into holy things by the ministration
of his Office, by the vertue of his Function. Till he blesses, they are
but common bread and wine; when he has taken and offered them, then
they are holy; then they are the means, and pledges, and seals of grace;
then they convey Christ unto the faithful Receivers soul. This is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Gospel, and so I speak it, not literally of Christs Person, but
mystically of his body and bloud, as offered and taken in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But after the blessing, the taking concerns us all; and though perhaps
it concerns us not, whether <hi>Simeon</hi> was a Priest or not; yet it both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us, that he that blesses and offers be a Priest, as much as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us, that it be the Sacrament we would have, which cannot be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but by the hands to which Christ committed that power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and (2.) that we our selves that take be some way qualified in the
same respects as old <hi>Simeon</hi> here, of whom we may be certain of his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
whatever of his Priesthood.</p>
            <p>The holy Spirit bears witness to him, that <hi>He</hi> was a just man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>ver. 25. just</hi> and upright in his dealing, <hi>in the righteousness which is by the
Law unblameable,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> of himself; yet has even such a one need of
Christ, is not fully and compleatly righteous till he take Christ into his
arms by faith, till he add the righteousness which is by faith. Yet is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57113:124"/>
that other so good a disposition to this, that (whatever some men, to
excuse their own laziness, or looseness, and the devil to encourage it,
have ungodlily vented to the World, that the moral, righteous, honest
man is further off from Christ than the most dissolute and debauched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
yet) we see the first that takes hold on Christ is said to be a just,
that is a moral honest man, who does all right and justice, no wrong or
injury to his neighbour; and whoever he is that Christ suffers to take
him into his arms, has already cleansed his hands by some works of
Repentance, and at least, stedfast resolution to be what is said
of <hi>Simeon, homo justus,</hi> to be righteous and just without such purposes at
least, no taking him to be sure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> is (2.) stil'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>devout</hi> and pious, <hi>homo timoratus,</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it, <hi>a man timorous</hi> to offend God, and reverently respecting holy
things. And with such affections, devotion, and reverence, and fear,
and trembling are we to approach the Table of the Lord, to receive and
take him; we shall else take nothing but the rags he is wrapt in, himself
will vanish out of our hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> (3.) was that <hi>He</hi> that <hi>waited for the consolation of Israel.</hi> And none
but such a <hi>He,</hi> one that waits, and looks, and longs, and thirsts, and
hungers after Christ, the <hi>consolation of Israel,</hi> and all the <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
too, none but he shall have the honour and happiness of Christs
Embraces; to them only that look for him will he appear either in grace
or glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vpon him</hi> (4.) <hi>was the Holy Ghost,</hi> and he only who is the <hi>Temple of the
Holy Ghost,</hi> whose soul is so, whose body is so, shall truly and really touch
<hi>the Child Iesus.</hi> He will not dwell or come into those arms which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost has not made holy. Holy things must not be cast to dogs, to the
unclean and impure, nor be laid up in unclean places; nor indeed <hi>can</hi> any
receive him, or so much as call him by his name, but by the Holy Ghost,
how fain soever he would call or come.</p>
            <p>This Point would have done well to have been considered before your
receiving, and I hope you did; but it is seasonable too now, that if you
have purified your selves before, approach't in righteousness with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reverence, with hungring and thirsting, believing and hoping
for him, and in the power of the Holy Ghost, you may so continue: if
you have been deficient in any, you may re-enforce your selves, ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and set your selves the more strictly to righteousness, and devotion,
good desires, and holy practises hereafter.</p>
            <p>As there is none too young to be brought to him, so there is none too
old to come and take him. Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> now ready to depart the World,
has yet strength enough to hold this Child in his aged arms; him that
by being held upholds him and all the World; none too old for Christs
company. Though he be here a Child, he is the <hi>Ancient of days</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
There's no pretending age against his service. In the old Law
the <hi>Priests</hi> at fifty were exempted from the service of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the
<hi>Mosaical</hi> service of the <hi>Law:</hi> but nor fifty, nor sixty, nor a hundred, nor
any years can excuse us from the service of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> Christs service, nor
debarr us from it. To that, the outward strength and vigour of the body
was necessary: To Christ, the inward vivacity and action of of the soul
will suffice where the body can do little. And as there is no time too
long for Christs Service, not from our first childhood to our second; so
there is none too late, if but strength to reach out a hand, and take that
which is no burthen, but an ease to bear the greatest ease of the sick, or
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57113:125"/>
weary, or aged soul. This is a Point may comfort us when all worldly
comforts are past us; When, like old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> we have neither pleasure
nor taste in our meat or drink, we may find sweetness in Christs body and
bloud. When the Grashopper is a burden, this Child is none, when the
<hi>keepers of the house tremble,</hi> our hands may yet hold <hi>him</hi> full fast; when
they that <hi>look out of the windows be darkned</hi> we may stedfastly behold <hi>him;</hi>
when <hi>the grinders cease</hi> we may yet eat this bread of life; he that <hi>rises at
the voice of the bird</hi> may sleep soundly with this Child in his arms; when
<hi>all desire shall fail,</hi> this desire of the Nations will not leave him; when
he is <hi>going to his long home,</hi> this Child will both accompany and conduct
him to his rest.</p>
            <p>O the comfort of this Child in our old age, when we are ready to go
out of the World, ready to depart; no comfort like it; no warmth like
that which reflects from the flesh of this young Child, his being flesh,
made and offered to us, and taken by us. When no <hi>Abishag</hi> can warm us,
this <hi>Shunamite</hi> can. When none can cherish us, he can <hi>stay us with flaggons,</hi>
and <hi>comfort us with Apples,</hi> Cant. ii. 5. when no earthly fire in our bosoms
can give us heat, with this Child in our arms we grow young again, and
renew our years unto eternity. O comfortable and happy old age that has
his arms furnished with the <hi>Child Iesus. Forsake me not, O Lord, in mine old
age,</hi> nor draw thy self out of mine arms <hi>when I am gray-headed,</hi> and I shall
seek no other love, no other embraces.</p>
            <p>Thus have I shewed you <hi>Simeons</hi> silver head, and golden hands; <hi>Simeon</hi>
with <hi>Iesus in his arms,</hi> an old man holding of a Child, a Priest embracing
of his King, a servant entertaining of his Lord, the <hi>First Adam</hi> laying
hold upon the <hi>Second,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> catching at the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the Old World
courting of the New, Age and Youth, State and Religion, Humility and
Greatness, Weakness and Strength, Rigonr and Mercy, Time and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
embracing. 'Tis a happy day that makes this union, where the
imperfection of the one is helpt out and perfected by the perfections of
the other. And 'tis the happier, in that now in the next place it directs
us how to bear a part in this union, and communicate in this happiness,
<hi>Et ipse accepit eum in ulnas,</hi> by taking him into our arms from whom comes
all this <hi>peace upon earth,</hi> and <hi>good will among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several are the ways of taking Christ. We take him in at our ears,
when we hear him in his Word. We take him in our mouths, when we
confess him. We take him into our hearts, when we desire and love
him. We take him unto our necks, when we submit to his obedience.
We take him upon our knees, when we pray unto him. We take him
into our heads, when we meditate and think upon him. 'Tis good taking
him any of these ways, nay, all he must be taken.</p>
            <p>But our business at this time is, in our arms or hands to do it, and so to
take him is,</p>
            <p>First, To believe and hope in him. Faith and Hope are the two arms
of the soul, whereby we take and entertain whatsoever it is we love. And
here <hi>Simeon</hi> did so: he would not so have waited for the consolation of
<hi>Israel</hi> had he not fully believed and hoped strongly to attain it; nor
would he have either so have stretcht out his hands to bless the
Parents, nor his arms to receive the Child, nor his voice to sing so loud
salvation to the ends of the World, that <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> both might
hear it.</p>
            <p>2. To take him in our hands and arms is to receive him in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Those are the two arms that the Church opens to take him.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57113:125"/>
               <hi>Baptism,</hi> as the left hand, the weaker, for young weaklings; and the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> as the right and stronger, for those of riper and stronger years;
and in these arms he lies at all times to be found, with them he is taken;
and when at any time we duly and devoutly use them we take him by
them. And by the one of them we have I hope all of us this day taken
him.</p>
            <p>3. But there is yet a way, and arms every day to take him with. Good
works are the hands, and the two branches of Charity; Divine Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Brotherly love, that divide the two Tables of the Law betwixt
them, are the two arms that embrace him: The good works that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the first are the hands of the one, and they that issue from the
second are the other. And I may have leave to call the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
the ten fingers that make the hands that receive him. Only
here's one thing to be observed, and worth it too, that these hands and
fingers, the duties of the Moral Law, are to take Christ to them, his
merits to supply their defects, his strength to actuate their weakness, his
faith to raise their flagging dulness and earthy heaviness, which till then
looks not high enough beyond worldly interests, ere they can reach
heaven.</p>
            <p>But by these hands thus ordered, purified, and lifted up, no fear of
taking Christ wholly, with his greatest benefits and utmost relations.
You need not fear the hands, or doubt the vertue of them that are thus
first enabled by Christ, but that they are the truest power we hold him
by. Let but our goodness die, our righteousness fail, our good deeds
vanish out of sight, and Christ does too; he that is the eternal Wisdom
will not dwell in a body that is subject unto sin, that is the vassal of Satan
under the dominion or habit of any iniquity.</p>
            <p>By these hands therefore you are dayly to embrace him. These are
the hands that keep him too, that hold him fast. So long as our good
Works, so long continues he; so long as our Sanctification, so long our
Justification; if the one goes, the other does not stay; no, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
says God. God himself forgets it, as if it had not been,
when once the righteous turns from his righteousness and turns wicked.
This day (my beloved) you have taken Christ by the hand of the holy
Sacrament. That was your morning service; Take him now hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by continuance in well-doing, by loving God, by loving your
neighbour, those two arms of Charity, and by all the fingers, and joynts,
and nerves of good works, all sorts of good works, that you never more
be deprived of him.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>suscipere</hi> is somewhat more. <hi>Sub capere, &amp; sursum capere,</hi> or in the
<hi>English,</hi> to take him up. Take up his cross and follow him. Put your
neck under even his hardest yoke if he point it out. That's <hi>Capere sub &amp;
super</hi> too, to take on and up, to deny your selves, and submit to any
affliction, any cross, any persecution, any loss of liberty, or limb, or
life, or goods, or friends, or any thing, rather than part with <hi>Iesus,</hi> than
part our arms to let him go, than any way part with our part, any part
or portion in him.</p>
            <p>And then lastly, <hi>Sursum capere;</hi> Take him up and offer him again unto
his Father: Offer him as our Lamb for a burnt-offering; offer him as
our Turtle for a sin-offering, for he is our Turtle, of whom it is said, <hi>the
voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land,</hi> Cant. ii. 10. offer him as our Dove
for a Sacrifice of thanksgiving, for he is our love and Dove, <hi>Cant.</hi> ii. 13, 14.
Offer him for our meat-offering, for he is our meat, <hi>the</hi> very <hi>bread that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57113:126"/>
came down from heaven,</hi> fittest therefore of all bread to be offered to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
again.</p>
            <p>Offer we him as our <hi>Turtur</hi> in our solitude and retirement; <hi>Turtur avis
solitaria, the Turtle is a solitary bird.</hi> Offer him as our <hi>Dove,</hi> in company,
and in our Congregations. <hi>Columba avis gregaria. Doves fly by flocks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Offer him in our contemplation, and offer him in our practical
conversation.</p>
            <p>And offer we up our selves together with him, for it is an offering day,
and we must not stand out, nor come in empty; offer up, I say, our selves
as Turtles and Doves; some, their single estate with the Turtle; others,
their married with the Dove. Offer we up the Turtles sighs instead of
wanton Songs: The Turtles chastity and purity, and the Doves simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Let our lives be full of sorrow for our sins, and compassions to our
brother, full of purity and innocency. Keep we still this <hi>sursum in susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere,</hi>
upon the tops of the Mountains, with the Turtle, as near heaven
as can be. Set no more our foot upon the green trees, or boughs (as the
Turtle does not when his Mate is dead) rest we no more upon the green
and flourishing, the light and leavy pleasures of the World, but spend
the residue of this mournful life in bewailing the widowed Church, our
lost both Spouse and Mother, our deceased Husband and Father to. Thus
taking Christ and his Offering, and proportioning ours according to it,
our heaviness may again be turned into joy, a joyful light spring up
again, our Purification become also a <hi>Candlemas,</hi> an illustrious day of lights
and glories.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Candlemas day</hi> I tell you again. Let it be so henceforward with
you for ever, perpetual <hi>Candlemas,</hi> perpetual <hi>Christmas;</hi> your good works
perpetually shine before men, that they also may glorifie your Father by
that light, and nothing be henceforth heard of but Christ, in your hands,
and arms, and mouths, all your words, and works, and lives, and
deaths, nothing but Christ, nothing but Christ; as if you were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
full this day, as <hi>Simeons</hi> arms, with the <hi>Child Iesus,</hi> with the <hi>Lords
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This work is never unseasonable. Christ may at all times be taken <hi>so</hi>
with reverence, into our mouths, or arms, or hearts, or any part
about us. Yet he has a proper time besides, and that is when he is
presented in the Temple after his <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and his mothers <hi>Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At such a time as that, when our hearts are purified by repentance
and faith; when the devout soul, which like his Mother, conceives and
brings him forth, has accomplished the days of her Purification, and
offered the forementioned offerings of the Turtle and the Dove, and we
circumcised with the Circumcision of the Spirit, all our excrescent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
exorbitant affections, and superfluous desires cut off, we may
with confidence take him into our arms: But till then 'tis too much saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciness
to come so near him, at least presumption to conceive we have him
truly in our arms, that he is truly embraced by us, whilst we have other
loves, other affections, which cannot abide with him, already in our arms,
and too ready in our hands.</p>
            <p>Prophane we him not therefore with unhallowed hands, nor touch this
holy Ark of the Covenant with irreverent fingers, lest we die. Many
that have done so, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> for so doing <hi>are sick</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> upon it,
and <hi>many sleep,</hi> that is, die suddenly in their sins, <hi>whilst the</hi> hallowed <hi>meat
is yet in their mouths.</hi> 'Tis as dangerous as death and damnation too to take
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57113:126"/>
Christ with unpurified and unprepared hearts or hands. Take him not
then till you are prepared.</p>
            <p>Yet (2.) if prepared, take him when you can, and as soon as you can,
when he is offered to you, whilst you may. To day if you will; 'tis of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
day with him yet any day too when he is offered, and whilst he is
so, for he always will not be so, 'twill not be always <hi>Candlemas,</hi> he will
not be offered every day. There is a time when he will go and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
when he will not any longer strive with flesh, when we shall stretch
out our hands and he will not come, nor hear, nor see us neither. <hi>To day,</hi> if
you will do it, do it; you are not sure of your selves to morrow, much
less of him. To day, if you will, if not, I know not what day to pitch,
nor will you find it easie to meet another if you at any time neglect the
present. This <hi>day,</hi> then, <hi>whilst it is called to day,</hi> lay hold of him if you be
wise, and would not be put off by him with a <hi>Discedite,</hi> hands off, I have
nothing to do with you, nor you with me, it is too late.</p>
            <p>Many are the times and days, as well as means and ways, wherein
Christ is offered to us; but this <hi>day</hi> he has been thrust into our arms, put
into our hands, and we have taken him. Yet, say I still, take him up
in your arms, and I say it without either <hi>tautology,</hi> or impertinence, or
impropriety. Into our hands we have taken him, and I hope into our
arms, into our bosoms, into our hearts besides; take him yet up higher
and higher into our affections, the very natural arms of our souls, more
and more into them, nearer and nearer to us, closer and closer to our
hearts; embrace and hug him close, as we those we most affectionate-love,
and hold him fast, that he may no more depart from us, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to be with us as with those that so love him that they cannot live
without him.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis no impertinence to wish you to take him still, though you
have taken him. Thus you are every day to take him, or this <hi>days</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him will come to nothing, or to worse. If you go not on, still ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him nearer and nearer, deeper and deeper every day into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms
and hearts, as you have this day into your hands and mouths, you
will be questioned in indignation by him; Why have you taken me into
your mouths? Why have you taken me up in your hands, seeing you
now seem to hate me, are so soon grown weary of me, and put me from
you, and even cast me behind you? Take heed, I beseech you, of doing
thus, of drawing back your hands so soon, drawing back at all. For
after this favour, whereby you have been made partakers of him,
whereby he has so infinitely condescended from himself, as to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into so unclean, and filthy, and extremely unworthy hands and souls,
to be embraced by such vile Creatures, what can we render him suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for such goodness? 'Tis but this, O man, that he requires, a poor
thing, O man, that he requires at thy hand for this vast infinite favour,
and thou hast <hi>Simeon</hi> here doing it before thee, blessing God. <hi>And he took
him up in his arms and blessed God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, we can do little if we cannot bless, bless him that blesses us;
<hi>benedicere,</hi> speak well of him; say he is good and gracious, loving and
merciful unto us; tell and speak forth his praise, tell and declare
the great and gracious things that he hath done for us, the wonderful
things that he this day did for the Children of men; Came and took
their place, and was presented and accepted for them, who were but
reffuse and rejected persons, were fain to send Bulls, and Lambs, and
Rams, the very beasts, to plead for them; glad of any thing to stand
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57113:127"/>
between them and their offended God, even the heifers dung, and ashes,
to make atonement for them; and as it were, her skin to cover them,
<hi>Numb.</hi> xix. 2. till this day, when this holy Child was presented for all; and
all those former poor shifts and shelters at an end: no need of those dead
offerings more, being fully reconciled by this living one for ever. Bless
we him, and praise him, and speak good of him for this.</p>
            <p>Bless we him yet more, for vouchsafing us the touches of his sacred
Body, for so kindly coming into our arms; our own children do not
sometimes do so, but come often with much frowardness and crying,
reluctance and unwillingness. This <hi>Child Iesus</hi> comes of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
slips down from Heaven into our laps when we are not aware, is
in our arms e're we can stir them up. And that this Son of God should
so willingly leave his Fathers bosom, the true and only seat of joy, and
pleasure, for ours, the perfect seat of sorrow and misery; and rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in our weak arms, who have nor rest nor shelter, but in his: that he
should thus really infinitely bless us, and yet require no greater a return,
than our imperfect blessing him again: How can we keep our lips shut,
our tongues silent of his praise.</p>
            <p>But having this day seal'd all these favours and blessings to us, by the
holy Sacrament, the pledge and seal of this love wherewith he loved us;
having so really, and fully, and manifestly, and fast, given himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our arms, we cannot sure but bless him both with our tongues and
hands; with holy <hi>Simeon</hi> make an <hi>Hymn</hi> of his goodness, an <hi>Anthem</hi> of
his love, a <hi>Psalm</hi> of his mercy, and in sweet numbers carol forth his
praise: set our heads to do it, our hearts to endite it, our pens to write
it, our voices to sing it, and with the <hi>three Children</hi> in their Song, invite
all the creatures in Heaven and Earth, Angels, and men, all the sensible
and insensible creatures to bear us company; so to make a full noise of
all kinds of Musick, to set forth his praise. Do it with our hands too,
do that which will exalt his praise. Then 'tis <hi>benedixit</hi> complete, when
it has <hi>benefecit</hi> next it. We speak best when we do best, when our lives
and actions speak it, <hi>Benedixit &amp; bene vixit,</hi> are not so near of sound
for nothing. A holy life is not more truly Gods blessing to man, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it is mans chiefest and most acceptable blessing God.</p>
            <p>Many ways may this blessing God be performed by us, but as we stand
now with some relation to this days blessing; the blessed <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the
feast of blessing, <hi>the cup of blessing,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> stiles it. I shall shew you
now you have taken it, what blessing is more peculiarly required after it.</p>
            <p>Three acts of blessing there are to be performed after this act of so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Christ into our arms; and for it three points of blessing for this
great blessing of the Holy Communion, <hi>Thanksgiving, Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</hi>
Bless him and give thanks to him. Bless him and offer up his Son to
him again, and our selves with him; offer his Son in our own arms, him
and our selves. Bless him and present our petitions to him, our prayers
as well as praises. Or in the language of the <hi>Text, Benedicamus.</hi> Speak
well of him, do somewhat for him, and bring our requests and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him. You see I need not run out of the <hi>Text</hi> for any kind of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>First then, Bless him with your tongues, <hi>Speak good of his Name,</hi> and
let your lips speak forth his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>wonderous works;</hi> tell the world
what he has done for you, what great and mighty things, <hi>Salutem ejus
evangelizate,</hi> Psal. xcvi. 4. Tell it out for good tidings, the tidings of
great joy. Be always speaking, always telling it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:57113:127"/>Call to all the creatures to bear you company, every thing to rejoyce
with you. Tell your happiness to the Woods and Mountains, in your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
retirements; tell it to the <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> speak of it in all
companies; tell it to the young Men and Maids, old Men and Children,
all Sexes and Ages, what God has done for your souls. Tell it to the
<hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> both in your prosperity and adversity: let nothing
make you forget your thanks. Tell it to the <hi>Frost</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> in your cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and in your fervencies and zeals; to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and to the <hi>Waters;</hi>
in your drinesses of soul, and in the sorrows of your hearts: praise him
in all conditions, Tell it to the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Heavens,</hi> as you are about
your heavenly business. Tell it to the Fowls of the Air, even in the midst
of your airy thoughts, and projects, that they may be such as may set
forth his glory. Tell it to the <hi>Priests</hi> and Servants of the Lord, to <hi>solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi>
your thanksgiving. Tell it to the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of the righteous,
to bear a part with you in your Song; and intreat them all, all estates
and orders, all conditions and things, to bring in each their blessing, to
make up <hi>one</hi> great and worthyblessing for this days blessing, to rejoyce and
sing, exult and triumph with you for this happy <hi>arm-full</hi> of eternal blessings
this day bestowed upon you. Begin we the blessing: blessing, and honour,
and power, and glory, and thanks, and praise, and worship, and great
glory be unto <hi>God,</hi> for ever and ever, and let all the creatures say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bless we him secondly with our <hi>Offerings.</hi> Hold we up first our hands,
and bless him; hold we up our hands and vow, and resolve to serve him
from henceforth with hand and heart, and all our members; offer him
our vows and resolutions, holy ones; strengthen our hands, and renew
our purposes to serve him now henceforward with a <hi>high</hi> hand; <hi>maugre</hi>
all the pleasures and profits of the world, say what they will against it,
with a <hi>strong</hi> hand; do they what they dare or can against us. Bless him
and resolve to bless him for ever; and every day renew we still our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
that our hands <hi>may</hi> be so strengthened by them, that none may be
able to take him out of our hands.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Catch</hi> we fast hold of him with our hands, when we bless him; clasp
him fast by a <hi>lively</hi> hope, as assured that all our hope is in him, all our
hope in holding him, clasp we him fast and bless him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spread</hi> your arms, and bless him with your <hi>Faith.</hi> Open your souls,
and every day more and more let him come in: let it be your continual
exercise more and more to trust him, to rely upon him.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Open</hi> your hands, and cast down your blessings upon the poor: He
that blesses the <hi>poor,</hi> blesses <hi>God.</hi> What you have done to them, says
<hi>Christ,</hi> you did to <hi>me,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. <hi>Open</hi> your hands, and bless <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Cross</hi> your hands, and beat your breasts: Bless him with your hands
a cross, as humbly acknowledging your vileness and unworthiness of so
great a favour as his presence; as the seeing, and touching, and handling,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asting him. He truly blesses <hi>God</hi> on high, that thus makes himself
low.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Fill</hi> your hands and bless him; bless him with a full hand, both
your hands full of blessings; blessings of all sorts, all good works and
vertues. An <hi>universal obedience</hi> is the onliest blessing <hi>God: Simeon</hi> being
interpreted is <hi>obedient;</hi> and he it is that here blesses, the obedient soul
that at any time only truly blesses God.</p>
            <p>7, <hi>Wash</hi> we yet our hands before we either open or spread, or hold up,
or cross, or clasp, or fill them: <hi>Wash</hi> we before we bless, wash away our
impurities with our tears, bewail and bemoan our defects, and weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57113:128"/>
and imperfections, which in our receiving have been too many; that
by this hand our oblation and blessing may be offered with pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
hands and hearts.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Clap</hi> we then our hands and bless him; do it with <hi>joy</hi> and not with
grief: we may do it well when we have so washt them first. Let it be
our way of blessing to do it chearfully, to settle our selves to all the
works of piety and obedience, of faith, and hope, and charity, and
humility: and in a word, to an universal righteousness, with all the
purity we can, with all the strength and resolution we are able. Bless
with a chearful and ready hand, set our selves ever hereafter merrily to
this work.</p>
            <p>But remember we all this while we so use our hands to bless, that we
so open and shut, so spread and cross them, that we let not <hi>Christ</hi> go <hi>out</hi>
the while. Offer we up our selves and him together: Resolve we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall take <hi>him,</hi> shall take <hi>us</hi> too. We will not part, no not in death;
we will live, and die, and sleep, and rise again together: He that will
have him shall have us, whether he will or no: He is in our arms, <hi>there</hi>
we will keep him. Yet in lieu of parting with him we will part with our
selves, and offer our selves for him if that will do it, <hi>yes,</hi> and that will
do it. <hi>Duo minuta habeo Domine corpus &amp; animam,</hi> says the devout <hi>Father.</hi>
I have two mites, O Lord, I have two mites to offer; to give thee for
thy Son, to offer thee for him; my <hi>soul</hi> and my <hi>body.</hi> Them thou shalt
have willingly: I am content to part with <hi>them,</hi> so I may keep <hi>him,</hi> and
<hi>they</hi> will content him. Offer them up then a living, reasonable sacrifice,
for it will be an acceptable service too, an acceptable blessing of him.</p>
            <p>Yet as we offer up our selves, we must now lastly offer up <hi>Christ</hi> too.
He gave him to us, to be an offering for us; to sanctifie all our offerings,
for a blessing to us, to bless all our blessings. And for the imperfection
of all our righteousness, offerings and sacrifices, prayers, and praises,
and blessings to make them accepted, which in themselves, and their
weak performances no way deserve, he was given us to <hi>offer.</hi> His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
will make amends for our imperfections, his purity for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities,
his strength for our weakness; and for them, when we have
done all we can to be accepted, we must offer <hi>him,</hi> or have all rejected.
We must when we begin to bless, turn our selves with old <hi>Iacob,</hi> to this
<hi>Caput lectuli,</hi> this beds-head, whereon only the soul can rest, or lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the top of this <hi>Staff,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> renders it, the only staff
wherein old <hi>Israel</hi> trusts; the only staff whereon we rely for mercy, and
acceptance. This is the name of the <hi>Angel,</hi> in whom only we are to
bless, in whom only we are blest, in whom either <hi>God</hi> blesses us, or <hi>we</hi>
him. This is the <hi>sum,</hi> he the chief of all our oblations, all our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
by oblation: and the blessing both of our resolutions and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
all: without whom we can do neither the one nor other; neither
resolve good nor practice it. He therefore is to be offered with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to <hi>God</hi> by us; his merits only to be pleaded by us, and the form
of all our blessing thus to run, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy
holy Son, the Child Iesus give the praise.</hi> It was not our own arm that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to him, 'tis not our own arms that can hold him, 'tis not our own
strength that can keep him, 'tis not our own hands that can present any
offering worthy of the least acceptance. To <hi>God</hi> only therefore be the
praise, to <hi>Chrìst</hi> only the merit of all our blessings.</p>
            <p>Thus are we lastly to pray too, that <hi>God</hi> would accept us and our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
<hi>Bless</hi> him with our <hi>petitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:57113:128"/>1. That he would please to pardon all our sins, or pass by all our
weaknesses in this days, in every days performance: our neglects, our
coldnesses, our drinesses, our wearinesses, and all the issues of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
any ways.</p>
            <p>That (2.) he would accept our offerings, and be pleased with us in
his Son, accept us in his beloved.</p>
            <p>That (3.) he would grant us the benefit of that holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> which
we have this day received; all the benefits of his Death and Passion,
the full remission of all our sins, and the fulness of all his graces signified
and conveyed by those dreadful mysteries.</p>
            <p>That (4.) he would particularly arm us every one of us, against their
particular corruptions with strength and grace proportionable to every
one, and effectual to us all. For proper and particular petitions, rising
from the sense of our several necessities, are this day proper to be askt,
and as easie to be obtained, whilst it is his own day, in which he invited
us to him; and will deny us nothing that we shall earnestly, faithfully,
and devoutly ask him. For this also to pray, to petition, is <hi>benedicere,</hi> and
it is a way of blessing <hi>God</hi> to offer up our prayers; thereby acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and confessing his power and goodness, which is no less in other words
than to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>bless</hi> him: He that <hi>offers praise</hi> honours him, and he
that presents prayers, professes and proclaims him Almighty Father,
gracious, and good, and glorious <hi>God,</hi> at the very first dash, <hi>God blessed for
evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Light up now your <hi>Candles</hi> at this evening Service, for the glory of
your morning Sacrifice: 'tis <hi>Candlemas.</hi> Become we all burning <hi>and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lights,</hi> to do honour to this day, and the blessed armful of it. Let
your souls shine bright with grace, your hands with good works: Let
God see it, and let man see it; so bless we God. Walk we as Children
of the <hi>light,</hi> as so many <hi>walking lights;</hi> and offer we our selves up like so
many holy Candles to the <hi>Father of light.</hi> But be sure we <hi>light</hi> all our
<hi>lights</hi> at this babes <hi>eyes,</hi> that lies so enfolded in our arms; and neither
use nor acknowledge any other light for better than darkness, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from any other but this eternal light, upon whom all our best
thoughts, and words, and works must humbly now attend like so many
petty sparks, or rays, or glimmerings darted from, and perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
thankfully to that glorious light; from this day beginning our
blessing God, the only lightsome kind of life, till we come to the land
of <hi>light,</hi> there to offer up continual praises, sing endless <hi>Benedicite's,</hi> and
<hi>Allelujahs,</hi> no longer according to the Laws or Customs upon earth, but
after the manner of Heaven, and in the <hi>Choire</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> with holy <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi>

he lead us by the hand, who this day came to lie in our arms; he
make all our offerings accepted, who was at this <hi>Feast</hi> presented for us;

that we might bless him again: and he one day in our several due times

Chapter;</hi> the committing the word and office of
this reconciliation to his Ministers, <hi>ver. 20. of the same
Chapter;</hi> the perswading us not to receive this grace
in vain, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, of <hi>this;</hi> the time certainly wherein we
may thus be reconciled, thus accepted to salvation, is worth the seeing,
worth a <hi>Behold,</hi> and a <hi>Behold;</hi> worth laying hold on too, a <hi>time</hi> to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi>
being a <hi>day of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>is the time,</hi> says the <hi>Text,</hi> we are fallen upon. And <hi>now is the
Time</hi> say the Days we are faln among: Times of reconciliation, both.
<hi>Days of Salvation,</hi> both. Indeed, the whole <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is no other.
Yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> applies it here to the Age he wrote in. We may draw it
down to ours we live in. But the <hi>Church,</hi> more particularly yet, applies
it to the time we are now in keeping, the holy time of <hi>Lent;</hi> a time
wherein the Office of Reconciliation is set open to receive sinners in; a
<hi>time</hi> when the <hi>Embassadors for Christ</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> stiles us, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. of the
foregoing <hi>Chapter) we that are workers together with him,</hi> ver. 5. are more
earnestly to beseech the people, and the people more especially to bestir
themselves by the works of mortification and repentance to reconcile
themselves to God; a time when in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> notorious sinners
<hi>were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in
the day of the Lord,</hi> says our <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Commination;</hi> and she her self by
making these words part of her <hi>Epistle</hi> for the <hi>First Sunday in Lent,</hi> she
cries out to us, as it were, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is
the day of salvation,</hi> this very <hi>time,</hi> make much of it, and lay hold upon
it.</p>
            <p>I shall give all their right, take in all the time we can, that seeing an
<hi>accepted time</hi> there is, <hi>a day of salvation</hi> to be had, still to be had, we may
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57113:129"/>
be sure not to miss it. 'Tis no idle trivial business, this; We cannot be
too careful for it. General and particular days and times, all to be taken,
and all little enough to obtain salvation; not to be thought much of
(though it were much more) so we may but compass <hi>that</hi> at last.</p>
            <p>I shall not therefore spend so precious time to study curiosity in a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
so serious, or to torture the <hi>Text</hi> into nice Divisions. It shall suffice
to shew you in these particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That an <hi>accepted time</hi> there is, some time, above others, wherein God
is most ready to accept us.</item>
               <item>2. That this <hi>accepted time</hi> is a <hi>day of salvation</hi> too; wherein we shall not
only meerly be <hi>accepted,</hi> but <hi>accepted</hi> so far also as to <hi>salvation,</hi> one or
other. <hi>Now is the day of</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>3. That <hi>Now is the Time,</hi> this is the <hi>Day.</hi> It is before us, it is in present
we need look no further.</item>
               <item>4. That God himself here points us to it; bids us <hi>behold</hi> it; sets an
<hi>Ecce,</hi> a mark upon it; a red Letter, as it were, upon the <hi>Day,</hi> that
we might mark and mind it, mind it above all other days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</item>
               <item>5. That we are therefore to do accordingly. <hi>Behold,</hi> and <hi>behold</hi> it
<hi>now,</hi> and again <hi>behold</hi> it, again and again, and so <hi>behold</hi> it as to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>
it, and apply us to it: bring all ends of the <hi>Text</hi> together,
that we may find <hi>Salvation</hi> in the end. 'Tis an <hi>accepted Time,</hi> we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make it so as well as count it so, make it perfectly <hi>accepted</hi> by
accepting it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These shall be the Particulars, and of them all, this is the sum; That
God in his goodness allowing us time to repent, to receive his grace, to
reconcile our selves to him, and lay hold upon salvation, giving us
daily deliverances and salvations too; nay, shewing, and setting, and
pointing us out here a time to accept and save us in; It is certainly our
duty to take notice of it, even <hi>now</hi> to do it, even as soon as may be to
accept his goodness and not neglect the <hi>day of salvation.</hi> And</p>
            <p>That we may not, but both accept and be accepted, we shall shew you
first that such a time there is wherein we may. A time (1.) <hi>still</hi> wherein we
may find acceptation; that God has not shut up the day, and shut us out.
A time (2.) wherein God is readiest to accept us, readier than at other
times. That there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as well as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a season, as well as time
for it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to, a seasonable opportunity, when it will be the
easier done, <hi>The accepted time.</hi> A time (3.) yet so confin'd and limited,
that, for ought we know, there may be none beyond it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is not
always, the season holds not ever. And <hi>Now is the Time,</hi> says in effect,
anon perhaps it will not be; for this <hi>time</hi> in the next words is expounded
into a <hi>day;</hi> and we know the day spends, and night will come on apace:
So that a time, a ready time, a limited time there is for our repentance, and
Gods accepting us. These three make up our first Particular we are now
to begin with.</p>
            <p>And (1.) that God still allows us time is worth a note. He does not
owe it us. He might snatch us away in the height and fulness of our sins
with as much justice, as he does it not in mercy. But he <hi>deals not with us
after our sins, nor rewards us according to our wickedness,</hi> says Holy <hi>David,
Psal.</hi> ciii. 10. <hi>Twelve hours of the day there are,</hi> St. Joh. xii. 9. and every one of
them God is not only ready to receive us, but goes out to seek us, St. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xx. 3. and so on. And <hi>at what time soever a Sinner doth repent,</hi> (so it ran of
old) and <hi>when</hi> he does, (so it runs now) and both the same, he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57113:130"/>
shall save his soul, God will accept him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 32.</p>
            <p>2. Yet for all that (.2.) all times are not alike. We will not always
find admittance at the same rate, with the same ease. As he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be chiding, so he will not always be so pleasing neither. We may
knock, and knock again, and yet stand without a while, sometimes so
long till our knees are ready to sink under us, our eyes ready to drop out,
as well as drop with expectation, and our hearts ready to break in pieces,
while none heareth, or none regardeth. We should have come before,
or pitcht our coming at a better time. God is in bed, as it were, and at
rest with his Children, cherishing and making much of them, he is
not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leisure to open to such strangers. We must knock hard and
importunately too, to get him to open to us We are out of time.</p>
            <p>But is he, who is <hi>no accepter of persons,</hi> become now an accepter of
times? Or would he have us turn observers of them? Is there ever a
star in heaven that can bring us into favour with the <hi>Father of lights?</hi> Any
so lucky an aspect there that can guide us up into his presence? Can
any, or all the Planets in <hi>Sextile, Trine,</hi> or <hi>Square,</hi> or any position else, make
us fortunate in our new <hi>Nativities,</hi> or second <hi>Births,</hi> or give us audience
with the <hi>Almighty?</hi> Alas! these are but as the <hi>Star</hi> of <hi>Remphan</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi>
which only carry us into <hi>Babylon,</hi> confound all the projects we build
upon them. The Star we are to look to, is the <hi>Star</hi> of <hi>Iacob;</hi> our <hi>Sol,</hi> the
<hi>Sun of Righteousness;</hi> our <hi>Venus, the Holy Spirit</hi> of love; our <hi>Iupiter,</hi> God
the Father, the great <hi>Iuvans Pater</hi> of the World. These are the only
<hi>Planets</hi> the Christian guides his motions by, that make our business go
well, our time accepted, our days lucky. And</p>
            <p>That such a time there is in the great Affairs of souls, a time of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
acceptance with God, and what it is that makes it so, is now worth
the considering.</p>
            <p>That so it is the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us plain. The <hi>Prophet</hi> from whom our
<hi>Apostle</hi> takes the words immediately before the <hi>Text,</hi> and which he ushers
in his own times and ours, says as much, <hi>Isa.</hi> xlix. 8. calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
voluntatis,</hi> a time not only when he will, but when he is willing to hear
us. <hi>Tempus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we may render it, <hi>the time of his good pleasure;</hi> the <hi>Vulgar</hi>
gives us it by <hi>tempore placito, a time when he is pleased,</hi> well pleased to hear
us, and be pleasant with us. The same <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us too, of <hi>a time</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>when he may be found,</hi> but <hi>when he is near,</hi> ready and at hand to hear us,
<hi>Isa.</hi> lv. 6. The <hi>Prophet David</hi> expresly, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxix. 13. speaks of an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time to make our prayers in. And <hi>To day if you will hear his voice,</hi> in the
<hi>Psalmist, paraphrased</hi> by the <hi>Apostle, to day, while it is called to day,</hi> shews
there is a set day, or days of audience with God, wherein he sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as it were, with all readiness to hear and help us; an <hi>accepted time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And will ye, next, know what it is that makes it so? There are but two
things that do. Either Gods being in a good or pleasing disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, or our being in a good and pleasing disposition towards him.
Come we but to him in either of these, and we have nickt the time, we
are sure to be accepted.</p>
            <p>1. When he is looking upon him, in whom he is always well pleased, his
beloved Son, when he is propounding him to us in his Word or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
scattering there, as it were, his gifts unto men, then in those
Solemnities is one sort of his accepted times, wherein he is ready to do
what we will desire him.</p>
            <p>2. But (2.) when we our selves are in a good temper and disposition,
that's another. <hi>In tempore quo vos facitis voluntatem meam,</hi> so the <hi>Chaldee
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57113:130"/>
paraphrases</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>tempus voluntatis,</hi> or <hi>tempus placitum,</hi> Isa. xlix. 8.
That time when you do what I would have you, says God, that's the
<hi>accepted time</hi> when I will hear you; when our souls are in that order and
obedience to our God that <hi>he</hi> would have them, then will <hi>he</hi> be in that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to succour <hi>us</hi> that <hi>we</hi> would have <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, goes for season. And of seasons there are some, you
know, more acceptable than others. Two very acceptable and pleasant in
the year, the Spring and Summer. There are the same in the souls of men. A
Spring, when our graces and vertues begin to sprout and blossom, bespread
and cloth this earth we carry, when the <hi>Sun of righteousness</hi> begins to smile
and warm us, when the air grows temperate, our passions and affections
moderate within us, and all our powers breath nothing but Violets and
Roses; this, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> stiles it, the very time of love, a disposition
and time we cannot but be accepted in, wherein God begins to be in love
with us. There is a Summer too, when <hi>the hills,</hi> the highest pitch and
spirit of our souls, <hi>stand thick with Corn,</hi> and <hi>the valleys,</hi> our lowest powers,
our inferiour passions <hi>laugh and sing;</hi> when the bright raies of heaven
shine hot upon us; when we are hung full with all heavenly fruits;
when <hi>our hearts</hi> do even <hi>burn within us,</hi> and the whole desires even of our
flesh, this dust, that covers us, are on fire for heaven; when our <hi>hearts
pant after the living brooks,</hi> and our <hi>souls are a thirst for God,</hi> to come unto
him to <hi>appear before him.</hi> This indeed is not only the time, but the fulness
of it, when, coming so replenisht with grace and righteousness, we shall
be fully accepted, and be sure not to be <hi>sent empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis sometimes an Autumn and a winter season with us. A
time when our leaves fall off, our graces and vertues decay and wither;
when the fair beauty of a Summer-goodness either spent and dried
away with too long a Sun-shine of prosperity; or blasted by the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of some cold wind, some touch of Winter, some affliction now
at hand makes the day look sad about us, and melancholy too, no way
pleasing. A time too there is when 'tis high Winter with us, our faith
and charity grown cold and dead; when the streams of our wonted Piety
lie, as it were, chain'd up in icy fetters, and <hi>the Sun of righteousness</hi> scarce
appears above the Horizon to us. These are times not to expect to be
accepted in. And such I told you were intimated here too, <hi>Now is the
accepted,</hi> seems to say plain enough there is a time coming that will not
be so; that's the third branch of our first Particular.</p>
            <p>The one and twentieth year after the hundred and twentieth that God
gave the <hi>Old World</hi> to repent in, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3. was a year too late. The next
day after <hi>Ninivies</hi> forty given her would not have done her work. <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
our Saviour tells us, had past her day. <hi>Nunc autem abscondita,</hi> the
things of peace <hi>then hidden from her eyes,</hi> were too sad a proof her day was
set, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 42. <hi>Nunc autem</hi> is full opposite to <hi>Nunc dies. To day if you
will hear his voice,</hi> Heb. iii. shews, <hi>if you</hi> will not, you must not look for
another. They in the <hi>First</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> found no less, they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their time, refused Gods when he called upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. They
shall therefore call, and he will not answer; they shall seek him, and
that early too, but he will not be found, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. he will but laugh at
them for their pains, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. A shrewd Lesson to us not to neglect our
day.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is not in the power of Astrology to calculate this time; nor
of any humane judgment to <hi>define</hi> or <hi>point</hi> out the day when God has done
accepting us, but sure such a one there is; or it were vain to fright us
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57113:131"/>
with a <hi>nunc autem, with a But,</hi> when there is no such matter; if day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
day would come and go, and yet never bring on a night wherein no
man could work, Nay, 'tis requisite there should be so; for were there
no such time, his very mercy would undo us, in the mercy of the most
highest; in his highest mercies we should infallibly miscarry, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without repentance. Nor would his justice have time to shew it
self, if no time came amiss, or short of mercy. 'Tis mercy enough that
he allows us time of repentance, time to come in; and gives us (1.) a
lesson to be thankful, and to take it. Yet (2.) he adds a greater, tells
us of an <hi>accepted time,</hi> when he keeps open Court, and gives ready au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all that come, and may teach us (2.) to seek and search that
out, that it slip not by us. Nay, 'tis a mercy (3.) to stint it too, to bound
and limit it; we else likely would never come, put it off so long till
we were past coming; and reads us (3.) a lecture against presumption,
as yet, the concealing of those bounds and limits reads us (lastly) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against despair. All these lessons to be learn'd from this first parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that <hi>an accepted time</hi> there is, wherein above other times God will
accept us.</p>
            <p>And yet there are degrees also of acceptation. The accepting us (1.) to
pardon, not imputing to us our former sins, nor reckoning to us our past
unkindnesses, but allowing us the liberty still of new addresses to him.
There's a time for that. The accepting us (2.) into favour, not only
leaving open the way, but affording us the means also to bring us to him;
the filling us with mercy, and loving kindness: there's a time for that.
The accepting us (3.) to salvation too. There's a day here next for <hi>that,</hi>
and 'tis our second observation.</p>
            <p>II. A day indeed: all time, nor all accepted time neither is not day.
Salvation it is that makes it day: all time without it is but night and
darkness; and in the brightest day that shines we <hi>sit</hi> but <hi>in the shadow of
death,</hi> if we want the glances of salvation. Let God so accept us, as
to hear and prosper us with riches and honour when we desire it. Let
him accept us to a pardon when we beg it; let him admit us to new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
and some new favours too upon it; 'tis but a dawn or twilight
still, 'tis not perfect day till salvation it self shine forth upon us.</p>
            <p>I confess <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here may have a temporal meaning, by the saving
and delivering Christs faithful servants out of those distresses they
were at that time under, or in fear of; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in
St. <hi>Peter, Salvation ready to be revealed,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 5. and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the soul,</hi> or life, in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 15.
St. <hi>Mark</hi> viii. 35. may prove the exposition good. Yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that ushers in the <hi>Text</hi> being about Gods <hi>reconciling himself to us in
Christ,</hi> and sending his <hi>Embassadours</hi> to us to that purpose, in the end of the
<hi>preceding Chapter,</hi> and an exhortation not to receive that grace in vain,
pursuing in that design, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. enclines me rather to apply it to a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sense. Nay the place of the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> xlix. 8. to which Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> alludes, seems to point particularly at this eternal salvation, <hi>ver.</hi>
6, 7, 9. extending it there to the very <hi>Gentiles, and the ends of the earth.</hi>
But be it a temporal, or be it an eternal salvation; be it either, or be it
both: both have their time, both have their day, and accepted ones
both.</p>
            <p>Indeed nothing can make them such so much as salvation; nothing
like some great deliverance upon them: but every time is not fit for that.
'Tis necessary there should be times of trouble, and times of trial come
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57113:131"/>
before it: and 'tis not necessary we should be delivered presently. Till
the <hi>fulness of time was come,</hi> God did not send it, nor him that brought it,
<hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 4. Indeed the <hi>Prophets</hi> that foretold it, enquired and searched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
says St. <hi>Peter, what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ did
signifie when it testified before-hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
should follow,</hi> when it witnessed of salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 11. but they could
get no more revealed than this, that they did not minister to themselves
but us, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. That such a time should come, that they were certain,
but when it should they could not tell us.</p>
            <p>Other salvations and deliverances have their due times too, and as
uncertain. Those very <hi>tempora novissima, those last times,</hi> that the very <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
speaks so oft of in their <hi>Epistles</hi> (who were under the dawning of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
have so large a latitude, that the great deliverance from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
then upon them, but one of all of them lived to see, as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
as all of them spoke of it. Enough to teach us patience as well as
confidence, to expect with patience, and quietly wait for the salvation of
God in all distresses; as well as to hold up our heads with confidence and
support our dying hopes and hearts that salvation will surely come in its
due time. And yet I may add, we may notwithstanding fear too, that
though it will be sure to come, we may not live to see it, or have the
happiness to enjoy it. We may die upon <hi>Mount Hor,</hi> or <hi>Nebo,</hi> e're it
come, unless we can now happily lay hold upon this little <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this <hi>now</hi>
set before us in the <hi>Text,</hi> the next particular, and take it <hi>now</hi> 'tis offered
to us.</p>
            <p>III. This <hi>now</hi> is but a little word, but there is much time, or rather
many several times that lay claim to it here. The whole time of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
in general. The times (2.) of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in special. <hi>Our</hi> times also
(3.) among the rest. These <hi>days</hi> (4.) we are now a keeping more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
above any other of ours. This <hi>very day</hi> (lastly) whilst it is called
to day, before it is past over us, before night come on us.</p>
            <p>The time of the <hi>Gospel</hi> from Christs coming out of the Womb, as the
Sun out of his Chamber, till he shall come again in the Clouds in glory,
is this accepted time, this salvation-day at large. The day-spring of it
rose with him at his first coming, but the day ends not till his second.
There is a double emphasis in this <hi>Now.</hi> (.1) Now, and not before. (2.)
Now and now, henceforth for ever. (1.) Now, and not before. In
him 'tis first we hear of God well, pleased, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. 17. All the
times before he did but wink at, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 30, In his time first it is that
we hear of saving people from their sins, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> i. 21. He the first of
all since the world began, that <hi>saved</hi> us <hi>from all our enemies, and from the
hand of all that hate us,</hi> St. Luke i. 71. in whom we have deliverance of
all sorts, salvation of all kinds. He in whom God <hi>reconciling the world
unto himself,</hi> verse 19. of the foregoing <hi>Chapter.</hi> Nay, he the very first
that indeed made it day: It was but <hi>darkness, and the shadow of death,</hi> we
sate in before, St. <hi>Luke</hi> i. 78, 79. His is the only time, the time of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> the only time of <hi>salvation.</hi> Here it began, and hence now it
goes on (2.) for ever; for St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls it, <hi>Evangelium aeternum,</hi> Rev. xiv.
6. the everlasting <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>salvation</hi> not to end even with the world;
to the end of it, sure, to continue. <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Law</hi> had but its time and
vanished; and whilst it had, could not pretend so far as to make
it day; cloud, and shadows, and darkness all the while: The times of
the <hi>Gospel</hi> are the only lightsome day, and a long one too, it seems; for
our Sun has promised still to shine upon us, and be with us ever, <hi>to the end
of the world,</hi> St. Mat. xxviii. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:57113:132"/>But some more remarkable points of this time there are we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was (2.) the very especial <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> intended here,
the <hi>Now</hi> in the <hi>Text:</hi> When the time of acceptation was at the fullest,
when whole families together, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 34. and xviii. 8. thousands at a
clap, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. whole Towns and Countries came thronging in so fast,
as if this very <hi>now</hi> were <hi>now</hi> or never; when Handkerchiefs, and Aprons,
and the very shadow of an <hi>Apostle</hi> carried a kind of salvation with them,
<hi>Acts</hi> v. 15. and xix. 12. when there was not only a large way opened for
all sinners to come in, but all ways and means made to bring them in;
when there were fiery tongues, both to inflame the hearts of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and to devour the gain-sayers: when there was a Divine Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
always ready to perswade, Miracles to confirm, Prophesie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
miraculous gifts and benefits to allure, strange punishments to
awe sinners into the obedience of Christ, and the paths of salvation:
when the time of that great deliverance too from the destruction of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and the <hi>enemies of the Cross of Christ,</hi> so often reflected on through
Saint <hi>Paul's Epistles</hi> was now nigh at hand, and the fast adhering to Christ
the only way to be accepted and taken into the number of such as should
be saved from it.</p>
            <p>Yet (3.) this <hi>Now</hi> is not so narrow, but it will take in our times too. 'Tis
true, those of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were furnished with greater means and power;
yet ours, God be thanked, want not sufficient. We have the <hi>Word, and
Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>inward Motions, daily calls,</hi> and <hi>ready
assistances of the Spirit,.</hi> It may be, too, somewhat more than they; a
long track of experimental truths, and long sifted and banded reasons,
and an uninterrupted <hi>Tradition,</hi> and a continued train of holy and devout
<hi>examples,</hi> a vast disseminating the Christian Principles, and the perpetual
protection of them we have, to make them more easie to be accepted;
and tell us, that 'tis <hi>Now</hi> still <hi>the day of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet (4.) even both in <hi>our</hi> times, and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> there has been a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some signal and peculiar time cull'd out of the rest, and set apart
for this Reconciliation, the great affair that sets the <hi>Ecce</hi> upon it. If I
tell you but of St. <hi>Augustin's, Tota Catholica Ecclesia,</hi> or St. <hi>Leo's Institutio
Apostolica,</hi> or St. <hi>Ieromes Secundum traditionem Apostolorum,</hi> or St. <hi>Ambrose's
Quadragesimam nobis Dominus suo jejunio consecravit</hi> for this holy time we are
in, the time of <hi>Lent;</hi> that they all call it <hi>Apostolical</hi> at the least: and St.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> fetches it from our <hi>Lord,</hi> and consecrates it from <hi>Christ himself;</hi>
and that it was always purposely designed for the time of reconciling sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and all the offices belonging to it, I shall need say no more to prove
this <hi>Now</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is not ill applied, when applied to this very time.</p>
            <p>Most reasonable it is (1.) that some such there should be design'd,
some time or days determined for a business of so great weight: we are
not like else to have it done: we would be apt enough to put it off from
time to time, and so for ever. Were there not some set days, I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirm, God would have but little worship paid him; thousands
would never so much as think of Heaven, or God.</p>
            <p>And if it be reasonable some time be set us, there is (2.) no time fitter
than where we are: 'tis the very time of the year when all things begin
to turn their course; when Heaven and Earth begin to smooth their
wrinkled brows, and withered cheeks, and look as if they were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.
'Tis the spring and first-fruits of the year, which upon that title
is due to God, and fittest to be dedicate to his Service, and the business
of our souls. (3.) 'Tis the time when the blood begins to warm, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57113:132"/>
the contest is now in rising between the Flesh and Spirit; which now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up at first and quell'd, may be the easier reconciled to peace, and the
body subdued into obedience to the soul; and so Gods grace not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in vain. (4.) The spring in which it is, 'tis <hi>tempus placitum,</hi> the
<hi>pleasant time</hi> o'th' year; fittest then to fit with the <hi>tempus placitum</hi> in the
<hi>Text,</hi> fit to be employed to set our selves to please God in, to make it
perfectly such. And sure we cannot be displeased that the <hi>Church</hi> (5.)
has thought so too, chosen it as the fittest. Surely it is or should be
the more acceptable for <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this time (besides) has all times in it, that <hi>Solomon</hi> himself
could think of, <hi>Eccles.</hi> iii. 1. It must needs be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too,
every way acceptable: and all of them it has. (1.) There is, says he, a
time to be born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so goes on: this is both a time to be born in, and
a time to die in. <hi>Lent,</hi> a time to die unto the world, and to be born and
live to Christ. (2.) 'Tis a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that
which is planted; to plant vertue, and to pluck up vice. (3.) 'Tis a time
to kill, and a time to heal; to kill and mortifie our earthly members,
and to heal the sores and ulcers that sin hath made, by a diet of fasting
and abstinence. (4.) 'Tis a time to break down, and a time to build;
to break down the Walls of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the fortresses of sin and Satan, and
to build up the Walls of the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> within us. (5.) 'Tis a time
to weep, and a time to laugh; to weep and bewail the years we have
spent in vanities, and yet rejoyce that we have yet time left to escape
from them. (6.) 'Tis a time to mourn, and a time to dance; to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
our repentance by some outward expressions, and thereby dispose
our selves every day more and more for <hi>Easter</hi> Joys. (7.) 'Tis a time to
cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; to remove every
stone of offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as <hi>lively stones to be built up,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>into a
spiritual house.</hi> (8.) 'Tis a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
embracing; to refrain from all wanton and loose embraces, and pour
out our selves wholly into the arms of our <hi>Blessed Iesus,</hi> (9.) 'Tis a time
to get, and a time to lose; to get Heaven by violence, and lose Earth,
our worldly goods (<hi>so</hi> the worldling counts it) upon Alms and Charities,
to cast away Earth to purchase Heaven. (10.) 'Tis a time to keep, and
a time to cast away; to keep all good resolutions, and cast away the bad
ones. (11.) 'Tis a time to rent, and a time to sew; to rent and tear
off all ill habits, and to begin good ones. (12.) 'Tis a time to keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and a time to speak; to keep silence from bad words, all idle,
ad wanton, and scurrilous language, and give our selves to good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
(13.) 'Tis a time of love, and a time of hate; to love God,
and hate our selves; or love our souls, and hate our sins. (14.) 'Tis in
a word, a time of War, and a time of Peace; to make war against all
our ghostly enemies, the flesh, the Devil, and the world; and reconcile
our selves to God, our Neighbour, and the Church. To all these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
serves the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> for them 'twas instituted at first, and for
them it is continued; and can any Christian now think it should not be
accepted upon such a score as this? or are any days liker the day of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than those that are spent thus? or it is our own fault if it be not:
or is any time more fit to be stil'd an accepted time, than this that is the
very comprehension of all times? a time every way fitted up for all the
designs of salvation? for calling publick offenders to accompt, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
notorious sinners to open penance, for reconciling penitents, and
receiving them again into the Church, for promoting piety and vertue,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57113:133"/>
for admitting <hi>Proselytes</hi> to holy Baptism at the end of it, for preparing all
of us for the Blessed <hi>Eucharist</hi> all the way, by solemn prayers and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
more than at other times, by fastings, and watchings, and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
and strict devotions, and every way conforming us to the
image of Christ, the fasting, and dying, and rising with him, that we
may so also be accepted by him? These were the practices of <hi>Lent</hi> in
the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> of Christ, wish'd and call'd for too in <hi>Ours,</hi> in the
<hi>Epistles,</hi> and <hi>Collects</hi> for it, and the <hi>Commination</hi> that begins it. And by
the afflictions, and necessities, and distresses, and labours, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and fastings, and pureness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that follow immediately upon the
<hi>Text</hi> (things all so answering to this time) I cannot say but the <hi>Text</hi> may
stand as an <hi>In diebus illis;</hi> a kind of prophetick designation at least of this
time of <hi>Lent,</hi> has caus'd the words I am sure to be so applied by many
of the <hi>Antients,</hi> and made a part by us also of the <hi>Lent</hi> Office.</p>
            <p>But this very time (so dilatory are we, and so ready to put off holy
duties) is yet perhaps too large, and these forty days too many to close
us to our work. Nay, the <hi>day</hi> has many hours, twelve, says Christ, to
walk in: And if we may guess from our ordinary guise and custom, we
are like enough to defer all to the last hour. I must set an <hi>accent</hi> therefore
upon this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this <hi>Now.</hi> Now, <hi>Lent</hi> or not; <hi>Now</hi> fast we or fast we not;
Now is the very time we must begin our reconcilement, look to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
that though the name of <hi>Lent</hi> should be distasteful (as too
much it is) yet however we may not slip our time. 'Tis the only sure
part of time we have, the present, the only day of salvation; for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
e're the next moment we are gone, and clearly cast without
the confines of it. Not only then <hi>to day, whilst it is called to day,</hi> but even
<hi>Now,</hi> whilst it is called <hi>Now,</hi> is the sure <hi>Now</hi> of salvation. To all these
<hi>Now's,</hi> God here points us by an <hi>Ecce, Behold, now is the,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IV. And indeed it is no more than needs, that he should point and
set us out some time even to accept our own salvation. Time and times
pass over us, and we think not of it: A piece of Land, a Wife, a yoke
of Oxen are more thought upon every day than that. We our selves
do but little mind it (I am sure we live as if we did not much:) The
Church cannot get us to it with all the Fasts and Feasts she sets us. Our
Ministers the <hi>Embassadours</hi> that are sent about it perswade little with us;
we had need of <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Apostle</hi> too to say it over and over again unto
us: and 'tis so in the verse we have the <hi>Text</hi> in. The <hi>Lords day</hi> it self, did it
not bear his name upon it, would as easily vanish into a neglect as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Holy days.</hi> 'Tis only the opinion that he himself commanded or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>that,</hi> which keeps it up a while above the rest: whether so or no,
we dispute not now; It is not to the <hi>Text.</hi> These things I shall tell
you, are there without dispute; (1.) Set days and times are there, times
set apart for the promoting of our salvation, particular ones too, <hi>Ecce nunc
tempus, nunc dies.</hi> Times (2.) that are so set, are so far from hindering,
that they are even the very days of salvation. Times (3.) may so still
be set by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or their successors; they have the power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
them, with St. <hi>Paul</hi> here, to put the <hi>nunc</hi> upon them. Times (lastly)
<hi>so</hi> set have an <hi>Ecce</hi> upon them; somewhat more upon them than other
days: are to be observed, to be accepted. Do we therefore now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
says my last particular, <hi>Behold</hi> them, and <hi>accept</hi> them, <hi>Behold
now is the,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Behold,</hi> (1.) and take notice, such a time there is, such a day as we
have been speaking of; Christ himself was anointed to preach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57113:133"/>
it, St. <hi>Luke</hi> iv. 19. <hi>the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> were
sent with the like Commission, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. of the former <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
and they beseech us to take notice of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. whilst they pray us
<hi>in Christs stead to be reconciled</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold</hi> therefore (2.) and again behold it; that is, not only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, (that may be perhaps a little by the by) but consider it. There's
a double <hi>Ecce</hi> upon it, take notice of that, and sit down and lay it to your
hearts, and chew it over and and over; say thus within thy self, God
has been gracious to me from time to time, expected me long from day
to day, proffering me grace, proffering me salvation, even beseeching
and entreating me to accept them, <hi>Lord what is man, Lord what is man, that
thou shouldest be</hi> thus <hi>mindful of him?</hi> that thou shouldest so regard him?
that thou shouldest thus follow him from one end of the year unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
from one accepted time to another; from <hi>Feast</hi> to <hi>Feast,</hi> from <hi>Fast</hi>
to <hi>Fast,</hi> from <hi>Feast</hi> to <hi>Fast,</hi> from <hi>Christmas</hi> to <hi>Lent,</hi> from <hi>Lent</hi> to <hi>Christmas,</hi>
from <hi>Christmas</hi> to <hi>Lent</hi> again: from one <hi>Lent</hi> to another, from one day to
another; begging and beseeching him not to refuse his own salvation?
Well may it deserve <hi>Ecce</hi> upon <hi>Ecce,</hi> consideration upon consideration;
admiration too as well as consideration, and admiration upon admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
(<hi>Ecce</hi> may pass for a note of both) to be beheld so long, till our eyes
and thoughts are not able to behold, or think any longer.</p>
            <p>And (3.) to day to set upon it, this <hi>nunc</hi> to begin it in. <hi>Thou knowest not,
O man,</hi> thou knowest not how short thy time is, whether this day may not
be thy last, whether this <hi>Now,</hi> this very moment may not at least be
the last time that this salvation may be offered thee. Many are the
times I confess I told you that challeng'd right to be among the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
ones; but remember I told you the present was the only sure one.
The <hi>Apostle</hi> surely thought so when he was so earnest for it, <hi>Heb,</hi> iii, that
within the compass of nine <hi>verses</hi> he three several times at least puts
them in mind to take care <hi>to day</hi> to <hi>hear Gods voice, while to day it is,</hi> as if
to morrow would not serve the turn, or the day of salvation were gone
at night; salvation gone, or we gone, and all gone with us. Thousands
there be in the world who now <hi>are,</hi> who within a few minutes will be no
more; and why mayest not <hi>thou</hi> be one of them? so much the sooner, in
that the so long contempt of Gods mercy may justly provoke him thus
to fetch thee off, and throw thee by. 'Tis not without reason that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> doubles his files, doubles the <hi>Nunc</hi> as well as the <hi>Ecce;</hi> calls as it were
in hast, Now, Now, catch hold on't.</p>
            <p>Indeed nor I, nor you can time it better. There are three special points
of time that meet here now, all extreamly fit to perswade and move us
to set upon the work, and business of salvation, to apply our selves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to our Repentance, and Gods Service. The particular time of
<hi>Lent,</hi> this special day of <hi>Confirmation:</hi> the general and continued day of
that latter great salvation and deliverance we still enjoy.</p>
            <p>For that particular (1.) of <hi>Lent,</hi> you have heard already all the helps it has
for the furtherance of salvation, the fastings and watchings, the severities
and restraints, the austerities and rigours it requires, and brings towards
it. I only add, 'tis <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> within a day or two, a day fit to go out
to meet your Saviour with <hi>Hosanna's,</hi> and bring salvation home, with
<hi>Palms</hi> and Triumphs. The holy week's at hand, a Week formerly of
greater devotion and strictness than any of the rest. <hi>Good Friday</hi> and
<hi>Easter</hi> are a coming, the great <hi>Anniversaries</hi> of our salvation; the fittest
days the properest <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to mind it in, for <hi>all</hi> to do it. But for some,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:57113:134"/>For some of you, you who come to be confirmed: this very day is a
day of salvation in particular; wherein I hope you shall have reason to
return, and say what our blessed Master said to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> This day is sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
come unto your houses. A day wherein by the <hi>Imposition of holy
hands</hi> your Saviour seems sensibly to accept you, to receive you signally
now after your first straglings into his house and Church again, to receive
you into his acquaintance, to receive you into his favour, to receive you
into his protection, to receive you to his benediction, and send you away
with it, with all the blessings of his Holy Spirit, whch are by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ceremony of laying on the <hi>Bishops</hi> hands, and pouring out his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
poured down upon you: only remember you come hither to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
and beg a blessing; that's your business. Remember that upon
your knees you beg it, and with your hearts desire it; and then upon
your heads be it. Be it will, I dare assure you; wisdom, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and counsel, and ghostly strength, and knowledge, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Gods holy fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; all these gifts and blessings of the Holy Spirit,
as they are prayed for in it, so will be upon you by it, to confirm you in
the Faith, if you now resolve (as it is required of you in the <hi>Preface</hi>) to
stand to those promises you have already made in holy <hi>Baptism,</hi> and
stedfastly determine to be Christians hereafter as you should be, to live
and die in the obedience of Christ, to keep his Faith entire, and his
Commandments to the utmost of your power. Do <hi>so</hi> to day, and to day
then will be your <hi>accepted time,</hi> will be to you certainly a <hi>day of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (3.) the days of salvation, we have now almost three years enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
may justly demand to be remembred too to spur us on to take a little
more care how we spend our time. I am afraid our late days have been
as much consum'd in vanity, as our former years were spent in trouble.
We have forgot our deliverance, we live rather as if we had been <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi>
up (as they in the <hi>Prophet</hi> excus'd themselves, <hi>Ier.</hi> vii. 10.) <hi>to do
all abominations:</hi> we seem to have quite lost the memory of our temporal
salvation; and for our spiritual we go on daily, as if we either cared not
whether God would save us or no, or at least we would venture it; or as
if we said in <hi>plain English,</hi> let him save us if he will, be it else at his own
peril if he will not; or in short, as if we bid him damn us if he durst.
Yet never were there such days of salvation as we have seen, never such
deliverances as we have found; never were such cast-aways, never men
so rejected, so despis'd, so trampled on, so again accepted on a sudden.
Good God, was it for our righteousness, was it for our merits, was it
by our own strength, or wit, or power, we were delivered? alas! Lord
we had none of these: was it for our Oaths, or Perjuries, or Blasphemies,
or Sacriledges, or Rebellions, or Schisms, or Heresies, or Thefts, or
Prophaneness, or Wickedness, or Villanies, that thou didst deliver us,
to our Kingdom, and our Church, to our peace, and plenty, and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to all the happy means of Piety and Religion, to all the beauties of
holiness, and opportunities of salvation? Enough indeed, O Lord, of these
we could have shewed thee, but these were reasons why thou shouldest not
deliver us, It was only, O Lord, because <hi>thou</hi> wouldest have the day, and
wouldest save us, because thou wouldest. But for all that (my Brethren)
take heed we sin not so again. God has set us here a time, points it out
to us with an <hi>ecce,</hi> and an <hi>ecce,</hi> that we can no longer plead ignorance to
miss it; we are already encompassed with the day of salvation, and we
are never like to see such a one again, if we should lose this; let us abuse
it then no longer, lest some horrible night, e're long overtake us, some
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57113:134"/>
terrible judgment come upon us, and hurry us hence, before we are
aware, into the horrors and miseries of everlasting darkness.</p>
            <p>4. By this time you understand this <hi>ecce</hi> is not to set us a gazing up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven, or observing days, and months, and times, and years, but
to retrive our months of vanity, as holy <hi>Iob</hi> calls them, and fill the days
we live with more acceptable employments. For God having so late
accepted our persons, and our complaints, and prayers, and tears, or
rather us indeed without them; and desiring only of us that we would
but accept and employ those mercies, and all others of his to our own
salvation; we should be me thinks the most unreasonable of men to be
so unkind to God, as either not to receive his grace, or receive it still
in vain. Worthy it is of better usage, for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of all acceptation</hi> there. The very time, says our Apostle, is such, what
then is the salvation of it? that surely much more.</p>
            <p>Accept we it therefore, and the time of it, with all readiness, with
all thankfulness, with all humility. Take we all the opportunities
henceforward of salvation, look every way about us, and slip none we
can lay hold on. This <hi>ecce, ecce,</hi> reiterated, is to rouse us, and to tell us
that <hi>our ecce</hi> should answer <hi>Gods. Ecce tempus,</hi> says he, <hi>ecce me,</hi> or <hi>nos,</hi> say
we. Behold the time, behold the day, says God. Behold <hi>us,</hi> say we,
O God, our <hi>hearts are fixed, our hearts are fixed,</hi> our hearts are ready, our
hearts are ready to accept it. <hi>Ecce adsum,</hi> says <hi>Abraham, behold here I am,
Ecce venio,</hi> says <hi>Christ, Lo I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> Behold thy servants
are ready, says <hi>David,</hi> to do whatsoever my Lord shall appoint. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<hi>we</hi> are coming, <hi>we</hi> are here, <hi>we</hi> are ready with thee according to
thy heart; these are the returns or <hi>Eccho's</hi> we are to make God back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Nor is it time to dally now. Time is a flitting Post, Day runs into
night e're we are aware: this Now is gone as soon as spoken, and no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
beyond it, and no salvation if not accepted e're we go hence.
There are I know, that cry, to day shall be as yesterday, and to morrow
as to day; all things continue as they were since our Fathers fell asleep.
And this thing you call Religion, does but delude us, and our Preachers
do but fright us; this salvation they talk of we know not what to make
of it, if there be such a thing (indeed) the day is long enough, we may
think time enough of it many years hence. Such scoffers indeed St.
<hi>Peter</hi> told us we should meet with. But I hope better things of you (my
beloved) and such as accompany salvation. And I have told you nothing
to fright you from it. I have not scar'd you with the antient rigour, nor
terrified you with primitive austerities. I have only shewed you there
is such a thing as salvation to be thought of, and 'tis time to set about it.
You cannot fast, you'l tell me, you are weak and sickly, it will destroy
you. You cannot watch, you say, it will undo you; you cannot give
Alms, you have no moneys: You cannot come so oft to Prayers as
others, your business hinders you. But however, can you do nothing
towards it, towards your own salvation? can you not accept it when
'tis offered; can you not consider and think a little of it? If you do but
that, I shall not fear but you will do more. When you have business
you can spare a meal, now and then to follow it; and nothing's made
on't when you are at your sports, or play, you can sit up night after night,
and catch no hurt, for a new fashion, impertinence, or vanity, you can
find mony, and time enough at any time, for any of these. I desire you
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57113:135"/>
would but do as much, nay half as much (I am afraid I may say the tenth
part so much) to save your souls, spend but as much time seriously upon
that as you do upon your dressing, your visits, your vanities, (not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
any thing so much of you upon that, as upon worldly business) and
dare promise you salvation, you shall be accepted at that day, at that
day, when our short Fasts shall be turned into eternal Feasts, our petty
<hi>Lents</hi> consummate into the great <hi>Easters,</hi> when time it self shall improve
into eternity, this day advance into an everlasting Sun-shine, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appear in all its glories.</p>
            <p>Accept us now, O Lord, we pray thee, in this accepted time; save us
we beseech thee in this day of salvation, that we may one day come to
that eternal one, through him, in whom only we are accepted, thy belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Son Christ Jesus. To whom, with thee and thy Holy Spirit, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
all our times, and days; all our years, and months, and hours,
and minutes from henceforward: to whom also be all honour, and praise,
all salvation and glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

towards, that begins with <hi>castigo,</hi> and ends
with <hi>reprobus;</hi> that is so rough with us at the first
as to tell us of chastning, and <hi>keeping under the body,</hi>
and so terrible at the last as to scare us with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>castaways</hi> unless we do it. And that too, <hi>cum
aliis praedicaverim,</hi> the greatest <hi>Preachers;</hi> the very
<hi>Apostles</hi> themselves after all their pains no surer of
their Salvation than upon such severe conditions.
If the <hi>Preacher</hi> will needs be preaching this, tell us of <hi>disciplining our
bodies,</hi> talk to us of being <hi>castaways, Quis cum audire potest, who can endure
him,</hi> who can bear it?</p>
            <p>Well, bear it how we can, think of it what we please, be the <hi>doctrine</hi>
never so unpleasing, it must be preacht, and bear it we must; unless we
know what to preach better than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>you</hi> what to hear or do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than that great <hi>Apostle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis but time for us to preach, for you to hear it. Men daily fool
away their souls by their tenderness to their bodies, and their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the certainties they pretend of it. 'Tis time to warn them of
it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> Time as fit a time, as any can be, to do it in, the <hi>holy time</hi> of
<hi>Lent.</hi> A time set apart by the holy <hi>Church</hi> to chasten and subdue the body
in. And the opportunity is fallen into my hand, among the rest, and <hi>vae

the occasion to do my utmost to keep my self and you from being <hi>cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies.</hi>

            <p>I know people do not love to hear on't, and the <hi>Preacher</hi> shall get little

be half a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> a <hi>Castaway</hi> himself for preaching it. But seem we what
you please, be it how it will, I venture on it upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account;
and both you and I, as high as we bear our selves upon our assurances that
we are the Elect, if we will be sure indeed not to be <hi>Reprobates,</hi> must be
content to hear of it lest we be so.</p>
            <p>'Tis a plain <hi>Text,</hi> the words very plain, need no <hi>Philip</hi> to expound
them. Nothing could be said, nothing can be plainer. For he that says,
<hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest I should be a Castaway</hi> says
nor more nor less, than unless I do so, so I shall be, for all my great flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

            <p>And it being an <hi>Apostle</hi> without exception, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. one who knew his
Office, and performed it beyond all that was required of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 18.
knew his Power, and how to stand upon it, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. understood well his

fall short of his Crown and lose the reward of all his labours. If he
can find no other means to avoid the one but by the doing of the other.

               </gap>, says St. <hi>Chrysostom, what can we say for our selves?</hi> Say, I
hope, it concerns us, and we will look to it, will set about it. Better
Authority we need not than the <hi>Churches,</hi> as for the time. Better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               </gap>, that we may save
our selves from being <hi>Castaways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not obscure the business by any nice Division of the words. Two
general Parts shall serve the turn.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> wholsom <hi>Discipline for his body;</hi> And,</item>
               <item>II. <hi>His</hi> godly <hi>fear, for body and soul.</hi> Or</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. His <hi>Disciplining and strict ordering of his body;</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> The Ground and Reason why he does so.</p>
            <p>The first is in those words, <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection.</hi>
The second in those, <hi>Lest by any means when I have preached unto others I my
self should be a Castaway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first we have St. <hi>Paul,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> and the <hi>Work</hi> he makes with it, or
the <hi>Discipline</hi> he uses towards it. Three Points to be considered.</p>
            <p>In the second we have three more to make up the <hi>Reason,</hi> why he does
so use it. Because (1.) he would not be a <hi>Castaway, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, lest I be.</hi>
Because (2.) there may be many ways to make us so, <hi>lest by any means</hi> I
be so, supposes <hi>by many</hi> I may be so. Because (3.) there is no avoiding
being so without it, all our preaching and doing will not do without it.
(1.)<hi>Lest I be a Castaway.</hi> (2.) <hi>Lest by any means I be a Castaway.</hi> (3.) <hi>Lest
when I have preacht to others I should be a Castaway</hi> notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>I could give you the Parts (perhaps) in nearer terms applied to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor</hi>
coucht in the words. But the <hi>Text</hi> is plain, and the Parts I would
leave plain, and I would be plain and understood. Yet under whatever
notions I should give you them; This is, and would be still the sum of
all; that the keeping under the body, and the bringing it into subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a business to be mainly lookt to, lookt to by the best and greatest,
the very St. <hi>Pauls</hi> among us; and that under no less penalty and
danger than being <hi>Castaways</hi> if we neglect it; our highest priviledges
our greatest services, our most Christian Liberties no plea at all to exempt
us from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:57113:136"/>I go on now with the Parts in order, and begin with the first general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
St. <hi>Pauls disciplining and ordering of his body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where we have these three particulars to treat on; <hi>Him, his body,</hi> and
<hi>his ordering it.</hi> But I begin with <hi>Him first;</hi> for so I find him set, set here
before his <hi>body.</hi> I would we would all set our selves so too; set our selves
above our bodies, value and prize our souls (for <hi>they</hi> chiefly are our
selves) before our bodies; at least our <hi>selves,</hi> that is, the good of the
whole man before the pleasing of that mortal part, we would not then
make our selves such slaves and drudges to it, as we do; face and brave
damnation for a petty lust, for a little meat or drink, for the satisfaction
of the belly.</p>
            <p>Indeed, could we pretend to know how to order our selves better than
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I might have spared this <hi>Note,</hi> but all the pretences we have
against the strict ordering of the body, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here takes up, are all
answered in <hi>his</hi> person, <hi>his</hi> very doing it, if we well consider it. For all
the arguments or pretences we have against it, are either (1.) our <hi>business</hi>
we cannot tend it; or (2.) our <hi>weakness,</hi> we cannot bear it; or (3.) our
holiness, we do not need it; or (4.) our Christian Liberty, it is against
it; or (5.) other things will do as well, we may well spare it; or (6.) a
less matter will serve the turn, we may be saved without it. But all
these shall I shew you might St. <hi>Paul</hi> plead, yet it seems all would not
serve to excuse <hi>him</hi> from this hard dealing with his body we read of in
the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We plead our weakness, we are not able to use this rigour. <hi>But I,</hi>
this <hi>I,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was as full of weaknesses as any of us, and yet he could:
<hi>Who is weak,</hi> says he, <hi>and I am not weak?</hi> 2 Cor. xi. 29. so weak sometimes,
that it cast him into a trembling, <hi>much trembling,</hi> 1. Cor. ii. 3. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
took this way rather to cure it, than to encrease it. And indeed, those very
weaknesses we complain of rise from the pampering our bodies, are cured
by our strict ordering them. Nay, those impatiences, and peevishnesses,
and nicenesses, and sinful infirmities, vvhich grovv so strong upon us in
our sicknesses vvould not do so, vvere the body kept but a little under
vvhen vve vvere vvell.</p>
            <p>But (2.) though vve could bear it, you'l say, vve cannot tend it. Not
tend it? Why St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon vvhom <hi>the care of all the Churches</hi> lay, vvho
vvas in continual <hi>journeyings</hi> and <hi>labours</hi> for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23, 25, 28. full of
vveariness and painfulness about it, vvas yet <hi>in watchings often, in fastings
often,</hi> ver. 27. of the same <hi>Chapter,</hi> keeping under his body, still, for all
his business, notvvithstanding all his other business forgets not this.</p>
            <p>Will you say novv (3.) you do not need it, you are holy enough vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, you are Gods <hi>Elect,</hi> and do not vvant it, vvant no such poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
means to help you out? What, are you holier than St. <hi>Paul?</hi> What,
are you better than <hi>he,</hi> that dares avovv he vvas not <hi>inferiour to the chiefest
Apostles?</hi> Have you been in more <hi>Heavens</hi> than he? Heard more <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
than he? Have you more assurances of your Election or Salvation
than he that vvas arrived at that height to be <hi>perswaded that neither death,
nor life, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature could separate him from the love of God
in Christ Iesus?</hi> Rom. viii. 38, 39. are you better than he? If you be not,
you had best take the course he did. If you be, you had best yet take his
course to keep you so.</p>
            <p>Yea, but (4.) our Christian Liberty is entrencht on by it. We must
not by this very same <hi>Apostles</hi> advice and counsel be <hi>subject to</hi> those <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:57113:137"/>
of <hi>touch not, taste not, handle not,</hi> Col. ii. 20, 21. and yet those things
seem to make much for the <hi>neglecting of the body,</hi> and the not <hi>satisfying of the
flesh,</hi> ver. 23. but that we must not be <hi>brought under the power of any,</hi> 1 Cor.
vi. 11. No, but the body must be brought under ours, for all that, says
our <hi>Apostle.</hi> Says he so? He says no more than he does, he does so too.
And yet <hi>he</hi> knew his power and Christian Liberty to the ful, had <hi>power to
eat and drink,</hi> he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and to do neither; power to work, and
not to work, <hi>to forbear working,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>was free,</hi> ver. 19. yet from this it
seems he is not free, unless he will fight <hi>as one that beats the air</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi>
before the <hi>Text.</hi> He knows no liberty that can allow the liberty to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
not to be kept under and subjected unless it please.</p>
            <p>Nor (5.) does he (whatever we think of it) think he may spare it
upon the account of other vertues, as if it were enough to be diligent at
our prayers, to be frequent at Sermons, to be orderly in our Families, to be
just in our dealings, to be honest in our Callings, to be charitable to the
poor, to be friendly to our neighbours, or the like; and let this subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body go whither it will. St. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be suspected to have
been wanting in any of these, yet he must needs add this grace also it
seems to make all sure; keep the body under, that he may so keep those
graces safe.</p>
            <p>For a less matter, lastly, will not serve the turn, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> labours, and
journeys, and perils, and stripes, and prisons, and deaths, as great and
as often as they were, must have this also added to them; the flesh must
have some thorn or other to keep it in subjection; If God send it not, if
the devil, by his permission, buffet not the flesh, we must do it our selves,
lest we be exalted above measure; those very performances which we
think we have most reason to glory in, will but puff us up, and cast us
sheer away, if we preserve not our body in that lowliness and subjection
that we should.</p>
            <p>So now, if we think good to guide our selves by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> authority
and example, there is none so weak, none so busily employed, none so
holy, that can exempt himself; no Christian Liberty, no other graces,
(though never so many) nor any other performances that can be pleaded
against it. All sorts of persons are included in St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and in this <hi>I</hi> all
objections against it are sufficiently answered, and we all included and
obliged, for if such a one as the glorious St. <hi>Paul</hi> could find no exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I know not what Christian can expect it. You'l confess it perhaps, when
you have confidered what this body is you are to deal with, the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
we are to handle.</p>
            <p>And by the body here may be understood either the flesh it self, or the
fleshliness of it; the body it self, or the sinful passions and affections ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in it. To be sure, take we both.</p>
            <p>And indeed, we can neither be sure nor safe, if (1.) the passions and
affections be not kept within their bounds, if we suffer our appetites to
rule us, our angers to transport us, our desires to harrow us, our fears to
distract us, our hopes to abuse us, or any other of that impetuous crew to
over-bear us. They must all be made underlings, kept within rule and
compass, or <hi>we</hi> are lost.</p>
            <p>Nay, and to keep <hi>them</hi> so, this very bulk of flesh (2.) must be kept
so too: for keep this but high it is impossible to keep them low. Stuff
the body with meat and drink, let it lodge soft, and lie long, let it have
the fill of ease and pleasure, <hi>&amp; facile despumat,</hi> it froths into lust, it boils
into anger, it swells into pride, it rises into rebellion, it leaks into looseness,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57113:137"/>
it mosses into idleness, it fills the brain with fogs, the heart with filth,
the liver with wanton heats, the mouth with unsavoury language, and
all the members with disorder and confusion. Do but take away the
meat, and let it fast a while; take it from the bed, and let it watch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while; take it from ease and tenderness, and set it to some hard
and unpleasing work; let it feel a little cold, a little labour, a little
course and rough usage for a time, and you shall see how humble it will
grow, how much under you shall have it, how orderly it will be. It will
do any thing you would have it.</p>
            <p>But to make all sure, every part must have its share; the eye must be
watcht, the heart kept under guard, the tongue bridled, the palate cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
the ears fenced, the hands restrained, the knees bow'd down, the
feet kept in, and all the members under, for they are all but one body,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 14. this body that is to be brought into subjection, make up but
that <hi>Iumentum animae, that beast that carries the soul,</hi> and is therefore to be
rid, like a beast, with bit and bridle, with whip and rod, lest it fall upon
us, or fall with us and cast us.</p>
            <p>Be St. <hi>Pauls</hi> body, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, never so good, so orderly, so chaste a body,
so it seems it must be used, nay, such it cannot be unless it be so used.
Let no man be so bold to think his body in better order than St. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
and yet here's a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for <hi>his,</hi> a kind of fear of some miscarriage, a fear
some evil may rise from it.</p>
            <p>Yea, even that very body of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which had been at so many
posts, endured so many lashes already, been in so many prisons, so many
perils, so many storms, and colds, and shipwracks, so many necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and infirmities; this very <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this very body, as much as it
has suffered, and as much as it has done, I must yet keep under, says
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> still more and more keep under for all that. <hi>My body,</hi> says he,
and <hi>mine,</hi> say I, and <hi>mine,</hi> must every one say, though we were all St. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
as holy as he, had done and suffered as much as he.</p>
            <p>But what yet must it suffer more? Yes more; for as neer us as it is,
it is our adversary, and the worse the nearer. There are nothing but
daily contentions and jars between us, this <hi>I</hi> and this <hi>body</hi> are at continual
odds; this <hi>I</hi> delights in the Law of God, and would do good, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 19,
22. this <hi>body,</hi> this flesh, there's no good dwells in it, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. this is for one
thing, and that's for another; this for good, and that for evil; and the
fewd oft grows so high; that this poor <hi>I</hi> is fain to cry out miserably
sometimes: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
this death,</hi> this body that is like to kill me? And St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings in here
himself and his own body (whosoever it was he brought in there) as
two combatants a wrastling and the words here applied to them are
<hi>Agonistical,</hi> drawn from the measure and fashion of combatants and wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and now we are coming next to treat of them. <hi>But I keep under my
body, and bring it into subjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the business stands thus. Our <hi>Apostle</hi> being undervalued by the
false <hi>Apostles</hi> has been vindicating his priviledge, his power, and his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
all along the <hi>Chapter</hi> till <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Yet lest for all his priviledge,
power, and pains he should yet lose his reward and himself, his soul, and
his Crown, heaven and glory at the last, by some miscarriage of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he betakes himself to the course of such as strive for other Crowns,
orders his body as they do theirs, denies it the full liberties it would
take, the fullest liberties he might lawfully give it too, deals with it as
his adversary, does what he can to get it under his command, beats and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57113:138"/>
buffets it, and bears hard upon it till he has brought it fully into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Shall I shew you how he does it? I will not stir out of the <hi>Text</hi> to do
it. The words in one sense or other, after one reading or other will do it
for me. Two words there are here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
upon which the business hangs, keeping under and bringing into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>blew marks under the eyes,</hi> and signifies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as others read it, from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Dorick Dialect,</hi> is
<hi>stringendo premo, crucio, onero, strictâ manu teneo, is to suppress, or press and
streighten, vex, torment, or burthen, or carry a streight hand over.</hi> Both these
go to the keeping under of the body. Some <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we must give it, some
marks by which we may know it again, by which it may remember us,
<hi>the marks of the Lord Iesus;</hi> such St. <hi>Paul bare about him in his body,</hi> Gal. vi. 17.
And a straight hand over it we must keep, give it but hard usage, if we
intend to keep it under.</p>
            <p>From this various writing and rendring of the word, three several
ways we have pointed to us to keep the body under, Watching, Fasting,
and hard usage. Nothing (1.) commonly makes us look blewer under
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he eyes, sets those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> upon us, then watching, <hi>that</hi> does <hi>properly</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Nothing (2.) more afflicts and brings down the body,
brings us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the combatant strives to do his adversary, more sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
the heat and insurrection of it than fasting does. Nothing
(3.) more streightens, vexes, and torments it, does more <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> than
the holding a strict hand over it, and using it to hardships and severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
crossing and thwarting the rebellious and insolent humours of
it. These the means the <hi>Apostle</hi> uses to keep his body under. Watching
first.</p>
            <p>And truly I put it first because I find it so in the <hi>Apostles</hi> practice, <hi>in
watchings, in fastings,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 5. Nay, and <hi>in watchings often, in fastings
often,</hi> 2. Cor. xi. 27. And in the first and best times, when Christianity
was in its glory, when men were Christians (for I know not what to call
us now) it was much in use. So much in use, that St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tell us,
they made their little Children rise at midnight, set them up in their
beds, when they had new left their Cradles, there upon their knees to
say their prayers. The holy watches were in those times so notable,
that the very Heathens took notice of their <hi>Hymnos antelucanos, their night
Offices;</hi> and not only their early <hi>Hymns</hi> before the light broke in, but
whilst the night it self was in full course. Nor was it a piece of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a Religion of their own inventing. They thought they had
Christs command to settle it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 22. where he commands his
<hi>Disciples</hi> themselves to watch; and where he complains of them that they
did not, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 40. <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour? There</hi> is no
evasion left to fancie it only a spiritual watchfulness commanded there,
for there 'tis plainly bodily. And the reason rendred for it being <hi>lest
they enter into temptation,</hi> must needs suppose it necessary still to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
so long as the danger of temptation shall continue, which will be as
long as the flesh continues, or any of us continue in the flesh. Nor did this
watching begin with Christians. We find the Law of Nature had
taught it <hi>Iacob,</hi> ere Law or Gospel came. He wrestles all night with the
<hi>Angel untill the breaking of the day,</hi> Gen. xxxii. 24. and off he comes not
without some marks, though not under the eye, yet under the thigh,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57113:138"/>
               <hi>ver.</hi> 25. and he halts for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. yet a blessing he got by it, a new
name of honour, the name of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the glory of prevailing with
God and men, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. Go we on, and we shall find a course of watchers,
<hi>such as by night stand in the house of the Lord,</hi> Psal. cxxxiv. 2. We shall
find <hi>David,</hi> himself too, at his night watches, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. 48. often at
them. Nay, even in his very bed, watching too, it seems, when we
find him washing that, and <hi>watering his Couch with tears.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
we hear ofter that at their Prayers and Praises, whilst the dull heaviness
of the night had lapt the rest of the World in sleep and silence, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi.
25. Yea, <hi>Christ</hi> himself whose holy body needed no such correctives we
have many times at his mountain-devotion watching in them, St. <hi>Mar.</hi> i.
35. St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xiv. 23. St <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 12. St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 37. And all to give <hi>us</hi>
good example, who so much need it, that we would put a penance upon
our wandring eyes, watch this wild beast our body, (for it is no other)
and make it tame (so they do wild beasts when they intend to tame
them) and thereby frame it into a posture fit to entertain the Master at
his coming; who can never come so much to our joy and comfort, as if
he come and find us watching, find us thus markt in the eye with his
own mark; <hi>Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find
watching,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 37.</p>
            <p>But is there not (2.) a blessing belongs to fasting too? Sure, they are
blessed that are not Castavvays, and fasting is a vvay to keep us that
vve be not such; if it but keep the body under, the soul vvill surely soar
to heaven and dvvell among the blessed; and it is the second means vve
have here pointed to us to keep that under by. It vvas one of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> in
the fore-cited places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 5. and xi. 27. so proper to the purpose, that
it is called an humbling of it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxi. 29. an humbling of the very
soul too, <hi>Hsal.</hi> xxxv. 13. a chastening of our selves, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxix. 10. vvell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvering
to the <hi>Vulgar Latine castigo</hi> here. Indeed, turn'd it vvas, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
says, to his reproof, men laught at him for it (as they do still com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
at those that do so) yea, and the drunkards made Songs upon him
for it. Yet do it he vvould for all that, he vvould not be jeer'd out of his
Religion by any of the Wits, as they call them, any of the Pot-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
or Trenchermen of them all. And I knovv not vvhy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
vvho are to pass through ill report as vvell as good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 8.
should be so sensible of the scoffs of a profane buffoon as to be jeered out of
their devotion by a little scurrilous froathy language any more than he.
We have (1.) our Masters example for our fasting, even for the Fast vve are
in, (if vve have leave vvith the <hi>Ancients</hi> to dravv it thence) for forty
days together, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. 2. We have (2.) his Precept and Prediction
for fasting too, when he should be gone, St. <hi>Mar.</hi> ii. 20. We have (3.) his
order and direction how to do it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 18. When you fast do thus
and thus. We have (4.) St. <hi>Paul</hi> telling us of a giving our selves to it,
making a business of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 5. We have (5.) all the Ages of our
Christianity severely using it. We have (6.) here an excellent end of
it, the keeping under of the body, and indeed that I need not prove;
'tis the fault we find with it, that it weakens the knees, and dries up
the flesh, <hi>Psal.</hi> cix. 23. that it agrees not with our bodies. No more it
should, that's the vertue of it. And it being of that vertue, and we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so good Example, so plain Precept, so sober direction, so strict pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
so long custom, to commend us to it; I know not where it sticks,
that it is perform'd no better.</p>
            <p>Indeed, were it for the <hi>destruction</hi> of the flesh, though that the Spirit
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57113:139"/>
might be saved by it, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 5. we might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
boggle at it; but it being only for the keeping it under rule and
order, that the spirit may be sav'd, methinks we should not stick at it,
at least not stickle against it. There are but two kinds of Fasts in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
a total, and a partial; a total from all kind of meat till even, and
that was <hi>Davids, 2 Sam.</hi> iii. 23, a partial from some kinds only, and that
was <hi>Daniels, Dan.</hi> x. 3. from Flesh, and Wine, and pleasant Meats. For
his three weeks mourning there, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. was his so long fasting, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to tht <hi>Hebrew</hi> manner of expression, <hi>Lugebam</hi> for <hi>jejunabam:</hi> Neither
of these so grievous, especially if but for a time; the latter of them mild
and gentle. And if that will do it, if our abstinence from Flesh,
and Wine, and Delicates will keep under the body, the <hi>Church</hi> (it
may be) by reason of our weakness, will be content with that. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
sure, it will do towards it, and somewhat however should be done
in the point. We should do all of us as much as we can, will do so too,
if we think Saint <hi>Paul</hi> worth following, the soul worth saving, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>castaways</hi> worth preventing.</p>
            <p>But besides this watching, and this fasting, there is a third way to
keep our bodies under, by using them to some hardships and restraints.
Will you see St. <hi>Pauls</hi> way, how he us'd his? you may in the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6, 8. and xi. 26, 27. He brings his up to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and travel,, to weariness and painfulness, to hunger and thirst, to
cold and nakedness. And when we feel this beast of ours begin to kick,
or lest it do so, we must take his way, keep it down with labour and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
lash it hard, tire it out, and weary it with some busie work,
make it sometimes feel cold, and pain (we will the better understand what
the poor man feels, and the easier pitty him) keep it sometimes at least
hungry and a dry; clothe it with course geer, break its sleeps, abate its
provision, displease it in the diet, debar it sweet odours and perfumes,
deprive it of the fine dresses, bring it out now and then in a mean garb,
and fashion, and let it not continually please it self, but be forc'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to sad and displeasing objects, and to dwell upon them; to see, or
feel, or do something or other that will afflict, and grieve it; that it may
learn to know it self, and to submit. This is a third way, or rather many
ways together, a part of the business of those antient <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, those severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Religious men of old, to bring it under. But when under it is, we
must have a care also to keep it so, in subjection; an eye to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as
well as to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to lead it away as the conquering combatant does
his conquered Enemy for his Servant, or his Captive; for that's the
true meaning of the word, and the second point of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now two ways there are to bring the body into this full subjection,
after that by fasting, and watching, and some severities we have first got
it down, and kept it under for a while. The one is Temperance, the
other is <hi>Exercise:</hi> both us'd by those that strive for masteries, and taken
up from <hi>them</hi> here by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his spiritual combat with his body.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They that strive for masteries are temperate in all things,</hi> ver. 25. And
he that will have the full mastery of his body, must possess it continually
in temperance and sobriety, must <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, get all into his power,
and resolve not to be mastered either by a stragling eye, or a liquorish
palate, or an unruly tongue, or a fond desire, or a foolish fashion, or an
impetuous passion, or any importunate temptation, but make his body
to foot and lackey it after his soul, and think it glory enough, that it
may be allowed to serve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:57113:139"/>But to make it a good servant, we are also (2.) to exercise it; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it to do, and exercise it to suffer. <hi>That</hi> can neither <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, do like
a servant; nor we <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> use it like one else, that cannot be a servant,
or we masters else.</p>
            <p>Exercise it then (1.) we must to do what we would have it; accustom
it to obey, inure it to our commands, habituate it to Gods service, set
it to good works, and ply it hard; tie it to order, and bind it to rule;
bring it upon the knees, employ it continually in some acts of vertue,
piety, or obedience, and let it never be idle.</p>
            <p>Exercise it (2.) to suffer too. Use it to bear affronts, to put up indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to be crossed in the desires, to be thwarted in the ways, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traried
in the sayings, to be disobeyed in the commands, to be diverted
from the bent, to be mortified in the lusts, to be moderated in the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to be straitned in the liberties; to be delayed, put off, contradicted
in all the motions of it: a way St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes pleasure in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 10.
This is the way to subject the body thorowly, another part of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the holy men of the first ages, of the way they took to bring
their bodies into order, and their souls to salvation; a way for us to lead
the body captive to our will, to make an excellent servant of it too, that
shall both help us up, and accompany us to heaven. For it is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it, 'tis not to trample on it, 'tis not to tyrannize, and triumph over it,
but to bring it thither; not to hasten it to its Grave, but to conduct it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the seats of rest, that we use it thus; that we preach to you to watch,
and fast, and be severe upon your selves, to be temperate in all things,
and keep all this ado, 'tis only that, nor <hi>that,</hi> nor <hi>we;</hi> neither soul, nor
body prove <hi>castaways</hi> at last. That's my second general, the ground and
reason of keeping under the body, and bringing it into subjection. Lest
when <hi>I have preached,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>II. And a good reason too it is. Take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>castaway,</hi> how
you will, it is so.</p>
            <p>Take it first for such in the sight of men: we would do much, rather
than be cast in their conceits. A good report is worth all the pains we
speak of, necessary too to those that are to be employed in holy business,
<hi>Acts</hi> vi. 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 7. they should be men of good report: Certainly,
our own doctrines should not reprove us, or we think it hard to do our
selves what we require of others,; 'tis a point of honour we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to stand on, not to be out-gone and cast by our own Scholars. And
I must confess watching and fasting are two of the ways by which Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> approves himself to be a Minister of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 4. But this falls
short of the <hi>Apostles</hi> meaning.</p>
            <p>Take it (2.) for a <hi>castaway</hi> in the sight of God, for a <hi>reprobate,</hi> a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
an extreamly wicked person: that's a second sense, and nearer <hi>his;</hi>
the sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 28. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 8. and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And 'tis a thing we must take heed of: for if the body be not kept
under, but let have its swing, wicked enough we may be quickly, and
lest we grow so by it, a good reason, I think, to deal strictly and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with it.</p>
            <p>To be a <hi>castaway</hi> (3.) from the sight of God, that's a third acception
of the word, and his fear indeed, to fall short of that incorruptible
Crown he strives for, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. This best answers to the <hi>Metaphor</hi> he is
in, of running, and fighting, and wrastling for the mastery, where 'tis
not only reasonable, but necessary to take care that the body be in order,
if we look to gain the prize: and we may well fear to lose all if it be not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:57113:140"/>But what? can this great <hi>Saint</hi> after he has been caught up into the
third Heaven, fear any thing? Can <hi>he</hi> be so poor spirited as to doubt
of his salvation, and fear to be a <hi>castaway?</hi> It seems, here he was, and
that after that time he had been there; as may appear by the time of
writing the <hi>Epistles.</hi> He did not indeed much fear the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
xiii. 7. to be reprobated by men, to be cast in their opinion, but for the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>indeed,</hi> to be so by God, to be a <hi>castaway</hi> in <hi>his,</hi> lest his body should
cast him into sin, and his sin cast him of his reward, and he be cast so
from the face of God, <hi>that</hi> fear he does. And if it be possible, after we
are <hi>once enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made
partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted of the good word of God, and of the</hi>
[very] <hi>powers of the world to come,</hi> after that to fall away, (and we find it is
so, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4, 5, 6.) 'Tis time for all of us to fear, to <hi>pass the</hi> whole <hi>time
of our sojourning here in it</hi> too, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> counsels us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 17. and
good reason we have to do all we can possible to prevent it; not spare our
bodies, if we can so save our souls from being <hi>castaways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Especially having <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> next, so much ground to fear it; seeing
there are many ways to be so, for lest by any may suppose many, by some
or other of which we may miscarry. Shall I name you some, and not
wholly out of the Text, (1.) The frailties of our nature. 'Tis a body
here we have to deal with: The multitude (2.) of temptations; some
things there are suppos'd too here, may some way or other get the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over it, if we look not to it. The uncertainty (3.) of the strongest
titles that we hold by, this very <hi>I</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> it seems a very <hi>Apostle</hi> may
be a <hi>castaway,</hi> else why does he set this <hi>lest</hi> upon it. The very manner of
the working (4.) of Grace it self, that this <hi>I</hi> must give its help, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way it will not do it. Our bodies we may fear they want keeping
under, temptations we may fear, they may <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, lead them away.
This very <hi>I,</hi> as great as he is, may be led away too, and overcome. And
the grace of God it seems will not hinder it but by the ordinary way of
our working with it. All which may tell us, St. <hi>Paul</hi> fears all (2.) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good ground, fears not being <hi>cast away</hi> for nothing, fears these very
grounds we are to speak of. And,</p>
            <p>The frailty of nature, that (1.) may well be fear'd: so much flesh
there is about us, and so little spirit; a weak, and yet unruly body;
where there are so many natural weaknesses, so many acquired infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
so many necessities hang upon us, so much dulness, so much
perverseness, so mach disorder in all our powers, that I cannot but
wonder that any should be so fool-hardy as not to fear, where there
are so many in-lets, and out-lets, so many windows and posterns, so
many gaps and breaches, and easie batterings, and easier underminings,
to let in the enemy.</p>
            <p>But (2.) bring up now the forces that are laid against it, the strong
enticements and allurements, the hopes, the fears, the desires, the joys,
the sorrows that on this or that side do continually assault it; the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
occasions, the infinite opportunities that are against it: and
who is it that dares think to withstand them all.</p>
            <p>Add thirdly the strongest titles, that we hold by, and we have yet a
cause to fear; Saints, and Servants, and Sons, and Heirs, and being <hi>seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the day of Redemption,</hi> these and all those happy names and interests
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ides we read of, cannot put us above fear. Servants may be turned
away, Saints may turn sinners; Sons may be cast off; Heirs may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited,
Seals may be broken up, Elect we are no further than good
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57113:140"/>
works, created, ordained, predestinated no further, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 4, 5. and ii. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and good works I am sure have uncertainty enough, <hi>Verebar omnia, Iob</hi>
fear'd the best of them, nothing will more assure us than this godly
fear.</p>
            <p>Nay, add we lastly the very way of the working of Gods Graces in
us, and yet we have reason to fear still. We are told indeed by some,
his Grace is irresistible; but God knows we find it otherwise. Why
does S. <hi>Stephen</hi> tell us else that we resist the <hi>Holy Ghost, Acts</hi> vii. 51. or St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> wish us not to quench the Spirit, if we cannot do it, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 19.
Do it alas? we do too often. One there was that said he should never
be removed; God of his goodness had made his Hill so strong: Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
he quickly was, fell, and fell fouly too; and had he not wept
and chastned himself to purpose, had lain low enough for ever, for all
his Hill so strong. <hi>Nemo tantâ est firmitate suffultus, ut de stabilitate suâ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat
esse securus,</hi> says St. <hi>Aug. Ser.</hi> 72. Who can look upon <hi>Noahs</hi> Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Lots</hi> Drunkenness and Incest, <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murther, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
Carnality and Idolatry; <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi>
in Heaven it self, and not fear his own, poor, easie, brittle earth. We
may well fear being <hi>castaways</hi> upon such grounds as these, and fear the
very grounds that thus sink under us; not only the sad upshot at the last,
but the means that bring us to it, all the way.</p>
            <p>3. But besides, if there be no way of keeping from being <hi>castaways</hi>
without this keeping under of the body, if all our preaching, and our
great doings will not do without it, we have a third reason to fear our
selves, and set seriously about it. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> here (3.) not only fear
his being a <hi>castaway,</hi> and fear that by some means he may come to it, but
fear also that all means besides this harshness towards his body will
scarcely hinder it; if after all his preaching from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> round about
unto <hi>Ilyricum,</hi> his preaching <hi>gratis</hi> too, after all his labours, all his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all his persecutions upon the Gospel score, he fears yet that the best
he has done else, the best he can do else will not save him for all his haste:
where are our great assurers of themselves and others of Heaven and
Glory? Why? 'tis not our preaching, 'tis not our praying, 'tis not our
prophesying, 'tis not our doing wonders neither, even to the casting out
of Devils that can save us from being cast out our selves at last, with a
<hi>Non novi,</hi> the sad sentence of <hi>I never knew you depart from me,</hi> St. Mat. vii.
23. Indeed we have so little reason to be confident that we shall not be
<hi>castaways,</hi> by reason of any of those performances, that our very preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or prophesying, as we call it, nay, and praying too, may bring us
to it. We may preach Rebellion, Heresies, and Schisms, nay, and pray
them too (some have done so long) and so preach away both our selves
and others. Nay, though we preach others into Heaven, we
may preach out our selves. We may preach freely, and preach constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and preach long, and preach sound doctrine too; preach with the
tongues of <hi>Angels,</hi> and yet prove Devils at the last, grow proud upon it;
light others up to Heaven, and yet go down to Hell our selves; shine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
for a blaze, and go out in a stench, have our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here, and be
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for ever, have our reward and glory here, and be cast away for
ever.</p>
            <p>And now, if the strongest <hi>Cedars</hi> shake, what shall the Reeds do?
If the first preachers of the Gospel, the <hi>grand Apostles,</hi> those Stars and
Angels of the <hi>Churches</hi> stand so trembling, and must deal so roughly with
their bodies, for fear of being <hi>castaways,</hi> who is it can dream himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt?
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57113:141"/>
unless ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ('tis to all of us it is
said so, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 13.) there is no living. If we keep not ous bodies low,
they will keep <hi>us</hi> low, if we bring not them into subjection, they will
bring <hi>us</hi> into slavery; they will cast us away, if we <hi>cast
away</hi> too much upon them. There's no way to cure our fears, to confirm our hopes, to
help our weaknesses, to beat back temptations, to establish our titles,
and rights to Heaven, to make Gods Grace effectual upon us; to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our prayers, and preachings, and all our labours, to the glory of a
reward, but to watch, and fast, and deal severely with our bodies; to
study temperance, and exercise our selves to do and suffer hard things.
'Tis no will-worship, surely, (as men brand it) that is prest and practis'd
here under so great danger of being <hi>castaways</hi> if we do it not: it is not
sure. Nor is it so hard a business as men would seem to make it. None
of all the ways I told you of for the subduing of the body, are so at all.
We can sit up whole nights to Game, to Dance, to Revel, to see a Mask
or play; make nothing of it. We can rise up early, and go to bed late
for months together, for our gain, and profit, and be never the worse: We
can fast whole days together, and nor eat, nor drink, when we are eager
upon our business, or sport, and never feel it. We can endure pain, and
cold, and tendance, affronts, and injuries, and neglects, slightings and
reproaches too, to compass a little honour and preferment, and not say a
word. We can be temperate too when we please, for some ends and
purposes. Only the souls business is not worth the while; whether <hi>cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways</hi>
or no is not considerable; all's too much on that accompt: Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills
are Mountains, and there is a Lion always in the way: watching will
kill us, fasting will destroy us, any kind of strictness will impair us; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
it self will pine us into <hi>Skeletons;</hi> every good exercise takes up
too much time, every petty thing that crosses but the way is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
difficulty, a Lion, when the souls business is to be gone about.
Hear but St. <hi>Austin</hi> chide you, as once he chid himself, <hi>Tu non poteris
quod istae, &amp; istae, &amp; istae,</hi> What, says he, <hi>canst not thou do that which so many
weak and tender Women,</hi> so many little Children, so many of all sexes, ages,
and conditions, <hi>have</hi> so often <hi>done</hi> before thee, and thought so easie?
'Tis a shame to say so.</p>
            <p>But suppose thou art infirm indeed, and canst not do so much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
thou would'st do else, canst thou do nothing? If thou canst not
watch, canst thou not fast sometimes? If thou canst not fast, canst thou
not endure a little hunger, thirst, or cold, or pains for Heaven neither?
If all these seem hard, canst thou not be temperate neither? canst
thou not bring thy self to it by degrees, by exercise, and practice
neither? Or if thou canst not watch a night, canst thou not
watch an hour, do somewhat towards it? if thou canst not fast
from all kind of meat, canst thou not abstain at least from some;
from dainties and delicates? If not often, canst thou not at such a time
as this, when all Christians ever used to do it? Sure he that cannot fast
a meal, may yet feed upon courser fare: He that cannot do any of these
long, may do all of them some time; may exercise himself in a little
time to the hardest of them all. Let's then however set a doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what:
for God's sake let's be Christians, a little at the least; let's do
somewhat that is a kin to the antient piety, watch, or fast, or somewhat,
in some degree or other; that the world may believe that we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
Why should we be <hi>castaways</hi> from the <hi>profession</hi> too?</p>
            <p>But indeed, he that will do nothing for fear of being a <hi>castaway</hi> in the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57113:141"/>
               <hi>Text,</hi> I despair he should do any thing upon any other concernment. He
that ualues his body above his soul, his ease and pleasure above Heaven,
his temporal satisfaction above his eternal salvation; there is no more to
be said of him, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> say true, he must be a <hi>castaway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am too long, but I must not end with so sad a word. All that has been
said or preacht, is not that any should be, but that not any should be cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,
only lest they should: 'Tis in our own hands to hinder it. 'Tis but a
few hours taken from our sleep, and employedon Heaven. 'Tis but a little
taken from our full Dishes, and groaning Tables, and gorged Stomachs,
taken from our own bodies, and bestowed upon the poors. 'Tis but a
little strictness to our bodies that sets all strait. 'Tis but the keeping the
body under, and the soul in awe, and all is safe. The keeping down the
body now, shall raise up both soul and body at the last; the holy fear of
being <hi>castaways</hi> shall keep you safe from ever being so; the bringing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into subjection here, shall bring it hereafter into a Kingdom, where all
our fears shall be turned into joys, our feasting into fasting, our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into rest, all our hardships into ease and pleasure, and these very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
bodies here kept under, shall be there exalted into incorruption,
where we shall meet the full reward of all our pains and labours; we of
our preaching, you of your hearing; all of us of all the good works
we have done, all the sufferings that we shall suffer; the everlasting
Crown of Righteousness, the incorruptible and eternal Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>Which he give us at that day, who expects such things from us in
these days, to approve us at that, God the Father, Son, and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
To whom be all glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <q>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
For the end of those things is death.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hose things</hi> were sins and sinful courses: These
words an Argument to disswade from them.
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> great Argument to disswade from sin, and
the service of it. An Argument then which there
can be no greater: nothing be said more, or more
home against it. Nothing more against it, than
that nothing comes of it but shame and ruine;
nothing more home, than that which comes home
to our own bosoms, makes our selves the Judges,
our own consciences and experiences the Umpires of the business. <hi>What
fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> says our <hi>Apostle, Ye</hi>
your selves tell me if you can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What had ye then?</hi> says he to the <hi>Romans</hi> here. What have <hi>ye,</hi> now say I
to you, ye, who ere you are still, or what had ye ever, any of you, who
have at any time given up your members to uncleanness, or to any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity?
What have ye gotten by it? Bring in your Accompt, set down
the Income, reckon up the gains, sum up the Expences and Receipts,
and tell me truly what it is. Or if you be ashamed to tell it, give the
<hi>Apostle</hi> leave to do it. <hi>Fruit</hi> ye had none of it, that's certain. <hi>Shame</hi> ye
have by it; that's too sure: and <hi>death</hi> you shall have if you go on in it,
nothing surer; <hi>for the end of those things is death.</hi> What reason then to
commit or continue in them? That's St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning by the question;
as if he had said: Ye have no reason in the world at all to pursue a
course so fruitless, so dishonourable, so desperate, as your selves have
found, and will still find your sins to be.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Text,</hi> you see, is a disswasive from sin and all unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
drawn here from these four Particulars: (1.) The fruitlesness and
unprofitableness. (2.) The shame and dishonour. (3.) The mischief
and damage of it. And (4.) our own experience of them all. The
unprofitableness in the enjoyment, the shame in the remembrance, the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57113:142"/>
damage in the conclusion of every sin, and our own experience call'd in
to witness to it.</p>
            <p>The unprofitableness (1.) without fruit; <hi>What fruit had ye?</hi> That is, no
<hi>fruit</hi> had ye, none at all. There's the fruitlesness of sin, none for
the time past.</p>
            <p>None (2.) for the present, nothing but what <hi>ye are now ashamed</hi> of,
there's the shame and dishonour of sin.</p>
            <p>None (3.) for the future neither, unless it be death; there's the
damage of sin, no fruit past, present, or to come but <hi>shame</hi> and
<hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this <hi>Ye</hi> know, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as I. I appeal to your
selves, and your own experience, <hi>What fruit had ye?</hi> I dare
stand to your own confessions. I dare make your selves the
judges.</p>
            <p>Now sum up the Argument and thus it runs. Were there any profit,
O ye <hi>Romans,</hi> in your trade of sin, I might perhaps be thought too hard
to press so much upon you to perswade you from it. Or though there
were no profit, yet (2.) if there were some credit in it, something per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might be said for your continuance in it. Or though there were
neither profit nor credit for the present, yet if (3.) there were some good
might issue from it for the future, or at least the issue not so bad as death,
somewhat peradventure might be pleaded in the case. Or if this
(4.) were all only in other mens opinions, and ye found it otherwise
your selves, ye might perchance have some excuse at least to go on in
sin; but to sin when there is neither profit, nor credit, nor hope, nothing
good at any time in it, neither when 'tis past, nor while 'tis present, nor any
yet to come; but all contrary, and we our selves can witness it by sad
experience (for to our own souls and consciences the <hi>Apostle</hi> here refers
it, that so it is) when we can shew no good of what we have done, <hi>are</hi>
but <hi>ashamed</hi> of that which can be shewn, and can see nothing but <hi>death</hi>
and destruction at our heels; after all this to sin still, to sin again, any
sin again, we have as little wit one would think in it as <hi>fruit</hi> of it, as
much senselesness as <hi>shame,</hi> and are like to make but a sad <hi>end</hi> when all is
done. It would be otherwise would we sit down and think upon it. Ye
are set already, set but your thoughts and hearts to ponder and consider
what is here set before you, the fruitlesness, the shame, the damage of
sin, and your own experiences of them all, and I shall not doubt but you
will make the Application St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have you of the <hi>Text;</hi> no
longer yield your selves servants unto unrighteousness, or commit those
things whereof ye cannot but presently be ashamed, and be next door to
be confounded. Consider we then, first, the fruitlesness or unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of sin, see what that will work upon us. <hi>What fruit had ye
then,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What fruit?</hi> That is, no fruit; for so such kind of Questions common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are resolved into the strongest Negatives. No fruit, then, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
means, can be shew'd of sin: For all fruit is either profitable for use, or
pleasurable to the taste, or ot least delightful to the sight. But sin is none
of these; Nothing so unprofitable, so distasteful, so ugly and unseemly as
sin is; so, nothing so fruitless.</p>
            <p>For profitable fruit (1.) there is none in sin. Let's call those profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and advantageous sins, as men imagine them, of fraud, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and sacriledge to a reckoning, and see what comes in by them.
Our common <hi>Proverb</hi> tells us, <hi>Covetousness brings nothing home. The poor and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57113:143"/>
the deceitful man meet together,</hi> says the sacred <hi>Proverb, Prov.</hi> xxix. 13. Even
in this sense true, that the Deceiver cheats himself, and grows poor by
his own deceit; they meet together thus. The <hi>Prophet Haggai</hi> says, 'tis
but <hi>put into a bag with holes,</hi> that is taken, or kept back, or but spar'd from
the House of God, <hi>Hag.</hi> i. 6. Says <hi>Solomon</hi> too, <hi>'Tis a snare to the man who
devoureth that which is holy,</hi> things dedicated to Gods service, <hi>Prov.</hi> xx. 25.
And is all the fruit of it, all the fruit of Sacriledge come to that, to a
snare, or to a halter? Little got by that. But whether to that or no, to
a curse it comes, <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>Ye are cursed with a curse,</hi> even no less than a
whole Nation by it; grown tatter'd and poor upon it; so far are they
from a blessing or enriching by it, because 'tis <hi>Gods blessing</hi> only that truly
<hi>makes</hi> us <hi>rich,</hi> Prov. x. 22. and all that is called riches but a curse without
it. But suppose this sin, or any other, got what it could desire, even
the whole World, as wide, and full, and glorious as it is, yet <hi>What shall
it profit a man,</hi> though, says Christ, St. <hi>Mark</hi> viii. 36. What fruit has he
of it all? Less far than <hi>He,</hi> that shall sell all he has or hopes, for the point
of a Pin, or the leg of a Spider. <hi>He shall not so much as rost that which he
has got with all his hunting,</hi> is as true of him as of the slothful man, <hi>Prov.</hi>
xii. 27. Of all the fruit that he has gathered he has not, it seems, so
much as to fill his belly. But if he should eat of it till his guts crackt, he
would not thrive upon it; no thriving for body or estate when the soul
is lost, for that thriving is worse than nothing.</p>
            <p>Well, yet, if there be no profitable fruit of sin, is there (2.) no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
neither? Just as little. Examine we the most sensual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
sins; and <hi>they</hi> it must be, if any; yet not <hi>they.</hi> Drunkenness,
that great voluptuous sin, will you behold the goodly fruit it brings?
(For profit it brings none) let the <hi>Wise man</hi> satisfie you, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiii. 29.
<hi>Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babling? Who
hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry
long</hi> (says he) <hi>at the Wine, they that go to seek mixt wine.</hi> Woe, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and contentions, and reproach, and wounds, and sad mourning
eyes at last are the fair fruits and issues of this rare pleasurable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and sure there's no pleasure in any of these. Nay, even what it
pretends to most it misses. The very wine, as sweet as it relishes at the
first, <hi>bites</hi> at last, says <hi>Solomon, like a Serpent, and stings like an Adder,</hi> ver. 32.
little pleasure of all its former sweetnesses. And as little in any other
of those sins of sense which claim most to it. The fruit of Gluttony,
what is it, but dulness, and unwieldiness, gripings, vomitings, and
collicks, surfets, aches, and diseases? Of Lust, what but rottenness
in the very bones and marrow? Our very vanities tire and clog us, and
make us peevish at every trifle; Spiritual wickednesses have less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Envy and malice are their own tormentors. Pride cannot so much
as please it self. Ambition is rackt with fears, distracted with visits, and
crucified daily with its own greatness; that little-inconsiderable point
they intitle pleasure in any of these is no sooner nam'd than it is gone,
and seldom is where the name is given it. But where at the highest, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
it is with bitterness and sorrow, that you cannot discern it, or
so quickly follow'd with them, that 'tis forgotten in a moment. Nay,
that sin which seems now adays to have all the profit, pleasure, and
beauty in it, Schism and Division upon the examination will find none.
They that make Divisions among you, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they do but <hi>serve
their own belly,</hi> Rom. xvi. 18. <hi>And God shall destroy both it and them,</hi> 1 Cor. vi.
13. What's gotten then? Whatever it is, the Kingdom of Heaven
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:57113:143"/>
is lost by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 21. where's then the profit, pleasure, or beauty of
it.</p>
            <p>But though there be neither profit nor pleasure, no such fruits, is
there (3.) no beauty neither, no fair fruits in sin to look upon? Are
there not so much as the fruits of <hi>Sodom</hi> (they tell us of) goodly and
and fair to see to without, though dust and ashes all within? No, not so
much as such. Look again upon the Drunkard, see him in his cups and
revels, and what see you there but a strange disfigured countenance, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
eyes, disordered gestures, words, and looks, and actions, all disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
ugly, and deformed? Behold next the lascivious Wanton in but the
addresses to his great sin, his antick postures, his affected follies, his
empty discourses, his religious (I should say irreligious) approaches to
his adored Idoll, (to say nothing of the sin it self that darkness covers)
and tell me, if you can, what is handsom in any of his applications.
View, thirdly, the passionate, fierce, and angry man, and what is there
lovely in his flaming eyes, his furrowed brows, his distracted looks, his
frantick carriage, in his loud rantings and raving furies? Call ye the
pale and meager look of the envious or malicious comely? Is the high
carriage of the proud or ambitious pleasing? Is the close and sowre visage
of the covetous person lovely? Nay, has not the face of every sinner
surprized in his sin, or afterward reflecting on it, a kind of guilt and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
that sensibly discomposes and disorders it? <hi>Then</hi> (and that <hi>then</hi> is in
the <hi>Text) then</hi> to be sure you will find all things in that disorder, you must
be vain to expect any thing handsome or lovely there. Sin it self is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a deordination, or swerving from order and beauty. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
and <hi>pulchrum</hi> are convertible: That only which is truly good is truly
fair, and that again only truly fair which is truly good. 'Tis the fault
of our eyes if we see otherwise. For if sin were lovely God would love
it: but he hates nothing so much, nothing, indeed, but it. Sin is <hi>that</hi>
only from whence all ugliness and deformity in things or actions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is deformity, or whatsoever is deformed, 'tis sin that caused it, or
sin that is it.</p>
            <p>And is not sin now, think you, a lovely piece, that thus disorders the
Universe, and deforms the whole Creation? That brings neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor profit, nor honour with it to its unhappy servants? <hi>'Tis an evil
and bitter thing,</hi> says the <hi>Prophet Ieremy,</hi> Jer. ii. 19. There is no pleasure in
it. <hi>They,</hi> that commit it, do but <hi>hatch Cockatrices eggs, and weave the Spiders
web,</hi> says the <hi>Prophet Isaiah,</hi> Isa. lix. 5. There's no profit in it. For <hi>he that
eateth of their Eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a Viper.
Their webbs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with
their works; they,</hi> whose <hi>works are works of iniquity,</hi> ver. 6. What fruits,
I pray, are these? Or will you call them fruits? If you will, it may be
I may help you to some more such, groping for the wall as if you had no
eyes; stumbling at the noon day as in the night; roaring sore like bears,
and mourning like doves, in the fore-cited <hi>Chapter,</hi> Isa. lix. 10. 11. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and weakness, and sorrow, and mourning, even to roaring, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and stings of conscience in abundance, and inability to do good, or
help our selves, such fruits as these you may have enow. Our <hi>Apostle</hi> tells
us besides of a sad slavery it brings us to, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> of a rain
of snares, fire and brimstone, storm and tempest, that falls upon the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by it, <hi>Psal.</hi> xi. 7. Crosses and afflictions, punishments and judgments
we every where read to be the issues of it. In Gods hot displeasure, and
mans scorn, and even, in the very next words, shame also, are the only
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57113:144"/>
fruits (if we will allow them that name) of those <hi>unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> justly stiles them, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 11.</p>
            <p>Well may we now, with him, ask, <hi>What fruits have ye,</hi> or ever had ye
in such things as those? What at all, or what worth, if any at all, from
those kinds of courses? Nay, what <hi>then</hi> had ye? What had you in the
very enjoying, in the very transactions of your sins? Did they either
satisfie or content you fully even then? Were ye not either first tired
with the pursuit, or fell much short of your expectations, or distasted by
some circumstances, or unsatisfied presently when you had accomplish'd
your unhappy and wretched work? But what however have ye now left
of any of them but the shame? Call it what ye will, that ye have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the most advantageous or pleasing wickedness, say as well of it as
you can, give us but leave to discover and rifle it to your faces, and your
blushing cheeks, and down-cast eyes, and disordered answers, and vain
subterfuges and excuses will witness to your teeth that 'tis nothing but
what ye are now next, indeed, asham'd of.</p>
            <p>II. And shame now (2.) is the next Property of sin we are to speak
of, the true genuine Issue of it. For no sooner had <hi>Adam</hi> tasted the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit and sinn'd, but both he and his co-partner are both presently
asham'd, and run away to hide themselves among the Thickets of the
<hi>Garden.</hi> Oh! how they blush to look upon one another when they had
once but eaten, done what they should not! the die and colour of the
forbidden fruit had got presently into their faces, they are ashamed of
themselves, though there were none but themselves in the World to see
them. O whither should they run, what should they do to cover their
nakedness and their shame? Nakedness was no shame at first till sin
came on it, but then they are ashamed even of their nature, so strange a
confusion had one single sin brought with it. Nor could all the fig leaves
of <hi>Paradise,</hi> nor all the shades of the trees and bushes, nor the shadows of
the approaching Evening cover their new-risen blushes, nor the cool of
it allay the heat that raised them in their faces. Shame and sin are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
companions; there is no parting them. <hi>Shame</hi> (1.) to be seen of
God; they run from him; the saddest effect that can be, that so parts
and hurries us from our Maker as far as possibly we can go. <hi>Shame</hi> (2.) to
be seen of men: We dare not look upon one another when we have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and are discovered. <hi>Shame</hi> (3.) to look upon our selves; we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
get what fig-leaves we may, make what excuses we can imagine
to cover our own weakness and infirmity. <hi>Shame</hi> (4.) to be seen by any
Creature, afraid, as it were, of every whisk of wind, every stirring of
a bush, ashamed any creature should come nigh us, for fear it should
laugh at our folly, deride our infirmity, trample upon our weakness, scorn
our acquaintance, and despise our authority, if it should once behold the
deformity of our sin.</p>
            <p>Thus shame from the very first prest close upon the heels of sin. And
ask the most impudent sinner still, him whom custom has made insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and whose face continual sinning has braz'd and harden'd against the
tenderness of a blush, yet ask him, I say, why he yet seeks corners for
the accomplishment of his sin, or the contrivance of his wicked Plots.
Why does he not act it without doors, and before the Sun? Why, when
he has done it with the highest hand, and needs not fear a contradiction,
or a power to controul or punish him, why he varnishes over his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with false colours, and glosses all his actions either with the name
of Piety and Religion, Reformation and Purity, Justice and Integrity,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57113:144"/>
Conscience, and I know not what. Why he sometimes excuses it
with necessity, sometimes extenuates it with infirmity, sometimes pleads
ignorance, false information or mistake, sometimes makes one pretence,
sometimes another. Does he not evidently and plainly tell you by so
doing, he is even asham'd of the things that he has done, though he bear
it out with all the confidence he can? He cannot utterly cast off shame,
though he has done shamefac'dness. We may confidently say to him,
Those very things thou even seem'st to glory in, thou art really no other
than asham'd of.</p>
            <p>Now there is a three-fold shame, a natural, a vertuous, and a penal
shame: a shame that naturally and even against our wills attends every
unhandsome action. A godly shame (2.) that should always follow
upon it. And (3.) a shame that will else e're long pursue it.</p>
            <p>The first, or natural, is that which through the modesty of nature,
not yet habituated to the impudence of wickedness, rises e're we are
aware, from the guilt and foulness of sin, either discovered or feared to
be so. That's the reason that <hi>the eye of the Adulterer waiteth for the twi-light,</hi>
Job xxiv. 15. to hide his reproach. That the Drunkard us'd in former
times (though now grown gallant on it) to be <hi>drunk in the night,</hi> 1 Thess. v.
7. being asham'd (as civility went then) to be seen so disguised in the day:
That the Heretick and Schismatick us'd in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times though now
grown confident) to come creeping into Widows houses, and hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
behind Curtains and Aprons, asham'd of their Schisms, and new
Doctrines at the first, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 6. That still the Thief by night, and
the sly Cheat, and covetous Extortioner by underhand dealing in the
day strive to conceal the designs and practices which only night and
darkness are thought fit to cover, or give a tolerable shadow too. Even
our vanities within a while make us asham'd of them. We are within a
few days in a huge confusion to be seen in our finest Clothes, and newest
Fashions we were the other day so proud of, rather naked than in a fashion
that has another grown upon it. Indeed, when any of our sins, great, or
little, take hold upon us; then as the <hi>Prophet David</hi> professes we are not
able to look up, <hi>Psal.</hi> xl. 15. so asham'd they make us. None but <hi>Absolom,</hi>
none but the wickedest sons of Rebellion sin upon the house top, at noon
day all the people looking on. Yet even for all that, there must be a
Tent, even for such as he, some thin Veil or other; some Silk, or linen
Scarf or Curtain to cover his wickedness in the upshot, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvi. 22.
So natural a fruit and companion is shame to any sin or sinner. Sin is more
than sin, when shame is gone, when that is lost.</p>
            <p>2. Yet if so be this kind of modest shame should be laid asleep a while,
through the custom and habit of a sin, there is a second sort of shame that
must be thought on; the shame that accompanies repentance: Sin must
have repentance, and repentance will have shame. Yea, what shame?
what, or how great, I cannot tell you; but shame it must work, if it be
true: Shame of our ingratitude to God, shame of our unhandsomness
to men, shame of the disparagement we have done our nature, shame of
the dishonour we have done our selves in committing things so foul, so
brutish, so unreasonable: this the properest of the three shames we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to this place, which it seems the <hi>Romans</hi> were here come to; and
is a business we are obliged to, to repent us, and be ashamed of our sins,
to be ashamed and blush with <hi>Ezra</hi> to lift up our faces, because our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities
are increased over our head, and our trespasses grown up into the
Heavens, <hi>Ezra</hi> ix. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:57113:145"/>3. And if this we be not, there is another-gates shame will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us; shame (3.) and confusion of face: if we be not ashamed of
our sins, we shall e're long be ashamed for them; come to shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
by them: such a kind of shame as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks of,
<hi>Isa. i. 29. Ye shall be ashamed of the Oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
for the gardens which ye have chosen;</hi> your very enemies shall laugh you
to scorn; the very Oaks and Trees shake their heads at you in derision,
your Gardens bring you forth no other fruit. All that pass by shall wag
their heads, and hiss at you, <hi>Ier.</hi> xix. 8. Ye shall be a curse, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment,
and an hissing, and a reproach to all Nations, <hi>Ier.</hi> xxix. 18.
and <hi>a shameful spewing shall be on your glory,</hi> Hab. ii. 16. To this our
ill courses will bring us at the last; and yet to worse, even to death too.
For <hi>the end of those things is death:</hi> that's the third Particular, the third
Argument against sin, the mischief and damage of it in the end, and
comes next to be consider'd.</p>
            <p>III. A sad end truly, and but sorry wages for all the pains and drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that sins put us to. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here thinks it not worth the name of fruit.
Yet what fruit sin brings, if you will call it fruit, 'tis unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii.
5. But if there were any other, death so nigh at heels would devour it
all. <hi>Sin when it is finished,</hi> when 'tis at the height, compleat and perfected,
<hi>it bringeth forth death,</hi> says St. <hi>Iames</hi> i. 15. that's the end God knows.
And a threefold death it brings; a temporal, a spiritual, and an eternal
death.</p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>Thou shalt die the death,</hi> was threatned to it before it came
into the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 17. And no sooner came it, but death came by
it, <hi>death by sin, Rom.</hi> v. 12. <hi>And</hi> it <hi>past</hi> thence <hi>upon all men,</hi> too. All men
ever since have been subjected to it. All have died, and all must die for
that one sin. Ever after that first sinful morsel all are become <hi>like the
beasts that perish,</hi> Psal. xlix. 12. So that the wisest of men had much ado
to distinguish between their ends, <hi>Eccles.</hi> iii. 19, 20. <hi>As the one dieth,</hi> says
he, <hi>so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath, so that a man hath no prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
above a beast. All go unto one place, all are of the dust, and all turn to
dust again.</hi> Only indeed, a little after, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. he perceives a kind of
glimmering as it were of the humane Spirits going upward: yet with
this lessening, for all that, of <hi>who knoweth</hi> it? who can certainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and distinguish, and define the difference? so deeply has sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
us unto death, that there is no escaping; and the shadows of it
are so great, that there is no discovering of differences in the Grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ashes of a man, and of a Beast.</p>
            <p>2. But there is (2.) a death before this; a death of the soul before the
death of the body; and the much worser of the twain. <hi>The teeth of Sin,</hi>
says the Son of <hi>Syrach, are as the teeth of a Lion, slaying the souls of men,</hi>
Ecclus. xxi. 2. the very souls. The separation of the body from the
soul, which is the temporal death, is but a trifle to the separation of the
soul from God, which is the spiritual. This sin brings upon the soul in
the very act, if it rather be not it it self: the very act of sin commits the
murther, and slays the soul, whilst it is in doing. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, says the
<hi>Apostle</hi> of the voluptuous Widow that lives in sin, or pleasure, she <hi>is
dead whilst she is alive,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 6. A meer walking carkase a sinner is, a
meer motion and engine without life, and spirit, when Gods Spirit and
Grace (as by sin it does) is departed from him. The fall of the body
into the dust of the Grave, is nothing so bad as the fall of the soul into
the dirt of sin. When our souls are but once deprived of Grace, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57113:145"/>
Goodness, Gods presence so taken from us, they do but wither, and
dwindle, and die away; and we only walk like so many Ghosts among
the Graves, in the shades of night and darkness. Did we but consider or
understand how miserably the soul crawls along in this condition, when
the eternal Spirit is departed from it, seal'd up as it were by her transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
in the grave of a customary wickedness; adding still one iniquity
to another, wholly insensible of any good, as the dead body: we would
say the natural death were nothing like it, the Grave but a bed of rest
and sleep, whilst sin were the very torments of death it self. Nay, the
very pangs, and horrors of death that make way to it but little flea-bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the stings and terrors of Conscience, that often follow upon our
sins, upon the loss of Gods favour and presence.</p>
            <p>And yet there is a third death worse than both these; eternal Death:
from the two former we may rise again. The dust will one day breath
again, and the soul after the departure of Gods Spirit may again retrive
it and recover; but once within the regions of eternal death, and there
for ever. Body lost, and Soul lost, and God lost for ever. An end
indeed, without an end; an end of good, but no end of evil; where
the worm is ever dying, yet ever gnawing; the fire dark as the
most dismal night, yet ever burning; the body eternally separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from all the comforts of the soul, yet the soul ever in it: the soul
for all eternity cast out of the land of the living, separated irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
from Gods presence, the only fountain of joy, and life, and being,
and yet continually and everlastingly, feeling the horrors of this into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
parting from him. <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fires,</hi> is the sentence
long since past upon the ungodly, and the sinner by our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi>
St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. 41. The very Heathen, notwithstanding the ignorance
they were in, they were not ignorant of this, that <hi>they that commit such
things are worthy of death,</hi> so says the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> i. 32. And be the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
who it will, and be his way never so plain and easie, never so speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet <hi>at the end thereof is the pit of Hell,</hi> says the son of <hi>Syrach, E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>clus.</hi> xxi. 10.</p>
            <p>He that now promises himself any better end of his sins, or sinful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he that flatters and feeds himself with any other end of his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or his Treason, of his Faction or his Sedition, of his Covetousness,
or his Sacriledge, of his uncleanness, or his unjustice, or any other sin
(I name no more, for I leave every one to reckon up his own) he that
flatters himself, I say, with any other end of any of them to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
forget this, does but deceive himself, and fool away his soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
recovery. Here's all the fruit he is like to get, the only end he will
certainly find at last, everlasting Death; an end without an end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any thing in life to sweeten the approaches of death, without any
thing in death, fruit, or leaves to garnish up the Chambers of the Grave,
or any bud of hope to allay the misery and sadness of it. And we need
no other witness of all this, neither of the little or no fruit, nor of the
great and horrid shame, nor of the vast and miserable ruine that comes
of sin, but our own selves. <hi>What had ye?</hi> says our <hi>Apostle,</hi> ye can shew
no fruit; <hi>ye are now asham'd,</hi> and ye cannot be ignorant that death is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on. I here refer it to you, say what you can in the behalf of it; I
desire none other witnesses, nor judges, than your selves, <hi>What fruit had ye
then in those things whereof you are now asham'd:</hi> tell me if you can.</p>
            <p>IV. Indeed, there is none can tell so well as the sinner can himself
what he has gotten by his sin; whether we consider him as one reflecting
upon his ways, only as a person of reason should, or else as a Christian
will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:57113:146"/>For (1.) let any of us, as men of reason, lay together the weary steps;
the hard adventures, the vexatious troubles, the ordinary disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the impertinent visits, the thoughtful nights, the busie days,
the tumultuous uproars of our fears, our jealousies, our hopes, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs;
the unworthy condiscentions, the base disparagements, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
enterprizes, that a lust, that a humour, that a vanity puts us
to, or puts upon us: and then compare them with the lightness, the
shortness, the unprofitableness, the unsatisfactoriness, the eternal shame
and confusion we yet after all purchase, with all that toil; and we must
both needs confess, that we have done brutishly and unreasonably, and
cannot but be asham'd we have so unman'd our selves, and betrayed the
very essence and glory of our nature: not done like men.</p>
            <p>But (2.) let us renew the same reflections, and view them over again
by the light of Grace; look upon our selves as Christians thus wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betraying our God for a Lust, Christ for an Interest, our Religion for
a Fancy, our obedience for a Humour, our Charity for a Ceremony, our
Peace for a Punctilio, our duty to God and man, for a little vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of peradventure ungodly men; our Innocence for Dirt and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
our eternal Glory and Salvation for Toys and Trifles; and will we
not without more ado confess we are asham'd, infinitely asham'd of it?
Hear but those brave ranting blades, those gallant sinners, <hi>Wisdom</hi> v. 8.
what they say themselves, <hi>What hath pride profited us,</hi> say they, <hi>or what
good have riches with our vaunting brought us?</hi> as if in sum they had said,
what have all our sins procured us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Why, all those are passed away like a shadow,</hi>
ver. 9. and we are <hi>consumed in our own wickedness,</hi> ver. 13. Now indeed,
though there too late, they begin to talk like men, to speak reason.</p>
            <p>The Christian penitent, after he has run the course of sin, and is now
returning, talks somewhat higher, calls it a Prison, the Stocks, the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
the very nethermost Hell; thinks no words bad enough to stile
it by. We need not put any such upon the rack for this confession, they
go mourning and sighing it all the day long, they tell you sensibly by
their tears and blushes, by their sad countenances, and down-cast looks,
by their voluntary confessions, their willing restraints now put upon
themselves, their pining, punishing, afflicting of their souls and bodies,
their wards and watches now over every step, lest they should fall again,
that never were any poor souls so gull'd into a course, so vain, so unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
so dishonourable, so full of perplexities, so fruitful of anxieties,
so bitter, so unpleasant as sin has been, nor any thing whereof they are
so much asham'd. No fruit of all you see, even our selves being judges.</p>
            <p>And yet I will not send you away without some fruit or other; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
after all this, that may do you good.</p>
            <p>For methinks if sin have no better fruits, if wickedness come no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
off, we may first learn to be asham'd, and blush to think of it, be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of sin.</p>
            <p>We may (2.) learn to beat it off thus at its first assaults. What, thou
sin, thou lust, what fruit shall I have in thee? what good shall I reap of
thee? Do I not see shame attend thee, and death behind thee? I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
already to think upon thee: away, away, thou impudent solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
I love no such fruit, I love no such end.</p>
            <p>And if (3.) we be so unhappy as to be at any time unawares engaged
in any sin, let us strike off presently upon the arguments of the <hi>Text.</hi> For
why should we be so simple, to take a course that will not profit, to take
pains to weave a web that will not cover us, to plant trees that will
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57113:146"/>
yield no fruit, to range after fruit that has no pleasure, to court that
which has no loveliness? If we can expect nothing from our sins (as you
have heard we cannot) why do we sweat about them? if they bring
home nought but shame, why are we not at first asham'd to commit them?
if they end in death, why will ye die, O foolish people and unwise?</p>
            <p>Lastly, you that have led a course of sin, and are yet perhaps still in it,
sit down and reckon every one of you with himself, what you have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<hi>Imprimis,</hi> So much cost and charges, <hi>Item,</hi> so much pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
so much care and trouble, so much loss and damage, so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and disquiet, so much hatred and ill-will, so much disparagement
and discredit, so many anxieties and perplexities, so many weary walks,
so much waiting and attendance, so many disappointments and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
so many griefs and aches, so many infirmities and diseases,
so many watches and broken sleeps, so many dangers and distresses, so
many bitter throbs, and sharp stings, and fiery scorchings of a wounded
Conscience; so much, and so much, and so much misery, all for a few
minutes of pleasure, for a little white and yellow dirt, for a feather, or
a fly, a buzze of honour or applause, a fansie, or a humour, for a place of
business, or vexation, sum'd up all in air, and wind, and dust, and nothing.
Learn thus to make a daily reflection upon your selves and sins.</p>
            <p>But after all these, remember lastly, 'tis Death, eternal Death, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
misery, Hell, and damnation without end, that is, the end of sin;
that all this everlasting is for a thing that's never lasting, a thing that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
often in its doing; all this death for that only which is the very
shame of life, and even turns it into death: and surely you will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yield your members, your souls and bodies to iniquity, unto iniquity,
but unto righteousness, unto holiness. So shall ye happily comply with
the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument in the <hi>Text,</hi> and draw it as he would have you, to
the head, do what he intends and aims at by it; and by so doing, attain
that which he desires you should, make your selves the greatest gainers
can be imagined; gain good out of evil, glory out of shame, life out of
death, all things out of nothing, eternal life, everlasting glory. Which,

of you but heard. And that in this Race all that run
do not obtain, no more than they do that run in other
Races, every one sees, and every one can tell you.
<hi>Not every one,</hi> we told you the last day, not they that
run only with their tongues, run they <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> never so fast; not many
others that run further than so you will hear anon, and too common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
can inform you.</p>
            <p>But how so to run as to obtain is not a piece of so common knowledge.
<hi>Hic labor hoc opus est.</hi> This is the Apostles business, a business ordinary
Christians are not sufficiently skill'd in, 'tis to be fear'd; or if sufficiently
skill'd in, not so practised in, but that they want a <hi>voice</hi> both <hi>behind</hi> and
before <hi>them</hi> to tell them, <hi>this is the way</hi> they are to walk in. <hi>This is the way,
walk in it,</hi> so, and <hi>so run that you may obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were we to run in those <hi>Olympick</hi> Games (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here seems to
allude to) they who were practised in those sports and exercises, were
fittest to instruct us how so to run as to be conquerours there. But being
now to run the true <hi>Olympick,</hi> that is, the heavenly Race, the true Race
to heaven that true <hi>Olympus,</hi> which that <hi>Poetical</hi> did but shadow, this
our <hi>Apostle,</hi> that great wrastler, <hi>not against flesh and bloud</hi> (though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense against that too) <hi>but against Principalities, and Powers, against the
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness,</hi> whose whole life was nothing
else but a continual exercise of all the hardships in the Christian course,
who so gloriously <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and <hi>finished his course,</hi> can best teach
us how to do so too. With this <hi>Prerogative</hi> too above the cunningest of
those <hi>Olympick</hi> Masters, that they cannot so instruct their Schollars that
they shall be sure of the prize they run for, though they run never so
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57113:147"/>
accurately to their Rules, many there running, and but one obtaining;
but here by St. <hi>Paul's</hi> direction we may all run, and all obtain. For
to that purpose only we are invited and directed to run, that we may
obtain.</p>
            <p>Yet true it is, as we may all obtain, so we may not; and it will be but
a spur to us to fear it, one spur to hasten and quicken us in our course.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> had such a one now and then to make him run. He had run
much; from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> round about unto <hi>Illyricum,</hi> Rom. xv. 19. yet lest
he had, or <hi>should run in vain,</hi> he gathers up his heels and to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> he
goes again, to see whether he had not run so, or might not at the last,
<hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 2. and notwithstanding all his great pains and care in the Gospel
of Christ, in preaching it freely too, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. without any charge to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> applying himself to all ways and means to gain <hi>them,</hi> and
and becoming any thing to make <hi>them</hi> Christs, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. he yet tells us
what a doe he kept with his body, lest when he had done all he <hi>should be a
Castaway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that such a one he should not be, he had some hope, that he should
be a partaker rather of the Gospel in its Reward as well as in its Work,
in the <hi>verse</hi> before the <hi>Text.</hi> This is the other spur to him in his course,
must be to us, that <hi>we</hi> thus quickned to our Race, and by these two,
hope to obtain, and fear to lose, as by two leaden Plummets, in each hand
one, to poise us as we run, may so run as to obtain.</p>
            <p>We <hi>may</hi> obtain, that's our hope; yet it is but <hi>may,</hi> that's our fear:
Yet no fear at all, if we run but so as we should, if we observe but the
<hi>Apostles</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, his way and mode. To obtain or get to heaven is a work of
labour and business, not of pretence and talk. It was we lately told
you, to do somewhat, now you will find it to do much, to take some
pains, and run about it. 'Tis a business of order and regularity, so and
so, not any how, to be performed. 'Tis a work of time and forecast, that
considers seriously what it is about; that casts which way to go, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are going; what it is we aim at, and how to compass it; what
it is we would obtain, and how to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Thus whilst I have given you the Sum, I have given you also the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the <hi>Text,</hi> only I shall point out the parts again in order, and tell

               <item>III. That this end we are to set before us, and so order all our course and

               <item>IV. And then, lastly, to <hi>stir up our souls and bodies to it</hi> with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this <hi>may;</hi> this Particle, which may serve both to
<hi>awe,</hi> and to <hi>encourage</hi> us, that from the hope that we <hi>may,</hi> and the
fear because it is no more than <hi>may,</hi> not <hi>shall</hi> or <hi>must,</hi> we may be
the more diligent in our course, and the more successful in our end,
that we may be sure so to run as to obtain.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin at the Christians course, to shew you what it is; then (2.) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it tends. It tends to a Crown, it tends to a Reward, it tends to
Heaven, it tends to <hi>obtain</hi> it, but by pains and labour it is (1.) that it
atchieves it. It is a course of labour and pains that must bring us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
whereby only we can obtain it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:57113:148"/>If Christianity be a course or Race, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. it is
a course of labour. <hi>Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit &amp; alsit. Many a hot and
cold sweat it has in it;</hi> much done, and much suffered in it from our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
Thence they begin to inure themselves to hardships and exercise
that intend to bear the <hi>Garlands</hi> at those Sports and <hi>Games.</hi> There should
we begin too to minister before the Lord, with <hi>Samuel,</hi> when we are
Children. If we have <hi>not,</hi> our Children may serve the Lord, as he did,
girded with a <hi>Linnen Ephod,</hi> 1 Sam. ii. 18. their <hi>Loyns girt</hi> up for the course,
even from their Chilhood; girt with white Linnen, pure and harmless
innocence; with a <hi>Linnen Ephod,</hi> bound to holy exercises, to assist <hi>Eli</hi> the
<hi>Priest</hi> in the service of God, if it be but with short <hi>Responsals</hi> and <hi>Amens;</hi>
girt and set betimes to Gods service. The word <hi>run</hi> is no idle word,
there is pains and labour in it. They much deceive themselves that think
there is a <hi>Quis requisivit</hi> upon all hardships in Christianity, that when
men tell them of any strictness or rigours there, answer presently, <hi>Who
has required it at your hands?</hi> Who? Why, he has done it, who they say
has not. Else certainly the <hi>Apostle</hi> would have spared himself as well as
they; would not have been so often <hi>beaten with rods,</hi> and laid on with
stripes, so often <hi>shipwrackt, in journeyings so often, in perils</hi> so often, <hi>perils
of waters,</hi> and <hi>perils of robbers, in perils by his own Country-men, perils by the
heathen, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brethren;</hi>
he would not have been so often <hi>in weariness and painfulness, in watchings</hi>
so <hi>often,</hi> so much <hi>in hunger, and thirst, in fastings</hi> so frequent, <hi>in cold and
nakedness</hi> so commonly, <hi>in deaths</hi> so <hi>oft</hi> as he tells us he was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 24, 25,
26, 27. had the way to heaven been so easie, as these men, that would
not forgo a jot of ease or pleasure, of meat, or drink, or sleep for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
would have it. Nor would he have prov'd the course of his Ministry
to be Gods, by his <hi>patience, afflictions, necessities, distresses, by stripes, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments,</hi>
tossings to and fro, by <hi>labours,</hi> and <hi>watchings,</hi> and <hi>fastings,</hi> as he
does, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 4, 5. could he have told how to have prov'd it better.
Nor would he have taken so much pains to keep under his body, to
buffet and humble it as he does, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. of this very <hi>Chapter;</hi> Were not
this obtaining Heaven somewhat a hard and laboursome business. This
is the course that brings thither, the course that, finished, brought him
the <hi>Crown of righteousness,</hi> 2 Tim. iv. 8. It is violence and force that take
heaven, says our only Saviour. The way to it is not strow'd with Roses
and Violets, nor spread with Carpets and Cushions, <hi>non jacet in molli,</hi> but
with Thorns, and Briers, and craggy Rocks.</p>
            <p>There are works and duties of Christianity, that cannot be performed
without much trouble. He must not fear his skin that puts himself into
Christs service; he must venture far, and hazard much sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he will give out by the way, and lose his reward. There is nothing
so hard in humane affairs but may fall into the spiritual and heavenly.
The pursuit of worldly projects, those empty, unsatisfying. and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
nothings cost us many a weary step, many a broken sleep, many
a tired body: and can we think to obtain the fulness of the joys above,
that fill and never fail, with less? Surely, did we consider the practise
of those first Christian <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> those daily pains and cares
their days and nights were spent in, we would think our Race to heaven
another-gates business, Christianity another manner of thing than we
make it now a days, or are willing to conceive it.</p>
            <p>Were there no other word than this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Text,</hi> this <hi>run</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, we might understand it to be a work of labour, and if we take it
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:57113:148"/>
with that reference it has to the <hi>Olympick</hi> Races, there are many things
in the performance that will sufficiently shew it. What a deal of pains
and care did they take first to fit and prepare themselves? And then with
what might and main did they pursue their course? How often have
such Racers been taken up at the Goal so tired and spent that they have
had much ado to recover their life or spirits? Ah! did we but half so
much for heaven there were no doubt of it.</p>
            <p>Running, take we it how we will, is a violent exercise, that for the
time imploys all the parts and powers. 'Tis <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> would have
here, that all the faculties and powers of our souls and bodies should be
taken up in the business of heaven. Our heads study it, our hearts bend
wholly to it, our affections strive violently after it, our hands labour for
it, our feet run the ways of Gods Commandments to come to it, our
eyes run down with water for it, and our bodies with sweat about it.
'Twill cost somewhat more to come to heaven than a few good words at
the last, than a <hi>Lord forgive me and have mercy upon me,</hi> when we are going
out of the World; or than a hot fit or two of Piety when we are in it;
or a cold and careless walking and stragling up and down in it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
even all our lives. Nay, more, 'tis not running over whole <hi>Breviaries</hi>
of Prayers. 'Tis not running over good Books only neither, reading
and studying of good things, but running as we read, <hi>that all that run may
read</hi> in our running the <hi>Characters</hi> of heaven. Would men but lay this
to heart, that it is no such easie or perfunctory business to get thither,
their courses would be better, their lives holier, themselves heavenlier
than they are, nor would so many put off the work to the last cast, make
a meer death-bed business of it, as if they then were fit enough to run
Gods ways when they cannot stir a hand or foot; whereby 'tis more then
to be fear'd they deceive themselves, and being then in no possibility to
run, they go they know not whither.</p>
            <p>II. And yet for all the pains and running we talk of, if now secondly
it have not an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to rule and steer it, if it be not a <hi>so</hi> running, such a
one as is right set to obtain, we had as good sit still. This <hi>so</hi> to run, is
(1.) To run lawfully; (2.) To run carefully; (3.) To run speedily;
(4.) To run willingly; (5.) To run stoutly; (6.) To run patiently;
(7.) To run constantly, and to the end. To run (1.) lawfully, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws and Rules prescribed to obtain it; (2.) Carefully, the
way to obtain it; (3.) Speedily, with the speed requisite to obtain it;
(4.) Willingly with spirit to obtain it; (5.) Stoutly, to endure any thing
to obtain it; (6.) Patiently, to expect to obtain it; (7.) Constantly,
not giving out till we obtain it.</p>
            <p>1. Lawfully, according to the Laws and Rules of the Race we are to
run, we are not crowned else, says our Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii 5. Now the
Laws of the Christian Race are Gods Commandments, according to
which we are diligently to direct our steps: Yet three Laws there are
more particular and proper to it, the Law of Faith, the Law of Hope,
and the Law of Charity. These the three more peculiar Rules of it.
We must run in a full belief of Gods Promises in Christ, that in him
they are yea, and in him <hi>Amen,</hi> that God will not let one tittle of them
fall to the ground, <hi>Looking unto Iesus the Author and finisher of our faith,
Heb.</hi> xii. 2. of our course too. We must, secondly, run in hope, that
through his grace we also, even we though the most unworthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>laying hold upon the hope so set before us,</hi> Heb. vi. 18. And thirdly, in
Charity must be our course, though we strive for the mastery, it must not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:57113:149"/>
be in strife or envy, but in love and charity, in unity and peace, in <hi>love
unfeigned</hi> our selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 6. and provoking one another to it, <hi>Heb.</hi>
x. 24. no other strifes or provocation, but who shall go before one another
in love, so keeping the bond of peace, which once broken, our clothes
and garments, which were tied up to us with it, as with a girdle, fall all
down about us, and hinder us both in our Race, and of our Crown.
Those who have broke this bond, and rent the Churches Robes, and
their own souls by their unhappy separations, will, after all their labour
with those in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> sleep their sleep, and find nothing; nothing but
that they have hindered both others and themselves of the Crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Run we lawfully and orderly then, that first.</p>
            <p>And (2.) run we carefully too, neither to the right hand, nor to the
left; neither looking after sensual pleasures, or worldly profits, or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
lusts, not turning aside after those golden balls, which the Devil, the
Flesh, and world, are always casting in the way to hinder us, but straight
on our course, carefully shunning all temptations, stumbling-blocks, and
stones of offence, which are likely to trip up our heels, and throw us in
our race, <hi>what carefulness,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> vii. 11. has your godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
wrought? will earnest desire of a heavenly Crown, say I, work in
you, if you would think upon it?</p>
            <p>It would make you (3.) gather up all your strength, set to all your
force, put to all your speed; you would think you could not come soon
enough to so glorious a Goal. <hi>Let us go speedily, and pray before the Lord,</hi>
say they in <hi>Zachary</hi> viii. 21. <hi>Make haste and come down,</hi> says our <hi>Saviour</hi> to
<hi>Zacheus,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 6. as if he that meant to see Christ here at his own
house, or hereafter in his, must make what haste he can. Running is
our speediest motion, and the more haste to Heaven, the better speed;
though to earthly things the proverb says it is not; and the reason may
be indeed, because our swiftest motion is to be towards Heaven, to be
reserv'd for that.</p>
            <p>Yet willingly (4.) must it be, we must do it without Whip, or Spur,
they are for unreasonable Beasts, and not for men in running. We are
not to look that God should force and drive us to his work, he loves no
such workmen: A ready mind is Gods Sacrifice, he accepts no other. <hi>If
I do it willingly,</hi> says our <hi>Apostle, ver. 17. I have a reward,</hi> no reward else to
be expected.</p>
            <p>But (5.) we must run stoutly too, bear any thing, do any thing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any thing for the Crown of Heaven; afflictions, persecutions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
any losses, any hardships, for the name of Christ. We must
not be frighted out of our course of Piety, and Religion, by the threats
of men, nor put out of it by the scoffs and flouts of standers by, nor dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from it by the fear of danger, and loss; nor diverted by the hope of
earthly honour and preferment, nor flatter'd out of it by ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor fool'd out of it by seducers and false guides; but bear up stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our course, against wind, and weather, storm and tempest, men and
devils.</p>
            <p>And though some of these perhaps may somewhat hinder us in our
course, and make it the more difficult, and the way seem longer, yet
(6.) if we <hi>run with patience,</hi> as our <hi>Apostle</hi> again would have us, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 1.
<hi>the race which is set before us;</hi> if we give not over yet, but go on expecting,
content however though it be long, that we shall come at last, willing
to suffer any thing, and stay any time that God would have us, we shall
obtain at last; but if we give out, we are lost for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:57113:149"/>For (7.) constantly also we are to run, not to run a while, and then
make a stand; now a spurt, and then a spurt, <hi>Vbi non currere ibi deficere
incipis,</hi> says devout St. <hi>Bernard, When we begin to slack our running, we begin
to fail of our reward.</hi> If we give over here, if we did run well, and do
not, St. <hi>Paul</hi> says we are bewitcht, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 7. and will ask us too, as he
did them, who has bewitched us, that we should no longer obey the
truth, that we run no more? we must run constantly and not give over,
nay, and constantly also and not give out. <hi>He that continues to the end, is</hi>
he <hi>only that shall be saved,</hi> that shall obtain the crown of life. Christ
himself, who is our Crown, and our Joy, he was obedient unto the
death; and unless we be so too, unless we hold the beginning of our
confidence stedfast unto the end, we shall not be partakers of <hi>him;</hi> for
they only are, that do so, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 14. So now you have this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
manner of your running, how it must be, lawfully, according to the rule
that God has given, that we swerve not from it; carefully in the way
that God has set us, that we erre not from it; speedily, that we come
not when the doors are shut; chearfully, that we may have a reward;
stoutly, that we be not baffled in our course; patiently, that we faint
not by the way; and constantly, that we fail not of our end, the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our souls. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay, but how may we obtain to run so? why, do as the runners in Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do (1.) Diet our bodies, (2.) Exercise our selves before, (3.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,

to it the obtaining.</p>
            <p>1. Diet we our bodies by temperance and abstinence. 'Tis in the <hi>next
verse,</hi> that <hi>every man that striveth for the mastery, is temperate in all things.
Abstinuit vino &amp; Venere,</hi> says the <hi>Poet,</hi> he abstains from riot and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
runs not with the world into the same excess of riot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 4.
from chambering and wantonness, runs not to his neighbours bed; a
head full of drink, a belly full of meat, and a body weakened with lust,
are fitter to lie down than to run. He that intends himself for a Race, for
this especially, must keep under his body, <hi>and bring it into subjection,</hi> with
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ver. 27. keep it empty, and agile, and firm, and sound.</p>
            <p>And (2.) he must exercise himself for the Race, that intends so to
run as to obtain; they do so that run Races, try and exercise before, keep
themselves continually doing: and they that are skilful in the word of
righteousness, and successful in the work, have <hi>their senses exercised to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
both good and evil,</hi> Heb. vi. 14. must exercise themselves unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

<hi>Psal.</hi> i. 2. and with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> again, exercise themselves to have always
a Conscience void of offence, toward God, and toward men, <hi>Acts</hi>
xxiv. 16.</p>
            <p>3. Consider also and contrive we must, what way we had best to tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of repentance. It was an old Ceremony, in some Churches yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
in Baptism, to anoint the baptized person in the name of the Lord,
in token that he was now to address himself to the course, to run the race
of Christianity, that was then set before him. You have now this
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> complete, what it is <hi>so</hi> to run both in its setting out, and
in its moving on, we will now see what it will come to in the end, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Yet before I come to that, give me leave a little to sum up the whole
manner of our running, by a kind of <hi>allegorizing,</hi> some several runnings
in Scripture we may read of.</p>
            <p>Leave we then first the oxen and run we with <hi>Elisha</hi> after <hi>Eliah, 2 Kings</hi>
xix. 20. Leave we all secular and worldly business to tend upon the word
of the Lord in the mouths of his Prophets. Run we next with <hi>Laban</hi> to
the well, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxiv. 29. to the well-springs of salvation. Rouse we
up our selves then out of our beds, out of our drousie dulness and earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with young <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> iii. 5. and run to <hi>Eli,</hi> the <hi>Priest,</hi> to ask
counsel of him, when God begins first to appear to us, that we may be
instructed what to do. Run we then with little <hi>Zacheus,</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 4.
and climb up into the tree, make our thoughts ascend, that we may
see Christ. Run we then after him, with the people on foot, S. <hi>Mark</hi>
vi. 35. out of our Cities, refuse no pains, nor think much to leave our
houses a while to overtake him. When we see good thoughts coming
to us, run we as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to meet the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> xx. 5. make haste
to entertain them, and bow down our selves before them, and entreat
them to stay, and tarry with us; run then presently to the herd and
fetch a calf and haste to slay and dress it for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. to the unruly
herd of our sensual passions, and affections, and mortifie them and dress
them better than heretofore. When any evil motions at any time arise,
run we with <hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> xvii. 51. and stand upon that <hi>Philistin,</hi> and cut
off his head, kill it in the cradle, nip it in the bud. When we fall into
sin, run with <hi>Rebecca, Gen.</hi> xxiv. 20. unto the well again, and draw thence
the waters of Repentance. If any temptation yet pursue us, that we
cannot resist, run we away with <hi>Iotham, Iudges</hi> ix. 21. and flee from it.
When troubles come upon us, run we to the hills, from whence cometh
our help, to the name of the Lord, as a strong tower, <hi>Prov.</hi> xviii. 10. to
our prayers. When we are in any good way of devotion and piety, run
we like the Sun out of his Chamber, and rejoyce we like a Giant to run
our course, <hi>Psal.</hi> xix. 5. Run we like <hi>Ioels</hi> horsemen, <hi>Ioel</hi> ii. 4. like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hums</hi>
lightning, <hi>Nahum</hi> ii. 4. in all good ways. If adversity betide us,
run we like the Rivers that the <hi>Prophet David</hi> speaks of among the hills,
<hi>Psal.</hi> civ. 10. hold up our heads still for all the sorrow. If prosperity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57113:150"/>
us, run we with <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> by the way of the plain, be lowly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in it; and when any good befalls us, run we with St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
unto the Sepulchre, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xx. 4. think we of our lives end, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a while we may enjoy it: run we to our friends with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and tell
them of it, make them partakers of Gods goodness too, that they may
rejoyce and praise God with us. In a word, in all distresses, in all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
run we with those <hi>Benjamites, Iudges</hi> xx. 41. to the <hi>Rock Rimmon,</hi> the
<hi>Rock Christ Iesus,</hi> and abide there not for some months or years, but for
ever, so run and so obtain. There will all our running be at an end, and
he and his salvation, he in his Fathers house is the end of all our running,
that which we are to aim at, that which we are to run for.</p>
            <p>III. For run for something we must, and we can run for nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
All men and creatures stir not from their place, but for some end,
to obtain somewhat. But men and reasonable creatures propound it to
themselves. I cannot tell you the several ends they do propound; but I
can tell you the end they should propound. Or rather let St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell
you, and you shall go no further for it then the very next <hi>verse, a Crown
incorruptible,</hi>
if you would yet know plainer what that is, look but to the
2 of <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 10. and thus you find it, that ye may <hi>obtain the salvation
which is in Christ Iesus, with eternal glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed methinks the one only word of the <hi>Text,</hi> this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this
obtain single without any super-addition, is sufficient to express it all:
for we obtain nothing till we obtain that, all that we get, or gain, or
purchase till we come to <hi>that,</hi> to the salvation in Christ, with eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is not worth the name of obtaining, of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all Crowns, and
glories of the world but dross and dung, not worth the taking up, not
any thing worth obtaining in comparison of this Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vt Comprehendatis</hi> it is in Latin; and it is a word that the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whose business is to speak most accurately and distinctly, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appropriated to the other life. There we are first only <hi>comprehensores,</hi>
comprehensours, that is, obtainers. Nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself is so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
too, that after all his pains in the Gospel of Christ, all his conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Christ, and the greatest height of perfection in Christ, that he
was arrived at, (which is a business and glory worth all the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides)
says yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I count not my self to have comprehended,</hi>
or obtained, so it should be rendred, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 13. professes himself not
to have obtained. Attained perhaps he will grant you, or apprehended,
somewhat towards it; apprehended peradventure, but not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, made way to his Crown, but not come to it,
not obtained it.</p>
            <p>So you see what it is you are to run for. Not a Crown of Bays or
Laurel, not the praise and commendations of men, not any earthly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
interest, or profit; but the honour of Heaven, the praise of God,
the Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>Not fading and decaying pleasures, such as the leaves of the trees,
or the flower of the field, that give a verdant beauty and fragrant smell
for a while and vanish, are we to set before us. Not the praise of men
are we to run our race, or do our works for; to be seen of men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by them. <hi>They</hi> indeed that do so, says Christ, <hi>have their reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but they had better be without it; for 'tis but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
they have it away with them, and must look for no more, that's all they
are like to have; they have beaten the air, contrary to the <hi>Apostle, ver.</hi>
26. and with the air they are past away: Air they sought for, and air
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57113:151"/>
they only have, a little foolish and vain breath, for all their pains; they
can shew nothing that they have obtained; and the very praise they
sought proves nothing too; for not he that man commends, but whom
the Lord commends, is only truly praised and commended, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 18.
Not any earthly ends (3.) are we to run for; that is, but <hi>currere in incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
at the best, to run as uncertainly, to run for uncertainties, things
that it is a doubt whether we shall get in in Gods Service, (who rewards
us better than with temporal rewards) and it is no doubt but they are
most uncertain, and cannot, <hi>comprehendi,</hi> be so laid hold on that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y will
not flee away; things that we our selves are to deny our selves in Gods
Service sometimes, such as it is a point of our running, to run from,
when they will hinder our course; and such as in such times as these are
not to be expected by them that faithfully and stoutly run the Christian
race, that hold out their course in true Religion, and the obedience of
Christ, and the Communion of his Church. Heaven only it is we are
to run to, and <hi>Iesus the author and finisher of our Faith,</hi> our infinite and
exceeding great reward, and the joy which was set before him it is we
are to look to, to no other recompence of reward, no other recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
and rewarder.</p>
            <p>But to him and to that lastly now we are to look: if he himself set the
joy of the right hand of the Throne of God before his eyes, that he might
the better endure the cross, and despise the shame, and so run the race
that his Father set him, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2. if he had an eye to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of reward, well certainly may we set such a consideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, and they talk they know not what, that deny it. God allures
us by rewards, and Christ himself preaching the Gospel began it, with
this encouragement to incite us to listen to it, because the Kingdom of
Heaven was at hand, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> iv. 17. Set we then those joys before us,
and fear not: look we in all our tribulations and sufferings, upon them,
to comfort and uphold us, in all our difficulties to encourage us, in all
our devotions to enflame us. Consider we, that all we do, that all we
suffer, is nothing to be compared to the Crown of Glory, that is laid up
for us, that all our pains and labour, going, and running, and sweating,
and blowing for Christ, is not to be mentioned or thought upon; so that
at last we may obtain.</p>
            <p>IV. Yet to keep our spirits in awe, and keep down our pride, that is
likely to arise sometimes upon our well running, and to make us diligent
and constant in our course, let us remember, it is but a <hi>may obtain</hi> the
while: we may miss as well, shall too, if we run not orderly, or give
out. 'Tis no more than we shall reap if we faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 9. If we
fail or faint we shall not; our Kingdom is removed, our Crown is gone.
Work we then our salvation out with fear and trembling, as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
advises us, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 12. that's the way to make us so to run as to obtain.
There's no such certainly to obtain, as some imagine, and delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with; no peremptory decree for their obtaining, though they run
how they will, nor any peremptory order neither that they shall run in
their due time whether they will or no: that God will force them either
to the Race, or to the Crown; either to run, or to obtain. 'Tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but the greatest vanity and fallacy in the world to think to get to
Heaven without pains, to go thither with all kind of pomp, and ease,
and pleasures to have our portion here, and hereafter too. 'Tis no such
matter, the way is strait, and narrow, that leads thither, says he that
came to shew it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 14. and a race here we have to run for it,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57113:151"/>
and all the way but a <hi>may,</hi> a possibility, or a probability, not a necessity to
obtain it. Look we carefully to our feet, apply we our selves diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to our course, to run the ways of righteousness, and peace; of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and salvation. Let us often look up to Heaven, and the Crown of
Glory laid up there, to add wings and spirit to us; and look we also
down sometimes to the dangers by the way, and fear our selves; and
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> our steps, lest we chance to stumble, and fall, to grow faint, or
weary; but that we may run lawfully, carefully, speedily, chearfully,
stoutly, patiently, and constantly to the end; that so running, we may
obtain the end of our hopes, the crown of of our joy, the salvation of
our souls, and the redemption of our bodies, everlasting life, and eternal
glory. Which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Text</hi> is a comparison between the worldly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant
and the spiritual, between the wrastler of
this World, and the wrastler with it, between him
that strives for the mastery over others, and him
that strives for the mastery over himself; between
the contenders in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, and the
contender in the <hi>Christian</hi> Race.</p>
            <p>And 'tis an apt and fit comparison. <hi>Olympus</hi> in
the Heathen <hi>Poets</hi> is commonly used for heaven,
so the <hi>Olympick</hi> exercises may well be used to resemble those for heaven,
and the heavenly Crown likened to the <hi>Olympick</hi> Garland, without any
offence, though with all advantage.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as seasonable as fit. This holy time of <hi>Lent</hi> is a time of stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for the mastery with our corruptions, with our corruptible for Gods
incorruptible, a time of holy exercises upon the corruptible earth to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Crown incorruptible in the heavens.</p>
            <p>And 'tis somewhat more accommodate and easie to our natures, as
much as temperance is than fasting, as partial abstinence from inordinacy
and excess, than abstaining altogether.</p>
            <p>Which makes me hope it will be as profitable as either fit, or seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or accommodate; to teach us by comparing our selves with the
Wrastlers of the World: our work with theirs, our reward with theirs,
to do as much as they. Indeed, it should be more, as our work is more
honourable than theirs, more honourable to master our selves than
others, our own unruly beastly passions than any man or beast whatever;
and our Crown more worth than theirs, incorruptible than corruptible,
and the obtaining it every way as easie, if we would but think it so, or
set seriously to think of it: what they do, and what they do it for, how
much they do, and how little they do it for; what we do, and for what
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57113:152"/>
we do it; how little we do, and for how much we do it; how little they
get for so much, how much we may get for so little.</p>
            <p>This is the Sum of the <hi>Text;</hi> and the intent is to perswade us to be as
industrious and careful for a Crown of glory as they are for a Crown of
grass, to take as much pains for the praise of God as they did for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of men, to do and suffer as much for heaven as they for less than
earth, for a few leaves that grow out of it. And both the one is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be understood, the other the more likely to be perswaded if I keep
the parts of the Comparison together, and do not sunder them, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them as we go.</p>

to do all things whereby we may come at last to obtain this incorruptible
Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>I begin with the two <hi>Combatants:</hi> the one, is <hi>any man;</hi> the other, <hi>any
Christian;</hi> the first is a man and no more, the other has a relation to Christ
added to him.</p>
            <p>That man, that every man striveth for the mastery, to outgo his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
some way or other is from his very nature; there is a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
contention thence in every body to be some body more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If this contention were placed upon good things, or things worth
the striving for, it were happy for us. But if we have no better assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
than from nature, we fix it upon Games and Sports, Vanities and
Trifles 'tis them we only strive about, there lies our business and our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, every one of us is no better, strive and study for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; and yet vain men that we are, we trouble and toil our selves
as much about such nothings, as if they were all we could desire, all we
could do.</p>
            <p>It being then so natural and necessary a condition to every one of us
to be striving for somewhat or other, to aim at some ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ence or
other, to be better than our neighbours in some way or other. It were to
be desired that this desire, and earnest pursuit were pitched right. 'Tis so
in the other of the two <hi>Combatants,</hi> the <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He indeed is the only <hi>man that strives for the mastery.</hi> All others strive
for that only which is but slavery when all is done; We, We Christians
alone strive for that which is mastery and excellence. The more men
strive for earthly things, the more are they brought under the dominion
of them, the greater is their vassalage, and brings them no better, but
to cry out with <hi>Paul,</hi> in the person of the unregenerate man, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii.
<hi>Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> 'Tis Gods <hi>service</hi> only that <hi>is
perfect freedom;</hi> we are then only free when we are free to righteousness,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57113:153"/>
then only masters when we can command our selves. For <hi>an ille mihi
liber videatur cui mulier imperat?</hi> &amp;c. says the <hi>Heathen Orator. Can you think
him to have got the mastery whom vanity commands,</hi> whom his Lusts give Law
to, who can neither go nor come, eat nor drink, wake nor sleep, work
nor play, speak nor do, desire nor think, but what they would have
him. <hi>Ego vero istum non modo servum sed nequissimum servum, etiamsi in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plissimâ
familiâ natus sit, appellandum puto. I truly.</hi> says he again, <hi>think he is
not only a servant, but a drudge, be he who he will, of never so honourable a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
I add, be his victory never so great and notable in meer vain and
corruptible things. They do but press him down the more, and subject
him to vanity, and leave him groaning under the bondage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The master over these is the true Christian only, who by his faith
and resignation conquers all his conquests, gets the better both when he
overcomes, and is overcome; both when his enemy oppresses him, as
well as when himself subdues him, who makes all things serve his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
every thing enhance his glory, also things work unto his good,
advance his Crown. All else are but the slaves of their conquests, meer
drudges to an empty name, an airy title.</p>
            <p>And (2.) if we take <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> for one that strives or fights, none so
truly does it as the Christian. All else do but beat the air, fight with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison; their combates are not only meerly vain, vain
scufflings with air and wind, to no purpose in the world, but the very
things and enemies they encounter are, at the best, but men whose breath
is in their nostrils, <hi>lighter</hi> than the very air, and <hi>vanity it self,</hi> if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. lxii. 9. and what great conquest over such? 'Tis
the Christian that fights indeed, that combates enemies indeed; <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
and Powers, and spiritual wickednesses in high places,</hi> enemies strong
and mighty, that go invisible, and strike and wound us when we see
them not, that fight with us out of high and almost inaccessible places
of defence, that have all possible advantage over us. These are
enemies, if we talk of enemies, to fight with indeed. The enemies
worldly men so tremble at are but <hi>bragadochios</hi> to these, all their force
and power but weakness if compared with the powers of hell and
darkness. This is fighting, to fight with these, to fight with devils, and
sins, and lusts; and thus the Christian is the only fighter, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to the Christian Combate, that fights often to the death,
must havtis ways that intention not to give over for death it self, but
continue constant to the end. So here we have in this first point even
the mastery amongst them that strive for mastery, that they strive for
things not worth the striving for; that they strive indeed for slavery, not
Mastery; that they scarce do any thing worth the name of striving or
fighting; that theirs is but play and sport in comparison of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Combatant; and yet for all that a great deal they do for the victory
in these petty trifles; they wrastle, and cuff, and leap, and throw, and run,
and try all their strength and powers. And 'tis worth the while to see
whether we strive and contend as much in our real Christian combate; in
a case vvorthy of the vvhile and labour. That vve are novv to do, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to compare our strivings, theirs and ours, the Grecian and the Christian
exercises.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:57113:153"/>
               <hi>Five</hi> several exercises, or kinds of striving for the mastery, there was
in those <hi>Corinthian</hi>-games, <hi>Wrestling, Cuffing, Quoiting, Leaping, Running.</hi>
All these answered in our Christian course and exercise.</p>
            <p>1. Wrestling. <hi>Wrestling against Principalities, against Powers, against the
Rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. vi. 12. <hi>Wrestling</hi> secondly with God in prayer, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
did, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 24.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Cuffing</hi> and buffeting there is to; buffeting our selves, keeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our bodies, and bringing them into subjection, St. <hi>Pauls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
ver.</hi> 27. making our eyes and bodies, as it were, black and blew by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and fastings; cuffing or buffeting our eyes for looking after, our
ears for listning to, our bodies for doing, punishing all our powers and
senses for acting any thing that is evil; a being buffeted too (2.) by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
when we forget to buffet our selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 7. Cuffing and buffeting
sufficient to be found in the Christians exercise.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Quoiting</hi> or casting; casting away any weight that hinders us, any
sin that does beset us, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 1. removing every stone of offence, <hi>giving
no offence</hi> to any <hi>in any thing, that our Ministry be not blamed,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 3. that
nothing we do, nothing we omit, neither our doing or our not doing, be
a stone of stumbling, whereby <hi>our brother may justly stumble, or is offended,
or is made weak,</hi> Rom. xiv. 21. Throw all such stones out of the way, and
strive who shall so come nearest that <hi>great corner stone Christ Iesus,</hi> or the
<hi>mark of your high calling of God in Christ Iesus,</hi> Phil. iii. 14.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Leaping</hi> also is to be found among the Christians exercises, skipping
and leaping for joy at the glad tidings of the Gospel, leaping and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God with the lame man that was healed, <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 8. striving who shall
leap farthest in it, leaping, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> viii. (for so the word
signifies) to see the day of Christ; Leaping, with holy <hi>David,</hi> before
the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 16. rejoycing, and leaping for joy in the day of our
sufferings for Christ, St. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 23. making it one of our daily exercises
and businesses to praise and magnifie God, and rejoyce in him, in all his
days, and ways, and dispensations, strive with one another who shall do it
most, who shall go farthest in it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Running</hi> we every where meet in the Christians course, running <hi>the
race which is set before us,</hi> Heb. xii. 1. so running as we may obtain, in the
<hi>verse</hi> before the <hi>Text.</hi> Christianity it self is stiled a race, the Christian
Law the Law of it, the Christian the runner, his life the course, heaven
the goal; nothing more ordinary.</p>
            <p>Besides these five single exercises in the <hi>Grecian</hi> there was a
sixth mixt or compounded of wrestling and cuffing both, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they
called it. But in Christianity all are joyned, all are sometimes exercised
together; the Christian must be skilled and well exercised in all; wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
against the World, the Flesh, and Devil; wrestle with God, cuff and
buffet himself, suffer the buffettings of Satan too sometimes, cast away
all weights and stones of hinderance and offence, leap and <hi>run</hi> with joy
and eagerness <hi>the race which is set before us, looking unto Iesus,</hi> always, in all
these, looking unto him that is both <hi>the author and finisher of our faith,</hi>
Heb. xii. 2.</p>
            <p>And being thus wholly to be kept in exercise, it will be convenient,
nay, necessary now to fit and prepare our selves, so to diet and order our
selves that we may so perform them as to obtain the day, to get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to be temperate in all things as well as any wrestler or runner of them
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:57113:154"/>
There are four several interpretations of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
we here render temperate.</p>
            <p>The first is what here we find it, to be temperate: to keep a certain set
diet, whereby their bodies might be best strengthned and enabled, made
nimble and active: so it signifieth to the Wrestlers. To observe a spare
and moderate diet, such as may most advantage the souls business, best
subdue the body and quicken the spirit, be it abstinence from some or
sometimes from all kinds of meat and drink: so it signifies to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
This the Christians, as the other the Wrestlers diet.</p>
            <p>Very exact and punctual were they that strove for the masteries in their
observances, kept their rules, and times, and kind of diet. I would the
Christian now were but half so much to his rule and order. Indeed I must
confess theirs was not sometimes a moral temperance, it was sometimes
to fulness; yet still such as was prescribed and most conducible to their
end, If we would observe as much those abstinences which most make
to the enabling us in our spiritual race or combat, I shall desire no more:
there indeed fasting and all temperance will come in, will be the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Christians being temperate in all things. A thing so
necessary, that St. <hi>Ierome</hi> says no less, than, <hi>Difficile imo impossibile est, ut prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentibus
quis &amp; futuris fruatur bonis, ut his ventrem &amp; ibi mentem expleat, ut de
deliciis transeat ad delicias, ut in utroque seculo primus sit, ut in coelo &amp; in terrâ
appareat gloriosus. It is hard, nay impossible,</hi> no less says he, <hi>to enjoy both
present and future goods,</hi> our good things here and hereafter too, <hi>to fill the
belly here, and the soul hereafter, to pass from pleasure into pleasure,</hi> from fulness
into fulness, <hi>to be first in earth and heaven too, glorious in both.</hi> He must feed
spare here that looks to be fed full there, be temperate in all earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and satisfactions, that looks for heavenly either in the other world
or in this either: for the full body stifles the soul, and we are not more
unwieldy in body when the belly is over full, then the soul is then. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
oppresses even the natural spirits, makes us we cannot even breath
freely for the while, enough to shew us our rational spirits are not likely
to be freeer to breath, or evaporate themselves to Heaven or Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
whilst the very natural ones themselves are so opprest. From
temperance and moderation we cannot be excused, neither in meat, nor
drink, nor any thing, whatever weakness may excuse from fasting: so
necessary a disposing of us it is to all Christian piety and goodness, yea,
and a Christian vertue too it self, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 23.</p>
            <p>The word may yet (2.) be rendred continence; so it seems to be taken,
<hi>Tit.</hi> i. 8. where 'tis distinguished from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sober, or temperate, and
joyn'd next to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, holy, clean, or pure. A point observed by those <hi>ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothletae</hi>
to abstain from Wine and Women for the time of their providing
themselves against those games: So the Poet. <hi>Qui cupit optatam cursu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingere
metam abstinuit vino &amp; Venere.</hi> And our Apostle tells us of such a
kind of temporary continence, very convenient for those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that more especially addict themselves to the Christian exercises,
particularly of Prayer and Fasting, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> ver. 5. But no
time but commands Continence and Chastity to all Christians whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that no uncleanness be so much as named among them; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not Saints, <hi>Ephes.</hi> v. 3. it becometh not the Gospel of Christ,
which is a doctrine of all holiness and purity. Nothing more weakens
and indisposes the body for vigorous and noble actions, nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
the soul for the race of Christian piety, nothing more blinds it from
understanding, nothing more keeps it from desiring, nothing more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57113:154"/>
it from performing it then inordinate and sensual lusts, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to them. To run, or wrestle, or combate well we have as much need
of continence as any that ever strove for secular mastery.</p>
            <p>A third notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is to signifie a constancy of mind to
abstain from all things that are hurtful. <hi>Suid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Hesychius</hi> render, it to
abstain from evil. And that not only things that are truly such, but
those things also sometimes that may hinder the greater good. Thus St.
<hi>Paul</hi> in this <hi>Chapter</hi> a little before the <hi>Text</hi> abstains from using his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
liberty, that he may so with the greater profit and success fulfil the
course of his Ministry: will not use the power he had to live upon preaching
of the Gospel, but voluntarily preaches to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> upon free cost,
that he might gain the more, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. becomes again all things to all men,
that by all means he might gain some, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. He saw the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
were close, and covetous, forsaw it was like to hinder his preaching
much if he put them to much charge; he therefore supersedes his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and liberty (though he convinces them from the beginning of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
that such he had, and just, and natural, and reasonable, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
it was) lest he should not do so much good upon them as he desired.
But though we must not expect that all men should advance to this
height, they must yet resolve to remove all real and and faulty hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of the way, abstain from all occasions and appearances of evil,
which may at any time hinder or rob us of our Crown, make us fall short
of the Goal of Heaven and Glory.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It may signifie his having all things in his power, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the getting the mastery over himself, getting the victory over one
desire after another, denying himself first one liberty, then another, till
at last he has mastered all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, got all into his power. Thus
strove those <hi>Grecian</hi> Wrestlers, and Racers, ordered and tempered their
bodies by degrees, first to this exercise, then another; first to this height,
then a higher; first to this, then to a further, till they had gotten a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
mastery and command over all their powers, and members, to use
them to the greatest advantage and agility. This is the Christians bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
too, to keep our soul and body in continual exercise, always doing,
ever suffering somewhat, now striving against that sin, then a second;
now mortifying that lust, then another; now moderating this passion,
then sweetning that; one while denying himself this liberty, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
sometimes attempting this difficulty, then some other; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
running after good, sometimes wrestling with evil, sometimes cuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
and crucifying an inordinate desire, sometimes throwing off such
and such a habit, sometimes leaping away in fear from an occasion or
opportunity of doing ill, sometimes leaping into a way or occasion of
doing good, sometimes leaping for joy when it is done: whereby at
length by continual exercise and custom, we may happily come to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
temper in all our powers and faculties of soul and body, bring them
all to an exact obedience, to the obedience of Christ, to run the race, to
fight the fight that he has set before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delicatus es miles, si putes te posse sine pugna vincere, sine certamine triumphare,</hi>
&amp;c. says St. <hi>Chrysost. Thou art too delicate a Souldier for Christ, if thou thinkst
thou canst overcome without striving, triumph without fighting. Exsere vires,</hi> &amp;c.
put out thy strength, fight valiantly, contend fiercely in the Christian
warfare: Remember thy covenant, think upon thy condition, consider
thy warfare, the covenant that thou madest, the condition thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tookest,
the warfare thou gavest thy name too at thy Baptism. The
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:57113:155"/>
Christians life is but a continual warfaring against the world, the flesh,
and the Devil; thy Captain calls, and leads thee to it, and thy crown
expects thee, not a Crown of corruptible leaves, or flowers, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Crown of Glory. Be temperate and sober, be chaste and
continent, be vigilant and constant, be diligent and active in Christs
holy work and business, that thou mayest run without falling, wrestle
without being thrown, cuff without being beaten, quoit all thy labours
near the mark, out-leap all evil ways, perform all thy exercises, get
happily at last to the end of thy way and labour, snatch and carry away
the Crown prepared for thee. That's the fourth and last point of the
comparison between Crown and Crown, the one <hi>corruptible,</hi> the other
<hi>incorruptible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here indeed first properly comes in the <hi>But,</hi> the comparisons before
have run somewhat even; combatants, and exercises, and preparations
much alike; but here nothing but the name, no comparison between
mortal and immortal, vanity and reality, finite and infinite: Yet let us
a little compare them as we can.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Crown</hi> these Gamesters strove for was but of leaves of Pine, or
Apple; of Oak, or Olive; of Laurel, nay, or even Grass sometimes:
Corruptible these indeed, nay, and vain too, to do so much, <hi>Multa tulit
fecitque puer sudavit &amp; alsit,</hi> to run, and sweat, and toil, and keep ado for
such a toy as the best of these, how vain and foolish. The very Heathen
themselves <hi>Anacharsis</hi> in <hi>Lucian</hi> sufficiently deride it.</p>
            <p>Yet as ridiculous as it seems the greatest part even of the Christian
world strive and labour for as little. What is the aim of all the great
ones of the world but leaves and grass? What get they by all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and pursuits, but some such business: Let them all have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and it comes to no more. Let the one obtain his so much desired
honour, another his beloved Mistriss pleasure, a third his darling
wealth: (of one of which three kinds of leaves all their Crowns are
made) and what get they but meer fading leaves, neither fruit nor
flower.</p>
            <p>The Crown of honour, what is it, but a very leaf that withers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently?
the worm of envy consumes it presently, the blast of jealousie
nips it in its glory, the breath of malice deads it in a trice. The Crown
of pleasure has a woe upon it, <hi>Isa.</hi> xxviii. 1, 3. a woe that will consume
them, <hi>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious
beauty is a fading flower:</hi> all that are drunk with any pleasure, their very
Crowns wither upon their heads, the intemperate heat that both produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and rises from their sensual pleasures, turns the colour of their beauty,
and will make their garlands e're long smell rank and stink with their own
corruption. The Crown of Riches has a worm commonly that breeds in
the leaf, this Oaken Garland in which we place so much strength, and
stedfastness, has an oaken Apple among the leaves that nurses a worm to
consume it when we least think of it. Nay, though we had <hi>coronam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litum,</hi>
a Crown, an Army of men as thick as the spires of Grass, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
and guard either our honours wealth or pleasures; yet they
would all prove in a little time but as the Grass; all men are nothing else,
Sr. <hi>Iames</hi> i. 11. but particularly the rich man, so says that <hi>Apostle, ver.</hi> 10.
the rich man as the flower of the grass, he shall pass away. He shall not
stay for a storm to blast or blow him away, even the Sun of prosperity
shall do it, <hi>Mole ruit suâ, his own weight</hi> and greatness <hi>shall throw him down.</hi>
For the <hi>Sun is no sooner</hi> (mark but that, no sooner) <hi>risen with a burning
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57113:155"/>
heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower of it falleth, and the grace of the
fashions of it perisheth; so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</hi> Mark
that too in his very ways, his own very ways shall bring him to ruine and
destruction. 'Tis so with the leaves of honour, 'tis so with the leaves of
pleasure, the very Sun no sooner rises upon them, but it withers them;
the very Sun-shine and favour of the Prince ruines them, the burning
heat of their pleasures waste them away, make their pleasures trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and burthensome in a little while, and a while after vanish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
them with shame and reproach, leave them nothing upon their
heads, but ill coloured and ill seated leaves, ignominy and dishonour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their souls but driness and discomfort; their estates too often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
drained dry, scarce any thing but the Prodigals Husks to refresh
them, or dry leaves to cover them.</p>
            <p>But the Christians Crown is nothing such, 'tis a flourishing Crown,
<hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxii. 18. a Crown of pure Gold, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxi. 3. a Crown of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones, <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 16. a Crown of Righteousness, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 8. a
Crown of Life, St. <hi>Iames</hi> i. 12. a Crown of Honour, <hi>Psal.</hi> viii. 5. a
Crown of Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 1. a Crown of Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 4. a Crown of
Glory that fadeth not away, in the same <hi>verse,</hi> eternal, everlasting. A
flourishing, not a withering Crown, a Crown of Gold, not of Grass;
of precious Stones, not of Leaves, of Righteousness not unjustly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
of Life not unto Death, of Honour not to be ashamed of, of Stars,
not Stubble, of Glory, not vanity, that never so much as alters colour,
but continues fresh and flourishing, and splendid to all eternity. <hi>An inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven
for us,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter, 1. Pet.</hi> i. 4.</p>
            <p>And having now compared our Crowns, and finding so vast, so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
a difference between them. Can we think much to do as much for
this incorruptible Crown of Glory, as the other do for their vain and
corruptible one? Shall they that strive for petty masteries, for toys and
trifles, for ribbands and garlands, be so exact in their observances so
strict in their diet, so painful in their exercises, so vigilant in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
so diligent in providing, strengthning, and enabling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for their several sports and undertakings, and shall we that are to
strive for no less than Heaven it self, be so loose in our performances, so
intemperate in meat and drink, so sluggish in our business, so careless of
advantages, so negligent in all things that make towards it. Are leaves
worth so much, and the fruit of eternal peace so little? Is a little air,
the vain breath of a mortal man to be so sought for, and is the whole
Heaven it self, and the whole Host and God of it, the praise of God and
Saints, and Angels, that stand looking on us, to be so slighted, as not
worth so doing, doing no more than they? Where is that man, <hi>Dic mihi
musâ virum,</hi> shew me the man that can, that takes the pains for eternal
glory, that these vain souls do for I know not how little enough to stile
it.</p>
            <p>But if we compare the pains the ambitious man takes for honour, the
voluptuous for his pleasure, the covetous man for wealth; meer leaves
of <hi>Tantalus</hi> his Tree, that do but gull, not satisfie them, the late nights,
the early mornings, the broken sleeps, the unquiet slumbers, the many
watches, the innumerable steps, the troublesom journeys, the short meals,
the strange restraints, the often checks, the common counterbuffs, the
vexatious troubles, the multitude of affronts, neglects, refusals, denials,
the eager pursuits, the dangerous ways, the costly expences, the fruitless
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57113:156"/>
travels, the tortured minds, the wearied bodies, the unsatisfied desires
when all is done, that these men suffer, and run through, the one for an
honour that sometimes no body thinks so but he that pursues it; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a pleasure base oftentimes and villanous: the third for an estate
not far from ruine, nay, oftentimes to ruine his house and posterity. If
I say, we compare these mens pains and sufferings, with what we do for
Christ, and God, and Heaven, and happiness, true, real, immoveable
happiness and glory, Good Lord! how infinitely short do we come of
them? shall not they rise up against us in judgment and condemn us;
nay, shall not we our selves rise up against our selves in judgment, who
have done many of these things, suffered many for a little profit, vain-glory,
or vain hope, which we thought much to do for eternal glory?
This we do, we strive, and labour, and take pains for vanity; we are
temperate in all things, restrain and keep in our selves, for the obtaining
sometimes a little credit, sometimes a little affection, or good opinion
from some whose love or good opinion is worth nothing; or if it be, is as
easily lost, as soon removed &amp; changed from us, is commonly both corrupt
and corruptible without ground, and to little purpose. But for Gods
Judgment, Christs Affection, the Holy Spirits good Love to us, for the
praise of good men, of Saints, and Angels, the whole choire of Heaven
rejoycing over us: nay, for Heaven it self, and blessedness, and glory,
all which we might obtain with the same pains, and lesser trouble, and
in the same time, 'tis so little that we do, so far from all, that I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injury stile it nothing.</p>
            <p>But for Gods sake, for Christs sake, for our own sake, let it not be so
for ever; let us not always prefer Glass before Diamonds, Barley Conrs
before Pearls, pleasure, or profit, or honour before Heaven, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Glory. There are in Heaven unspeakable pleasures, whole
Rivers of them there. There are in Heaven infinite and eternal riches,
which we can neither fathom nor number; there is glory, and honour,
and immortality, and eternal life. There are all these Crowns made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
and everlasting, all running round, encircling one another
like Crowns, encircling our souls and bodies too like Crowns, without
end, without period. If we would have any Crowns, Honour, or Riches,
or Pleasure, let us there seek them where they are advanced to an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility,
made incorruptible, where the leaves are turned into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fruit, incorruptible honour, incorruptible pleasure, incorruptible
riches, incorruptible all. Let us but do for them, thus advanc'd and
heightned, as we do for them when they are but fading and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and unsatisfying, and I say no more, but you will with as much ease
obtain this incorruptible and immortal; as that mortal and corruptible.
God grant us grace to do so, to strive for the mastery over our selves, and
lusts, and sins, so to be temperate, abstemious, vigilant, and industrious in
the pursuit of Heaven, as we are or have been of the earth, that we may
at last be crowned not with a corruptible but an incorruptible crown of
glory and everlasting life.</p>

SERMON
ON THE
Sixth Sunday in Lent.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>DEUT. xxxii. 29.</bibl>
               <q>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
consider their latter end!</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd if we be <hi>They,</hi> who I am afraid we are, we are now
in a good time to do it: <hi>Lent</hi> is a considering time.
A Time set us by <hi>holy Church</hi> to consider what we have
done all the year before, what we are to do all our
years that are behind, and what we shall do, what will
become of us if we do not, when all our years are at
an end. It begins with a day of <hi>Ashes,</hi> and it goes out
with a <hi>week</hi> we hear of nothing in but the preparations to a Grave and
the Resurrection, so as it were to mind us of our latter end, make us
more serious about it at this time than ordinary, from the first day of it
to the last. So the Text is not unseasonable, nor the <hi>Wish</hi> in it unfit any
way for the time.</p>
            <p>And whether this Wish be <hi>Moses</hi> his, or Gods, this <hi>They</hi> his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or their enemies, it is no matter. A good Wish it is from whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to friend or enemy. Only it intimates, They are none of the wisest
for whom it is.</p>
            <p>For his own people it might well be. Them he had led out of the
waste howling wilderness, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Them he had kept there as the apple
of his eye, as in the same <hi>verse;</hi> and when he brought them thence, fed
them with the fat of Lambs, and the kidneys of wheat, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. And upon
this, they grew fat and kickt, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. 'Tis a good Wish for <hi>them, that They
were wiser.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their Adversaries (2.) it might be as well. They had as little
sense it seems, very ready to grow high at any time upon prosperities
and successes, as if they, and not God, had done the business, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.
'Tis a good Wish for them, that they would understand a little
better.</p>
            <p>There's another people that we know (but I know not how to call
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57113:157"/>
them, his or I know not whose, they carry themselves so strangely, (I
pray God it be not we at last) whom the Wish may suit as well as any.
A people, who, some of them, not long since, were, as it were, in wasts
and desarts like Gods own People, (in a condition sad enough God
knows) born thence no great while ago upon his wings, since that set
high, and fed high with Corn, and Wine, and many good things else,
who, for all that, have not well requited God that did it. Others of
them, who because <hi>they came in no misfortune like other folk, nor were plagued
like those other men,</hi> stand much, like <hi>Israels</hi> enemies, upon their terms;
their righteousness, or power, or policy, or somewhat did the work. Both
are become too much unmindful of the Rock of their Salvation, as we
have it, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and have quite forgot to consider the latter end of
things, what may be yet; that however things stand now, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the mountains may be set on fire again, as the Phrase is, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.
if they be no wiser, either of them, than by continuance in sin to blow
up the sparks; and then who can assure his house, or barns, or shop, or
office at the next turn? 'Tis a good Wish for these too (both of them)
that they would consider a little better on't together, <hi>in novissimo, now at
last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all these it may be; and to be short and home, for all these it is;
As in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time for <hi>Israel</hi> and their enemies, so in Ours, for Us, late
enemies, now friends together, that we would <hi>all</hi> be wiser once, <hi>that we
men,</hi> at least at last, <hi>would understand the loving kindness of the Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the wonders that he hath done for the children of men.</hi> But above all,
that men would think of this same latter end, think that all things end
not here, there is somewhat to be lookt to after these days are done,
which wise men would look to, and provide for. <hi>O Si, O that they would.</hi>
God wishes it, and <hi>Moses</hi> wishes it, and you and I, all of us, I hope, may
wish what they do without offence. But do it we must besides, else God
will complain of Us, as he does of Them here in the <hi>Text.</hi> For a kind of
Complaint it is, as well as a Wish; <hi>O Si, that they were,</hi> a plain Complaint
that they were not.</p>
            <p>But be it a Wish, or be it a Complaint, (and both it is) a Wish for
some, that they were wise, or a Complaint of them, that they are not,
for three Particulars it is,
<list>
                  <item>I. As a <hi>Wish;</hi> 'tis that the men here spoken of (1.) <hi>were wise. That</hi>
(2.) <hi>they would understand this,</hi> somewhat or other that we shall see
anon worth understanding. <hi>That</hi> (3.) <hi>they would</hi> especially <hi>consider
their latter end.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. As a <hi>Complaint;</hi> it is for three things too that they vvere none of
these, that they vvere neither <hi>Wise,</hi> nor <hi>Vnderstood,</hi> nor <hi>Consider'd</hi>
vvhat they should. For <hi>O Si,</hi> is but a kind of a sigh that 'tis no other;
a very trouble to God that men are no better.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of both, this is the sum; that They vvho in the midst of mercies,
after the sharp sense of former judgments, and not yet out of the fear of
nevv ones, forget God, and either by nevv sins, or retriving old ones,
slight so both his judgments and his mercies, they are neither vvise nor
understanding, nor considering men (vvhat ere they go for) but a sort
that God vvill complain of (vvho ere they be) for somevvhat else,
and vvishes to be vviser, to understand a little better, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
novv at last, lest the latter end be vvorse vvith them than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>That it may not, but that the Wish may take effect, and God have no
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57113:157"/>
more reason to complain. Let us now consider the Particulars; where
I must first shew you for whom, before I shew you for what it is. And yet
I know not how you'l take it.</p>
            <p>I. Indeed that <hi>Israels</hi> enemies, the <hi>Heathen,</hi> should be a Nation void
of counsel, that have not any understanding in them, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
may be taken well enough.</p>
            <p>But (2.) that <hi>Israel,</hi> Gods own people, should be of the number, they a
foolish people and unwise as it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>And that not the meanest of them neither, but they that eat the fat,
and drink the sweet, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. the best (as we would say) of the Parish,
who are always wise because they are rich, that <hi>they</hi> should not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>Those (3.) who ride upon the high places of the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. the
chiefest persons, that men in honour should have no understanding.
'Tis well <hi>Moses</hi> says it; I know not whether it be safe to say it after
him.</p>
            <p>But (4.) that wise men too, not the ignorant only, but they, whose
wits God seems to be afraid of, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and dares do nothing for them,
for fear they should misapply it, who (let God do what he can, say what
he will) will say and prove any thing good against him; who are always
giving reason upon reason for every thing, but why they reason him out
of all, that They should come into the tale; that we, or any body, or God
himself should wish them wise (as if they were not as wise as we could
wish them) what an affront does this simple <hi>Moses</hi> put upon them? Why,
Lord, who does understand if they do not? Or who will believe us if we
say it?</p>
            <p>And yet all These are They the Wish is for. Gods enemies are fools,
and Gods people not so wise says our blessed Saviour, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xvi 8. The
gallantest, the richest, the wisest of them not so wise always as they
should be; not so wise, I hope, at any time, but God may have leave to
wish them wiser.</p>
            <p>Yea, every one of them, every mothers child, if they have learnt no
more than they here in the <hi>Chapter;</hi> learnt nothing by their afflictions,
but to forget them; nothing by their deliverances, but to abuse them;
nothing by what is past but to be discontent with the present, and yet
daily powre out themselves into excesses, and never think of what may
come. If this be all the wise parts they play, as they were theirs in the
<hi>Text</hi> (be they who they will) they are they God means, God make them
wiser. The Wish now is like I fear to fit the Persons as well as it does
the Time. And three Points there are in it I told you to be learnt. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere,
Intelligere, &amp; Novissima Providere.</hi> To call to mind the things that are
past; To understand the things that are; And to provide for things to
come. To remember where we were, To understand where we <hi>are, and
to consider and provide for</hi> where we may be, <hi>the three main Points of Wisdom;</hi>
So St. <hi>Augustine</hi> distinguishes the three words as the three main parts of
wisdom, and so shall I. But (1.) consider them as <hi>our</hi> duty; and then
(2.) as <hi>Gods</hi> desire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sapere,</hi> or to be wise, that's the first. And <hi>Sapientia est per quam repetit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
quae fuerunt:</hi> So that learned <hi>Father, To be wise is to call to mind the things
that are already past,</hi> and the great <hi>Roman Orator</hi> I may tell you takes the
words so too.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>Moses</hi> himself seems so to mean it; For no sooner had he
called this people foolish and unwise, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. but in the next words
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57113:158"/>
immediately he bids them remember the days of old, and consider the
years of many Generations, as if that were the way to make them wise.
Indeed, if we be but of yesterday, or look no further back, <hi>Iob</hi> will
quickly tell us we know nothing, <hi>Iob</hi> viii. 9. <hi>State super vias antiquas,</hi> that's
the Rule God gives us, <hi>Ier.</hi> vi. 16. On the <hi>old</hi> ways <hi>ther's</hi> the standing, no
foundation to build on else. New opinions and devices are but a kind of
standing upon our own heads; we cannot stand so long; a building upon
a tottering and boggy ground, which vents it self ordinarily into vapours,
that make a noise and blustering, darken and infect the air and nothing
else. Every wind, too, carries them which way it will, this way, or that
way, or any way; and, observe it when you will, once out of the old way,
and they ne'r know where to fix.</p>
            <p>Yet (2.) <hi>to be wise,</hi> has here a notion more practical, and sends us
sadly and soberly to meditate now and then upon the late condition we
were in. And surely, where God found us, and how he found us, how he
led us about, and how he instructed us, how he kept us all the while as
the apple of his eye, how he flutter'd over us with his wings, how he spread
them abroad and bore us on them, (I keep the expressions of the <hi>Chapter,</hi>
for <hi>Israels</hi> case was much our own) or to speak out, the desolations, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verties,
and distresses, and reproaches we were in; the prisons, the dangers,
the necessities we escapt; the supplies, the reliefs, the protections we found
(we know not how) are not things would be forgotten; they are such,
as (one would think) would make one wise. They would be written
upon our walls, and beams, and posts, and doors; written with a Pen
of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond, graven upon the Tables of
our hearts, and upon the horns of our Altars, or (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks) upon
the rock for ever. Our Churches, our Halls, our Chambers, all our
Rooms hung round with the sad stories we have seen, to make them live
in our memories, and in our childrens after us, to make them wise by their
fathers sufferings.</p>
            <p>And yet (3.) to be wise is more still: To make these things live in
our lives as well as memories, to grow good upon it. <hi>To be wise, and to do
good</hi> the <hi>Psalmist</hi> joyns, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxvi. 3. Indeed, they cannot be asunder. He
is not vvise vvho is not good. To keep my Lavvs and do them, this is
your vvisdom, and your understanding; the vvay to make the Nations
say, <hi>This is a wise and understanding people.</hi> So God determines it,
<hi>Deut,</hi> iv. 6.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I come not hither to preach other vvisdom, I should make my
preaching foolishness then, indeed, in a truer sense than the <hi>Apostle</hi> meant
it. The Wisdom of God (if vve can keep to it) that's our business.
And he (1.) that hearkens to it, he is vvise says the vvisest <hi>Solomon,
Prov.</hi> xii. 15. He (2.) vvho exalted from that lovv condition, vve vvere
speaking of, to a high one, is lovvly still, he is vvise, says he again,
<hi>Prov.</hi> xi. 2. He (3.) vvho upon the same accompt keeps himself under
still, keeps under Discipline and Government as if he felt the former
lashes still, he is vvise. <hi>Apprehendite disciplinam,</hi> is a Point of holy <hi>Davids
Nunc ergo sapite,</hi> of the vvisdom he commends, <hi>Psal.</hi> ii. 11.</p>
            <p>But if you vvill be vvise, indeed, and pardon me that I extend Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
a little further than I first propounded it, There are four things that
are <hi>exceeding wise, Prov.</hi> xxx. 24. you may learn it of. <hi>The Ants,</hi> that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
their meat in the Summer. The Conies,</hi> that <hi>make their houses in the Rock.
The Locusts,</hi> that <hi>go forth all of them by bands.</hi> And the <hi>Spider,</hi> that <hi>takes
hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.</hi> Were vve but as vvise as they,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57113:158"/>
as Ants, and Conies, and Locusts, and Spiders (and 'tis a shame we should
not) we would by the experience of our former evils: Prepare (1.) in
good days with the Ant, for bad ones. We would (2.) with the Conies
build our dwellings in the Rock St. <hi>Paul</hi> says was Christ; having felt
sufficiently already there is no sure building else. We would (3.) go
forth, as the Locusts do, to gather all by bands, unite in the bond of
peace and charity, not straggle into factions, and divide in parties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what that lately came to, and may quickly come to again if
we look not to it. We would (4.) with the Spider, catch hold with
our hands, keep our selves employed in our own business, trades, or stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and not meddle with things we either understand not, or belong not
to us. We would learn of them besides to be in the palaces of the great
King, the houses of God a little more constantly than we are. This
would be to be exceeding wise.</p>
            <p>And if to these we add the wisdom of the Serpent, as our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
commends it to us, St. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 16. make it our care above all (as
they say the Serpent does) to save our heads, <hi>Caput Christum,</hi> and <hi>Caput
Regem, Christ our head,</hi> and <hi>the King our Head,</hi> make it our business to keep
our Religion and obedience safe. Be who will else thought never so wise,
I am sure there is none wiser, as God counts wisdom, than they that do
so.</p>
            <p>Yet lastly, if you had rather take the rule of your wisdom from above,
take it from St. <hi>Iames,</hi> That wisdom (says he) is <hi>first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hypocrisie,</hi> St. James iii. 17. So to be wise, is to wash our hands of what
is past, to live peaceably and orderly, friendly and kindly together for
the time to come, heartily promoting one anothers good, without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or dissembling. For in returning and quietness, it seems, is the
<hi>Apostle</hi> wisdom, as well as the <hi>Prophets</hi> strength, <hi>Isa.</hi> xxx. 15. wisdom
it seems and strength both. I would some would understand it, that, or
this, nay, that and this, we are to consider next. The condition we are
in, that 'tis we are now to understand. For <hi>Intelligentia perspicit quae sunt,</hi>
so St. <hi>Augustin</hi> defines it, and this <hi>hoc</hi> is most naturally the present. So to
<hi>understand this,</hi> (which is the second particular in the wish) is, to be truly
sensible how things now go with us. Where (1.) what it is we are to
understand, and then what it is to understand it.</p>
            <p>What <hi>this</hi> is we take in two particulars: Gods dealing with us, and
our dealing with him again. These two, the <hi>this,</hi> the business we are wish'd
to understand.</p>
            <p>I. And how God deals with <hi>Vs,</hi> the high places of the earth we ride
on, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. the places and offices we enjoy, the increase of the Fields
we eat of, the plenty we abound with, the Honey we suck out of the rock,
and the oil that issued to us out of the flinty rock, the same <hi>verse,</hi> those
blessings which we could no more expect than those sweet dews out of
stones and flints, the butter and milk, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. the smoothness and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our conditions now, the fat of lambs, and rams, and goats in the
<hi>next words;</hi> the full tables we well nigh groan at, and the pure blood of
the grape, the mirth and jollity we live in tell <hi>us</hi> as plain, I say, how he
deals with us as they did <hi>Israel</hi> how he dealt with them. <hi>One day tells an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi>
how the Almighty commands it to dart blessings on us, <hi>and one
night certifies another,</hi> how he enjoyns it to shadow us with protections,
both speak loud enough to have <hi>their voices heard among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how (2.) we deal with him again. I would there were no voice
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57113:159"/>
abroad, I would no body heard, I would <hi>Gath</hi> did not speak it, nor the
streets of <hi>Askelon</hi> ring of it, that the day might be clouded with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to cover it, and that the night were as the shadow of death to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it for ever: that thou, O God however, wouldst not reckon the days
of our ingratitude in the number of our months. We are surrounded
with plenty, and we abuse it to excess. We are encompassed with peace,
and we disturb it with petty quarrels. We are loaded with wealth and
riches, and we lash them out in lusts and vanities. We are cloathed with
honours, and we dishonour them with meannesses. Our friends are given
into our bosoms, and we envy some of them, and slight the rest. Our
Laws are restored us, and we live as if we had none. Our Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and we laugh it out of countenance. Good discipline reviving,
and we are doing what we can to break the bonds in sunder. Our
Churches now stand open to us, and we pass by them with neglect. Our
King God has set upon his holy Hill, and the people still imagin vain
things against him. In a word, we are filled with all good things, and
we do all the evil we can with them. We fill up our days with iniquities,
and our nights with transgressions. We neither consider Gods dealings,
nor mind our own. We understand neither that nor this.</p>
            <p>For to understand this (which is the second branch of this particular)
is to understand both whence and whither these mercies are, whence they
come, and whither they tend.</p>
            <p>For the first we are too ready to say with the Heathen, <hi>ver. 27. Our
hand is high, and God hath not done it.</hi> God hath not done it; why, tell
me then (I pray) what were the counsels that brought things about?
where were the Armies that forced our passage? whence the mony that
smooth'd the way? who confounded the devices, who fettered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
who divided the strengths that were against us? who turned the
hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the hearts of the Children to
the Fathers? who softned our enemies? who strengthned our friends?
who suppled strangers at last to pity us? who calm'd the Seas? who held
the winds? who guided our happiness into our harbours, and even threw
it into our bosoms? This Cloud, that arose like <hi>Eliah</hi>'s out of the Sea,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. 44. out of the vast Sea of Gods endless mercy, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heaven, and Earth with blessings (till we are grown black, I fear sadly
black and sinful with them) it was not as his servant took it, like a mans
hand at all, it was like Gods all the way, it was meerly Gods, <hi>Non nobis</hi>
therefore <hi>Domine non nobis,</hi> must be our <hi>Psalm, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto
us, but to thy name only be the glory.</hi> And this the first way to understand his
mercies, to confess from him they come, and so give him thanks.</p>
            <p>The second is, to learn also whether they tend. They are in St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
understanding to lead us to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 4. (and the time is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for it.) In the Psalmists, to understand well is to do thereafter, <hi>Psal.</hi>
cxi. 10. So to understand Gods blessings right well, is to use them right
well. And when under blessings we live accordingly, take them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
use them soberly, employ them charitably, then, and not till then
we understand them.</p>
            <p>Yet lastly, I must add, that till we think we have no understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
till we confess we are (what God says we are in the words just
before) a Nation that has none, a Nation that when time
was, undid it self with its own wisdom, whilst we would needs teach
God to govern his Church, and rule the world, and in a manner force
him either to make the world anew again <hi>out</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> or make the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57113:159"/>
Church <hi>into</hi> it; till we grow sensible how wisely we reformed all till we
had reformed God out of <hi>all,</hi> and all into <hi>Atheism,</hi> and confusion; and that
we are no wiser still then to tread in the same steps that will do it again,
there will be little hope we understand Gods dealings or our own. Yet this
understanding our not understanding God here particularly points them
to; for having immediately before said, this people, they were a Nation
that had not any understanding, he presently adds, <hi>O that they were wise and
understood it;</hi> even <hi>this</hi> very thing in particular, that they do not understand,
as wise as they seem, or think themselves. The next point may make them
wiser if however now at last they will <hi>consider their latter end.</hi> What may be
the end both of their follies, and their wisdoms here, and what is like
to be the end of them hereafter; what in this world, and what in the
other; for <hi>Novissima</hi> reaches both, the issues of this life and the issues of
the next. <hi>Et novissima providerent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Several latter ends there are of both sorts, to be considered; but
how things may notwithstanding the fair face they carry, end yet here
e're long, that consider first. And that I shall tell you without stirring
out of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> for God tells us it there himself: (1.) He <hi>will set on
fire the foundations of the mountains,</hi> verse 22. if we be no wiser than we
have been yet. The highest mountains of our honours, the greatest
mountains of our strengths, nay, the sirmest foundations we can build on
shall fall all into ashes, and scatter into smoke and air.</p>
            <p>Or (2.) burning heat, and bitter destruction shall devour us, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.
even our zeal and bitterness against one another shall raise such flames as
shall consume us all together, <hi>High and low, rich and poor, one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or (3.) he will send the teeth of beasts upon us, with the poison of the
Serpents of the dust, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. again; set the beasts of the people again to
tear and worry us: nay, even the most contemptible persons, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the dust, they shall devour us. They shall creep like Serpents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Families, poison them with errors, poison with sin, poison them
with lusts, multiply too there like dust, and destroy us e're we dream on't.</p>
            <p>Or, if we escape that, the sword (4.) without, and the terror within
shall destroy the young man, and the Virgin, the suckling, and the man
of gray hairs, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. nor young, nor old escape the second bout.</p>
            <p>Or (5.) He will scatter us into corners, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. but they shall not hide
and shelter us as before; our very remembrance he shall make to cease,
we shall come no more out, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Not so much as an ear, or leg, as the
<hi>Prophet</hi> speaks, <hi>Amos</hi> iii. 12. taken out of the Lions mouth to remember
us by. But a <hi>populus non populus,</hi> a people that we count as nothing, shall
possess our room, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. any thing, every thing that will but serve to
root us out.</p>
            <p>Some of these, nay, all these lastly, and more shall come upon us,
heaps of mischiefs, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. and all the arrows of the Almighty, till they
be spent, as in the same <hi>verse,</hi> if we be no wiser than we have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
if we understand no better how to use either our bad days or our
good ones. And if after not only so many fair warnings, but so many
fair enjoyments, we carelesly throw away our selves into our former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
we shall also die like fools; and who can be such to pity us?</p>
            <p>That all these have not befallen us before this time, that God has not
torn up our foundations, nor given us over to our own wraths, nor to the
peoples, that he has not scattered us, nor brought some ill end or other
upon us long e're this; 'tis not for our righteousness, I am sure: but <hi>ne
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57113:160"/>
hostes dicerent,</hi> ver. 27. lest some should justifie their own dealings, or <hi>ne
populus diceret,</hi> lest some others condemn Gods, as if he had delivered them
only to destroy them. But what e're they say, <hi>Ego retribuam eis in tempore,
their foot shall slide in due time,</hi> says God, <hi>&amp; juxta est dies perditionis, the day
of their calamity is at hand,</hi> ver. 35.</p>
            <p>But if we escape all these, there are four other latter ends that must be
thought on; Death and Judgment, Hell and Heaven: the <hi>quatuor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissima,</hi>
that everybody can tell, but few consider, yet the two first of
them we cannot avoid, and one of the other we must come to.</p>
            <p>And (1.) suppose our prosperity and splendor should go with us to the
Grave (and we can carry them no further) yet after we have lived like
Gods to come to die like men, to be shaken with Agues, or burnt with
Fevers, or torn with Cholicks, or swoln with Gouts, or groan away
in pain, or go out in stench, (every body glad when we are gone) and at
our going to be stript of all our gallantry with a <hi>stulte cujus haec?</hi> Thou
fool, whose are all these things thou must leave behind? to be sent away
with so scornful a farewel, into rottenness and putrefaction, and so be
blown into dust, and vanish into oblivion, like the meanest men, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
which is far more terrible to be pluckt away in the heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of a sin, and none to deliver is, is but a sad end of all our jollities
and glories.</p>
            <p>Yet hence (2.) to be drawn to the last Tribunal (that's the next stage
we come to) there to have our follies fully laid open to the eyes of all
the world, not a night-folly hid, where we must give an account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hour and minute spent, every word and thought as well as work: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all our blustering here to be dragged thither to a reckoning for every
farthing, even to the last mite, and receive accordingly, how bad so e're
it be: This will set us to consider, sure, what we shall answer at that day,
how to give up our accounts with joy, and come off with glory.</p>
            <p>For we end not yet, there is still a latter end beyond both these; two
for fail: and 'tis yet within your choice, which you will come to. <hi>Novissima
coeli,</hi> or <hi>Novissima inferni.</hi> The highest Heaven, or the lowest Hell. This
last we have, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and that we will take first. 'Tis better ending with
the t' other.</p>
            <p>For this, 'tis a place whence joy is ever banish'd, and where no good
is; where nothing but sorrow, and sadness, and horror dwells: where
the wicked lie wrapt in flames, and Sulphur, covered with worms, and
stench, and darkness. All the racks and tortures that the wit of cruelty
ever found out here, are beds of Down and Roses to those horrid lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Here in the bitterest pains there is some part or other well, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
or other always to be found to give us ease. The light will chear
us, or the night refresh us, or sleep give us rest. Company will divert the
anguish, or custom lighten it, or hope lessen it, or time wear it out. But
in that place of torment (so <hi>Dives</hi> called and felt it) nor soul, nor body,
nor faculty, nor member free. The conscience of former sins, that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
them; the memories of former happiness, that distracts them, the
understanding now what they have forfeited and might have had, that
above all infinitely torments them. The tongue burns, and the teeth
gnash, and the heart trembles, and the eyes weep, and the hands wail,
and the ears are filled with continual screeches, and everlasting howlings,
and every member is intolerably tortured with the punishment of its
own sins: and yet not so much there as a drop of water to refresh 'um,
not a gleam of light to comfort 'um, no rest day nor night. The company
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57113:160"/>
of Devils, and damned spirits, (the only company there) and amongst
them (perhaps) their dearest friends, or Wives, or Children, infinitely
increase their hell; and all is augmented by continuance: for no such
thing as hope to be heard of there. 'Tis the Kingdom of despairs and
terrors, <hi>The worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched:</hi> all the miseries are
everlasting, everlasting. This the latter end of all the people that forget
God, says holy <hi>David,</hi> that forget him in their prosperities; into Hell
they shall be turned, <hi>Psal.</hi> ix. 17.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the melancholy mans dream, or the contrivance of the
Politician, or the Priests cheat to keep men in awe. If a cheat it be,
'tis <hi>God</hi> has cheated you, and <hi>Christ</hi> has cheated you, and the <hi>Prophets</hi> have
cheated you, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> have cheated you, for they all say the same
thing: And would the rantingest of those brave fellows that scoff at it,
sit down a little and consider, (which I am sure they never do) or should
the tremblings of death begin to seize them, when their understandings
are about them (which are not always) and open the windows into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, then these would be <hi>the words of truth and soberness,</hi> then, <hi>men
and brethren, what shall we do</hi> (when commonly 'tis too late.) How shall we
do with these everlasting burnings? we will do any thing, suffer any
thing to avoid them.</p>
            <p>Then Heaven too, the end we reserved for our last, <hi>that</hi> will begin to
be thought on too, and how to get in there. There, where is joy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sad look to shadow it; pleasure without any tang to stain it;
peace without disturbance, plenty without fatiety, continual health
without infirmity, nor grief, nor fear, nor hazzard to impair our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or fully it. <hi>Glorious,</hi> all glorious <hi>things are spoken of thee, (Thou City of
God.</hi>)
Gold, and Pearls, and Diamonds, and all precious Stones; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and Thrones, and Crovvns, and Scepters; torrents of Joy, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Pleasure, vvell-springs of Life, dvvellings of Glory, seats of
blessedness, and blessed company, the Throne of God, all are said of
thee, thou glorious place. And yet vvhen all is said, vve must conclude
vvith the Apostle, that <hi>neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heart of man the things prepared there,</hi> or if they had, it seems it
is not lavvful for a man to utter them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 4. So I must needs leave
them to you to consider them.</p>
            <p>And truly 'tis time novv to tell you vvhat considering is. (1.) 'Tis to
sit dovvn and lay your ends together, and think upon them. Consider
then seriously (1.) vvhether you vvould have your foundations once
more unsetled, your houses plundered, your estates sequestred (they are
scurvy vvords, pray pardon them) your glories once again trod to dirt:
Whether 'tis good making ventures, trying Gods severities the second
time. For let them smite you but once more, and as <hi>Abisha</hi> said to <hi>David,</hi>
so say I to you, they vvill not smite you the second time.</p>
            <p>Consider again, (2.) vvhether seeing hovvever you must leave all these
enjoyments, within so short a span of time as death is off us, (and vve may
be fetcht off the stage e're vve are avvare, ill provided for it) it be vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to lay up all our treasure and provision here; either so hoard up here
as if it vvere for ever, or so lavish here as if it vvere to accompt for
never.</p>
            <p>And seeing to that accompt vve must come at last, consider (3.) vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such <hi>Imprimis</hi>'s and <hi>Items</hi> as the long impertinent Bills of sins and
pleasures vvill bring in, vvill pass current at the last Audit; vvhether so
much in purple and fine linen, so much in living sumptuously every day,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57113:161"/>
so little time in the assemblies of devotion, and so much in those of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
whether, <hi>Soul take thy ease, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> the living in all
liberty and licenciousness; the being hateful, and the hating one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
will pass for a rewarding the Almighty for his mercies, when, <hi>Come
ye blessed, go ye cursed,</hi> come in to conclude the day.</p>
            <p>And if they will not pass so (as no doubt they will not) consider (4.)
what will be next the end you come to, and remember but half that I have
told you of those eternal fires (and I have told you nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
and then tell me again whether the strictest attendances of piety,
the largest expences of charity, the trouble now and then of doing well,
the beggarliness of honesty, the restraints of temperance, the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of chastity, the very hardships of repentance, watching, fasting,
weeping, even the greatest penances of Religion, as high as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
and austerities of <hi>Hermits</hi> and <hi>Anchorets</hi> be not far easier to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and whether we can be thought wise any way, if we omit any way
to prevent those flames.</p>
            <p>Or if you had rather be led with hopes and glory (as all ingenuous and
noble natures had) consider (5.) whether all the glories ye have liv'd in,
all the satisfaction ye have met with, all the delights ye have ever here
enjoyed, or ever can, be worth one minute of those eternal fulnesses in
Gods presence in the Heavens; when even they that counted the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
mans life, but madness, <hi>Wisdom</hi> v. 4. and laught piety and honesty
out of doors, were so amaz'd at the glory and strangeness of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
mans salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.
that they even groan'd for anguish of spirit, and cry'd out openly,
<hi>We fools,</hi> we fools indeed, how have we cheated our selves of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the glorious Kingdom, whilst the poor <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s, these poor
contemptible things crept in, and we with all our pride, and riches,
and vaunting quite shut out, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>And now I may read the <hi>Text</hi> another way, as an assertion, not a
wish: and I find it read so. Thus, <hi>Si saperent &amp; intelligerent &amp; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent.</hi>
If men were wise, they would both understand and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all these things without this ado. They would presently turn
<hi>considerarent</hi> into <hi>providerent</hi> too, (and so the word is rendred by the
<hi>vulgar</hi>) and provide now for their latter end. And the provision
will not stand us in much, nor shall I stand long upon it. Three ways
to do it, and you have all.</p>
            <p>The Son of <hi>Syrach</hi>'s (1.) <hi>Remember thy end, and let enmity cease,</hi> says
he, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> xxviii. 6. Let us not spend our wits, our courage, our
estates any longer in feuds and enmities, seeing God has now at length
so strangely brought us all altogether.</p>
            <p>The (2.) way shall be his too, with a little alteration, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> vii. 36.
<hi>Remember thy latter end,</hi> and that thou never henceforward do amiss. I
know 'tis read, remember and thou shalt not, but 'tis as true if read,
remember and thou wilt not: if you consider it as you should, you will
also provide you sin no more.</p>
            <p>To make all sure, make the provision our Blessed Saviour would have
you for a third. <hi>Provide the bags that wax not old,</hi> St. Luke xii. 33. friends
that will not fail you, make them to you out of the <hi>Mammon</hi> you have
gotten, make the poor your friends with it, <hi>That when ye fail they may receive
you into everlasting habitations,</hi> S. Luke xvi. 9.</p>
            <p>And consider lastly for the close of this part of the Text (and I am
almost at the close of all) that all this is Gods desire. He wishes it here,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57113:161"/>
he wishes it all the holy <hi>Text</hi> through, <hi>Oh that there were such an heart in
them,</hi> Deut. v. 29. O that my people would hearken to it, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxi. 14.
O that men would therefore, <hi>Psal.</hi> cvii. four times in it.</p>
            <p>II. And yet the second general of the Text tells you, he does more;
wishes it so heartily, that he complains again: complains they answer not
his wishes. And wisht he has so often, that he may well complain. <hi>How
often have I,</hi> says he, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 34. so often nor they nor we can tell
it. Only so often <hi>Noluistis,</hi> as often as he would, so often they would
not. All the day long he had stretched out his hand unto them, sent to
them by his messengers, early and late, to desire them, visited them with
judgments, courted them with mercies, and yet they would not, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and gain-saying people that they were. And therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
he does, that do what he can, he must give them up, though with
<hi>a Quomodo te tradam?</hi> Hos. xi. 8. with great regret and sorrow, give them
up for fools, men of neither understanding, nor consideration; men
that like fools throw away Gold for baubles, men that are so far from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
or considering, that they live as if they car'd not whether
they went to Heaven or Hell.</p>
            <p>But I love not to lengthen out complaints,; in this case I should ne're
have done: and 'tis time I should. And the Text only insinuating, not
enlarging Gods complaints, gives me an <hi>item</hi> to do so too. Only give
me leave in brief to sum up all.</p>
            <p>Every wise man before at any time he begins a work, sits down and
considers what he has to do, and to what end he does it. O that we
would be so wise in ours; that we would retire our selves some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
now and then to consider the ill courses at any time we are in (or
entring on.) And when we are got into our Chambers, and be still thus
commune with our selves.</p>
            <p>What is this business I am about? to what purpose is this life I lead,
this sin, this waste, this vanity, Am I grown so soon forgetful of my
late sad condition, or so insensible of my late rebellions, and of the
pardon God has given me, as thus impudently to sin again? Is this the
reward I make him for all his mercies, thus one after another to abuse
them still? or is it that I am weary of my happiness, and grown so
wanton as to tempt destruction? Is it that I may go with more dishonour
to my Grave, leave a blot upon my name, and stand upon record for a
fool, or worse, to all posterity for ever? Is it that I have not already
sins enough, but I must thus foolishly still burthen my accompts? Is it
that I may go the more gloriously to Hell, and damn my self the deeper?
Is it that I may purposely thwart God in all his ways of mercy and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cross his desires, scorn his entreaties, defie his threats, despise his
complaints, anger him to the heart, that I may be rid of him, and quit
my hands of all my interests in Heaven for ever. Why this is the English
of my sins, my profaneness, and debaucheries, the courses I am in, or
now going upon: and will I still continue them?</p>
            <p>This would be considering indeed, and a few hours thus spent some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
would make us truly wise. And let us but do so, we shall quickly
see the effect of them, God shall have his wishes, and we shall be wise,
and we shall have ours too, all we can wish or hope, and no complaining
in our streets. All our former follies shall be forgotten, and all ill ends be
far off from us; and when these days shall have an end, we shall then
go to our Graves in peace, to our Accompts with joy, and passing by
(some of us perhaps) even the gates of Hell, come happily to the end
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57113:162"/>
of all our hopes, the salvation of our souls, have our end, glory, and
honour, and immortality, and eternal life; where we, as <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us
the wise do, shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament, and as the
Stars for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Whether he bring us, who is the eternal Wisdom of his Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; to whom with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and one Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, and only Wise God, be
all Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and
Glory, and Blessing for ever and ever.</p>

               <q>And the Angel came in unto her, and said, Hail thou that art highly
favoured, The Lord is with thee, Blessed art thou among
women.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>day</hi> will tell you who this <hi>Blessed among women</hi> is, we
call it our <hi>Lady-day;</hi> And the <hi>Text</hi> will tell you why
she comes into the <hi>day,</hi> because the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>day</hi> came
in to her. And the <hi>Angel</hi> will tell you why he to <hi>day</hi>
came in to Her; she was <hi>highly favoured, and the Lord
was with her,</hi> was to come himself this <hi>day</hi> into her, to
make her the most <hi>blessed among women,</hi> sent him
only before to tell her so, to tell her, he would be with her by and by
himself.</p>
            <p>This makes it <hi>Annunciation day,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation of the Virgin Mary,</hi> as
the <hi>Church</hi> calls it, and the <hi>Annunciation</hi> to her, as we may call it too:
The <hi>Annunciation</hi> or announcing and proclaiming of Christ unto her, that
he was this <hi>day</hi> to be <hi>Incarnate</hi> of her, to take that flesh to <hi>day</hi> upon him
in the womb, which he was some nine months hence on <hi>Christmass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
to bring with him into the world. And (2.) the <hi>Annunciation</hi> or
announcing, that is proclaiming of her <hi>blessed among, above women</hi> by it, by
being thus <hi>highly favoured</hi> by her Lords thus coming to her. A <hi>day</hi> upon
these grounds fit to be remembred and announced or proclaimed unto the
World.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Dominus tecum</hi> is the chief business, the Lord Christs being
with her, that which the <hi>Church</hi> especially commemorates in the <hi>day.</hi>
Her being <hi>blessed,</hi> and all our being blessed, highly favoured, or favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at all, either mens or womens being so, all our hail, all our health,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57113:163"/>
and peace, and joy, all the <hi>Angels</hi> visits to us, or kind words, all our
Conferences with heaven, all our titles and honours in heaven and
earth, that are worth the naming come only from it. For <hi>Dominus tecum</hi>
cannot come without them; He cannot come to us but we must be so,
must be highly favoured in it, and blessed by it. So the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of
Christ, and the <hi>Annunciation</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> his being incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of her, and her blessedness by him, and all our blessednesses in
him with her make it as well our <hi>Lords</hi> as our <hi>Ladies day.</hi> More his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his being <hi>Lord</hi> made her a <hi>Lady,</hi> else a poor <hi>Carpenters</hi> Wife, God
knows; all her worthiness and honour, as all ours, is from him; and
we to take heed to <hi>day,</hi> or any day, of parting them; or so remembring
her as to forget him; or so blessing her, as to take away any of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him; any of his worship to give to her; Let her blessedness, the
respect we give her, be <hi>inter mulieres, among women</hi> still: such as is fit and
proportionate to weak creatures, not due and proper only to the <hi>Creator,</hi>
that <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> Christ in her be the business: that we take pattern
by the <hi>Angel,</hi> to give her no more than is her due, yet to be sure to give
her that though, and that particularly upon the <hi>day.</hi> And yet the <hi>day</hi>
being a day of <hi>Lent</hi> seems somewhat strange, 'Tis surely no fasting work,
no business or occasion of sadness this; What does it then, or how shall
we do it then in Lent, a time of fast and sorrow? Fast and feast too:
how can we do it? A Feast it is to <hi>day,</hi> a great one, Christs <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
a day of joy, if ever any: and <hi>Lent</hi> a time of sorrow and repentance: a
great one, the greatest Fast of any; How shall we reconcile them?
Why thus, The news of Joy never comes so seasonable as in the midst of
sorrow; news of one coming to save us from our sins can never come
more welcome to us than even then when we are sighing and groaning
under them: never can <hi>Angel</hi> come more acceptably than at such time,
with such a message, as <hi>All Hail, thou art highly favoured, blessed art thou;</hi>
'Tis the time that <hi>Angels</hi> use to come when we are fasting: So to <hi>Daniel,
Dan.</hi> ix. 3, 21. So to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> x. 30. the time when we best hear a
voice from heaven, and best understand it with St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> x. 13, 15,
16, 20. the time when God himself vouchsafes to spread our Table, as
he did there of all kinds of beasts and fowls, to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> all heavenly
food and mysteries. 'Tis the very time for <hi>gratia plena,</hi> to be fill'd when
we are empty; the only time for <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> for our Lords being with
us when we have most room to entertain him. So nor the <hi>Church,</hi> nor
we in following it, are any whit out of order. <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> Christ is
the main business, both of our Fasts and Feasts: and 'tis the greatest
order to attend his business in the <hi>day,</hi> and way we meet it, be it what it
will.</p>
            <p>Though perhaps it seem stranger too to hear of an <hi>Angel</hi> coming into a
<hi>Virgins</hi> Chamber, at midnight, (as is conjectured) and there saluting
her. But no fear of those Sons of God if they come in unto the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of men. <hi>Angels</hi> are Virgins, may be with Virgins, in the privatest
Closets, are always with them there to carry up their Prayers, and to
bring down blessings. No strange thing then to hear of an <hi>Angel</hi> with any
of them whom God highly favours, with whom himself is too: no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to hear of an <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Ave</hi> to any such. The only wonder indeed to us
will be to hear of an <hi>Ave Mary.</hi> Indeed I cannot my self but wonder at it,
as they use it now, to see it turn'd into a Prayer. 'Twas never made for
Prayer, or Praise, a meer <hi>Salutation;</hi> the <hi>Angels</hi> here to the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended it, I dare say, for other, either to praise her with, or pray unto
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57113:163"/>
her. And I shall not consider it as such, I am only for the <hi>Angels Ave,</hi> not
the <hi>Popish Ave Marie,</hi> I can see no such in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor should I scarce, I confess, have chosen such a <hi>Theam</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> though
the Gospel reach it me, but that I see 'tis time to do it when our <hi>Lord</hi> is
wounded through our <hi>Ladies</hi> sides; both our <hi>Lord</hi> and the mother of our
<hi>Lord</hi> most vilely spoken of by a new generation of wicked men, who,
because the <hi>Romanists</hi> make little less of her than a <hi>Goddess,</hi> they make
not so much of her as a good woman; because they bless her too much,
these unbless her quite, at least will not suffer her to be blessed as she
should. To avoid both these extremes we need no other pattern but the
<hi>Angels,</hi> who here salutes, and blesses her indeed; yet so only salutes and
blesses her, so speaks of and to her as to a woman here, though much
above the best of them; one <hi>highly favoured,</hi> 'tis true, yet but favoured
still; all her grace, and blessedness, and glory still no other, meer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and no more, and <hi>Dominus tecum, the Lords being with her,</hi> the ground,
and source, and sum of all; <hi>Virgin</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> both blessed thence. The
better to give all their due, <hi>Angel,</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> and you the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understanding of the <hi>Text,</hi> the scope, and matter, and full meaning
of it, we shall consider in the words these two Particulars: The <hi>Angels
Visitation,</hi> and the <hi>Angels Salutation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. His <hi>Visitation,</hi> or coming to her in these words: <hi>And the Angel came in
unto her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>His</hi> Salutation <hi>to her, or saluting her, in these,</hi> Hail thou that art highly
favoured; The Lord is with thee, Blessed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Visitation</hi> we have,</p>
            <p>(1.) The Visitor. (2.) The Visited. (3.) The Visiting. The Angel,
the Visitor, He. The blessed Virgin, this the Visited, Her: And the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
his coming in unto her.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Salutation</hi> there is to be considered both the Form of it, and
the Titles in it.</p>
            <p>1. The Form threefold: (1.) <hi>Hail.</hi> (2.) <hi>The Lord is with thee.</hi> (3.) <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
art thou,</hi> or be thou blessed, <hi>Sis benedicta,</hi> it may be, as well as <hi>es.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Titles given her, they three too: <hi>Thou that art highly favoured,</hi>
that's one. <hi>Blessed thou,</hi> that's another. <hi>Blessed among women,</hi> that's the
third. These all so evident and so plain, that none can miss them; But to
these two Points two more are to be added, The Grounds and Bounds of
these great titles.</p>
            <p>1. The Ground of this high blessedness and favour: (1.) <hi>Full of grace,</hi>
so our old <hi>Translation,</hi> and the old <hi>Latine</hi> render it, her fulness of grace and
goodness, that's one. (2.) But <hi>the Lord is with thee,</hi> that's the main, thence
all her blessedness, thereby it is that she is so highly favoured, because the
Lord is with her.</p>
            <p>2. The Bounds or Limitation of these titles, they come first with a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, no other form then what is and hath been given unto men; though
great they be, yet divine they be not. The greatest Title secondly is but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from meer grace and favour. Thirdly, It must still too acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Dominus tecum.</hi> She hath a Lord, is a Subject as well as we. And
lastly, All her blessedness is but <hi>inter mulieres, among women;</hi> how much
soever she excels all vvomen, she is but <hi>inter mulieres,</hi> among such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in the rank of Creatures, no <hi>Goddess,</hi> nor partner vvith the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
either in title or vvorship.</p>
            <p>By considering and laying all these Points together vve shall both
vindicate the <hi>blessed Virgins</hi> honour, as vvell from all superstitious as
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57113:164"/>
prophane abuses, and our selves from all neglect of any duty to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our <hi>Lord,</hi> one so highly favoured, and blessed by him, whilst we
give her all that either <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> gave her, but yet dare not give her
more.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Dominus mecum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus vobiscum</hi> too, the <hi>Lord</hi> be with me
whilst I am speaking it, and with you whilst you are hearing it, and bless
us both whilst we are about it, that we may learn to bless where we
should bless, whom, and when, and how to do it, and rightly both accept
and apply God's blessings and our own.</p>
            <p>We are now to learn it from the <hi>Angel,</hi> his visiting and blessing the
<hi>blessed Virgin</hi> here. His visit and his Salutation to her. But his visit, or
visitation, that stands first. Where the visiter, the visited, and his visit;
the <hi>Angel,</hi> the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and his coming into unto her are all to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>And the Angel came in unto her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who so fit as an <hi>Angel</hi> to come into her, to give this visit, to give
this blessing? It was a bad <hi>Angel</hi> that brought the curse, upon the woman,
'twas fit a good one should bring the blessing.</p>
            <p>The imployment (2.) suits none so well. 'Twas news of joy who
could bring it better, than one of those who were the first sons of eternal
joy, the first enjoyers of it, who could pronounce it better?</p>
            <p>Who fitter (3.) to come with a <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> before the face of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> with a message of his coming down to earth, than they who always
behold his face in heaven, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 10.</p>
            <p>Who fitter (4.) to come to her, she was an immaculate and unspotted
<hi>Virgin,</hi> and to whom do Virgins Chambers lie ope at midnight but to
<hi>Angels?</hi> God sends no other thither at that time of night, and that that
time it was may be well conjectured from <hi>Wisdom</hi> xviii. 14, 15. <hi>When all
things were in quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course;
Thine Almighty Word came down from Heaven,</hi> then it seems was the time of
her <hi>Conception,</hi> of Christs coming to her, before whom immediately the
<hi>Angel</hi> came to bring the message that he was a coming, if, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi>
says, he were not come already.</p>
            <p>And (5.) with such a message to a <hi>Virgin,</hi> as that she should conceive,
without a man, who was convenient to bring it but an <hi>Angel? Ne quo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genere
depravaret affectu,</hi> says St. <hi>Ambrose, that there might not be the least ground
of a false suspition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (6.) to such a <hi>Virgin,</hi> one so highly favour'd as to be made the
mother of God (for the mother of Christ is no less, he being God) what
messenger could come less than an <hi>Angel? Prophets</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
were too little for so great an embassage, and <hi>Angels</hi> never came upon a
greater.</p>
            <p>Nay, (7.) every <hi>Angel</hi> neither was not fit for so high an Office: The
<hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> it was, he is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here. <hi>Gabriel</hi> is by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and
St. <hi>Gregory</hi> interpreted <hi>Fortitudo Dei,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> or strength <hi>of God,</hi> and in
this work it appear'd indeed. Gods strength and power never so much
shewn as in the saving of us by Christ. It is by others (2.) interpreted
<hi>Vir Deus,</hi> or <hi>Deus nobiscum, God man,</hi> or <hi>God with us.</hi> Could any be thought
fitter to bring this news upon his lips than he that carries it in his name?
Especially (3.) being the same that foretold all this to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. ix. 21.
fit that he should see to the performance who brought the promise.
(4.) <hi>Petrus Damiani</hi> thinks he was the holy <hi>Virgins Guardian Angel,</hi> proper
therefore to bring her this good message, or any else. (5.) God had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times employed him before, to <hi>Daniel, Zachary,</hi> and others, and found
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57113:164"/>
hm faithful, he therefore now employs him still, that we may know, he
that is faithful in the least God will by degrees trust him with the most,
the greatest matters.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Angels</hi> drove us out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and now they come to let us
in again. Then they placed a Sword to keep us out, now they bring the
word to let us in. None now you see more fit for this business than an
<hi>Angel,</hi> than the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> too, whether we respect the persons,
either from whom, or to whom the message comes, or the message
or the time, or the way and order of it. So we have done with him, come
we now to her, a greater than He, if we may speak with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and
some others.</p>
            <p>Yet I shall not give her other Titles than the Scripture gives her, I am
afraid to give her such as many do. A <hi>Virgin espoused to a man whose name
was Ioseph, of the house of David she was, and her name was Mary,</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi>
before the <hi>Text.</hi> (1.) Of royal descent and linage. (2.) Espoused to an
Husband of the same Kingly house. (3.) Of a name very answerable
to her greatness. Of <hi>Davids</hi> Seed, for so her Son the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be.
A <hi>Virgin,</hi> for of such a one he was to come: <hi>Semen mulieris,</hi> not <hi>maris,</hi>
from the beginning the womans seed, and not the mans, so necessarily
a <hi>Virgin</hi> then, and so plainly foretold to be by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa. vii. 14. A <hi>Virgin
shall conceive and bear</hi> him; yea, a <hi>Virgin espous'd;</hi> (1.) To conceal the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> from the <hi>Devil;</hi> (2.) To take away all occasion
of obloquy from devilish men; (3.) That the birth of our Saviour might
be with all possible honour; and (4.) That his <hi>Genealogy</hi> might so be
reckoned as all others regularly by the man, as you see them both by
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of a high and illustrious name besides; <hi>Maria</hi> is <hi>Maris stella,</hi> says
St. <hi>Bede. The star of the Sea,</hi> a fit name for the mother of the bright morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
star, that rises out of the vast sea of God's infinite and endless love.
<hi>Maria</hi> (2.) the <hi>Lyriack</hi> interprets <hi>Domina,</hi> a <hi>Lady,</hi> a name yet retain'd,
and given to her by all <hi>Christians, our Lady,</hi> or <hi>the Lady mother of our Lord.
Marie</hi> (3.) rendred by <hi>Petrus Damiani de monte &amp; altitudine Dei, highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,</hi>
as you would say, like the Mountain of God, in which he would
vouchsafe to dwell, after a more miraculous manner than in very <hi>Sion</hi> his
own <hi>holy Mount.</hi> (4.) St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> interprets it, <hi>Deus ex genere meo, God of
my kin,</hi> as if by her very name she was designed to have God born of her,
to be <hi>Deipara;</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> against all <hi>Hereticks</hi> has ever stil'd her the
<hi>Mother of God:</hi> you may well now fully conceive no Embassador so fit to
come to such an one as her but some great <hi>Angel</hi> at the least.</p>
            <p>And his coming to her comes next to be considered, And the <hi>Angel
came in unto her.</hi> Where we are taught both how he came, and where he
found her. By his coming, or being said to come, we are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that it was in a bodily and humane shape; So <hi>Angels</hi> often used
to come in the likeness of men, and at this time it was of all ways the
most convenient that the <hi>Angels</hi> should come like men, seeing their <hi>Lord</hi>
was now to come so: and one of them to come before him with the
news. When he himself would vouchsafe to wear the livery of our
flesh, 'tis most convenient his servants sure that wait upon him, whom he
sends upon his errands, should appear at least in the same Livery.
Nor could his Message easily be delivered in more sweetness, nor the
<hi>Blessed Maid</hi> entertain it with less terror or diffidence any other
way.</p>
            <p>For though it could not but trouble her, as we see it did in the follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57113:165"/>
verse, to see a man at that time in her Closet, ere she was aware, yet
his coming in so insensibly when the doors were shut upon her, besides per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the brightness of his countenance and raiment could not but tell her
it was an <hi>Angel,</hi> and so abate her fear a little.</p>
            <p>Yet observe here a difference between the <hi>Angels</hi> coming now, and
heretofore; we never read of an <hi>Angels</hi> appearing but abroad, or in the
Temple, till now. Now they begin to grow more familiar with us, come
in into our Closets now Christ is coming; the Kingdom of Heaven 'tis
a sign is come nigh unto us. And 'tis a good <hi>Item</hi> to us to keep much in
our Closets seeing <hi>Angels</hi> are now to be met with there.</p>
            <p>And (2.) 'tis an Item too for <hi>Virgins</hi> to keep within; <hi>Dinah</hi> went out
and met with you know whom, came home ill-favouredly. The blessed
<hi>Virgin</hi> keeps in, and meets with an holy <hi>Angel,</hi> and the title of <hi>highly
favoured,</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> for it. The stragling, gadding huswife meets no <hi>Angel</hi>
to salute her, whosoever does; if we look for <hi>Angels</hi> company, and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
we must be much within. A Garden enclosed is my Sister, my
Spouse, a Spring shut up, a Fountain sealed, says Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> iv. 12. The
Spouse of Christ, the Soul he loves and vouchsafes his company, much
private, oft within. Within, and at her Prayers and Meditation too.
So was the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> say the Fathers here, blessedly employed,
watching at her devotions; no way so sure to get an <hi>Angels</hi> company, or
hear good news from heaven, to obtain a favour or a blessing thence, as
this, as prayer, and watching in our Closets.</p>
            <p>This we piously believe of the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> but we are sure she was
within, a true daughter of <hi>Sarah</hi> in it; who it seems kept commonly
within doors in her Tent, <hi>Gen.</hi> xviii. 10. <hi>whose daughters you are,</hi> says St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
1 Pet. 3. 6. <hi>as long as you do well;</hi> must be too in this, as well as other
things, if you vvould do vvell.</p>
            <p>For lastly, to shevv the truth of the <hi>Angels</hi> vvords, that she vvas full of
grace, the Scripture tells us, by the <hi>Angels</hi> coming into her, that she vvas
vvithin, vvhere, <hi>qui habeat abundantiam gratiae,</hi> says <hi>Hugo, they that are full
of grace,</hi> keep in as much as they can, fearing the corrupt discourses and
conversations of the World. None so scrupulous of appearing abroad,
none more fear idle, loose, or vain discourses (vvhich cannot be avoided
by such vvho go often abroad) than they that are fullest of grace and
goodness. Nor do they care for the salutation, favours, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men, vvho are highly favoured of the <hi>Lord.</hi> No matter at all
vvith them to be neglected by men, vvho desire only to be saluted by an
<hi>Angel,</hi> as vvas the <hi>Virgin</hi> here, vvhich falls next to be considered. The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Salutation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tvvo Points vve told you there vvere to be handled in it. The form
of it, and the titles in it: The form in vvhich it runs, the Titles vvith
vvhich it's given.</p>
            <p>The form is in three expressions, <hi>Hail, the Lord is with thee, Thou art,</hi> or
<hi>be thou blessed.</hi> Three several salutations, as it vvere, and that (1.) for
the greater reverence and honour to her, so Kings and Queens are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
saluted vvith three adorations. (2.) To shevv from vvhom he
came, from <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> from all three persons in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
That (3.) she vvas so intent and busie at her devotions, that she
minded not perhaps his first and second Salutation, he vvas fain to add a
third; To shevv lastly the triple blessing that he came vvith, Peace, and
Grace, and Blessedness; that Heaven vvas novv at peace vvith us,
Grace vvas thence coming dovvn apace, Heaven doors set open, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57113:165"/>
very blessedness of Heaven clearly now propounded and proffered to us.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>salutation</hi> is an <hi>Ave,</hi> a salutation never heard from <hi>Angels</hi>
mouth before. And it speaks joy, and peace, and health, and salvation,
both to her, and us by her. The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> rejoyce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
at such a Child as now is to be born of thee, <hi>O Virgin Daughter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I bring you tydings of great joy, of a Child,</hi> all our joy by him, <hi>which is
Christ the Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word speaks, Peace be to thee. A wish for peace, the
first news of Heaven reconciled; the way to reconciliation being now
in agitation, and to be by her. Peace from the Prince of Peace, from
the author of our peace, now coming, as joyful a salutation as we can
wish, all our peace from this <hi>Conception,</hi> all begun with this message, and
the <hi>Angel</hi> the <hi>Herauld</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>3. It intimates health as well as peace, we were all sick till this <hi>day</hi>
came, the best with the <hi>Spouse,</hi> sick of love, <hi>Cant.</hi> v. 8. the worst sick of
somewhat else; none well till this news came, till the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this great <hi>Conception,</hi> rose with healing in his wings. Now all hail,
and whole, and well again.</p>
            <p>4. It signifies a wish of salvation too. <hi>Ave,</hi> says one piously, though
not learnedly, <hi>a vae,</hi> all woe now away, temporal and eternal. <hi>Eva</hi> spell'd
backwards, all <hi>Eves</hi> ill spun web unravel'd, undone, roul'd backward by
the <hi>Conception</hi> of this <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> here foretold, temporal and eternal
woes taken all away, nothing but joy and salvation to us if we will hear
it with the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and accept it.</p>
            <p>The second salutation is, <hi>The Lord is with thee,</hi> and it may be either an
apprecation, or wishing that he would be, or an <hi>Annunciation,</hi> or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
a declaring and affirming that he is, or a prediction or foretelling
that he will be with her.</p>
            <p>It was an apprecation when <hi>Boaz</hi> gave it to the Reapers, <hi>Ruth</hi> ii. 4. that
God would be with them.</p>
            <p>It was an apprecation and an affirmation both, when the <hi>Angel</hi> gave it
to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. vi. 12. <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is affirmation, apprecation, and prediction, all three here, to our
<hi>Blessed Lady,</hi> a wish that the <hi>Lord</hi> would, an assurance that he is, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
that he will be yet more signally, and more particularly with her
by and by.</p>
            <p>'Tis somewhat to be saluted by an <hi>Angel,</hi> and 'tis not common; we
hear often of their coming with a message, seldom with a salutation:
'tis sign of more then ordinary acquaintance and familiarity with God,
and of his respect particular unto us, when he sends his <hi>Angels,</hi> not only
upon errands, but <hi>how-do-yous</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>With such a salutation too, as <hi>the Lord is with thee.</hi> The hand of the
<hi>Lord</hi> was with him, 'tis said of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and that was well, his
hand and not himself; and yet the greatest of them that was born of
women was not greater than he, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 11. But here 'tis he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the greatest among women. It is a great favour to have his
hand, but it is an high one to have himself with us.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Angel</hi> says to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. vi. 12. <hi>The Lord be with thee,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
but 'tis here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an <hi>Article,</hi> an <hi>Emphasis</hi> put upon it: he
is not with her, as he is with any else, <hi>Tecum in mente, tecum in ventre,</hi> as
the <hi>Fathers</hi> gloss it, <hi>Tecum in spiritu, tecum in carne,</hi> with her he was, or
would be presently, as well in her body, as in her soul, personally, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
nay bodily with her, and take a body from her, a way of being
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57113:166"/>
with any never heard before or since, a being with her beyond any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
or conception whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Lord</hi> thus being with her, all good must needs be with her, all
the gracious ways of his being with us are comprehended in it, so the
salutation no way to be exceeded: And well may he chuse to be with
her, even make haste and prevent the <hi>Angel,</hi> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> speaks, to be
with her. He is with the pure in heart, with the humble spirit, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
retired soul, and she is all. And though by the <hi>Angels</hi> words, <hi>ver.</hi>
31. we cannot conceive that the <hi>Lord</hi> was yet conceived in her, he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the future, yet as sure it was, even whilst the <hi>Angel</hi> was in his
salutation, as if he were already incarnate in her flesh: upon this may
well follow the third salutation, <hi>Blessed art thou,</hi> or be thou blessed. Yet,</p>
            <p>I shall not here say much of this, I reserve it to be handled amongst the
titles, onely tell you it may as well pass for a salutation as the other.
We still sometimes use it in our salutations, use to say <hi>God bless you,</hi> when
we salute sometimes; so the mowers to <hi>Boaz,</hi> return his salutation of,
<hi>the Lord be with you,</hi> with <hi>The Lord bless thee,</hi> Ruth. ii. 4. And <hi>Gen.</hi> xlvii.
7. we read that <hi>Iacob</hi> blessed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he came before him, that is,
saluted him in a form of blessing.</p>
            <p>All the famous salutations, now you see, of all former and latter times
are here rallied up in this, <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Live for ever,</hi> for life, and health,
and safety, the <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>Gideon, The Lord is with thee, Boaz</hi> his to <hi>Ruth,
Blessed be thou, of the Lord my daughter,</hi> Ruth. iii. 10. <hi>Tobit</hi>'s to the <hi>Angel,
Gaudium tibi,</hi> Tob. v. 11. <hi>Ioy be unto thee, Christ</hi>'s to his Disciples, <hi>Peace
be unto you:</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> grace, and peace, and salvation to their Churches,
all in this of the <hi>Angel</hi> to the <hi>Virgin,</hi> now in treaty about <hi>Christs Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
To shew us (1.) all these are in Christ, all now coming to us, by
his coming to us, to be found altogether no where but in him, joy, and
peace, and health, and salvation, and blessedness first rising on us by
this <hi>days</hi> business, his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> To teach us (2.) good forms of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation,
blessing, and not cursing, though there are some so peevish, to
say no worse, to tell us they had as lieve we should say the <hi>Devil take
them,</hi> as <hi>God bless them,</hi> or <hi>God be with them.</hi> It seems they had rather imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the bad <hi>Angel</hi> than <hi>the good,</hi> I hope we had not: Good words, if it
be no more, are fittest sure for Christian mouths, but yet good wishes
too; for he that forbids to say to some, <hi>God speed you,</hi> 2 John x. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
we should say so to others: And though the <hi>Disciples</hi> are bid to
<hi>salute no man by the way,</hi> St. Luke x. 4. that is, when it will retard or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their holy business, they are yet bid, when they come into a house,
say, <hi>Peace be to it,</hi> ver. 5. And if the <hi>Angel</hi> do it, and Christ bid it, and
do it too, as he does, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 35. I hope we may and will do too.
Nay, and give good titles too upon the same account, the <hi>Angel</hi> does so
to the blessed Virgin, and we hasten to them. <hi>Thou that art highly favoured,
blessed, blessed among women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou that art highly favoured;</hi> but why, thou, without a name? why
not <hi>Mary</hi> here as well as after, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. Why? there he used her name,
so to dispel her fear as it were, by a kind of friendly familiarity; here
he forbears it in his reverence to her. We use not to salute great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
by their Names, but by their Titles; and the Mother of God is
above the greatest we here meet with upon the earth. We must not be
too familiar with those whom God so highly favours, that's our lesson
hence. We are not to speak of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi>
as if we were speaking to our Servants, <hi>Paul, Peter, Mary,</hi> or the like:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:57113:166"/>
'Tis a new fashion of Religion, neither taken from <hi>Saints,</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> nor
any of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>heavenly spirits,</hi> to unsaint the <hi>Saints,</hi> to deny them
their proper titles, to level them with the meanest of our Servants: We
might learn better manners from the <hi>Angel</hi> here, manners, I say if it
were nothing else, for we dare not speak so to any here that are above
us, and we think much to be Thou'd without our titles, by that new ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of possessed men, who yet with more reason may call the best
man thou, then we the <hi>Apostles, Iohn</hi> or <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to descend to a particular survey of these Titles here, <hi>Thou that art
highly favoured,</hi> so our new <hi>Translation</hi> renders it, <hi>Full of grace,</hi> so our old one
hath it from the <hi>Latin, Gratia plena,</hi> and both right; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> will
carry both. Grace is favour, God's Grace is divine favour, high in
grace, high in his favour, full of his grace, full of his favour, all comes
to one.</p>
            <p>Now there is <hi>Gratia Creata,</hi> and <hi>Increata, Created grace, and uncreated
grace.</hi> Created grace is either sanctifying, or edifying; the gifts of the
Holy Spirit that sanctifie and make us holy; or the gifts that make us
serviceable to make others so. The first to serve God in our selves, as
Faith, Hope, Charity, and other graces: The second to serve him in
the <hi>Church,</hi> such as the gift of Tongues, of Prophesie, of Healing, and
the like: of each kind she had her fulness according to her measure,
and the designation that God appointed her.</p>
            <p>For sanctifying Graces, none fuller, <hi>Solo Deo excepto, God only excepted,</hi>
saith <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And 'tis fit enough to believe that she vvho vvas so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured to have her Womb filled vvith the body of the <hi>Lord,</hi> had
her soul as fully fill'd by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For edifying Graces, as they came not all into her measure, she vvas
not to preach, to administer, to govern, to play the <hi>Apostle;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no necessity she should be full of all those gifts, being those are
not distributed all to any, but <hi>unicuique secundum mensuram, to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his measure,</hi> and employment, and not at all times neither; so
neither is she said to be less ful for vvanting them. There is one fulness
of the Fountain, another of the Brook, another of a Vessel; one ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
of the Sea, another of the River, another of the Pond, and yet all
may be full. <hi>Christ</hi> himself is said to be full of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> is said to be full, and others said to be full; yet <hi>Christ</hi> as the Sea
or Fountain, they as the Rivulets or Rivers, and yet all as they can
hold. 'Tis so in Earth, 'tis so in Heaven: And vvith such a fulness as
the Brooks, or Rivers, is our Virgin full, and with no other. Where any
edifying Grace vvas necessary for her, she had it, as well as others; more
perhaps than others: Where it vvas not necessary, it vvas no vvay to
the impairing of her fulness, though she had it not; as the banks of the
Rivers rose, or the Channel was enlarged, so were those graces: but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mulieres, among women</hi> at the end, makes me incline to think the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Apostolick</hi> endowments do not any way belong to her; women
not being suffered in the times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but to teach their children
or servants at home: never thought so full of the Spirit as to be sent to
blow it all abroad.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is not said here, full of the Spirit, but <hi>full of Grace,</hi> and
that is commonly understood of sanctifying Grace, of which it is very
convenient that we believe none fuller than she: and the original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
will not inforce it much higher in the business of created grace.</p>
            <p>But in respect of the increated Grace, that is, of Christ, with whom
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57113:167"/>
she was now so highly favoured as to be with Child, none ever so filled
with Grace indeed. This was a grace of the highest nature, of which
created nature was never capable; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> well rendred, highly, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favoured; for 'tis most highly can be imagined: and this is her
first title, <hi>O thou that art highly favoured;</hi> high in Gods grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
so high as to be made his Mother, then sure made a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
for so great, so holy a guest, by the fulness of all grace and
goodness.</p>
            <p>From this follows the second Title, <hi>Blessed,</hi> blessed of God, blessed of
men: blessed in the City, and blessed in the Field; Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
call her blessed. Blessed in the fruit of her body, in her blessed
<hi>Child Iesus.</hi> Blessed in the fruit of her Ground, her Cattel, her Kine,
and her Sheep, in the inferiour faculties of her soul, and body; all fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
to Christ. Blessed her Basket, and her Store, her Womb, and her
Breasts; the Womb that bare him, and the Paps that gave him suck.
Blessed in her going out, and in her coming in; the Lord still being with
her. The good treasure of Heaven still open to her, showring down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, and the Earth fill'd with the blessings which she brought into
the world, when she brought forth the Son of God. Blessed she indeed
that was the Conduit of so great blessings; though blessed most in the
bearing him in her soul, much more than bearing him in her body. So
Christ intimates to the woman that began to bless the Womb, that is, the
Mother that bear him, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 27. yea rather, says he, they <hi>that hear
the word of God and keep it:</hi> As if he had said, she is more blessed in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word in her soul, than in her body. But blessed she is; <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
by the Holy Spirit fell a blessing her when she came to see her: And she
her self by the same Spirit tells us, all generations shall call her blessed,
<hi>ver.</hi> 28. So we have sufficient example and authority to do it. And I
hope we will not suffer the Scripture to speak false, but do it.</p>
            <p>And (3.) do it to her above all women, <hi>Benedicta tu in mulieribus.</hi> That's
her third Title. Most blessed, none so blessed; none ever had Child so
blessed; none ever bore or brought forth Child as she.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Benedicta in mulieribus, Blessed among women;</hi> She indeed only blessed:
all others subject to the curse of <hi>in dolore paries,</hi> of conceiving and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in sorrow. She wholly free from that, she a perpetual <hi>Virgin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and in, and after Child-birth. Christ came into her Womb insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
came forth as it were insensibly too, without groan or sorrow to
her. <hi>Blessed</hi> (2.) <hi>among women;</hi> they all henceforth saved by her Child-bearing:
notwithstanding she, that is, woman shall be saved in child-bearing,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. ie. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by her child-bearing, says a learned
<hi>Commentator,</hi> not their own, but hers, by the Child she bore; and they
therefore shall call her blessed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed</hi> (3.) <hi>among women,</hi> that is, none more blessed then the best, the
highest of them; none above the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> none sure so good as she
which now brings me to consider the grounds of all this honour, all these
Titles.</p>
            <p>The first is Grace, <hi>Gratiâ plena,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that always the
ground of Gods favour, and all our blessedness: So she tells us in her
<hi>Hymn, Respexit humilitatem.</hi> It was the humility of his Hand-maid, that
God in this high favour of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of his Son respected in her.
Humility the ground of all grace within us, all grace without us, of
Gods grace to us, of his graces in us, the very grace that graces them
all too. Humility makes them the most lovely, pride disgraces them all,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57113:167"/>
be they never so many, though indeed they can be truly none, that are
not founded in and adorned with humility.</p>
            <p>The second ground of blessedness is in the <hi>Text</hi> too, <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi>
the Lords being with her. From Christs being with her and with us,
it is, that we are blessed. From his <hi>Incarnation</hi> begins the date of all
our happiness. If God be not with us, all the world cannot make us
happy, much less blessed: From this grace of his Incarnation first riseth
all our glory: So that, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name
give the praise,</hi> must she sing as well as we; and they do her wrong as well
as God, that give his glory unto her; who will not give his glory to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
though to his Mother, because she is but his earthly Mother, a
thing infinitely distant from the heavenly Father. Nor would that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hand-maid, if she should understand the vain, and fond, and almost
idolatrous stiles and honours that are given her some where upon earth,
be pleased with them; she is highly favoured enough, that her <hi>Lord</hi> and
Son is with her, and she with him: she would be no higher sharer. You
may see it in the last particular, the bounds and limitations of her titles
and blessedness.</p>
            <p>For first, how full soever she be of Grace, 'tis yet but grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
'tis no more; Gods meer favour so exalted her, <hi>respexit</hi> only, his
respect to her, his free looking on her, no merit or desert, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he
hath highly favoured her indeed, but he has done, done it in the <hi>praeter</hi>
before she could conceive or imagine it.</p>
            <p>2. The salutation here, except the titles, given her by the <hi>Angels,</hi> is
not much more than what he gave to <hi>Gideon,</hi> or what <hi>Boaz</hi> to his Harvest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
enough to make the <hi>Papists</hi> afraid one would think of those extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant,
at least, if not blasphemous titles they give her, of their closing
their Books and Studies with <hi>Laus Deo, &amp; Virgini Maria,</hi> joyning her in
partnership with God; as if they were as much beholding to her as him.
I am sure they learn'd not this from the <hi>Angel:</hi> he brings no divine, but
humane titles and salutations to her. And he knew how to give titles,
though not flattering ones, as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks in <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. All her honour and blessedness is from <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> the Lords
being with her. He is her <hi>Lord</hi> as well as ours. More indeed he is with
her than with us, or with <hi>Angels</hi> either, <hi>plus tecum, quàm mecum</hi> as some
gloss it: but he is her <hi>Lord</hi> still for all that, and she is content so to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, and leave us a penn'd <hi>Hymn</hi> in witness of it, to give him
the sole honour of her magnifying and being magnified.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Though it be <hi>Benedicta,</hi> 'tis but <hi>inter mulieris, among women,</hi> all
this is; and they are but creatures; a creature-blessedness, a blessedness
competible to the creature. All to shew us, that when we exceed this
way of honour to her, or this way of blessing her, we are all out in our
<hi>Aves,</hi> we know not what we say. And 'tis well for some, that their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
excuses them, that they understand not what they speak.</p>
            <p>Give we her in Gods name, the honour due to her. God hath stil'd her
blessed by the <hi>Angel,</hi> by <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> commanded all generations to call
her so, and they hitherto have done it, and let us do it too: Indeed some
of late have over-done it; yet let us not therefore under-do it, but do
it as we hear the <hi>Angel</hi> and the first Christians did it; account of her,
and speak of her as the most blessed among women, one highly favoured,
most highly too. But all the while give <hi>Dominus tecum,</hi> all the glory, the
whole glory of all to him; give her the honour and blessedness of the chief
of <hi>Saints,</hi> him only the glory, that she is so, and that by her conceiving and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57113:168"/>
bringing our Saviour into the world, we are made heirs, and shall one
day be partakers of the blessedness she enjoys, when the Lord shall be
with us too, and we need no <hi>Angel</hi> at all to tell us so.</p>
            <p>Especially if we now here dispose our selves by chastity, humility, and
devotion, as she did to receive him, and let him be new-born in us. The
pure and Virgin Soul, the humble Spirit, the devout Affection will be
also highly favoured; the <hi>Lord</hi> be with them and bless them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Blessed is the Virgin Soul, more blessed than others in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
opinion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. blessed the humble spirit above all. For God hath
exalted the humble and meek, the humble Hand-maid better than the
proudest Lady. Blessed the devout affection, that is always watching for
her Lord in Prayer and Meditations; none so happy, so blessed as she:
the Lord comes to none so soon as such.</p>
            <p>Yet not to such at any time, more fully than in the <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> to
which we are now a going. There he is strangely with us, highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
us, exceedingly blesses us: there we are all made blessed <hi>Maries,</hi>
and become Mothers, Sisters, and Brothers of our Lord, whilst we hear
his word, and conceive it in us, whilst we believe him who is
the word, and receive him too into us. There <hi>Angels</hi> come to us on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
errands, and there out <hi>Lord</hi> indeed is with us; and we are blessed,
and the <hi>Angels</hi> hovering all about to peep into those holy mysteries, think
us so, call us so. There graces pour down in abundance on us, there grace
is in its fullest plenty, there his highest favours are bestowed upon us, there
we are fill'd with grace, unless we hinder it, and shall hereafter in the
strength of it be exalted into glory; there to sit down with this <hi>Blessed
Virgin,</hi> and all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and sing praise, and honour, and
glory to the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost</hi> for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Thus by being full of grace, and full of those graces, we also become
<hi>Maries,</hi> and the <hi>Mothers of our Lord;</hi> so he tells us himself, he that so does
the will of my Father, he is my Mother. Let us then strive to be so, that
the <hi>Angels</hi> may come with heavenly errands to us, our <hi>Lord</hi> himself come
to us, and vouchsafe to be again born in us, and so bless us, fill us with
grace, receive, and set us highly in his favour, and fill and exalt us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
with his glory, and with this <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and all the <hi>Saints</hi> and
<hi>Angels,</hi> we may sing praise, and honour, and glory to him, <hi>Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost,</hi> for ever and ever.</p>

St. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls some of them at least <hi>Palm branches,</hi>
St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xii. 13. and the <hi>Church</hi> calls the <hi>day Palm
Sunday. Dominica Palmarum,</hi> the day wherein our
<hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> riding as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Bishop of our souls</hi> his
Visitation to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> upon an Ass, was met
with a kind of solemn Procession by the people, <hi>a
very great multitude</hi> of them, says our <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and
had his way strewed with boughts, and bespread
with cloths the best they had, as is usual in Princely Entertainments,
and Triumphs, and Processions.</p>
            <p>And 'tis both a <hi>day</hi> and business worth remembring, wherein we see the
triumph of humility, whereby we are taught both humility and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Christs mercy and mans rejoycing in it, Christs way of coming to
us, and our way of going out to him to meet and entertain him. Things
worthy consideration. All that was this day done were so, but they are
many; and though they all concern us much, yet our own duty concerns
us most, to know with what dispositions, which way, and how to meet
and receive our <hi>Lord,</hi> come he never so meanly, never so slowly to us,
upon Horse or Ass, by Mountain or Valley, gloriously or humbly to us,
though come he how he will it will be humbly, the greatest imaginable
condescension even to come unto us.</p>
            <p>I shall stir out neither of the <hi>Text</hi> nor time to mind us of our duty in
the way of receiving Christ, nor desire more matter to spend the hour than
the words will give me. Only I must take both the Letter and Spirit of
them. If we look to the History and Letter many remarkables we shall
meet with: If to the Mystery and Spirit more and more punctually to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57113:169"/>
our purposes. By both we shall be abundantly fitted against Christs
coming to us; and for our due receiving him, the Sacramental within few
days now at hand, not excepted; nay the Spirit of the words may be as
fitly applied to that, to the Sacramental receiving him as any other,
to teach us how to receive and meet him there as well as any where
else.</p>
            <p>Consider we the words then under both Notions, what they did as to
the Letter, what we are taught to do by the Mystery and Spirit. In each
these three Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>I. The Persons that go out to meet Christ and entertain him; The
<hi>multitude, A very great multitude.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. The Ceremony and respect they meet him and entertain him with,
Some <hi>spread their Garments in the way, others cut down branches from the
trees, and strewd them in the way.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. The Way and Place they meet and entertain him in, both the one
and the other <hi>in the way.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>There <hi>they</hi> met him, so <hi>they</hi> there entertained him so many hundred
years ago, in the literal sense, in the same way and manner in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sense are we to entertain him every year and all our years and days
to come. And by thus canvasing the <hi>Text,</hi> and taking both senses of it,
we shall plainly see we have good reason to remember a <hi>Palm Sunday,</hi> the
<hi>Church</hi> so to entitle it so to prepare us both to the <hi>Passion</hi> and the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
by spreading still before us these branches of <hi>Palms</hi> and <hi>Olives,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating
this way unto us as the properest to entertain our <hi>Saviour</hi> in, to
usher in the thoughts of both the <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi> both his and ours,
and fit us for them both.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Persons of the <hi>day,</hi> and them I find the <hi>multitude,</hi> A
<hi>multitude</hi> for their quality; <hi>a very great multitude</hi> for their number.</p>
            <p>The <hi>multitude</hi> for their quality are the common people. And <hi>Interdum
vulgus rectum videt,</hi> says the <hi>Poet, Sometimes,</hi> it seems, <hi>the Common People see
what is right.</hi> No people of so low or mean understanding but may come to
the knowledge of Christ, and understand the ways of Salvation. The <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi>
had a <hi>Proverb,</hi> that <hi>Non requiescit Spiritus Domini super pauperem, The
Spirit of the Lord rests not upon the poor.</hi> And the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had taken up
somewhat like it, when they give the people no better stile than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

               <hi>to the poor the Gospel is preacht,</hi> is one of the tokens he
sends St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to evidence himself the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> quite contrary
to the <hi>Pharisees Hic populus qui non novit, this people that knoweth not the Law.
The Gospel,</hi> the Law of Christ, the far better Law, <hi>is preacht,</hi> it seems,
<hi>to the poor</hi> by him, and <hi>spiritus</hi> is now joyn'd with <hi>pauperes:</hi> The Spirit and
poor together we find in his first <hi>Sermon</hi> and first beatitude, <hi>the poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 3. and a while after <hi>Quam difficile,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How hardly shall they
that have riches enter into the Kindom of God?</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 23. The condition
altered, the poor advanc'd, the rich deprest, a good reason why the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
should follow and respect him, and a great testimony of our <hi>Saviours</hi>
mercy and humility so to honour mean things.</p>
            <p>Yet (2.) that the <hi>multitude</hi> may not forget themselves, as they are too
prone to do, to ride, you know whither, when they are set a horse back;
they may remember. Christ would <hi>not commit himself unto them,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> ii.
24. He needed not their honour, he knew what they would do in a few
days hence, cry as many <hi>Crucifies</hi> as they did to <hi>day Hosannahs;</hi> as fast to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57113:169"/>
crucifie him as now to bless him. Indeed, they are easie to be seduced
and led away by any <hi>wind of Doctrine,</hi> new Teachers and Seducers. We
have found it so of late, Christ, and his <hi>Church,</hi> and his <hi>Religion</hi> more
dishonoured by the madness of the multitude than he was honoured
here. They have stript himself and his <hi>Church</hi> of all the Garments and
Ornaments to cloath themselves, instead of stripping themselves, or
spreading their own Garments to honour him. Yet for all that, of such
giddy pieces as these Christ does not always refuse to be honoured, that
we may know he does not deal with us after our sins, nor reject us for our
weaknesses, much less condemn or damn us for them before we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them.</p>
            <p>Nay, perhaps (3.) he accepts this honour from this <hi>multitude,</hi> that he
might shew us what all worldly honour is, how fickle, how inconstant,
how vain it is, to puff up our selves with the breath of men, to feed our
selves with their empty air. They that are now ready to lick the dust of
some great mans feet, and spread not their Garments only, but their
bodies for him to go over; not only to cut down boughs to strew his
way, but to cut down every one that stands any way in his way if he
would have it, will within a few days, upon a little change, be as ready
to trample upon that great one they so much honour, and even cut his
throat if he command any thing that pleases not their humour, or crosses
their private interests and designs. This very <hi>multitude,</hi> so eager to day
to exalt <hi>Christ</hi> to the highest in their loud <hi>Hosannahs,</hi> are as fair on <hi>Friday</hi>
to exalt him to the <hi>Cross</hi> by their louder cryings. He yet would suffer
them to give him honour that you might know all earthly honour what
it is.</p>
            <p>But (4.) he thus receives this honour from the <hi>multitude,</hi> that he might
provoke great ones by their example. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>Salvation was
come unto the Gentiles to provoke the Iews to jealousie, Rom.</hi> xi. 11. that they
might in a holy strife and indignation endeavour to outgo them. 'Tis
the like intended here, that we might think much that simple men and
women should outstrip us, the ignorant know more of Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
do more at least, the poor and meanest bestow more, much more
on Christ than we with all our wit, and wealth, and greatness, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>And in this (5.) appears as well his power as providence and wisdom
that he should out of such <hi>stones</hi> as these <hi>raise up children unto Abraham,</hi>
that he should thus out of the mouths of babes and sucklings perfect his
own praise, make the Child as eloquent as the Orator, the women as
valiant in his service as the stoutest men, the People understand that
which the learned <hi>Doctors</hi> would not see. <hi>Even so O Father, for so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thee to reveal those things to babes and sucklings, and hide them from the wise,</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> x. 21. his only doing it was, neither their doing nor deserving,
<hi>and it is marvelous in our eyes,</hi> an evidence of the freeness of his power, that
he can do what he pleases, that he does what he lists, no man can hinder
him, none able to contradict him.</p>
            <p>This (6.) shews his Omniscience and his truth, that nothing that he
foretels, not a tittle of it shall fall any time to the ground. He had
foretold it by his <hi>Prophet, Zech.</hi> ix. 9. that the daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and the daughter of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shout for joy; and here we have it
to a tittle. even their Sons and Daughters doing it, <hi>a very great multitude</hi>
it is, and children and women in it; <hi>Children in the Temple, ver.</hi> 15.
and the whole <hi>City moved, ver.</hi> 10. all Sexes then, that the Prophesie
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57113:170"/>
might be fulfilled to the last letter. So punctual is he of his
word.</p>
            <p>Yet to fulfil it fuller, 'tis <hi>a very great multitude</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> that we
might know, that he that was here met by so great a company was the
<hi>Saviour</hi> of all, as many as would come, that would spread their garments
to receive him, make him any kind of entertainment, though butstrew
boughs and rushes for him, that (2.) the World might know that he
was going to his Passion, he went freely too; he could as well have used
these multitudes to preserve himself, as thus strangely to do him honour;
made them have bespread him with Arms and Weapons as well as arms
and boughs of trees; strewd the way with their bodies in his defence, as
well as their Garments in his honour; but he would suffer death, and
therefore would not suffer that. To tell us (3.) that he should be served
hereafter by great multitudes, and not by little handfuls of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
this was but a forerunner of the great multitudes of those that
should hereafter believe on him.</p>
            <p>Upon such grounds as these it is, that the Eternal Wisdom so uses this
<hi>great multitude</hi> here to set forth his glory, makes them do that which
themselves yet do not understand; to tell us he is a <hi>Saviour</hi> of the poor
and needy, as well as of the rich and wealthy. That he does not (2.) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refuse mans service though he know it is not to last long, to teach
us (3.) all the glory and honour we receive from men is but transitory
and quickly vanishing; to provoke us (4.) by their doings, to a godly
jealousie and contention to out-do them; to ascertain us (5.) of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
performance of every <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of his promises; To intimate, lastly, to us,
that he is the <hi>Saviour</hi> of us, willingly comes to suffer that he may be so,
that he may purchase a <hi>Church,</hi> great multitude, by it to himself. Thus
you have some kind of glimmering light why this <hi>great multitude</hi> are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in this way of honouring him by the way. And yet there is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
beyond it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>multitude</hi> throngs together to inform us (1.) how <hi>Christ</hi> would be
serv'd and honoured; with full Assemblies and Congregations. The
places where he comes he loves to see crouded with devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
to hear them encouraging and heightning one another with
<hi>O come let us worship and fall down and kneel before God our Maker,</hi> and by
outward reverence, gestures, and expressions, provoking one another
to his service.</p>
            <p>It instructs us (2.) that there is neither man nor woman, Master nor
Servant, old man or child, poor or rich, to be out in giving glory to him,
all sexes, ages, and conditions to flow together to do him service, the
very children to lisp it out; they that have not a rag to cover shame may
have a leaf to honour him; they that cannot, are not able to cut down a
bough, may strew it yet; that cannot lift a branch, may hold a twig, do
somewhat or other to his entertainment.</p>
            <p>It preaches (3.) to us, that there is nothing readier to serve him than
the poor in spirit; that the spirit which most does him honour, which is
ever most ready to do it to him is the poor and humble Spirit, such as
ranks it self lowest, thinks meanest of it self, none so mean in the meanest
multitude. Heres the spirit of this <hi>very great multitude,</hi> the spiritual sense
it speaks, a serving <hi>Christ</hi> with a poor and humble spirit, and bringing
our selves, and all ours, our very children to speak or point out his praise,
to do it too <hi>in the great Congregation,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, to <hi>praise him
among much people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:57113:170"/>And not only so, but with much ceremony too: so we read in the
next particular, some <hi>spread their garments in the way, others cut down bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. These Ceremonies, neither of them, were strange among the
<hi>Iews</hi> in the days of joy or triumph, or the inauguration of Kings and
Princes. When <hi>Iehu</hi> was anointed King, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 12. we find every
man hasting to take his own garment, and put it under him, spreading
them as carpets for him to walk on, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. And in the Feast of <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi>
it was commanded them to <hi>take boughs of goodly trees, branches of
palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook, and so rejoyce
before the Lord,</hi> Lev. xxiii. 40. whence afterward it became usual in all
Feasts of solemn Joy to do as much. So we read <hi>Simon</hi> entring the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Ierusalem, with thanksgivings, and branches of Palm-trees,</hi> St. Matth.
xiii. 51. and when <hi>Iudas Maccabeus</hi> had recovered and cleansed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palms also,</hi> rejoycing for it,
2 <hi>Mac.</hi> x. 7. So that the reason's ready why the <hi>multitude</hi> met <hi>Iesus</hi> in this
fashion. They would long before have made him <hi>King;</hi> they believed
he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the King of <hi>Israel;</hi> and therefore thus go out to
meet him and receive him. They had heard his word, they had seen his
miracles. <hi>never man,</hi> say the very <hi>Pharisees</hi> officers <hi>spake like</hi> him, with
more authority and power he then all their <hi>Iewish Doctors and Rabbi's</hi> all
together, never man did such things as he, and therefore no wonder if
the people do some strange things too to express their opinions of him.</p>
            <p>But the matter is not so much what they do, as what we learn by
<hi>Christs</hi> suffering them to do so. And by it we first gather, that <hi>Christ</hi> is
no enemy to outward Ceremonies, and respects, to outward civilities and
expressions.</p>
            <p>That (2.) he dislikes not neither even the Ceremonies of solemn joys,
and triumphs, of respects done to Kings, and Princes, and great Persons,
or publick congratulations with them in the days of their joy, or of any
publick joy, or particular gladness, as occasion shall present it.</p>
            <p>That (3.) he rejects not even the old and antient Ceremonies, is as
much content with such as any other; these were no other, and yet he
sticks not to receive them, stumbles not at them.</p>
            <p>Nay (4.) even in his Service, and for his own honour he accepts them,
is not only content, but pleased also that they should do them to himself.
It is the <hi>Pharisees</hi> only, and <hi>Pharisaical</hi> spirits, men of meer pretended
Piety and Religion, whose devotion is only to be seen of men, whose
whole business is to appear holier than others, not to be so, that find
fault with the doing it, that would have them rebuk'd for it, St. <hi>Luke</hi>
xix, 39. To whom <hi>Christ</hi> answers, that if they did not <hi>the stones</hi> would do
more; they, even they <hi>would</hi> both <hi>cry out</hi> against them for their silence,
and not doing it, and do what they could to express that joy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of which they seem'd so insensible. The very trees
would bow themselves, and every branch shake off its leaves, and spread
the ways, if men should not spread their garments; break off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they would not cut them down to strow them; the very stones
of the Wall fall themselves into an even pavement to kiss the feet of
their <hi>Lord</hi> and maker. Insensible and sensless stones are men the while
that deny <hi>Christ</hi> eternal reverence, outward worship, reverent and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
approches to him, that make I know not what sensless argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and excuses, idle scruples and pretences against <hi>old good significant
Ceremonies</hi> in his service to his honour. The very stones confute them, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57113:171"/>
               <hi>Christs</hi> telling us they would cry if men should not, signifies as well they
would bow, and worshp, and fall down, beautifie the ways and places
where he comes if men should not, rear themselves into Temples and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
if men should be so irreligious not to raise and employ them to it.
I now spare any other confutation.</p>
            <p>We learn (5.) by <hi>Christs</hi> thus suffering them, and Gods secret moving
them thus to spread the ways with boughs and garments, that he would
be acknowledged to be that great He to whom all creatures owe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to whom all are to be devoted, who is to be serv'd with all, even
to a thred; the trees to pay their boughs, and men their garments, to
strip themselves to the very skin, and consecrate even their garments to
his honour, to lay them at his feet, to resign all to him, to be content
that he, nay the very ass he rides on should trample on us if it be to his
praise and glory, that that may be augmented by it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, This spreading the way with <hi>Garments,</hi> and <hi>Palm-branches</hi> was
the way of entertaining conquerors in their triumphs; and by his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it at this time to himself, he gave them to understand, that he was
the conquerour over Death and Hell. In this only differing from other
conquerours, that he triumphs before his conquest, none so but he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none certain of the victory till it be perfected but he. This might
go for a mystery among the rest, but it concern those persons peculiarly,
and those times. The mystery of this point as it concerns us we are
next to see, how these <hi>garments</hi> and <hi>branches,</hi> this <hi>spreading</hi> and <hi>strowing</hi>
belong to us, how we are still so to spread our garments, and straw bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
before Christ.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Garments</hi> (1.) pass in the accompt for riches, <hi>Zech.</hi> xiv. 14. and
he that either bestows plentifully upon the poor, that clothes the naked,
and feeds the hungry, and supplies the needy with any thing to cover,
comfort, or refresh him, and spreads Gods holy house and table with offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
gives or does any thing to beautifie his service, to add honour and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
to his Worship, spreads his <hi>Garmtnts</hi> before Christ.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Garments</hi> are reckon'd among necessaries, and he that not only out
of his superfluity, but as the <hi>Apostle</hi> testifies of the <hi>Corinthians, 2 Cor.</hi>
viii. 2. out of his poverty also abounds unto the riches of liberality that
spares somewhat from his necessities, spreads even his inner garment at
the feet of Christ.</p>
            <p>But (3.) the <hi>Garments</hi> the <hi>multitude</hi> here spread were honorary, the
outward vestments and more honourable, that we might know our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
also are to be laid aside; nay, laid down to be trod upon by any
Ass for Christs sake, we to count nothing of our honour in comparison of
his, tread all under foot, and reckon nothing so honourable as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Christ.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Garments</hi> are a shelter from the injury of wind and weather, of heat
and cold. Yet if Christs business require it of us, we must not think much
to lie open to storm and tempest, to be deprived of house and shelter, of
robes and rags, nothing too much, nothing enough for Christ.</p>
            <p>5. To spread our <hi>Garments</hi> under ones feet, was construed for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of subjection and obedience to him, for whom we spread, or to
whom we send them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> ix. 13. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> x. 25. so to spread our
garments in the way of <hi>Iesus,</hi> is to profess, and promise, and begin obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, the chief spreading the way that he desires, the best way
of entertaining him.</p>
            <p>6. Our righteousness is called our <hi>Garment, Rev.</hi> iii. 4. and xvi. 15.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57113:171"/>
This also we are to spread before him, that he may consecrate and hallow
it; till he has set his mark upon it, and seal'd it, it will not pass for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
all our righteousness and obedience must have his stamp to confirm
it, his robes to lengthen it, his righteousness to make it right.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to spread our <hi>garments</hi> to receive him, may have a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the preparation we are making for the <hi>Blessed Sacrament.</hi> We
must open our bosoms, disrobe our selves, spread our garments, stretch
out our hands, open our bosoms by confession, disrobe and dismantle our
selves by renouncing all former vanities, spread all the good thoughts,
and affections, and desires we can, stretch out our souls in all holy vows
and resolutions, to receive and entertain him. Nay, all the former gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and spreadings may again be repeated and remembred here. We
must spread our garments upon the backs of the poor, spread our selves
before the Altar upon the pavement with all humility and devotion, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and trample upon all private respects and interests, lay aside all vain
desires of honour and greatness, despoil our selves of all trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in our selves, or in the arm of flesh, faithfully protest and renew
the vow of obedience and subjection, acknowledge our own no righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
till he accepts it, thus spread our garments all we can to receive him
with joy and honour.</p>
            <p>But if it so fall out, that we either have not some of these kind of
<hi>garments,</hi> those we have be not worth the spreading, we may yet
<hi>cut down branches from the trees, and strew in the way,</hi> at least where our <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
will not reach. Now several sorts of branches there were which
we may conceive the <hi>multitude</hi> made use of. Two more particularly,
<hi>Palms</hi> and <hi>Olives,</hi> yet from <hi>Nehemiah</hi> viii. 15. we may gather more, <hi>Olive-branches,
and Pine-branches, and Myrtle-branches, and Palm-branches, and
branches of thick trees,</hi> he reckons up and bids them fetch to make them
Tents and Tabernacles, the like likely also here; and in <hi>Leviticus, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>
are added too: in brief, any such as were at hand, that grew by the
way from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> These to the letter, shall we see
what spirit we can draw from them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Branches of Palm-trees</hi> by name St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us they came out of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
to meet him with, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 13. And <hi>Palms</hi> (1.) are the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of patience and perseverance, they cannot be deprest with any
weight; but the more you press them the more they rise; and so may
teach us the patience of the <hi>Cross,</hi> not to look sad for any hardship that
shall befal us in the way to <hi>Christ:</hi> but the more we suffer for him, the
more to bear up and lift up our heads that our redemption draweth nigh.
<hi>Palms</hi> thence (2.) are signs of victory, so being here given as it were to
<hi>Christ,</hi> they intimate to us both, to whom to give the glory of all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
we get over our sins, and passions; and so to labour our selves against
them, that we may be thought worthy to overcome them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Branches of Olives</hi> could not probably but be here too; the meeting
was upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> a place full of Olives; and Olives are the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of peace and meekness, of mercy and softness: nothing so smooth,
so softning, so suppling as Oyl, to teach us what spirit we are of if we
be Christs: this the offering he is most pleased with, the disposition he
most delights in; his way is spread with <hi>Olive-branches,</hi> is a way of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his yoke an easie yoke, full of rest and peace to the wearied soul:
the Christians way must be so too, a sweet and quiet temper in us
through all our ways.</p>
            <p>3. We may have leave to conjecture from that cited place of <hi>Leviticus</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:57113:172"/>
and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> there were other sorts besides. <hi>Pine-branches,</hi> or as some
render the word, <hi>branches of Balsam,</hi> and <hi>Cedar-trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Pine and Cedar are tall, streight, and upright trees, and
may mind us of high heavenly thoughts, pure and upright intentions,
streight and regular affections, to run forth to meet him with.</p>
            <p>In particular, the <hi>Pine</hi> is a Tree, says <hi>Pliny,</hi> that is, never but bearing
fruit: It has perpetually three years fruit upon it, and ripens month by
month. What a glorious tree is this to present to <hi>Christ!</hi> a soul always
bearing fruit, fruit after fruit, fruit upon fruit, <hi>adding to faith, vertue;
to vertue, knowledge; to knowledge, temperance; to temperance, patience; to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
godliness; to godliness, brotherly kindness; to brotherly kindness, charity,</hi>
as St. <hi>Peter</hi> advises us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 5, 6, 7. bearing still one fruit upon earth,
for the great years, the three great ages of our life, youth, man-hood,
and old age. till we bring our years to an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cedar</hi> next is a sweet lasting wood, will not take worm, corrupt,
or lose its scent; and the branches of it shadow out thus much to us,
that in the actions we present to Christ, there be no worms, no by inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
no corrupt affections, all sweet, and incorrupt, and a continued
constancy, and continuance in them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Balsame,</hi> or <hi>Balm-tree</hi> (3.) is a Tree medicinal to heal and cure
Wounds; and <hi>is there no Balm in Gilead, no Physician there,</hi> says the
Prophet <hi>Ieremiah?</hi> If there be not, here there is; upon Mount <hi>Olivet</hi>
there is here, upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> there is, in <hi>Christs</hi> Death and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to which he here is going: let us then bring <hi>Balm-branches</hi> thence,
and strew the way; acknowledge our <hi>Physician,</hi> in whom our health, he
that heals the lame, the blind, the sick, and all.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> mentions <hi>Myrtle-branches,</hi> as usual in such solemnities as
these. It was a Tree, says <hi>Pliny,</hi> dedicated to love; and the boughs of
it may teach us upon whom all our love is to be bestowed, all upon Christ,
all upon Christ.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> from whence this spreading the ways were
borrowed, we read of <hi>Willows, the Willows of the Brook;</hi> and they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
unto us, that we are to sit down with the <hi>Willows</hi> a little by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
look upon our selves in the streams of repentant tears, and then
bring our branches so watered to strow the way of Christ.</p>
            <p>There is yet <hi>lignum nemorosum, the branches of thick trees</hi> behind, to tell
us that we are to strew the ways not here and there with our piety and
good works, but thick every where, as thick as may be, that so we may
even cover the way, hide the earth, all appearance of earth, or earthly,
sensual, worldly desires and thoughts, when we are coming to receive our
Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus I have brought you to the <hi>Trees,</hi> shewed you what to spread
Christs way with: you must now cut down the <hi>branches,</hi> and strew the
way; take others in your hand and present him with. And with joy, and
gladness, and thankful hearts both accept the infinite favour he does you
to come to you, and rejoyce in it. 'Tis time now I say somewhat of the
<hi>way</hi> he comes, the <hi>way</hi> you are to meet him in.</p>
            <p>III. Between Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it was, from the <hi>Mount</hi> into
the <hi>Temple.</hi> Upon the <hi>Mount</hi> he preacht, and in the <hi>Temple</hi> he taught,
and there in his word you are to meet him, and that the word pass not
away as the wind, and empty air, you are to come to it with prepared
hearts, to open your ears, to spread your hearts to entertain it, to bring
the boughs of <hi>Olives,</hi> peaceable and pliant dispositions, boughs of <hi>Palms,</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:57113:172"/>
conquered passions; bows of <hi>Cedar,</hi> constant resolutions; boughs of
<hi>Myrtle,</hi> loving affections to it: and from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it is from the Mount of Peace to the City of Peace, that you
may not forget to come in the unity of the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, without
Schism, or Faction, or schismatical and factious intentions, if you look
to meet <hi>Christ</hi> there.</p>
            <p>2. In both <hi>Olivet</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> you see there is a mystery; the <hi>branches</hi>
and <hi>garments</hi> cover mysteries all the <hi>way,</hi> are kind of Sacraments; and in
the <hi>Blessed Sacraments</hi> it is we receive <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Throw we then our
<hi>garments</hi> in the way, cast all our own from us, that we may have none
but <hi>Christ;</hi> bring <hi>Palms,</hi> and <hi>Pines,</hi> and <hi>Olives, Cedars,</hi> and <hi>Myrtles,</hi> and
<hi>Willows;</hi> all thick and all green verdant pleasing graces, vertues, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to them, spread them all at the foot of the Altar; that's the
Ass that Christ rides on; the holy elements they that carry him, they
that convey him to us: There's our conquerour, let us bring <hi>Palms;</hi> there's
our peace-maker, let us bring <hi>Olive-branches;</hi> there's the Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
let us bring the upright <hi>Pine;</hi> there's our sweet-smelling sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in the eyes of God our eternal redemption, let us bring <hi>Cedar-boughs;</hi>
there's the great <hi>Physician</hi> of our souls, let us bring him <hi>Balm;</hi> there's
our love, let's bring him <hi>Myrtle;</hi> there's the well-spring of our life, let's
bring <hi>Willows;</hi> there's the fulness of our good and happiness, let's bring
him the <hi>branches of thick trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may do it better, remember this <hi>way</hi> is the way to the <hi>Cross,</hi>
this <hi>procession</hi> to his passion. This the <hi>way,</hi> his <hi>Cross</hi> and Passion the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
we are to receive him in. Let us readily strip our selves of all our
<hi>garments</hi> for him, who is stript presently of all his for us. Let us cover
him with <hi>Palms,</hi> and crown him with <hi>Olives;</hi> let us make it our business
and delight to be always <hi>strewing</hi> his way before him, to be doing all
our endeavours we can to entertain him. Let us leave no branch of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
out, spread them as thick as possibly upon this earth of ours, cover
our selves with them that we may be the way, our souls and bodies the
way for him.</p>
            <p>And now you see, I hope, how fit <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> is to usher in the <hi>Passion,</hi>
to precede the receiving <hi>Christ;</hi> the very <hi>Trees</hi> of the Wood have told
you it: I shall do no more, spread the <hi>boughs</hi> no further. 'Tis you now
must <hi>strew</hi> them, or I have but hitherto strewed in vain.</p>
            <p>The work is not to be done singly by the Preacher, 'tis the <hi>multitude</hi>
that is to do it too; 'tis to be done in publick, 'tis to be done in private,
'tis to be done by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> 'tis to be done by the people, 'tis to be
done by men, women, and children, old and young, poor and rich, all to
bear a part by the way if they hope to come to the happy end; every one
either to spread his <hi>garment,</hi> or strew a <hi>branch,</hi> or bring a sprig; some one
thing, some another, but all something to the honour of <hi>Christ;</hi> to do it
with much solemnity and respect, outward and inward all of it, as to
one that deserves all that we can do to strew our souls, to strew our bodies,
to fill our hands, to spread all our powers and affections to entertain him;
to strew our souls with <hi>Palms,</hi> and <hi>Olives, Pines,</hi> and <hi>Cedars, Myrtles,</hi> and
<hi>Willows,</hi> patience and meekness, uprightness and constancy, love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and all holy vertues, as thick, as full, as fair as may be; think
nothing too much, nothing enough to do or suffer in his service.</p>
            <p>Then shall our <hi>garments</hi> truly cover us, and keep us warm; then shall
our <hi>trees</hi> bring forth fruit, when <hi>boughs</hi> and <hi>garments</hi> are thus employed;
then shall our <hi>ways</hi> be strewed with peace, every one sit under his own
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57113:173"/>
vine, and drink the wine of it, then shall our <hi>branches</hi> cover the hills, and
stretch out unto the River. He that is the <hi>Branch</hi> in the <hi>Prophets</hi> stile, shall
so spread them for it, give us the <hi>tree of life</hi> for these liveless boughs, and
for the spreading our <hi>garments</hi> over him, spread his garment over us, the
<hi>robe of his righteousness,</hi> the garment of glory, where strewing our <hi>garments</hi>
and <hi>branches</hi> with this <hi>great multitude</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> we shall with that <hi>great
multitude</hi> in the <hi>Revelation, of all Nations, which no man can number, stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white garments, and palms
in our hands,</hi> singing and saying, <hi>Salvation unto our God, which sitteth upon
the Throne; and to the Lamb, Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving,
and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd this being Passion day, <hi>I am determined not to</hi> preach
<hi>any thing among you</hi> to day <hi>but Iesus Christ and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
I cannot preach any thing more seasonable, nor
you <hi>hear any thing</hi> more comfortable, nor any of us
<hi>know any thing</hi> more profitable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself thought
nor he nor his <hi>Corinthians</hi> could, <hi>determined</hi> so here <hi>ex Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threda.</hi>
And the Holy <hi>Church</hi> has thought and <hi>determined</hi>
so too; to send no other <hi>Epistles,</hi> to preach no other <hi>Gospels</hi> to us this week
thorow than of <hi>Iesus Christ and him crucified:</hi> as if the sum of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self, were nothing else; no other knowledge worth the
knowing, at least at this time, these days to be thought of or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Not but that we may lawfully have other knowledges besides, intend
other knowledges too at other times, in their proper times; not but that
we may know more of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself than his being crucified; but
that all the knowledges of him tend hither, <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Office clearest seen here, best determined hence; that all other
knowledges are to be directed hither, to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> are but petty and
inconsiderable in respect, and only worth the knowing when <hi>Christ</hi> is in
them, and we with Christ crucified in them, or affections mortified and
humbled by them; that especially at this time nothing is so fit to take up
our thoughts, to employ our meditations, nothing not of <hi>Christ</hi> himself,
no act or story of him as his <hi>crucifixion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>Text</hi> affords us a plainer reason and account of this so
<hi>determined knowledge</hi> from the two <hi>Pronouns, I</hi> and <hi>You.</hi> None so fit for this
<hi>I,</hi> for an <hi>Apostle,</hi> a Preacher, a Divine, to be <hi>determined</hi> to, to <hi>determine</hi>
from, to be <hi>determined</hi> by as <hi>Christ and him crucified;</hi> nothing so fit to fasten
his resolutions against the crosses and thwartings he is like to meet with
in the world, even among them he bestows and spends most upon, and
would be bestowed and spent himself for, as this <hi>Apostle</hi> for these <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57113:174"/>
2 Cor.</hi> xii. 15. as the consideration of the <hi>Cross of Christ.</hi> And no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
fitter for this <hi>You,</hi> for <hi>the Corinthians,</hi> people now divided into
Schisms and Factions, than to think of <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> rent and torn in
pieces by them, thus crucified again by them through their Divisions,
who was crucified to unite them, to bring all into one body, under one
head, by <hi>his body on the Cross,</hi> into himself the <hi>head Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there were at the time of this <hi>Epistle</hi> among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as there
are now among us, some that much boasted of their knowledge, as if
they alone knew all was to be known, more than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> made themselves heads of Factions and Schisms upon it,
and drew parties after them. In this indeed differing from the heads of
ours, that they vaunted of their Humane Learning, ours have nothing
but ignorance to boast of; they would have Faith reduced to Reason,
these rul'd by fancy; yet in this agreeing both, in their ignorance of the
<hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> or sure quite forgetting it, and making Schisms, and
sowing Heresies in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> though perhaps we could find
them some <hi>Socinianiz'd</hi> wits too, that would fain bring all to natural
reason, and really deny the very effects of the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and redemption, the very denying, in effect, <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> or any
knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>To beat down these great boasters, and all vain braggers, St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
upon two Points in the <hi>Text,</hi> a seeming ignorance, and a real
knowledge: A seeming ignorance to confound their seeming know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
a real knowledge to confound their real ignorance; not to <hi>know,</hi>
and but to <hi>know;</hi> not to know, that is, not to seem to know any thing;
yet to know, to know every thing that is worth the knowing, <hi>Iesus Christ
and him crucified,</hi> the whole way of salvation: So to teach us besides, and
all that should come after him, what to <hi>determine,</hi> and how to <hi>determine</hi>
both of our ignorances and knowledges; what not to <hi>know,</hi> things that
have no profit, but only breed strife and debate, Schisms and Divisions,
not to <hi>know</hi> such things among them, to do others hurt by our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
What to <hi>know, Iesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> that to be sure to know,
and <hi>nothing but him and it,</hi> and in order unto it or him; thus to <hi>determine</hi>
and be <hi>determined</hi> the only way to profit and benefit both our selves and
others at any time with our knowing and not knowing; to know what,
and how far to know, and not to know; what to determine of, and where
to be determined.</p>
            <p>Thus we have brought the <hi>Text</hi> to its own natural division, to hinder
our unnatural ones; St. <hi>Pauls</hi> double determination: One, for Ignorance,
the other, for Knowledge; one, <hi>not to know,</hi> the other, to <hi>know.</hi> A <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
too in a double sense, as well as a double Object. A double <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi>
about not knowing, and a double one about knowing. A <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination</hi>
to both, and a determination of each.</p>

                  <p>I. A Determination not to know, to seem ignorant, <hi>I am determined not
to know.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Determination of this not knowing, or seeming ignorant, it is
but seeming, only so determin'd or put on; 'tis but <hi>among you,</hi> 'tis
but in comparison of the following knowledge, which is the only
saving knowledge.</p>

               <item>
                  <p>II. A Determination to know, not to be really ignorant, though, <hi>not
any thing but,</hi> is something though not <hi>that</hi> those false Teachers
vaunted of.</p>
                  <p>A Determination or determining of this knowledge (1.) to <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:57113:174"/>
(2.) <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> (3.) <hi>Christ Iesus crucified;</hi> that, and nothing further,
now further, <hi>among them,</hi> nothing else to determine himself, or
them, or his, or their knowledges by at any time, nothing save that,
nothing saving but that.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Text</hi> determines both our knowledge, and ignorance, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
both, shall determine and limit our discourse. God grant we may
all so be determined by it, that both our ignorance and knowledge may
hence learn their bounds and limits, and all end at last in <hi>Iesus Christ and
him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> determination, <hi>not to know any thing among</hi> the
<hi>Corinthians;</hi> where we have (1.) the things he is determined not to
know; (2.) the not knowing them; (3.) the determination so to do;
(4.) the determining how far, and among whom, how, and where to be
ignorant, and not know them.</p>
            <p>And first, many things there are <hi>not to be known,</hi> of which 'tis good to
be ignorant. Some things that are not worth the knowing, light and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
things, which only rob us of those pretious minutes which a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
should spend upon nobler thoughts.</p>
            <p>Some things we are the worse for knowing; which only infect the
soul, and instead of knowledge bring blindness and ignorance upon it,
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> unhappy knowledge, when we will needs be knowing
more than God will have us, curious and vain Arts and Sciences, of
which 'tis far better, with those in the <hi>Acts,</hi> to burn the books than read
them.</p>
            <p>Some things we can scarce do worse than know them, whose very
knowledge is a guilt whereby we are perfected in wickedness, grow
cunning in contriving, subtle in conveying, experienced in managing sin
or mischief.</p>
            <p>Some things again there are which it is best <hi>not to know,</hi> sins from which
the safest fence is ignorance, whose knowledge would but teach us to do
them, or leave in us a desire and itching after them, <hi>nitimur in vetitum;</hi>
sins which else perhaps we had never thought of or attempted, the not
knowing of which had kept us safe, because we cannot desire things we
know not.</p>
            <p>Some things there are again, which though good and commendable,
yet of which we may say, and say truly, 'tis very pleasant and useful too
<hi>not to know</hi> in time and place; and such is this <hi>any thing</hi> of the <hi>Apostles;</hi>
Humane Learning and Sciences, Natural Reason and Artificial Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Tongues and Languages, Disputes and Questions, whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a real ignorance, sometimes a seeming one will do more good than
all of them together.</p>
            <p>For diversity there is in the <hi>not knowing</hi> as well as in the things <hi>not to be
known;</hi> many ways of <hi>not knowing.</hi> For <hi>not to know,</hi> is (1.) really to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
which in good matters, if it be not voluntary or affected, but
either by reason of a natural dulness or incapacity, or for want of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which we could not have, or because we had not the means or
time to come to the knowledge of it; or if we were not bound <hi>to know</hi>
it, is no sin, may not only excuse from punishment, but from fault.
Thus the poor simple man, that knows not a letter, nor understands half
what others do, not the tenth part that others do, may know enough of
<hi>Christ crucified</hi> to bring him into heaven, when many that are more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shall stand without. But this ignorance, for the most part of it, must
not be <hi>determined</hi> by us; we must not, the meanest of us, resolve and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57113:175"/>
               <hi>determine</hi> with our selves to be ignorant, or remain so in any spiritual or
heavenly business, but <hi>to know</hi> as far as our condition requires, or will
give us leave. Yet in meer humane knowledges even a resolved igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
may do well, when your knowing would take up more time than it
is worth, when it would rob us of better, or hinder us in the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
improvements of our souls, when there is just fear it will but
make us insolent or impertinent; better far <hi>not to know</hi> a Letter, not to
speak a Tongue, but what the Nurse and Mother taught us, than be
the nimblest <hi>Orator,</hi> or skilfullest <hi>Linguist,</hi> or rarest <hi>Philosopher,</hi> if nothing
be like to come of it but the disturbance of the <hi>Church,</hi> the seducing others,
and vain glory in our selves. In this case we may, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even
<hi>determine</hi> to be ignorant, more ignorant still, especially in unprofitable,
curious, or impious knowledge, or ways of knowing.</p>
            <p>However, even in the best and most necessary of these it may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<hi>not to know</hi> in a second sense; that is, not to seem to know them, to
bear our selves sometimes as if we did not. There are some we may
have to deal with that are suspicious of being deceived by too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> with whom 'tis the only way to work, to renounce, as it
were, all Art, and <hi>Logick,</hi> and discourse, as if we were wholly ignorant in
them, that we may so by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> own way, of becoming all things to
all men, to the ignorant as ignorant, of every thing but salvation, by plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and condescension to their humour win them to the truth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
where ever <hi>Eloquence, Language, Philosophy,</hi> or natural reason are like
more to lose than gain a soul, more to vaunt themselves than preach
<hi>Christ; not to know,</hi> that is, to seem <hi>not to know</hi> them, or deal by them,
or build upon them, or make shew of them, but conceal them is the
best.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not to know</hi> them in a third sense is not to teach them, not to teach
them when we should be teaching <hi>Christ,</hi> or teach them instead of <hi>Christ,</hi>
Natural Reason for Divine Faith, Moral Philosophy for the only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not to know</hi> them, fourthly, to profess and make our whole business of
them, to make knowledge our whole profession, as if Religion consisted
knowing only, and they the best Christians that knew most. Alas, <hi>Nos Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinis
nostris trudimur in infernum</hi> is too true: <hi>Many a learned man is thrust at
lest into hell with all his knowledge.</hi> We may <hi>speak with the tongues of Angels,</hi>
and <hi>have all knowledge, all faith</hi> too, even to a <hi>miracle,</hi> and to do miracles,
and yet for all that be <hi>but sounding brass and tinckling Cymbals,</hi> meer noise
and vapour, not so good as the <hi>Prophets reprobate Silver,</hi> but meer Brass
and Copper, that will not pass with heaven for currant money, nor
be received into the Treasuries of God, better it is <hi>not to know</hi> at all,
than to know only and no more, to know and not do, we shall only get
the more stripes by the bargain; and hovvever vve seem to knovv God,
not to be knovvn of him, or acknovvledged by him, but sent avvay by
Christ vvith an <hi>I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things then not to be knovvn, and the not knovving being things
of so difficult or doubtful nature, best it is novv that vve determine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of them, that vve may knovv both the things, and knovvledge,
or rather not knovvledge that is fittest for us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>any thing</hi> the Apostle means, expresly is set dovvn in the former
verse under the terms of <hi>excellency of speech</hi> or <hi>wisdom;</hi> and that vvisdom,

            <p>And this is the very determining our determination I spake of for a
fourth consideration. I shall set no other bounds either to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or object, or our determining our selves to it, or in it, than what
we have within the bounds of the <hi>Text,</hi> because my determination is to
hasten to the knowledge of <hi>Iesus Christ and him Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>determine</hi> then this determination of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>not to know any
thing,</hi> take we the words as they lie, and consider who it is that has thus
<hi>determined. I,</hi> it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself it is, an <hi>Apostle,</hi> and a great
knowing one too. Yet <hi>I have determined</hi> not to know. <hi>Sciences</hi> there are
that are below an <hi>Apostle,</hi> that become not him whatever they do others.
The <hi>Apostles</hi> were to act all by the power of the Spirit, were not to study
words and humane arguments, though we sometimes find them disputing
too, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 8. and quoting <hi>Poets</hi> and humane Authors, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 28.
were not to pretend to such worldly wisdom, that the glory might be
wholly Gods, and the whole world convinc'd, that as the Christian Faith
was not stablished by mortal strength, nor setled by worldly power, so it
was not perswaded by humane wit or interests, and was therefore truly
divine and heavenly.</p>
            <p>But (2.) even the successors of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the Ministers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
(though they have now only this ordinary way of enabling them to their
office) are yet so to use their knowledge, as if they us'd them not, their
chief work being <hi>Christs,</hi> and these only as ways to it, remembring their
great business to be <hi>to know Christ Crucified,</hi> and to teach him, and not to
know any thing but in order to it, at least not to profess any thing above
or equal with it, that may swallow up the time, which ought to be spent
in divine employments. Thus this not knowing is first determined by the
person: Persons wholly interessed in the business of Heaven, not to turn
their studies into a business of the world, persons design'd to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
office, not to deal in it by extraordinary means, but guide all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that rule, and way, and work that God has set them.</p>
            <p>But the not knowing the secular Sciences, is not only limited to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
persons; there are limits within which all must keep as well their
ignorance as knowledge. When at any time they will determine not
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57113:176"/>
to know it must be (1.) by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by judgment and discretion, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously:
such things as sound judgment propounds unnecessary, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
or unfruitful.</p>
            <p>It must be (2.) by a <hi>non judicavi quicquam,</hi> whatsoever knowledge we
have of humane Sciences, we must judge and reckon it as nothing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it to be no or her than dross and dung, than building with hay
and stuble in respect of the knowledge of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> not any thing to
that.</p>
            <p>It must be (3.) too without putting any estimate upon our selves for
any such knowledge; we must still think we know nothing whilst we
know no more. <hi>Moses</hi> a man, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> stiles him, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 22.
<hi>mighty in words, and deeds, and learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians;</hi> yet
when God would send him of his errand, considering that, tells God he
was not eloquent, neither heretofore nor since he had spoken to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
but slow of speech, and slow of tongue. And <hi>Isaiah</hi> that <hi>Seraphick
Prophet</hi> cries out, he is a <hi>man of unclean lips,</hi> Isa. vi. 5. so little valued they
all their knowledge, when they had but a glimpse of that great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God was now imparting to them. How much soever we think, we
know before, when we once come to the knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> or but our
thoughts to come to know a taste of <hi>the riches of the fulness of the knowledge
of Christ,</hi> we then know we know nothing, count our selves dolts and
ideots, meer fools and blocks for squandering away so much time, and
cost, and pains, upon those empty notions whereby we are not an inch
the nearer Heaven, and it may be the further from God, after all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Then only we begin truly to know, when we can pass this sentence
upon our selves, that we know not any thing; when we are so humble
that we think so, at least think not any thing of our selves for all we
know.</p>
            <p>4. We must <hi>determine not to know any thing</hi> at all of humane Sciences or
natural reasonings, rather than to determine our selves by it, renounce
it rather, all knowing, and turn all to believing; not fix our faith upon
natural principles, or believe no further than we can know; rather than
so, we had far better know nothing, set it up for a resolution however
in the matters of faith not to know, that is, not to go about to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them by reason: for the natural man he understands them not, <hi>ver.</hi>
14. they are foolishness unto him, a foolish thing to him to talk of a
God Incarnate, of a Crucified Saviour, of a Religion whose glory is the
Cross, and reward he knows not where nor when.</p>
            <p>Or (5.) he is only <hi>not determined to know any thing;</hi> so the <hi>negative</hi> is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyn'd, not to his knowledge, but to his determination, <hi>not determined:</hi>
if he know it he counts it but by the by, his main business is something
else, humane knowledge is but by the way and <hi>obiter,</hi> he intends them
not for his doctrine, nor yet to prove or stablish his doctrine upon them,
as upon foundations, nor pearch moral and natural <hi>Philosophy</hi> for Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but to advance both the one and the other: all <hi>Philology, Language</hi>
and <hi>History</hi> to the Service of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the glory of his <hi>Cross,</hi> to use our
<hi>Rhetorick</hi> to set forth his sufferings, the merit, and benefit, and glory of
them: our natural <hi>Philosophy</hi> to find us out the God of Nature in all his
works: moral <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>History</hi> to disswade Vice, and encourage Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
even by the light of nature, the knowledge of the Heavens and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spirits to declare his excellent and wondrous works, our <hi>Criticisms</hi> to
sift out truth, and our <hi>Languages</hi> to express it: in a word, not so much to
know any of them, as God through them; not them properly, but <hi>Christ
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57113:176"/>
Iesus</hi> by them. There is no fear of humane Sciences thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>Yet there is one way more to determine our not knowng by, by the
persons with whom we have to do. Our Doctrines, (for so we told you,
and for the chief meaning here we tell you now again, to know here sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
to teach) our Doctrines are to be proportioned and fitted for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory:
It was no meaner a mans practice than St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to the weak to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as weak, to gain the weak; to the weak and simple not to speak
mysteries and speculations; to them that were without Law, as without
Law, plain honest dealing, not quirks and quillets, to gain such; not
to know any such thing among such as they. Yet sometimes upon the
same ground to do quite contrary, to confound the wisdom of the world,
by that which that counts foolishness; the strength of the world by that
it reckons weakness; the honourable things of the world by things which
that esteems base and ignominious. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> gloried in their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and eloquence; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to confute their vanity, undertakes to do
more by plainness and rudeness of speech and ignorance, than they all of
them can by all their wisdom and rhetorick: among them he will make
no use of any thing but the contemptible knowledge of the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi>
and yet do more then all their <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Orators.</hi> Where Learning
will serve but to ostentation, and the ear only tickled by it, or humane
applause not edification, Schism not peace, the issue of it; among them
<hi>not to know any</hi> such <hi>thing</hi> is best of all; for <hi>let all things be done,</hi> says the
<hi>Apostle, to edification,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 26. and if that will be done best
by plainness, to use plainness; if by learning, to use that; as the <hi>you</hi> are
that are to be edified, so the <hi>I,</hi> the Minister to deal with them; if they
be puft up with humane knowledge to humble them to the <hi>Abc</hi> of the
<hi>Cross,</hi> to exalt and preach up that above all knowledge whatsoever, if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into Schisms by the several Sects of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> or the Masters of
them, to unite all again into one, as so many pieces into one <hi>Cross,</hi> among
them to cry up no knowledge but thence, or thither.</p>
            <p>So then now to sanctifie all our secular knowledges and ignorances,
thus we are to determine them, to know our times, and place, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for them, to keep measure and order in them, to profess none that
are wicked, or only vain and curious, and to no profit, to submit our
knowledge to faith, and our determination to the <hi>Churches,</hi> not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
them, or our selves by them, but only make them hand-maids to
guide us to the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> and there with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the
good women stand weeping at it; <hi>not to know any</hi> of them otherwise, to
resolve and determine nothing <hi>of Christ</hi> by them, and <hi>not to know</hi> them
where they will know no submission and order. I come now to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and 'tis indeed the only saving one, <hi>Iesus Christ, and him crucified;</hi>
nothing save that, nothing to that.</p>
            <p>For you may now take notice, that it is not an absolute determination
not to know, a decree for ignorance, but a determination with a But, <hi>not
any thing save,</hi> then save something, something to be known still. Some
have been blam'd for making Ignorance the mother of Devotion, yet
themselves that blam'd them have advanc'd it to be the mother of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
now whilst they set up meer ignorants, I might say more, to be the
<hi>Apostles</hi> of it: fit teachers I confess of their Religion, which so much
abhors the <hi>Cross of Christ,</hi> as to cast it off their own shoulders upon other
mens, and the <hi>name of Iesus,</hi> as to reckon it superstition to respect it.</p>
            <p>But this great <hi>Preacher</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi> as much as he seems <hi>determined not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57113:177"/>
to know,</hi> had yet <hi>languages</hi> more than all these <hi>Corinthians</hi> he writes to,
tells them of it too, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 18. though he will not boast of it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
even in <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the <hi>Synagogue of the Iews,</hi> Acts xix. 8. and in
the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ver. 9. quotes Heathen <hi>Poets</hi> too to the men of
<hi>Athens, Acts</hi> xvii. 28. and to <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> i. 12. that we may know that the
preachers of the <hi>Gospel</hi> may read other Books besides the Bible, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
read that to understand it if they do not. 'Tis only in some cases,
and with some persons we are not to make profession of them, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too upon private determination, as our own wisdom and prudence
shall direct us; not that <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> has determined the least against it.
God would have his people to seek his Law at the mouth of the <hi>Priest,
Malachy</hi> ii. 7. and adds the reasons, because <hi>his lips should keep knowledge.</hi>
And <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> though he made poor simple Fishermen his <hi>Apostles</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
his <hi>Gospel,</hi> yet he would not have the blind lead the blind, for fear
of falling both into the ditch, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xv. 14. and therefore promises
to give them wisdom, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 15. such wisdom as all their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
should not be able to gain-say, and sends down the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> with
the gifts of tongues to sit upon them all; so little is there to be said for
the ignorant and unlearned mans teaching from them, who before they
went about that work were so highly furnished and endued. And though
the <hi>Apostle</hi> here resolve the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to make no profession of those
great knowledges; yet it is to shame them only from the great estimate
and confidence they set upon them, and reduce them to humility, and
into order, and to edifie them, that he chooses and prefers to speak among
them <hi>but five words in a known tongue,</hi> before all languages to no purpose.</p>
            <p>And indeed all tongues are too little, to speak of that the <hi>Apostle</hi> is
here about, <hi>Iesus Christ, and him crucified;</hi> all knowledges not sufficient to
make us know him, and teach him as we should. We had need have all
tongues and knowledges, all words and eloquence to set it forth.</p>
            <p>Well then, at least let us about it, to see what it is <hi>to know Iesus Christ,
and him crucified.</hi> 'Tis the determination of this determined knowledge,
<hi>to Christ, to Christ Iesus, to Christ Iesus crucified,</hi> to this only and no other
object among them.</p>
            <p>A knowledge this the most profitable, the most happy, the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
even eternal life it is <hi>to know Iesus Christ,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xvii. 3. Nor does
his Crucifying abate any thing of the glory of it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it his
only glory, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 14. with a <hi>God forbid that he should glory in any thing,</hi> as
here <hi>not know any thing</hi> else, <hi>but in the Cross of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Indeed
hence flows all our happiness, the wound in his side is the hole of the rock
in which only the soul can lie secure; the water that issued out thence
is the only laver to cleanse it in; the blood the only drink it lives by;
the wood of the <hi>Cross</hi> the only tree of life; the title of it better to us
than all the titles of the earth; the reproach of it better than all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the world; the pains of it sweeter than all the pleasures under
heaven; the wounds better cordials and restoratives to a sick soul, than
all the Physick nature or skill affords. There is not a grain of that
<hi>holywood,</hi> but of more worth than all the grains of Gold that the <hi>Indies</hi>
can afford. There is not a vain in that crucified Body of <hi>Iesus</hi> but it
runs full with heavenly comfort to us. There is nothing in <hi>Christ crucified,</hi>
but man glorified. Who indeed would not be determined to fix all
his knowledge here, to dwell here for ever! but so immense and vast is
this happy subject, that I must limit it; yet I shall give you notions that
you may improve, whilst I tell you <hi>to know Christ crucified,</hi> is to know him
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:57113:177"/>
as we do other things by the four causes of it: the <hi>efficient,</hi> the <hi>material,</hi>
the <hi>formal,</hi> and the <hi>final.</hi> So to know him is to know who crucified him,
for what he was crucified, how it was he was crucified, and to what end
he was crucified.</p>
            <p>It was his own love that mov'd him to it, it was God that sent him
and delivered him up to it, it was <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed him to it, it was
both the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that had the hand in doing it: And what know
we hence but this, his infinite goodness, Gods unspeakable mercies,
mans base ingratitude, this <hi>mystery</hi> in all, how vastly Gods purposes and
mans differ in the same business, how infinitely good and gracious God
is, even where men are most wicked and unthankful.</p>
            <p>Know we then the <hi>material</hi> cause of his sufferings for a second, and the
matter for which he suffer'd was our iniquities, <hi>for the transgressions of my
people,</hi> says the <hi>Prophet, was he smitten,</hi> Isa. liii. 8. And to know this is to
deplore it, to abhor and detest our selves, who were the causes of so vile
using the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Know we (3.) and consider the formal cause, the manner of his cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a death most cruel, most lingring, most ignominious, to have his
back all furrowed with whips and rods, to hang naked upon the <hi>Cross,</hi>
by the hands and feet, and them nailed to it through the most tender
parts, where all the organs of sense are quickest; to be given vinegar
and gall to drink when he most needed comfort, and refreshment; to be
mockt and scofft at in his sorrow too, derided by his enemies, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by his friends as he hung; to have the weight of all the sins of all
mankind upon him; to have God as it were leave him to struggle under
them without the least glimmering of his presence; to see in his soul all
the horrors of all the sins of men; to feel in his body all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that a body so delicate beyond the bodies of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> by
reason of its perfection, must needs feel beyond all others, and groan and
die under the fury of an angry God, now visiting for all the iniquity that
were before or after, should be committed by the world. To know all this,
and by this, no sorrows like his sorrows, is at least to sit down and weep
at it; however not to pass by regardless of it.</p>
            <p>And know we (4.) the end why all this was, even to redeem us from
all our sins, or as it is in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before this, <hi>ver. 30. That he might be
made unto us, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that
by his blood we might have entrance into the holy of holies,</hi> into Heaven it self,
<hi>Heb.</hi> x. 19.</p>
            <p>This you all know, as well as I, every one will say he knows it all. Yet
I must tell you, you do not know it as you should, if you sit not down
and sometimes determine your thoughts upon it, unless you sadly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and thankfully think upon it, unless you value the meditations
and discourses of it above all other thoughts, all other talk, unless you
set by other business ever and anon to contemplate this. To know in
Christianity is to do more than fill the brain with Scripture notions, 'tis
to fill the heart too with devout affections: therefore we read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of an understanding heart, and wisdom is said in the holy phrase to
be seated there. And when the heart evaporates it self into holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and desires Christ, then we are only said to know him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>to know Christ Iesus crucified,</hi> is more than so; 'tis in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>to be crucified with him,</hi> Gal. vi. 14. to <hi>take up our cross and follow him,</hi>
to make profession of him, though we be sure to come to execution by
it, to go with him as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> exhorts, though we die with him, to be
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57113:178"/>
willing to suffer any thing for him, to deny our own wisdom and repute,
and our selves for his service, to be content to be counted fools for his
sake, our very wisdom and preaching, foolishness, if we may save any
by it, to count all as nothing, so we may know him, and be known of
him.</p>
            <p>We cannot think much sure to be crucified with him, who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
only for us, to suffer something for him, who suffered all for us, if
we but know and consider who it was was crucified, and for whom he
was so, the Son of God for the Sons of men, the most innocent for the
greatest sinners, the most holy for the most wicked, for such who even
deny him after all he has done for them,</p>
            <p>This speak we, this preach we, this profess we, this determine we up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to know, to think, to speak, to teach, to preach, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this, and nothing else; ever crying out to him with that good old
<hi>Father, Deus mens &amp; omnia, Deus meus &amp; omnia, This crucified Iesus is my God and
all, this Christ</hi> crucified <hi>is my God and all;</hi> all my thoughts, all my hearts,
all my knowledge, all my profession; he is all in all, I know nothing else,
I value nothing else, I know him though never so disfigured by his
wound, I will acknowledge him though in the midst of the Thieves, I
am not ashamed of him, though full of spittle and reproach, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
him though all run from him: alas, I know not any thing worth
knowing if they take him away.</p>
            <p>And yet to know him has one degree more: when our understanding
knows any thing it does, says the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> become the same with it.
So to know <hi>Christ</hi> then is to become like him, to know <hi>Christ</hi> to be
anointed, is to be anointed like him also with holy graces: to know him
<hi>Iesus</hi> a Saviour, is to be a Saviour to the poor and needy, to deliver the
widow and fatherless from the hand of the oppressor: to know him to
be <hi>crucified</hi> is to crucifie our affections and lusts. Thus we know him as he
is here, and by so knowing him here, we shall at last come to know him
hereafter; where we shall know him perfectly, know him glorified for
here knowing him crucified, and all things then with him, for now not
knowing any thing but him, know God, and happiness, and eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and our selves partakers in them all.</p>

                  <p>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth,
they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>

wherein this great <hi>perplexity</hi> both rose and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
It rose from the not-seeing the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in the Grave, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. It was resolved by the
hearing here, <hi>he</hi> was <hi>risen</hi> thence.</p>
            <p>Thus rise the greatest perplexities still, and thus
they are resolved. From the miss of <hi>Christ;</hi> which
way soever, truly or falsly, conceived by us, they
come, and at the very hearing of him again they
vanish. To be sure, they stay not at all after he <hi>is risen,</hi> and we hear it;
and God will not let it be long before we hear it; he will not suffer those
to be long perplext that seek <hi>Christ</hi> heartily, affectionately, and devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though with some error in their heads, as here poor souls they had, if
they have no wickedness in their hearts, and Spices and Ointments, good
Works and Charity in their hands. Some Angel or other shall be sent to

says the whole Choir, He whose rising is all your risings, who is your
Saviour now compleat, and the lifter up of all your heads, and go but
into <hi>Galilee</hi> and you shall see him.</p>
            <p>But this only hearing of him must for this time content us, <hi>we shall</hi> one
day <hi>see him as he is;</hi> till then if we hear of him with our ears, and feel
him in our hearts, and see him in our conceits; if so hear as to believe
him risen, and our hearts listen to it (for the heart has two ears as
well as the head, nature has given to it such a form as has been observed
in the dissections, to teach us, that our hearts within us, as well as our
ears without us, are to give ear to him that made, to him that saves 'um)
if they do, we need not be the least perplexed for not visibly seeing him.
All believers that then were did not see him so; five hundred indeed we
read of all at once, but they were not all that were then believers; <hi>Not
to all,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly, <hi>but unto witnesses chosen before of God, Acts</hi> x. 41.
There is a blessedness, and it seems, by the manner of speaking,
somewhat greater, for them <hi>that have not seen and yet have believed,</hi>
St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xx. 29.</p>
            <p>Be we then content to <hi>day</hi> to hear that he <hi>is risen,</hi> with the first news
and tidings of it. From a good mouth it comes, to good souls it comes,
in good time it comes. From the mouths of Angels to good women, and
very seasonably, when they were <hi>much perplexed,</hi> much <hi>afraid,</hi> and much
cast down for want of such a message. And though we cannot here see
<hi>Christ</hi> as we desire, yet be we pleas'd to see our selves, our own sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
upon the loss of him in these womens perplexities, fears, and
down-cast looks: our way to seek him, humbly with our faces down as
not worthy to look up, reverently with fear and trembling as afraid to
miss him, solicitously much perplex'd to want him, as they were in the
<hi>Text.</hi> And that we may not give up our hope, be afraid, or cast down
for ever, look we upon the bright <hi>shining garments</hi> of the two <hi>Angels</hi> here
(for these <hi>men</hi> are no less) 'tis a joyful sight, and rejoyce at the good
success that always follows them that so seek him, Angels and good
news. The women found it here, heard the good news from the <hi>Angels</hi>
lips. You must be content to hear it from mine, yet you know who says
it, <hi>Angelus Domini exercituum est,</hi> the Priest is the Angel, or Messenger,
that's enough, of the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> too much for me poor sinful wretch;
But look not upon me, but upon them that here first told the news, and
see in the <hi>Text</hi> these three Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>I. The sad condition for a while of those that either are without, or
cannot find their <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> in three Particulars: They are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,</hi>
they are <hi>afraid, they bow down their faces to the earth,</hi> they go
all the while with down-cast looks.</item>
                  <item>II. The only ready way to find him after a while; by being here <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed</hi>
for his loss and absence, by being <hi>afraid</hi> to miss him, by
looking every where up and down to find him, or nevvs of him;
going poring up and dovvn, looking vvhere vve lookt before, and
casting <hi>down,</hi> not our <hi>faces,</hi> but our selves also <hi>to the earth</hi> in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to search after him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:57113:179"/>III. The good success at last of them that thus diligently, reverently,
and humbly seek him in three points more: to see Angels, to be
directed right, and be made partakers of the joyful news of a
Resurrection, of Christs Resurrection by them, who is both the
ground of ours, and the first fruits of them that rise.</item>
                  <item>The sum of all is this, That though it sometimes fall out to us that
we lose <hi>Christ,</hi> or cannot find him for a while, and so fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities
and fears, and go up and down dejected with down-cast
looks, yet if we so seek him with a solicitous love, a reverent fear, and
humble diligence, we shall meet Angels after a while to comfort us
and bring us news of our beloved <hi>Lord,</hi> and find him risen or rising
in us ere we are aware. And the close of all will be our duty, and
the duty of the <hi>day,</hi> (1.) to make our selves sensible of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
and sad estate of those that are without <hi>Christ,</hi> who have lost
him in the Grave, or know not where he is, or how to find him,
and thereupon (2.) so set our selves to seek him that we may
be sure at last to hear of him, and be made partakers of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a glad <hi>day,</hi> I confess, yet I begin with the gloomy morn that
seem'd to usher it in to these poor women, their sadness upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
loss of their dear <hi>Lord,</hi> truly representing to us the sad condition
of those who are deprived of <hi>Christ,</hi> or think they are so. The glory of
the <hi>day</hi> will appear brighter by this morning cloud; the news of the
Resurrection will be the welcomer when we first see what poor, troubled,
frighted, dejected pieces we are without it, we will have the higher
thoughts of him, now risen, when we feel how disconsolate a thing it
is to be without him, even without his body here though dead and
buried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it came to pass,</hi> says the <hi>Text, that they were perplexed thereabout;</hi> and it
will quickly come to pass that the best of us all will be perplexed to lose
any thing of our <hi>Lords,</hi> much more his body, if we love him. They
were good souls, such whose devotion and affection death it self could
neither quench nor alter that were so here, that we might know even
devout and pious souls may both err concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and sometimes
want him too; seek him sometimes, vvith these here, vvhere he is not,
vvhere vve falsly imagine him to be, and not find him presently neither
vvhen vve look him vvhere vve left him.</p>
            <p>No vvonder, they here, poor vvomen, vvere so perplext. Men, the
great St. <hi>Peter,</hi> knevv not vvhat to say to it, <hi>ver. 12. departed wondring.</hi>
Indeed, it seems a vvonder at the first, that such vvho love Christ so
dearly, seek him so early, should yet miss of him; that such too should
be in so great an error about him, as to think the <hi>Lord of life</hi> could be
held in death; but so poor a thing is man, that, as such, he is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
subject to error and mistake, and may thereupon easily lose the sight
and presence of his <hi>Lord.</hi> The Spouse, in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> complains, her <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
had withdrawn himself, and was gone,</hi> she <hi>sought him, but could not find
him,</hi> she <hi>called to him, but he gave her no answer,</hi> Cant. v. 6. and thereupon
tells the Daughters of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> ver. 8. that she is sick of love; that is,
so perplext and troubled at his absence that she is not able to hold up her
head any longer, no more than these are here.</p>
            <p>Nothing certainly but doubts and perplexities can involve us vvhen
vve have either lost our love, or fear it; to be sure, nothing but doubts
vvhen vve have lost him vvho is the only truth that can resolve us;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57113:180"/>
nothing but perplext ways when we have lost him who is the Way.
Which way can we resolve on when our way is gone? What can we
think can hold him whom the Grave cannot? If in a seal'd Sepulchre
under a mighty stone the dead body be not safe, where can we think to sit
down in security?</p>
            <p>To lose a token or remembrance of a friends how are we troubled! but
to have his body stoll'n out of the Sepulchre, his Grave rifled, and his
ashes violated, how impatiently would we take it? You cannot blame
them for being much perplext for so great a loss.</p>
            <p>I shall shew it greater in the <hi>Mystery. The body is the Church,</hi> and to have
that taken from us, the <hi>Church,</hi> that glorious <hi>Candlestick,</hi> removed, and
born away we know not whither, what good soul is there that must not
necessarily be perplexed at it? What way shall we take when they have
taken away that which is the Pillar of the truth, and should lead us in it?
Whither shall we go when we know not whither that is gone, where
they have laid it, or where to find it? Poor ignorant women, nay, and
men too may well now wander in uncertainties (as they do) full of
doubts and perplexities, full of cares and troubled thoughts which way
to take, what Religion to run to, what to leave, and what to follow,
seeing the body to which the Eagles use to flock, the most Eagle-eyed,
the most subtile and learned used to be gathered, is removed away, and
we have nothing to gather to, scarce a place to be gathered together in.
Well may we now fear (2.) what will become of us, and what God
means to do to us, how he intends to deal with us, having thus suffered
our Lord to be taken from us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afraid</hi> they were, that they had lost him quite. I pray God we may
have no cause to fear the same fear. When <hi>Christ</hi> was but asleep the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
were afraid at a blast of wind that rose, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> viii. 25. and cry out
they perish whilst he but sleeps. Any thing scares us if <hi>Christ</hi> watch not
over us; not the visions only of the night, but the very noises of the
day, any light air or report afrights us, and blows us which way it
please, to any side, any faction out of fear. What hold then is there of
us, what little thing will not scare us when he is absent quite? When
his body the <hi>Church</hi> is removed from us, where can we stay our wavering
souls, or fix our trembling feet? <hi>Christ</hi> was no sooner dead and gone but
away run all his <hi>Disciples</hi> into a room together, and shut up themselves
for fear of the <hi>Iews,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xx. 19. so coward-like and faint-hearted
are we all when <hi>the Captain of our Salvation</hi> is slain before us; nor can
it be other, all <hi>our life</hi> being <hi>hid in him,</hi> and all our spirit only from his
presence.</p>
            <p>Part of these womens fear, at least, was at the sight and congress of
the <hi>Angels.</hi> Even <hi>Angels</hi> themselves do but scare us if the <hi>Lord</hi> of the
<hi>Angels</hi> be not by us. Nay, even <hi>God</hi> himself <hi>is</hi> but a terror to us, and <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire</hi> without <hi>Christ;</hi> 'tis with him only under the shadow and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his wings that we dare approach that inaccessible light, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
fire. Lose we <hi>Christ</hi> and we lose all our confidence in heaven, all
the ways of access to heavenly things, all the pleasure and comfort of
them; we are nothing but agues, and fears, and frights, not courage
enough even to look up; we with these perplexed souls go (3.) bowing
down our faces to the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou didst hide thy face from me,</hi> says holy <hi>David, and I was troubled;</hi> the
very hiding of Gods face sore troubled him; What think you to hide
his whole body would do then? Why; then he goes <hi>mourning all the day
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57113:180"/>
long, Psal.</hi> xxxviii. 6. So did the two <hi>Disciples</hi> that went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> ver. 17.
they walkt sadly, and talkt sadly, and lookt sadly, like men disconsolate
and forlorn, such as were ashamed to shew their faces in the City, after
this was come to pass; durst not look any body in the face upon it. Alas!
how could it be otherwise with them? All their hope was gone, he that
they lookt should have redeemed <hi>Israel</hi> could not redeem himself; nay, his
body stoln out of the Grave, and conveyed they knew not whither.
Well may they bow down their faces to the earth having now little hope
above in heaven, he being gone and lost by whom they only hoped and
expected it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if he be either so gone from us, that we have no hope to find
him, or he be found in that condition in which there is no hope, (as there
is none in a dead Saviour, where ere he be) no wonder if our faces then
bend wholly to the earth, if we look no further. Let us take our portion
in this life, for we are like to have no other: without <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ
risen</hi> too, hither it is we fall, no looking higher, not an eye to heaven, so
much as in a Prayer, if we have not <hi>per Dominum Iesum, Christ Iesus</hi> at
the end of it; in and thorough whom only we can with confidence look
for a blessing thence, and without whom at the end, the Prayer is to no
end or purpose.</p>
            <p>II. Yet in as sad a Condition as this we speak of, we are not utterly
without hope if we again look upon the words at a second view. For now
(2.) they as well decipher to us the condition of those that seek as of
those that have lost their <hi>Lord and Master.</hi> We may be as much <hi>perplext</hi> in
our search as at our loss, as vvell <hi>afraid</hi> to miss, as startled at our loss, as
vvell <hi>bowdown</hi> our <hi>faces to the earth</hi> in seeking as in sorrovving. And thus in
the second vievv of the <hi>Text</hi> it is.</p>
            <p>They had lost their <hi>Masters body,</hi> and vvere now not only troubled at
the loss, but hovv to find it, vvhere to look it. Surely, take but avvay his
<hi>body</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and the vvisest of us vvill scarce know to find him; one
vvill run this vvay, another that vvay after him; one vvill stand vveep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sepulchre, and think that a sad melancholy posture and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is Religion only; another vvill run thence from the Sepulchre as
fast as he can, and think the finding <hi>Christ</hi> so easie a business that it does
not require either a groan or a sigh; others vvill be vvalking to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
up and dovvn, novv to one Sect, novv to another, and from <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
most commonly, from the City of peace, out of the bonds of unity, every
one by himself, vvhich vvay pleases him, if <hi>Christs body,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> be
once removed out of our sight. Our best vvay is, vvith the <hi>Disciples,</hi>
into our Chambers altogether, till vve can get a better place, vvith all
the company vve can make, to our Devotions and our Prayers; or if vve
vvill step out a vvhile to the Sepulchre, let it be but to pay a tear upon it,
to vent out troubled souls, to express hovv vve are troubled at our sins
that have made us lose our <hi>Lord;</hi> or at our negligence, that he is slipt
from us vvhilst vve vvere asleep, lull'd in soft pleasures; or at our slovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that vve come so late to seek him that he is gone before vve come.
This is so to seek as to be <hi>perplexed thereabout,</hi> and there is no true seeking
him vvithout it.</p>
            <p>But (2.) vvith fear too vve are to seek him; <hi>with reverence and godly
fear,</hi> Heb. xii. 28. that the only acceptable service and seeking of him
<hi>with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. ii. 2. no hope either of Saviour or Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without it. <hi>Afraid</hi> of the <hi>two men in shining garments</hi> they were here:
and if <hi>Angels,</hi> habited like men too, and in so chearful attire be so
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57113:181"/>
terrible, vvhat think you is that <hi>excellent Majesty?</hi> if vve cannot see those
our fellovv servants, as they stile themselves, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 9. vvithout fear
(for vve seldom read of the appearing of an <hi>Angel,</hi> but either coming or
going he strikes some terror) hovv say some among us, that in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to God vve need not be afraid? Alas, deluded souls! they
conceive not God, or <hi>Christ,</hi> as either of them should be conceived; they
neither seriously consider the <hi>Majesty</hi> of God or <hi>Christ,</hi> nor their ovvn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthiness,
nor hovv hard a thing it is to find <hi>Christ,</hi> that are not afraid
either to miss him in the search, by their unskilfulness, or lose him by
their sins. He that looks to be comforted by an Angel, must not think
much to be afraid, hovv great a claim soever he conceives he hath in
<hi>Christ. Perfect love</hi> indeed says the <hi>Apostle, casts out fear,</hi> but 'tis servile
fear and no other. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to vvhom <hi>Christ</hi> bears vvitness that
<hi>she loved much,</hi> yet she also is <hi>afraid.</hi> The more for that she loved so much,
for the more vve love the more vve fear to lose the thing vve love, the
more vve love the more vve fear to offend the person vvhom vve love;
nay, the more vve fear to miss; and the more earnest vve are too seek,
the more likely are vve to find vvhat or vvhosoever vve set to seek for.
Seek him vvith filial fear, or love and fear; that's the second.</p>
            <p>Yet if vve seek <hi>Christ,</hi> vve must also thirdly seek him vvith our <hi>faces
bowed down to the ground;</hi> and that is (1.) the fashion of those that seek
earnestly: and so he must be sought vvith all the earnestness vve
can.</p>
            <p>And it is (2.) a token of diligence in the search, much like that of the
poor woman that sought her groat, that lighted a candle, swept her house,
rak'd in the dust, look'd into every corner, peer'd into every chink to
find it. Do we so in seeking <hi>Christ,</hi> light up the candle of Faith kindled
from the flame of love, sweep we the houses of our souls with the besom
of repentance, look vve into our dust, consider vvhat vve are made of,
vvhat poor dusty things vve are, ransack every corner of our hearts, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
crany of our thoughts: that so vve may if not find him there, yet
make all clean for him against he comes, and vve shall commonly find he
vvill come gliding in vvhen vve think not of it, vve shall hear of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
rising in our dust after vve have so rais'd it, by the breaking and
contritions of repentance.</p>
            <p>And it is (3.) the posture of humility, and of the humble he vvill
be found; they shall not miss of him vvhoever do; to them his grace
St. <hi>Iames</hi> iv. 6. to them his vvays, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxv. to them his dvvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The lovver vve bovv dovvn before him, the higher vvill he lift
us up.</p>
            <p>And lastly, the <hi>face bowed down to the earth,</hi> is the look of them that
mourn, we must seek him as his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> did, seek him <hi>sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
sorry that we have been so long without him, that we so carelesly lost
him, then after a day or two we shall be sure to find him: nay, if our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
begins, as here in the morning of the day, if we begin betimes to
be exceeding sorrowful, the morning shall not pass e're we hear at least
some tidings of him: nay, we shall not stir from the Grave but we shall
hear it e're we go, some <hi>good Angel</hi> or other shall bring us some glad mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
or other from him, and tell us where he is. So it follows, <hi>as they
were perplexed, behold two men stood by them in shining garments, and as they were
afraid, and bow'd down their faces to the earth,</hi> this news they tell them, that
<hi>He is risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:57113:181"/>God never faileth them that seek him, says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> never them
that seek him as these did, with careful and troubled souls, such he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
does refuse, <hi>Psal.</hi> li. <hi>with reverence and godly fear,</hi> such he never does
reject, vvith earnestness, vvith diligence, vvith humility, vvith godly
sorrow, those he visits presently either by himself or by his <hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which (2.) is very observable, and as comfortable, <hi>as they were
perplexed, and as they were afraid, and bowed down,</hi> says the <hi>Text,</hi> that is,
even when they began to be so, before their perplexities had misled them,
or their fears undone them, or their faces lick'd the earth; as they began
only to hang their heads, and their spirits began to faint, and their
souls to be troubled, <hi>two men</hi> on a sudden, whence they cannot tell, and
which way they came there they knew not; but there they stand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse
both their sorrows and their fears, by what they have to tell them.
Three grand points we observe in this <hi>apparition</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> to make
up that great success that those who faithfully and devoutly seek <hi>Christ,</hi>
may promise themselves upon it.</p>
            <p>1. They see a <hi>Vision</hi> of <hi>Angels.</hi> 'Tis their good hap ever to meet bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Spirits</hi> who seek the <hi>Lord of Spirits,</hi> to meet them here, to be with them
ever hereafter, to meet one or two of them here at times, to meet ten
thousand times ten thousands of them hereafter.</p>
            <p>To meet them here even at the Sepulchre in the midst of sorrow, even
then to receive comfort from them, even in the Grave, in our greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p>To meet them (2.) like <hi>young</hi> men, so says St. <hi>Mark,</hi> sprightly, and
able to defend us.</p>
            <p>To meet them (3.) in <hi>shining garments,</hi> tokens of some exceeding joy,
and gladness, which we may expect, and shall find from them.</p>
            <p>To meet them (4.) <hi>standing</hi> by us, that is ever ready to comfort and
assist us.</p>
            <p>To meet (5.) <hi>two</hi> of them together, not one single comforter alone,
but comfort upon comfort, deliverance upon deliverance, spiritual and
temporal, one at the right hand, and another at our left.</p>
            <p>But lastly, hereafter to be sure, we shall meet them in full Choires,
when we rise out of our Sepulchres, then like young men indeed, both
they and we, then to be always so, never die again, never grow old, nor
our garments neither, but have them always shining</p>
            <p>The next point of the good success is to receive direction from them.
Two parts of it there are first to recal us from the wrong; and then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
to set us right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why seek you the living among the dead, he is not here;</hi> that's the correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our judgments and affections: <hi>He is risen,</hi> that's the setting them to the
right.</p>
            <p>For a Traveller when he is out of the way, to be told he is so, is a thing
any of us would take well; and when we are stragling out of the way to
Heaven, going out of that safe, and fair, and happy way into the bogs
of the world, and mires of lusts and ditches of Hell, to have an <hi>Angel,</hi>
one of a thousand, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, but a messenger of the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi>
to call out to us, that we are wrong, is certainly a happiness if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it; and such God sends always to them that seek him truly, if
they will but turn their heads at the call, and look after him. Well but
what says he that so calls out to us, <hi>Why? why seek you the living among the
dead?</hi> what's that?</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:57113:182"/>
               <item>I. They <hi>seek the living among the dead,</hi> that seek <hi>salvation</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> long since dead and buried.</item>
               <item>II. They <hi>seek the living among the dead,</hi> that seek it by the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
by the power of them: Nature without Grace is dead, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebar
omnia opera mea,</hi> says holy <hi>Iob,</hi> there is not in us one poor work to
trust to.</item>
               <item>III. They <hi>seek the living among the dead,</hi> that seek salvation, that
think to be sav'd by a meer outward holiness, by the outward body
of Religion without the inward life, by forms of godliness, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be meerly ceremonial performances of Religion, or great
shows and pretences of godliness without the power of it in their
lives and conversations.</item>

            <p>They lastly <hi>seek the living among the dead.</hi> that seek <hi>Christ</hi> upon worldly
interests, that take up their Religion upon by-respects, that do it for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or worldly affections. But say the Angels, He is not here. <hi>Christ</hi> is
not here, <hi>Christ</hi> the Saviour is not, that is, our <hi>salvation</hi> is not to be
found in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> or by the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> or in meer external
performances, or great pretences, or in worldly and carnal hearts, they are
but Graves and Sepulchres all; which we too much and too often bury our
souls in, and stand weeping by, and are much perplexed at if we cannot
find it there, but must be forc'd from thence to a new search<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as here are
the women are to leave these kinds of seeking, all of them, and betake
us now to think of him as risen thence. For so the <hi>Angels</hi> say he is, <hi>He
is risen.</hi> And in this he both tells us what to conceive of him, and at the
same time to put off all our perplexities, and tears, and sorrows to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
with him. <hi>He is risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Risen,</hi> and not rais'd; others indeed have been rais'd from death, the
<hi>Sareptans</hi> Child, the <hi>Widows Son,</hi> one of these, <hi>Mary's Brother Lazarus;</hi>
but none risen but he: he rais'd himself, they did not so; he rais'd them
all, must raise us all too, will raise us by his Resurrection, For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Risen,</hi> that is (2.) his <hi>Body risen,</hi> that is, we members of it to have part
also in his Resurrection; for if our Head be risen, the Members also will
follow after.</p>
            <p>Must (3.) in the <hi>interim</hi> follow him, so raise our thoughts above the
earth, as to seek him now above, to seek those things which are above;
that's it the <hi>Angel</hi> directs us to, by telling us <hi>he is risen,</hi> so pointing us
where now to fix our thoughts to leave the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> to bemoan it self, to
cast off all the ways and paths of death, to throw off all worldly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
fears, and sorrows, or in the midst of them to take a ray at
least from their <hi>shining garments,</hi> and put on the looks of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This both the direction they give us, and the joy they make us
partakers of.</p>
            <p>To tell us he is risen whom we seek, he is alive whom we bemoan for
dead; he that is our head, our hope, our love, our life, our joy, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
our crovvn of rejoycing, he in vvhom vve trusted, vve may trust
still, hope still, joy in him still, for he is risen and alive.</p>
            <p>That's the close vve are novv to make to day, that the ansvver vve are
to give to the <hi>Angels</hi> speech, that the application of the <hi>Text,</hi> to make it
full, run vve once more over it.</p>
            <p>Grovv vve then first as sensible as we can of our sad condition vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

him, hovv our hearts cannot but tremble vvhen he is gone, our spirits
faint, our faces look sad and heavy, dull and earthy vvhen he is from us,
Let us upon this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it, that we may not at any time give him occasion henceforvvard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
us, or leave us comfortless at the Grave, but send his <hi>Angels</hi> thither to
direct and to conduct us to his joyful presence.</p>
            <p>When we are thus made sensible what we are without him, we
then secondly, certainly will make after him with all care and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
all earnestness and diligence, all humility and devout repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
troubled at his absence, fearful of our own unworthiness, and
truly humbled for our sins that drove him from us; perplext to lose
him, fearful to offend him, vigilant to seek him, that so at last we
may recover him; for you see he is recovered from the Grave, and
may again be by us recovered to our souls.</p>
            <p>This the duty both our own necessities, and the opportunity of this
great day require of us.</p>
            <p>The business we are next to go about exacts as much. We are with
these women come here to seek the <hi>Lords body,</hi> and I shall anon give
you news of greater joy than here the <hi>Angels</hi> did the <hi>Women.</hi> They
say <hi>he is not here,</hi> but <hi>he is risen.</hi> I say, but <hi>he is risen, and is here,</hi>
will be here by and by in his very <hi>Body.</hi> Your eye cannot see him, but
your souls may there see and taste him too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lift up then your heads, O ye immortal gates, and be ye lift up ye ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
doors, that the King of Glory may come in.</hi> Look up and <hi>lift up
your heads, for your salvation draweth nigh. Bow down your faces</hi> no longer
<hi>to the earth,</hi> neither look here as to an earthly business. Look not sad
but chearful now to <hi>day,</hi> (I hope you have lookt sadly enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in your Chambers upon your sins) you may here put on another
face. Yet if you be somewhat <hi>perplext</hi> and troubled at your sins,
or <hi>afraid</hi> of your own unworthiness, or your souls and bodies bowed
down as low as can be in humility, I shall say you are the fitter
to receive your joys, and to be made partakers of the <hi>Angels</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
which as the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, are present in holy places; and
if ever, there, there more especially, at so great a mystery as this
which they themselves bow down themselves to look into, and wing
about us, say the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to assist the celebration all the while.
You will be the fitter too to receive the joyful news, that this <hi>day</hi>
brings us, of <hi>Christs</hi> rising; being only so cast down and prepared in
all humility to receive it.</p>
            <p>Yet learn we something from the <hi>Angels</hi> too as well as from the
<hi>Women;</hi> for <hi>behold,</hi> says the <hi>Text;</hi> as if it meant we should look upon
them too, and learn by their <hi>standing</hi> constancy and resolution, by
their clothing in <hi>shining garments,</hi> purity, and innocence, and all good
works whereby we are so to shine as to glorifie <hi>our Father which is in
Heaven,</hi> by their correcting the good womens errour, to correct our
own, and not let our Brother either perish or go astray for want of
good and timely admonition, a prime work of charity which this
business so requires; by their advice no longer to <hi>seek the living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the dead;</hi> no more to seek <hi>Christ</hi> for earthly profits or respects;
and by their so readily publishing the news of <hi>Christs</hi> rising to be
this <hi>day</hi> ever telling it, every day thinking of it, and so living as if
we believed a Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:57113:183"/>So shall it come to pass, that however we come, we shall not depart
perplexed, but in peace; not in fear, but in hope; not in sorrow, but
in joy; and shall one day behold him risen whom we now only hear is,
and meet him with all his <hi>Angels in shining garments,</hi> in the robes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
glory.</p>
            <p>He who this <hi>day</hi> rose, raise now our thoughts with these apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
raise our thoughts to the height of these heavenly mysteries, make
us this day partakers through them of his Resurrection by Grace, and
in his due time also of his Resurrection to Glory.</p>

                  <p>And the Graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints which slept
arose.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd this is the third <hi>day</hi> since the first of these was done,
since <hi>the Graves were opened;</hi> and the first <hi>day</hi> that all
the rest, that the <hi>bodies of Saints arose, came forth, went
into the holy City and appeared,</hi> the blessed <hi>day</hi> of our
<hi>Saviours Resurrection.</hi> So we have both <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
in the <hi>Text,</hi> and not amiss; the one to usher
in the other, the <hi>Passion</hi> the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> both comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
when together, to see the <hi>Passion</hi> end so glorious, the darkness
of so sad an Evening open it self at last, after a little respite, into
so lustrous a Morning, the most lustrous that Sun ever shone in, the
most joyous thus to meet the Grave and the holy City, <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Saints</hi>
together.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Day</hi> the very stones cry out, and send forth the deceased <hi>Saints</hi> as
so many Tongues to speak the glory of their <hi>Redeemer.</hi> And if the <hi>graves</hi>
open their mouths, can we hold our peace? If the dead bodies of the
<hi>Saints</hi> appear to <hi>day</hi> in the <hi>holy City</hi> to celebrate the <hi>Day,</hi> shall not we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with our living bodies in the <hi>holy Mount</hi> to do as much? The <hi>Grave
cannot praise thee, Death cannot celebrate thee,</hi> says <hi>Hezekiah, Isa.</hi> xxxviii. 18.
And <hi>the Dead praise not thee O Lord,</hi> says <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cxv. 17. Yet here they
do. They thought then they could not, we see now they do; and
shall not the living do so to? <hi>The living, the living, he shall praise thee,</hi> says
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>But we will praise the Lord,</hi> says <hi>David;</hi> that's agreed on both
hands that the living shall; the Father to the Children make known the
truth of this <hi>days</hi> great wonder, declare it one to another from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to Generation, keep the <hi>Day</hi> in remembrance throughout all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we be not more senseless than the <hi>Day,</hi> more silent than the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57113:184"/>
               <hi>grave,</hi> the house of silence, we cannot hold to <hi>Day,</hi> up and arise we will,
and into the holy places to set forth the wonders of the <hi>day. They that go
down,</hi>
as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>into the silence, and into the Land where all things
are forgotten,</hi> who are either <hi>dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> or are resolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all that their Fathers have seen or done, or has been done for them,
who are in the dark, the darkness of ignorance or error, departed from
the <hi>Church,</hi> out of the marvelous light into the Land of darkness, they
shew not of these wonders among the dead in their own Congregations,
nor tell of the loving kindness, faithfulness, and righteousness of this
<hi>Day,</hi> in that great destruction they have made. But we will, I hope,
we that are among the living stones, in the <hi>Communion of holy Church,</hi> will
praise the <hi>Lord,</hi> do as much as the <hi>Graves</hi> and now risen <hi>bodies</hi> wherever
we appear.</p>
            <p>For upon this <hi>Day,</hi> hang all our hopes. We were hopeless till it came;
hopeless when it was come till we knew it, and no great hope of us if we
forget it now it is. This <hi>Day Christ</hi> rose out of the <hi>Grave.</hi> If he had not
risen, had had no <hi>Resurrection,</hi> there had been no hope of ours. If nor
<hi>hope</hi> nor <hi>Resurrection,</hi> we had been <hi>of all men most miserable;</hi> and if we do
not thankfully remember both, we are but miserable unthankful
wretches; no sooner the <hi>Day</hi> forgotten, and such days put down, but all
our happiness put down with them, we of all the Nations under heaven
presently <hi>most miserable,</hi> miserable times quickly after this happy <hi>Day,</hi>
with the rest of its attendants, was unhappily voted to be forgotten. So
much does it concern our happiness with the <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
it in the <hi>City,</hi> if the <hi>City</hi> intend either to be <hi>holy</hi> or happy, so much
to make much both of all <hi>Texts</hi> and times that may bring it to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
all days and words, <hi>Texts</hi> and Testimonies either of <hi>Christs
Resurrection</hi> or our own.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Text</hi> then among the rest. Wherein we have both a <hi>Testimony</hi> and
<hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Christs Resurrection,</hi> and a <hi>Pledge</hi> and <hi>Symbol</hi> of our own. Two
general Points which we shall consider in the words. Or more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
thus. A <hi>Testimony</hi> of the truth of <hi>Christs Resurrection,</hi> and an <hi>Evidence</hi>
of the power of it. A <hi>Pledge</hi> of the certainty of our <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and a
<hi>Symbol</hi> of the manner of it, both of our <hi>Resurrection</hi> to grace, and our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
to glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Testimony</hi> of the truth of <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> (1.) in the <hi>bodies of the
Saints arising,</hi> and coming out of their <hi>Graves.</hi> (2.) In their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the <hi>holy City,</hi> and there <hi>appearing unto many,</hi> telling and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evidence</hi> of the power of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> to be seen (1.) in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Graves;</hi> (2.) In raising the <hi>Saints bodies that slept</hi> there; (3.) In
sending them into the <hi>holy City;</hi> (4.) sending them thither to <hi>appear
to many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pledge</hi> of our <hi>Resurrection</hi> it is, (1.) that they that <hi>rise</hi> are of those
that <hi>slept, Saints</hi> and members of the same <hi>body</hi> with us; that (2.) 'tis
no <hi>phantasm,</hi> no phantastick or meer imagined business, for they <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole business of their <hi>Resurrection</hi> is a <hi>Symbol</hi> and signification of
ours, both of that to grace, and that to glory. (1.) Of that to
grace; the <hi>grave,</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> the <hi>Symbols</hi> of sin and sleeping in it,
the <hi>bodies rising</hi> thence, of the souls rising out of sin; their going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>holy City,</hi> of the souls passing from sin to righteousness and
holiness; their <hi>appearing to many,</hi> of this righteousness manifested
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57113:184"/>
and appearing unto all. A <hi>Symbol</hi> (2.) it is of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> unto
glory, where the <hi>Grave</hi> first <hi>opens,</hi> then the <hi>body rises,</hi> then into the
<hi>holy City,</hi> into new <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it goes, and there appears and shines for
ever.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the <hi>Text</hi> opened as well as the <hi>Graves;</hi> we must now
go on to <hi>raise</hi> such <hi>bodies</hi> of doctrine and comfort out of it, as may bring
us all into the <hi>holy City,</hi> serve to make us holy here, and happy hereafter,
partakers here of the <hi>First Resurrection,</hi> and hereafter in the <hi>Second.</hi> He
that here opened the <hi>Graves,</hi> and raised the dead <hi>bodies</hi> out of their <hi>sleep,</hi>
open your ears and hearts, and raise your understandings and affections,
that we may all of us have our share in both, rise first to righteousness,
then to glory; <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> is the <hi>pattern</hi> and ground of both, we
therefore begin with that, with those words first that bear witness to the
truth of it, that <hi>Christ is risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A double <hi>Testimony</hi> we gather of it in the words, from the rising of the
dead <hi>Saints,</hi> and from their <hi>appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a sign indeed that the <hi>Resurrection</hi> was well towards when the
<hi>Graves</hi> began to open; we could not but see somewhat of it even in those
dark Caverns, when they once began to let in the light; some hope of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
even when a body begins to yawn; some hope the body might come
ere long to recover its long lost liberty when the prison doors were wide
set open, and the shackles of death knockt off the legs; some sign and
hope, I say, it would be so, that there would be a resurrection of some, of
some one or other by and by.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Graves</hi> being opened at <hi>Christs Passion,</hi> they could be but hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
prognosticks at most of his <hi>Resurrection;</hi> a <hi>Testimony</hi> it could not be;
but when out of these opened <hi>Graves</hi> the <hi>Saints arose</hi> out of their <hi>sleep,</hi>
they could tell us more certain news of it than so. And being but mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that body of which <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> was the head, we must needs
know the <hi>head</hi> is risen when the <hi>body</hi> is got up; the <hi>head</hi> first ere any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
could, be it never so holy, never so much <hi>Saint. He is the head of the
Church,</hi>
says the <hi>Apostle, Eph.</hi> v. 23. and the <hi>Church the body,</hi> and if any part
of the body be raised to life, the head you may be sure is; first too; For
if <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>first fruits of them that sleep,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. and <hi>the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
from the dead,</hi> as he is stiled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 5. If we see others risen, other
dead bodies walking and alive, there is no witness more true than that
<hi>he</hi> is. The first fruits ever before the crop, <hi>Christ the first, fruits, afterwards
they that are Christs,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> xv. 23. out of order else; and the
<hi>first begotten</hi> ever before all the rest; second, and third, and fourth, and all
witness the <hi>first begotten</hi> was before them, <hi>the first begotten from the dead,</hi> risen
before the other dead.</p>
            <p>And it seems 'tis not a single witness, they were <hi>many dead bodies</hi>
here that <hi>rose,</hi> and <hi>in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word
be established,</hi> Deut. xvii. 6. much more in the mouths of many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</p>
            <p>And if these be from the dead, surely then the most incredulous will
believe, <hi>Nay, Father Abraham,</hi> says <hi>Dives, but if one come from the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they
will believe,</hi> yea, <hi>and repent too,</hi> Luke xvi. 30. Here's more than one, here's
<hi>many,</hi> that not so much as any of <hi>Dives</hi> his brethren, the most voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
secure, customary, and obstinate sinner can be incredulous after
this, or have reason to doubt the truth, or have the power to contradict
it. To satisfie either particular curiosity, or infidelity, God does not use
to send us messengers from the dead; he sends us to <hi>Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:57113:185"/>
there, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. for our instruction; does not press men from hell or
heaven, or raise them out of their beds of rest to send them on an errand
to us (though perhaps little can be universally, though ordinarily it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be defin'd in this particular, for the ignorance we are under of
the condition of the bounds and limits of the dead) <hi>If they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Moses and the Prophets,</hi> says <hi>Father Abraham, neither will they believe if
one rise from the dead;</hi> If they will not believe the living word, the word
of the living God, no likelihood that they should believe the word of a
dead man, especially when they cannot be certain but it may be the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
the <hi>father of lies</hi> and falshood. But not of one only rising from the
dead, that to be sure; no man so simple to venture his faith upon a single
Testimony, and such a one as that. Or if he would, God does not use to
do extraordinary miracles, where the ordinary means of probation or
information are sufficient.</p>
            <p>But in this great business that concerns all mankind he is pleased to step
out of his ordinary course to give us for once some extraordinary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that all Ages afterward might be sufficiently convinced of the
truth of <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> from heaven and earth by the Testimony of
the dead and living, that there might be no occasion hereafter to doubt
for ever. He raises therefore a great company to attend the triumph of his
<hi>Sons Resurrection,</hi> and to bear witness to it.</p>
            <p>2. And as it is not a single witness, so it is not secondly a single testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
'tis not from their rising only, but from their going into <hi>the City,</hi>
and there <hi>appearing unto many.</hi> For sure neither their journey nor appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was to tell stories of the dead, what is done either in the <hi>grave,</hi> or
<hi>heaven,</hi> or <hi>hell,</hi> to satisfie the curious soul with a discovery of those
Chambers of silence, or the <hi>Land where all things are forgotten;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all forgotten, that we may know they remember when they come
thence to tell us nothing that is there; their business was to wait upon
their <hi>Lord,</hi> that had now set them at liberty from the Grave, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
the greatness and glory of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>
appeared upon the <hi>holy Mount</hi> at <hi>Christs transfiguration, talking with him,</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, they <hi>spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 31. And 'tis highly credible the discourse of these <hi>Saints</hi>
with those to whom they appeared was of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Their going
into the <hi>City</hi> was not meerly to shew themselves, nor their <hi>appearance,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to appear, but to appear <hi>Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Companions</hi> of their <hi>Saviours Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it probable that the <hi>Saints,</hi> whose business is to sing praise and
glory to their <hi>Lord,</hi> should be silent at this point of time of any thing that
might make to the advancement of his glory.</p>
            <p>Yet you may do well to take notice, that it is not to all, but <hi>to many</hi>
only that they <hi>appeared,</hi> to such, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of <hi>Christs</hi> own appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> as <hi>were chosen before of God, witnesses</hi> chosen for
that purpose, <hi>Acts</hi> x. 41. that we may learn indeed to prize Gods favours,
yet not all to look for particular revelations and appearances. 'Tis suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for us to know so many <hi>Saints</hi> that slept arose to tell it, that so many
<hi>Saints</hi> that are now asleep, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Twelve,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>five hundred
brethren at once,</hi> all saw him after he was risen, so many millions have faln
asleep in this holy Faith, so many slept and died for it, that it is thus abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
testified both by the dead and living, both by life and death, even
standing up and dying for it; and a <hi>Church</hi> raised upon this faith through
all the corners of the earth, and to the very ends of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:57113:185"/>But to know the truth of it is not enough, unless we know the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of <hi>Christs Resurrection:</hi> they come next to be considered, and there is
in the words evidence sufficient of four sorts of them, (1.) The victory
over sin and death, both the <hi>Graves</hi> were opened; (2.) The Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the soul and body, the one in this life, the other at the end of it,
<hi>many dead bodies that slept arose;</hi> (3.) The sanctification and glorification
of our souls and bodies, the dead bodies that arose out of the graves
<hi>went into the holy City;</hi> (4.) The establishing us both in grace and glory,
they <hi>appeared unto many.</hi> All these, says the <hi>Text,</hi> after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> by
the force and vertue of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it seems <hi>the graves were opened,</hi> death almost vanquished, and
the grave near overcome whilst he yet hung upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> before he
was taken thence; deaths sting taken out by the death of Christ, and
all the victories of the grave now at an end that it could no longer be a
perpetual prison, yet for all that the victory was not complete, all the
Regions of the Grave not fully ransackt, nor the forces of it utterly
vanquisht and disarm'd, nor its Prisoners set at liberty, and it self taken
and led captive, till the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> 'Tis upon this Point St. <hi>Paul</hi> pitches
the victory, and calls in the Prophets testimony, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 54. upon this
'tis he proclaims the triumph, <hi>ver. 55. O Death where is thy sting? O Grave
where is thy victory?</hi> even upon the <hi>Resurrection of Iesus Christ,</hi> which he
has been proving and proclaiming the whole Chapter through with
all its benefits, and concludes it with his thanks for this great victory,
<hi>ver.</hi> 57.</p>
            <p>So it is likewise for the death and grave of sin; the chains of sin
were loosed, the dominion of it shaken off, the Grave somewhat opened
that we might see some light of grace through the cranies of it by <hi>Christs
Passion,</hi> but we are not wholly set at liberty, not quite let out of it, the
Grave-stone not perfectly removed from the mouth of it till the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
at the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or rather the <hi>Angel of the Covenant</hi> by his <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
remove it thence, remove our sins and iniquities clean from
us.</p>
            <p>2. Then indeed (2.) the dead soul arises, then appears the second
benefit of his Resurrection; then we rise to righteousness and live,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 24. then we <hi>awake to righteousness</hi> and sin no more. So St. <hi>Paul</hi>
infers it, <hi>That like as Christ was raised from the dead, by the glory of the father
even so should we also walk in newness of life,</hi> Rom 6. 4. This <hi>Resurrection</hi> one
of the ends of his; our righteousness attributed to that, as our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his death.</p>
            <p>From it it comes that our dead bodies arise too; Upon that <hi>Iob</hi>
grounds it, his Resurrection upon his Redeemers, <hi>Iob</hi> xix. 25. <hi>I know that
my Redeemer liveth;</hi> well, What then? Why, I know too, therefore,
that <hi>though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God.</hi>
The <hi>Apostle</hi> interweaves our Resurrection with <hi>Christs,</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> with
ours, his as the cause of ours, ours as the effect of his, a good part of
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. If <hi>Christ</hi> be risen, then we; if we, then he; if not he, not we;
if not we, not he; And in the <hi>Text</hi> 'tis evident, no rising from the dead,
how open soever the graves be, till after his Resurrection, that we may
know to what Article of our faith we owe both our deliverance from
death, and our deliverance into life here in soul, and hereafter in our
bodies, by what with holy <hi>Iob</hi> to uphold our drooping spirits, our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
martyr'd, crazy bodies, by the faith of the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> that <hi>day,</hi> the
day of the <hi>Gospel of good tidings</hi> to be remembred for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:57113:186"/>3. So much the rather in that 'tis a <hi>Day</hi> yet of greater joy, a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of all fulness of grace and glory to us, of the means of our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(3.) of our rising <hi>Saints,</hi> living the lives of <hi>Saints,</hi> holy lives,
and of our glorification, our rising unto glory: both doors opened to us
now, and not till now, liberty and power given us to go into the <hi>holy City,</hi>
both this below, and that above now after his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and through it.
<hi>He rose again,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, for our justification,</hi> Rom. iv. 25. <hi>to regenerate us
to a lively hope blessed be God</hi> for it, says St. <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 3. that we might <hi>be planted
together in the likeness of his Resurrection,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> vi. 5. grow up
like him in righteousness and true holiness; and when the day of the
<hi>general Resurrection</hi> comes rise then also after his likeness, be conformed
to his Image, bear his Image who is the heavenly, as we have born
the Image of the earthly, <hi>our vile body chang'd and fashioned like his glorious
body according to the working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself,
Phil.</hi> iii. 21. whereby in the day of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> he subdued death, and
grave, and sin, and all things to him.</p>
            <p>4. And to shew <hi>the power of his Resurrection</hi> to the full, there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
purchast to us by it, an appearing here in the fulness and lustre
of grace, such as may appear unto all men to be such, not a few, but
many, many graces, all graces obtained by it; nay, <hi>it does not yet appear
what we shall be by it, but when we shall appear we shall be like him,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn,
1 Ioh.</hi> iii. 2. our righteousness and glory last for ever; <hi>He died once,</hi> says the
<hi>Apostle, but being raised he dies no more;</hi> no more did these in the <hi>Text,</hi> no
more shall we, but live for ever. Not only grace and glory, but perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
in the one, and eternity in the other, apparently no less accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us by the vertue and efficacy of his <hi>Resurrection;</hi> good news from
the grave the while, and from the late rais'd Prisoners of it, who are
now thirdly as well the pledges of the certainty of our Resurrection, as
the evidences of the power of <hi>Christs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A double <hi>Pledge</hi> we have here of our Resurrection, one from the <hi>many
dead bodies of the Saints that slept, arising out of their graves:</hi> The other from
<hi>their going into the holy City, and their appearng unto many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first then are four particulars to assure us of it:</p>
            <p>1. We find <hi>dead bodies</hi> here arising, to assure us such a thing there may
be, such a thing there is as a Resurrection of the body; that bodies, be
they never so dead, may be quickned, never so corrupted, may rise incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible;
you may see them rising here. And,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Many</hi> of them there are, that we may see it belongs not only
to a few, to some particular <hi>persons;</hi> this many is but the usher to
St. <hi>Pauls all, We shall all arise and stand before the judgment Seat of Christ,
Rom.</hi> xiv. 10.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Saints bodies</hi> they are said to be, and they are our fellows, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the same <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>if one member be honoured, all the other members
are honoured with it,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 26. Indeed, the <hi>bodies of the
Saints</hi> only shall rise with <hi>Christ,</hi> rise to enter into the <hi>holy City,</hi> but all
shall rise, <hi>for all shall appear, every one to receive the things done in his body,
according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 10. <hi>they that
have done good to the Resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the
Resurrection of damnation,</hi> says <hi>he</hi> that rose himself to <hi>day,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> v. 29.
<hi>For all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth,</hi> ver. 28.
none be left behind, though the best come first. The <hi>Saints</hi> have only the
prerogative, not the only priviledge of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>For (4.) 'tis said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>bodies</hi> of them that <hi>slept,</hi> that we may know
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57113:186"/>
that all that sleep, that all that die, shall awake again and rise at last.
He that lies down only to sleep, lies down to rise; and good and
bad, how sad soever the ones dreams be, how full of terror soever be
the wicked mans sleep in death, are both said to sleep, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,
Baasha</hi> and <hi>Omri,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ioram</hi> are said all of them to
sleep with the <hi>Fathers</hi> as well as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Ioash,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,
obdormierunt simul, they all sleep together</hi> the sleep of death, and so
shall likewise arise together; though as there is difference in sleep,
some sweet, some horrible; so in rising too, some sad, some joyful when
they awake: but sleep necessarily intimates and supposes some awaking
and rising after it: 'tis else somewhat more than sleep. Thus by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the dead bodies of these Saints, so many rising, rising as men
out of their sleep, not as Saints, out of a priviledge, we have one strong
<hi>pledge</hi> of our Resurrection, of which they only lead the van after our
great <hi>Captain</hi> the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second we have given us from both <hi>their going into the holy City, and
their appearing unto many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not <hi>in obscuro, this thing was not,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>done in a corner,</hi>
not in a house or <hi>Church-yard,</hi> (where are all the apparitious we now hear
of) not in a Country Village, no not an ordinary City neither, but in
the great <hi>Metropolis, Ierusalem</hi> it self; call'd holy for what it had been,
not what it was; for it was now the most sinful City: or called holy yet
for the <hi>Temples</hi> sake, that yet stood firm: an <hi>item</hi> by the way to tell us
how long a City may be stil'd holy, so long as the <hi>Church</hi> stands sacred
and inviolate in it, and no whit longer. But be the City holy or not,
that which is done there by many, is not likely a private business, has
witnesses enow to give credit to it.</p>
            <p>But to put all out of question, the there appearing unto many will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
it was no <hi>phantasm,</hi> no particular fansie, or imagination of some
silly, simple, or timorous persons, but a business of the greatest certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
whether you take <hi>many</hi> for the <hi>many,</hi> or many people and folk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or for <hi>such who were before chosen,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>to be witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
to whom the <hi>Resurrection</hi> should be reveal'd, as to men of credit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
and understanding.</p>
            <p>Nor does the word appearing any way prejudice but confirm it, the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to make plain and certifie; to give us
a full knowledge and manifestation of a thing, so us'd, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 21.
<hi>Acts</hi> xxiii. 21. and xxiv. 1. when either persons or things really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear before us. So the publickness of the place, the number and
fitness of the persons, and the way and manner of appearance is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough of their real Resurrection, and a second <hi>pledge</hi> to us that
it concerns more than themselves, (though themselves were <hi>many,</hi> even
the <hi>many they appeared</hi> to, too;) whole Cities, all Cities, holy and unholy,
all the world, of which that City was but an emblem and signification;
a place from whence God did as it were, out of his own house and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
dispence his providence through all the earth: and the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
thus going after the Resurrection <hi>into the holy City,</hi> an intimation
whether the <hi>Saints</hi> go when they are risen; the whole action a <hi>Symbol</hi> of
what is done in both the <hi>first and second Resurrection,</hi> what we are to do in
the one, and expect in the other, or what is done both in the one and the
other: and so lastly we now consider it.</p>
            <p>For the similitude the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> or the Resurrection of the soul
from sin to righteousness bears to this of the <hi>dead bodies</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> we
have it very like both for thing and order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:57113:187"/>The Graves in which the souls lie buried are either our corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or corrupt passions, or stony hearts, or continued ill customs,
which so entomb the spirit, that it lies dead without any spiritual life
and operation. The opening of the Graves is the loosing the chains of
those earthly affections, bodily depressions, wicked habits, and hardned
hearts. The souls that are dead in trespasses and sins, are those dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
fuller of stench, and worms, and rottenness, then any dead body
whatsoever, full of infamous and stinking sins, worms of conscience,
and worms of concupiscence, rotten resolutions and performances: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in sin is the sleep of death. Holy purposes and resolutions are
the rising out of it. Walking thenceforward in the ways of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is going into the holy City, and the letting our righteousness so
shine before men, that God may be glorified is the appearing unto many.</p>
            <p>And the order is as like; our justification or spiritual Resurrection well
resembled by it. God first for the merits of <hi>Christs Death and Passion,</hi>
breaks ope the stony heart, looses the fetters of our sins, and lusts, all
worldly corruptible affections in us; opens the mouth of it to confess its
sins; then the soul rises as it were out of its sleep by the favour of Gods
exciting grace, and comes out of sin by holy purposes and resolutions,
resolves presently to amend its courses: then next it goes into the holy
City by holy action, endeavour, and performance; so goes and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
its reconcilement to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and at last makes its Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
repentance, and amendment, evident and apparent to the world
to as many as it any where converses with, that all may bear witness to
it that it is truly <hi>risen with Christ,</hi> now lives with him. This the order,
this the manner of our first Resurrection from the death of sin to the
life of Grace.</p>
            <p>Our second Resurrection to the life of Glory is but this very Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in the Text acted over again. As soon as the <hi>consummatum est</hi>
is pronounced upon the world, as soon as <hi>Christ</hi> shall say, as he did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Cross, all is finished, the end is come, the <hi>Arch-Angel shall blow his
Trumpet, the Graves open, the earth</hi> and <hi>Sea give forth their dead, and the
dead in Christ shall rise first; then they that be alive at his coming: For if we
believe that Iesus died and rose again, even so them also that sleep in Iesus shall
God bring with him,</hi> 1 Thess, iv. 14. and they shall <hi>come out of their Graves,
and go into the Holy City,</hi> the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that is above, and there appear
and shine like stars for ever. Indeed the ungodly and the wicked shall
arise too, and appear before the <hi>great Tribunal,</hi> but not like these <hi>Saints,</hi>
for into the <hi>holy City</hi> they shall not come: Rise and come forth they shall,
but go away into some place of horror, some gloomy valley of eternal
sorrow, some dark dungeon of everlasting night, some den of Dragons
and Devils, never to appear before God, but be for ever hid in the arms
of confusion and damnation.</p>
            <p>As for the godly the <hi>holy City</hi> is prepared for them, for us if we be like
them. <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are the inhabitants of this <hi>holy City,</hi> no room
there for any other; if our bodies then be the bodies of holy <hi>Saints,</hi> then
into the <hi>holy City</hi> with them, and not else: no part in the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
if no part in the old; no portion above if none below; no place there
with <hi>Angels,</hi> if no communion here with <hi>Saints;</hi> no happiness in heaven,
if no holiness on earth. They are the <hi>bodies</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> you hear that
go into the <hi>holy City,</hi> they that rise from the sleep of sin, and awake to
righteousness, that rise from the dust of death to the rays of glory.</p>
            <p>And this now may hint us of our duty to close with them for the close
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57113:187"/>
of all. It has been shewed before what is the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> without
which there is no <hi>second,</hi> namely a life of holiness; a dying to sin, and
a living unto God. And this is a Resurrection we are not meerly passive
in, as in the other. We must do somewhat here towards our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
at least to finish it. We must open our mouths, which are too
often what <hi>David</hi> stiles the wicked mans throat, even <hi>open Sepulchres,</hi>
and by confession send out our dead, our dead works, confessing our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;
we must awake out of our sins, and arise and stand up by holy
vows and resolutions, rear up our heads, and eyes, and hearts, and hands
to heaven, <hi>seek those things that are above if we be risen with Christ,</hi> get up
upon our feet, and be walking the way of Gods commandments, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, get us into the <hi>holy City</hi> to the holy place, make our humble
appearance there, express the power of <hi>Christs Resurrection</hi> in our life, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him through all the parts of it all our life long.</p>
            <p>This the great business we are now going to, requires of us more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
to come to it like new rais'd bodies that had now shaken off
all their dust, all dusty earthly thoughts, laid aside their Grave-cloths,
all corrupt affections that any way involv'd them, and stood up all new,
all fitly composed for the <hi>holy City,</hi> drest up in <hi>holiness and newness of life,</hi> thus
come forth to meet our new risen Saviour and appear before him. This
the way to meet the benefits of his <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Resurrection:</hi> for coming
so with these <hi>Saints</hi> out of their Graves, <hi>Christs Grave</hi> also shall open and
give him to us, the <hi>Cup and Patine</hi> wherein his body lies as in a kind of
Grave, shall display themselves and give him to us, the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi>
shall raise and and advance the <hi>holy Elements</hi> into lively <hi>Symbols</hi> which shall
effectually present him to us, and he will come forth from under those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
shadows into our Cities, our Souls, and Bodies, if they be holy;
and his grace and sweetness shall appear to many of us, to all of us that
come in the habit of the Resurrection, in white Robes, with pure and
holy hearts.</p>
            <p>Here indeed of all places, and this way above all ways, we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
to meet our Lord now he is risen, and gone before us: this the chief
way to be made partakers of his Resurrection, and the fittest to declare
both his Death and Resurrection, the power of them till his coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>And to declare and speak of them is the very duty of the <hi>day,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Grave</hi> this <hi>day</hi> with open mouth professes <hi>Christ is risen,</hi> and gives praise
for it, that it is no longer a land of darkness, but has let in light; no
longer a bier of death, but a bed of sleep. But <hi>shall thy loving kindness, O
Lord, be known in the dark,</hi> or <hi>shall the dead rise up</hi> again, <hi>and praise thee?</hi> yes,
holy <hi>Prophet,</hi> they shall, they did to day: and if his loving kindness
shall not be known in the dark, the dark places shall become light, now
the <hi>sun of righteousness has risen</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>But shall the dead rise up again and praise him, and shall not we? shall
the graves open, and shall not our hearts be opened to receive him, nor
our mouths to praise him for it. Was it the business of the dead <hi>Saints</hi> to
<hi>day</hi> to rise to wait upon their <hi>Lord,</hi> and shall not the living rise to bear
them company? shall the whole City ring of it, out of dead mens mouths,
and shall not our Cities and Temples resound of it? shall they tell the
wonders of the <hi>day,</hi> and we neither mind the <hi>day,</hi> nor wonders of it? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>some evil will befal us,</hi> as said the <hi>Lepers</hi> at the Gates of <hi>Samaria, if we
hold our peace.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>day</hi> of good, of glorious tidings, and we must not,
lest the <hi>Grave</hi> in indignation shut her mouth upon us, and the <hi>holy City</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:57113:188"/>
bar us out. Open we then our mouths to day, and sing praises to him
who made the <hi>day,</hi> made it a joyful day indeed, the very seal of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto us: Open we our mouths and <hi>take the cup of salvation,</hi> as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
calls it, <hi>the cup of thanksgiving,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> stiles it, <hi>and call upon the
name of the Lord.</hi> Open our mouths now as the grave, and he will fill
them. Open our mouths as the grave, and be not satisfied, give not over
our prayers until he do. Raise we all our thoughts, and desires, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to entertain him, go which way he shall send us, appear what
he would have us, attend him whither soever he shall lead us; and when
he himself shall appear, he will lead our souls out of the death of sin
to the life of righteousness; our bodies out of the dust of death into
the land of life, both souls and bodies into the <hi>holy City,</hi> the new <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
where there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, nor
any more pain, but <hi>all tears shall be wip'd away,</hi> all joys come into our hearts
and eyes, and we sing merrily, and joyfully; all honour and glory, be
unto him that hath redeemed us from death, and raised us to life by the
power and vertue of his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> All blessing, and glory, and praise,
and honour, and power be unto him, with the Father and Holy Spirit
for ever and ever.</p>

high day, as the <hi>Iewish Easter,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xix. 31. but the
highest of high days, highest of them all. A <hi>Day</hi> in
which the Sun it self rejoyced to shine; <hi>came forth like
a Bridegroom,</hi> in the robes and face of joy, and <hi>rejoyced like a Giant,</hi> with
the strength and violence of joy, <hi>exultavit,</hi> leapt and skipt for joy <hi>to run
his course, Psal.</hi> xix. 5. as if he never had seen day before; only a little day
spring from on high, as old <hi>Zachary</hi> saw and sung, never full and perfect
day, the <hi>Kingdom and power of darkness</hi> never fully and wholly vanquished
till this morning light, till this day-star, or this day's Sun arose, till
Christ rose from the grave as the Sun from his Eastern bed to give us
light, the light of grace and the light of glory, light everlasting.</p>

it peculiarly the Lords making. This <hi>day</hi> of the week from this
<hi>day</hi> of our Lords Resurrection, stil'd <hi>Lords Day</hi> ever since. And of this
day of the Resurrection, the <hi>Fathers,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. Not one of the Fathers, says that devout and learned <hi>Bishop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
that he had read (and he had read many) but interpret it of <hi>Easter
day.</hi> The Church picks out this <hi>Psalm</hi> to <hi>day</hi> as a piece of service proper
to it. This very <hi>verse</hi> in particular was anciently used every day in <hi>Easter</hi>
week, evidence enough how she understood it. And for the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
The two <hi>verses</hi> just before; <hi>The stone which the builders refused, the same is
become the head of the corner. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our
eyes,</hi> to which this <hi>day</hi> comes in presently and refers, applied both of them
by Christ himself unto himself in three several places, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxi. 42.

applied again twice by St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> iv. 10. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 7. to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
For these doings, these marvelous doings, a day was made,
made to remember it, and rejoyce in it, as in the chiefest of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
works. And being such, let us do it. Let not the Jews out-do
us, let not them here rejoyce more in the figure, than we in the substance;
they in the shadow, than we in the Sun. 'Tis now properly <hi>Sunday,</hi> this
<hi>day,</hi> ever since, a day lighted upon on purpose for us, by the Sun him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to see wonderful things in, and as wonderfully to rejoyce in. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
saw</hi> this <hi>day</hi> of Christs as well as <hi>Christmas,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> viii. 56. saw it in
<hi>Isaacs</hi> rising from under his hand, from death as in a figure, says the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
Heb.</hi> xi. 19. <hi>saw it and was glad</hi> to see it, exceeding glad, as much at
least to see Christ and <hi>Isaac</hi> delivered from death, as delivered in to
life. <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, all the faithful, will be so too to see the day when
ere it comes. It now is come by the circle of the year, let us <hi>rejoyce and be
glad in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I require no more of you than is plainly in the <hi>Text,</hi> to confess the day,
and express the joy. Both are here as clear as day. <hi>Dies Gaudii, &amp; Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
Diei, A day of joy, &amp; the joy of the day. Easter</hi> day, and <hi>Easter</hi> joy.
A day made, and joy made on it; A day ordained, and joy appointed;
God making the day, we making the joy upon it. Or if you please,
<hi>Ordo Diei, &amp; Officium Diei; An Order for the day, and an Office for the
day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Order for the day, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made,</hi> order'd,
and ordain'd.</p>
            <p>The Office for it, <hi>We will,</hi> or let us <hi>rejoyce and be glad in it, Exultemus &amp;
laetemur;</hi> An office of thanksgiving and joy ordained and taken up
upon it. The first is Gods doings, the second ours. And ours or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to follow his, our duty his day; the <hi>Lords day</hi> requires sure
the Servants duty. Both together, Gods day and mans duty
make up the <hi>Text,</hi> and must the Sermon. But I take my rise from the
days rising. The Lords order for the day, <hi>This is the day which the Lord
hath made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we have,</p>
            <p>(1.) The Day design'd; (2.) The Institution made; (3.) the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
given it; (4.) The Institutor exprest; (5.) The ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated;
(6.) The End annext. <hi>This is</hi> designs the day. Gods making
that institutes it. The <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the <hi>The</hi> gives it the Preeminence; the Lord
is the institutor; The ground is understood in the <hi>This,</hi> this <hi>day</hi> when
that was done that went before, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and the End by the annexing joy
and gladness to it. Of these particularly and in order; then of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>Exultemus, laetemur,</hi> and <hi>in eâ,</hi> Outward and Inward joy, and our
directing, and spending both upon it. But <hi>haec est dies,</hi> the day designed is
our first design. <hi>This is the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi>] first is a sign of a particular. God made all days, all in general,
but this in particular. Particular days are of Gods making as well as
others. God made such from the beginning, all days in the week, but
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in particular; all days in the month, but the <hi>New-moons</hi> in
particular; all days in the year, but the <hi>Feasts</hi> and <hi>Fasts,</hi> the <hi>Easter,</hi> the
<hi>Pentecost,</hi> the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> the great <hi>Kipparim</hi> in particular, to his
service in particular among the Jews. And among the Christians parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
days may be observed too. <hi>He that observes a day may observe it unto the
Lord,</hi> Rom. xiv. 6. And upon particular order we have such; <hi>Pascha nostrum
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57113:189"/>
immolatum;</hi> our Passeover is slain, and we must keep a Feast, we have an
<hi>Easter, 1 Cor.</hi> v. 7, 8. We have the <hi>Lords day</hi> thence, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 10. and we may
be <hi>in the spirit upon</hi> it; a <hi>first day of the week, and we may break bread,</hi> Act. xx. 7.
and make collections upon it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 1, 2. <hi>Panem frangere,</hi> and <hi>Collectas
facere, make meetings,</hi> and <hi>celebrate Sacraments</hi> upon it. We have the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
at their <hi>Pentecost, Acts</hi> ii. 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> after that, making a journey to
be at it, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 16. the Spirit descending on it, to sanctifie it particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Gods service, to take it, as it were, away from the <hi>Iewish</hi> into the
<hi>Christian Kalendar.</hi> We have a <hi>hodie natus est, a day for Christs being born</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up from the examples of an <hi>Host of Angels,</hi> St. <hi>Luk.</hi> ii. 10. by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
people (for I can scarce call them Christians any of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it) ever since; a Day of his Incarnation too, whence the Christian
<hi>Aera,</hi> all Christian accompts of the year have since ever begun and
run; a proof sufficient to shew Christians have their observations of
days as well as Jews, particular Days and Feasts, nay, and Fasts
too upon Christs <hi>in diebus illis jejunabunt,</hi> his particular injunction of them,
St. <hi>Luk.</hi> v. 35. days all particularly made for his own service.</p>
            <p>The fault that the <hi>Apostle</hi> finds with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. iv. 10. for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
<hi>Days,</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> was for the observing
the Jewish ones, not the Christian, for falling back to the beggarly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the Law, as he there expresses it in the verse before, as if
the Gospel-Rites were not sufficient, or that they being afraid to suffer
for the Cross of Christ, studied such poor compliances to avoid it. Else
some particular days have been always set apart to the more especial and
particular remembrances of Gods benefits and Christs; many of these
days in the devoutest and purest times, in the ancientest Kalendars. This
of <hi>Easter</hi> in particular among the rest. So particular that generally all
the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Interpreters</hi> pitch upon it as the day design'd and deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
here.</p>
            <p>Other secondary interpretations, I confess, they make some of them,
but this the prime, though to some other upon occasion, or by the by they
apply it too.</p>
            <p>To the day of the Incarnation first. Then this <hi>stone,</hi> upon whose exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
this day is founded, was <hi>cut out of the mountain without hands,</hi> Dan. ii.
34. Christs body fram'd without mans help.</p>
            <p>2. To the day of his Nativity. Then <hi>factus est in angulum, this stone was
made,</hi> made more plainly in little <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a corner of <hi>Iudaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To the day of his Passion. Then he was rejected by the <hi>builders,</hi>
the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and people of the Jews; <hi>Nolumus hunc,</hi> take
him who will, <hi>we will not have him; disallowed</hi> indeed then <hi>of men,</hi> says S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
1. Pet. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>4. To the day of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the whole time wherein that glorious light
displaies it self to all the corners of the world.</p>
            <p>5. To the weekly <hi>Lords day,</hi> the Christians day of rest and joy, the
weekly Resurrection day, that rose, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks, <hi>post tristia Sabbata,</hi>
out of the sad <hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi> after the sad <hi>Saturday</hi> of Christs Passion to
the primacy over the other days.</p>
            <p>6. To the day of the general Resurrection, when this stone, <hi>elect and
precious,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> stiles it, shall appear in its full brightness and glory to all
the corners of the earth, at which day we are bid by our Saviour to look
up and lift up our heads, S. <hi>Luk.</hi> xxi. 28. that is, to rejoyce and be glad when
we see it coming.</p>
            <p>7. To Christ himself it is applied, the day in this verse as well as the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57113:190"/>
stone in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. He is both <hi>Daniels</hi> and <hi>David stone, Zacharies</hi> and <hi>Davids
day-spring</hi> or <hi>day. Ego sum dies,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> reads it for <hi>Ego lux, I am the day,</hi>
and <hi>he that walketh in the day,</hi> in me, he <hi>stumbleth not,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xi. 9.</p>
            <p>Nay, lastly, we find it sometimes applied to any day of famous and
notable mercies and deliverances, wherein any great blessing has been
given. Thus to the letter 'tis here applied to <hi>Davids</hi> coming to the
Crown after his long being rejected by <hi>Sauls</hi> Party. Thus in the Council
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> under <hi>Agapetus,</hi> for the blessing or election of <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> a
most learned and pious Bishop there.</p>
            <p>But all these though they may be applications, they are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
explications of this <hi>day.</hi> To this of <hi>Easter</hi> it most fully points. Then
the <hi>stone</hi> so lately <hi>rejected by the builders became the head stone of the corner,</hi>
the head of the Church, to unite both corners of the building, <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> into one holy <hi>Temple:</hi> then were the hearts of the Disciples
fill'd with joy and gladness, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xx. 20. the Prophesie here fulfill'd,
the joys completed in the exaltation of the <hi>Son of David,</hi> which the
Jewish people here began for the exaltation of <hi>David,</hi> but prophesied
of Christs, though perhaps they knew no more than <hi>Caiphas</hi> what they
said.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the <hi>Nativity,</hi> the <hi>Passion,</hi> the time of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the
<hi>Sunday</hi> or <hi>Lords day,</hi> the <hi>day</hi> of the Universal <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the particular
<hi>days</hi> of <hi>Gods mercy</hi> to us are all days of Gods making, and to be kept and
clebrated with joy, even the Passion it self with spiritual joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and Christ is the day that gives light to all these days, enlightens
all, yet both day and joy, and the Lords making of them to us, can fit
nor one, nor all of them so properly as this <hi>day</hi> that now shines on us,
<hi>Easter day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thus we have found which this day is, what day it is that is here
so particularly design'd, and pointed out, which in the <hi>Text</hi> is said to
be made, and now to be considered how or what 'tis made. Of common
days 'tis said only that they be or are, so <hi>the evening and the morning were
the first day,</hi> Gen. i. 5. and <hi>the evening and the morning were the second day,</hi>
ver. 8. and so of all the rest. The Evening came, and the Morning came,
light and darkness succeeded one another, so the day came, no making
else. But of this 'tis punctually said that it was made, something in it, or
in the making more than ordinary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Made</hi> (1.) that is, made famous by something done upon it; death,
and hell, and all the terrours of darkness this <hi>day</hi> put to flight for ever by
Christs only Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Made</hi> (2.) that is, appointed and ordained for something. So <hi>Deus
fecit Dominum &amp; Christum, God</hi> is said to have <hi>made</hi> our Saviour <hi>Lord and
Christ,</hi> Acts ii. 36. and of Christ that <hi>fecit nos Reges &amp; Sacerdotes,</hi> that he
<hi>made us,</hi> that is, ordained, <hi>us Kings and Priests,</hi> as God had him both Lord
and Christ, and upon this day both; so that 'tis no wonder if the day
too be said to be made, made, or ordained and appointed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Made</hi> (3.) to be celebrated too, to be kept aniversary as a solemn day
of joy and gladness, of Praises and Thanksgivings. Thus <hi>facere diem
Sabbati,</hi> Deut. v. 15. <hi>&amp; Pascha facere,</hi> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvi. 18. is to keep the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
and the <hi>Passeover;</hi> what is there in <hi>Latine</hi> to make the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and the
<hi>Passeover,</hi> in our <hi>English</hi> is to keep them, to make up, or make out the
day in Gods Worship and Service. When God is said to make a day, 'tis
for himself, and we can make none but to him; mar days we do when
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57113:190"/>
we spend them upon any thing, or any else, they are never made but
when on him. The greater sin theirs then that unmake the days that are
thus made, that both unsaint the Saints, and unhallow the days, and
prophane both; that make them for all but him, all business but his,
as if the holiness of the <hi>Holiday</hi> were the only offence of it, that which
made the day, or for which the day was made, the only reason to them
to unmake it.</p>
            <p>3. But however it pleases some to mar what God has made, yet made
days there have been many, are, and shall be. Themselves are not yet
so impudent to deny us all, not the <hi>Lords days</hi> yet, which yet are but so
many little models of this great day. But of <hi>made</hi> days all are not alike;
some high days, some not so high, though the one and the other made
and constituted for Gods service. Of <hi>made days</hi> this is the highest; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>The day,</hi> so we told you out of <hi>Ignatius;</hi> so we now tell you out of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
Principatum tenet, 'tis the prime.</hi> As the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> among women,
so this blessed <hi>day</hi> among the days, says he. The most holy Feast of <hi>Easter</hi>
the good <hi>Emperour Constantine</hi> calls it four times in one <hi>Epistle</hi> to all the
<hi>Churches, Solenne nostrae religionis festum,</hi> a little after, the <hi>solemn Feast of our
Religion,</hi> by which we hold our hopes of immortality, the very day of all
our Religion and our hope. <hi>Illa videtur dies clarior illuxisse,</hi> sings <hi>Lactantius.</hi>
The fairest day that ever shone. The Sun, which so many hours withdrew
its light, and hid its face in sable darkness, went down sooner into
night at our Saviours Passion, and to day rose so much sooner, restored
those hours to lengthen, or encreased it beams to enlighten this glorious
<hi>Day</hi> in the opinion or else Rhetorick of <hi>Chrysologus, Eusebius,</hi> and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
If so, it was <hi>The Day</hi> indeed, none like it ever since; but if not,
There were two Suns rose to day to enlighten it, the Sun of Heaven, and
the Son of God; who is also stiled the Sun in the strictest spelling, <hi>The
Sun of righteousness;</hi> needs must it be a glorious day indeed which is gilded
with so much light, so many glorious Rays.</p>
            <p>All days were night before, nothing but dark clouds and shadows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> nothing but a long unevitable night under the <hi>Law
of nature,</hi> nothing but a disconsolate night of sorrow under the power of
sin and darkness, this was the first bright <hi>day</hi> that dispell'd all darkness
quite. A kind of spring of day or glimmering twilight there was abroad
from the first preaching of the Gospel, but men could scarce see any
thing; not the Disciples themselves; their eyes were ever and anon
held, not fully opened, till the grave it self was this <hi>day</hi> opened, and
gave forth Christ to open the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to them by the evidence of the
Resurrection. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>this is the day</hi> when all this was done, when this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
light shone forth, to enlighten all the world. The day of all the
days before or since.</p>
            <p>4. And now (4.) it may well be so when the <hi>Lord made</hi> it. All his
works are wonderful, all perfect and complete, deserve Articles and
Notes to be set upon them. But when he sets the Note himself, and
gives the Article, then to be sure 'tis somewhat more than ordinary,
somewhat he would have us to observe above the rest. And when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
himself to it, or challenges it unto himself, day it self is not more
clear than that such a <hi>day</hi> must be observed.</p>
            <p>Things that are exceding eminent, and full of greatness, wonder, or
perfection, are commonly attributed unto God. This <hi>day</hi> is such at least,
because 'tis said God made it; a peculiar work and Ordinance of his,
more than the common Ordinance of day and night; and if God made
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57113:191"/>
it, what is man that he should mar it, or the son of man that he should
unmake it? Or how dares man, or Son of man make little of that which
God made so great?</p>
            <p>So great as to call it his; so great as to make it the mother of one and
fifty daughters, of all the <hi>Lords days</hi> in the year besides. <hi>This is the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
indeed. None could alter the <hi>Sabbath</hi> into the <hi>Lords day</hi> but he. None
put down that, and set up another, abolish the Seventh, and set up the
First, but the Lord of all, and may do all, what he pleases in heaven
and earth, Lord it every where how he will. Herein he shews he is the
Lord, and this <hi>day</hi> the Lady of the year, from whence so many little
weekly <hi>Easter</hi> days take both their rise and name. All the former days
God made, the Lord made this, the Lord Christ the ground and
Author of this day, Christs rising raising this to that height it is.</p>
            <p>Now God or Christ is not only said to do or make that which they do
immediately by themselves, but that also which they do by those to
whom they have committed such authority. So Christ tells us, St. <hi>Luke</hi>
x. 16. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me;</hi> he that heareth his <hi>Apostles,</hi> his
<hi>Church,</hi> his <hi>Ministers,</hi> heareth him himself; their commands are his, their
orders his, so long as they are not contrary to his word. And thus
we may evidently without much labour deduce the day to be his
making.</p>
            <p>From the Apostles times it came. <hi>Palicarpus,</hi> that <hi>Angel,</hi> as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> Rev. ii. 8. kept <hi>Easter,</hi> saith <hi>Ireneaeus,</hi>
with St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and with the rest of the <hi>Apostles, Euseb.</hi> l. 5. c. 26. The great
difference about the time of keeping <hi>Easter</hi> between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and the
<hi>Western Churches</hi> was grounded upon the different keeping of it by the two
great <hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> keeping it after one reckoning,
St <hi>Peter</hi> after another; St. <hi>Iohn</hi> keeping it, after the Jewish reckoning,
upon the fourteenth of the month <hi>Abib:</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> much after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
as now it stands, upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> following; but all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
was about the time, not about the keeping it; none denied or
questioned that but <hi>Aerius,</hi> none left it at liberty but the <hi>Cathari,</hi> both
registred for Hereticks about it. So confident were they 'twas from the
Lord.</p>
            <p>And that from him, at least by the <hi>Apostles, Constantine</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Which day</hi> (says he)
<hi>ever since the first day of his Passion we have kept untill this present,</hi> We have
received it of our Saviour, says he a little after. And again, which our
Saviour deliver'd to us. Thus <hi>Dominus fecit</hi> then indeed. And that so it
was either from his own command, or from his Apostles, the whole pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Church is ground enough, in all Ages still observing it, even
in the hottest times of persecution, some in Caves, and some in Woods,
and some on Shipboard, and some in Barns and Stables, and some in
Goales, keeping it as they could, says <hi>Eusebius;</hi> so scrupulous were they
of omitting that <hi>day</hi> upon any hand that the <hi>Lord had made</hi> them:
and the great contentions about the time of keeping it shews as
plain they thought it more than an humane institution; they
might else have easily ended all the Controversie, and laid down the
day.</p>
            <p>But they had <hi>not</hi> then <hi>so learned Christ,</hi> had not learned the trick
of lightly esteeming days and places, and things, and persons, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
dedicated to Gods service, which God had made, or were made to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:57113:191"/>5. Especially made upon such an occasion as this <hi>day was.</hi> This <hi>day;</hi>
What day is this? The <hi>day</hi> wherein the <hi>Stone</hi> that was disallowed
by <hi>Men</hi> was approved of <hi>God,</hi> and exalted to the <hi>head of the corner.</hi>
Wherein the chief <hi>corner stone</hi> of <hi>Sion</hi> was laid, and <hi>Sion</hi> begun to be
built upon it, when we had ground given to build upon, and stones
to build with by Christs Resurrection; that's the ground and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the day. And a good one too: For had he not risen we had
had no ground to build upon, we had perish'd in our sins, been
swept all away like so many houses builded upon the sand. We
had had neither place for faith, nor ground for hope; nor room
for preaching, our <hi>preaching vain, your faith also vain,</hi> all vaine, all
come to nothing. <hi>His</hi> being <hi>delivered for our offences</hi> had been nothing
if he had not been raised again <hi>for our Iustification,</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi>
iv. 25. 'Tis to this day we owe our Justification; 'tis from this day
we are made just, and holy, from this <hi>Stones</hi> being made the <hi>head
stone of the corner</hi> we made <hi>lively stones, built up into a spiritual house</hi> or
building, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 5. From his becoming this
<hi>day</hi> the <hi>chief corner stone</hi> it is in that we now have confidence, as
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks, and creep not into corners to hide our faces, that we
dare boldly look up to heaven, and come unto him, and that we call
not to the Hills to hide us, or to the Mountains to cover us from the
presence of God, or the face of man or devil. Our faith and hope, our
souls and spirits are all raised by this days raising, we are all made by this
days being made, we had else better never have been made, for we had
been marr'd and undon for ever.</p>
            <p>6. But by this <hi>day</hi> it seems we are not: for this rejoycing and
gladness that now follows close upon it shews what a kind of day it is,
for what 'tis made, even to be glad and to rejoyce in, a Feast, or Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
God is no enemy to the <hi>Churches Feasts,</hi> whoever be; calls to us
to blow up the Trumper for Feasts, as well as bid us to proclaim a
Fast. Indeed he more properly makes the Feast, and we the Fast,
for he only gives the occasion of the one, and we of the other; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
and we sins; <hi>Deus nobis haec otia fecit.</hi> So no wonder that the <hi>day</hi> that
he has made, be a good day, a day of good things, such as we may well
rejoyce in, a Festival.</p>
            <p>Yea, and a set one too. His making, you heard, was an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or instituting it. Though God would sometimes have free-will
Offerings, he will not always trust to them. If he leave all to the wills
of men, the fires will oft go out upon his Altars, his house stand thin
enough of people, and his Priests grow lean for all the fall of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
if he come once to the mercy or courtesie of men. They would
quickly starve him and his Religion out of doors. But set Feasts he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had, set Services and offerings, would not leave himself or his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to mans devotion, for <hi>he knew what was in man.</hi> He made this <hi>day,</hi>
made it a <hi>Feast,</hi> a day of joy and gladness; Let us now therefore to our
Office, to <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>be glad in it;</hi> that's the second General, thither now
are we come.</p>
            <p>Three Points we told you we would consider in it, <hi>Exultemus, laetemur</hi>
and <hi>in eâ.</hi> Three parts in our Office, <hi>rejoycing, gladness,</hi> and <hi>the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
both.</hi> Outward expression, inward gladness, and right placing
them. Both words, I confess, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,
&amp; e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ultemus, &amp; laetemur</hi> in the <hi>Latine,</hi> have something outward in
them; yet <hi>exultemus,</hi> is more for the outward, <hi>laetemur,</hi> somewhat more
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57113:192"/>
within, a joy of the heart with some dilatation only of it, <hi>Laetitia quasi
latitia,</hi> a stretching out the heart, and sending forth the Spirits;
<hi>exultatio</hi> of <hi>saltatio,</hi> a kind of skipping or leaping for joy, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
got into all the parts and powers, ready to leap out of them for
joy.</p>
            <p>Being thus both involv'd one in the other, I shall not trouble my
self to distinguish them, but only tell you hence, that first, The joy
that God requires in the things that he has made, or any time makes for
us is not only inward, it must out into outward acts. Out into the
mouth to sing forth his praise, in <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and <hi>spiritual Songs,
Eph.</hi> v. 19. Out into the hands to <hi>send portions to the poor for whom nothing
is prepared,</hi> Nehem. viii. 10. Out into the feet to go up to the House of
God with the Posture as well as the <hi>voice of joy and gladness,</hi> to go up
with haste, to worship with reverence, to stand up chearfully at the
Hymns and Songs of Praise. Our very bones, as <hi>David</hi> speaks, to rejoyce
too; the very clatter'd bones to clatter together and rejoyce, all the parts
and powers of the body to make some expression in their way and
order.</p>
            <p>But not the powers of the body alone, but all the powers of the soul
too. <hi>Praise the Lord O my soul, and all that is within me praise his holy name,
Psal.</hi> ciii. 1. Our souls magnifie the Lord, our Spirits rejoyce in God
our Saviour, our memory recollect and call to mind his benefits, and
what he has done for us, our hearts evaporate into holy flames, and
ardent affections and desires after him, our wills henceforward to give
up themselves wholly to him as to their only hope and joy. 'Tis no
perfect joy where any of them is wanting. 'Tis but dissembled joy
where all is outward. 'Tis but imperfect gladness where all is within.
It must be both. God this <hi>day</hi> raised the body, the body therefore must
raise it self, and rise up to praise him. He this <hi>day</hi> gave us hope he
would not <hi>leave</hi> our <hi>souls in hell,</hi> fit therefore it is the soul should leave all
to praise him that sits in heaven. He is not worthy of the day, or the
benefit of the day, worthy to be raised again, who will not this <hi>day</hi>
rise to praise; not worthy to rise at the Resurrection of the just, who
will not rise to day in the Congregation of the righteous to testifie his
joy and gladness in the Resurrection of his Saviour, and his own. He is
worthy to lie down in darkness, in the Land of darknes, who loves not
this <hi>day,</hi> who stands not up this <hi>day</hi> to sing praises to him that made
it.</p>
            <p>And now I shall give you reason for it out of the last words, <hi>In eâ, in it.</hi>
In it. and for it. As short as they are they contain arguments and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as well as time and opportunity to rejoyce in.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce first <hi>in it,</hi> because this <hi>day</hi> it is, a particular <hi>day</hi> of gladness
and rejoycing. Let us do what the day requires. 'Tis a day of joy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for it, let us therefore <hi>rejoyce in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rejoyce (2.) because the <hi>Lord made</hi> it. All the works of the Lord are
matters of joy to the spiritual man, even sad <hi>Days</hi> too; much more glad
days, such as this.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce (3.) because the Lords people have ever made it such. God
has always made them to rejoyce in it, to contend and strive who should
do it best or nearest to the point.</p>
            <p>Be glad (4.) for the occasion of it, the Resurrection of our Lord and
Master, and the hopes thereby given us of our own; all benefits of
Christ were this <hi>day</hi> sealed unto us, all his promises made good, all so
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57113:192"/>
hang upon this <hi>day,</hi> that without it, <hi>we of all men,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> had
been <hi>most miserable;</hi> none so fool'd, so wretched, so undone, so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as we.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce (5.) because God bids us; 'tis an easie and pleasant Precept.
If we will not be glad when he commands us, certainly we will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that he commands us, especially when he gives us so great occasion
of joy when he commands it.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce (6.) because the very Jewish people do it here. They had
but little cause of joy compared to ours; they saw but a glimmering of
this joy at most, saw the Resurrection but afar off, and yet you hear they
cry out, <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi> And is it not a shame that we
Christians, who see it clearly, and pretend to believe it fully, should not
as much exceed them in our joy, as in our sight, in our gladness as in our
faith? Clearly so it is.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce (7.) because <hi>it is a good thing to rejoyce;</hi> to rejoyce in Gods
mercies and favours to us, in Christs Crown and glory, in his <hi>day</hi> and
way. The very <hi>Angels</hi> themselves put on this <hi>day</hi> the white garments
of joy and gladness, we find them in them, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 4.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce lastly to <hi>day,</hi> because this <hi>day</hi> is the first of all our <hi>Lords days</hi>
ever since. We count them <hi>feasts</hi> and <hi>days</hi> of joy, and we meet together
upon them to rejoyce in, to give God praise, and thanks, and glory. 'Tis a
piece of worse than non-sence to say we are to do it upon these days, and
not on <hi>this,</hi> from which only and no other they had their rise and being.
All that we commemorate or rejoyce in on every <hi>Sunday</hi> is more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and first in this: this the great yearly anniversary of that weekly Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival,
the time as near as the <hi>Paschal circle</hi> can bring it to the time that the
Resurrection fell upon.</p>
            <p>For these, and for this <hi>day,</hi> so made to mind us of all these, let us now
take up the resolution of these pious souls, <hi>We will rejoyce and be glad in
it,</hi> in the <hi>day,</hi> and on the <hi>day,</hi> and for the <hi>day;</hi> that's the very work and
business of the <hi>day, opus diei in die suo, the proper work of the day in the day it
self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is now a way particularly before us to rejoyce in. <hi>Laetari</hi> is
taken sometimes for <hi>laetè epulari.</hi> To rejoyce is to eat and drink before the
Lord in his House or Temple, so <hi>Deut.</hi> xiv. 26. <hi>And thou shalt eat there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoyce, thou and thy houshold.</hi> Here now
we are before him, the <hi>Table</hi> spread, and our banquet ready, let us eat,
drink, and be merry, and rejoyce before him; only rejoyce in fear, and
be glad with reverence. <hi>This is the day which the Lord made,</hi> and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
observed for the celebration of this holy Banquet and <hi>Communion;</hi>
Never let the day pass without it; excommunicated them that did,
not one day or other of or about <hi>Easter</hi> receive the blessed Sacrament;
the greatest expression of our Communion with God, and Christ, and
all his Saints, and our rejoycing in it. You may see this people in the
<hi>Psalm</hi> within one <hi>verse,</hi> blessing him that <hi>cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi>
blessing the Minister that comes with it, wishing him and all the rest that
be of the House of the Lord good luck with their business, Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in his Office and Administration. And in the next verse calling
out aloud, <hi>God is the Lord which hath shewed us light, Bind the Sacrifice with
cords even to the horns of the Altar,</hi> God has shewed us light, and made us
a <hi>day,</hi> let us now bind the Sacrifice, the living Sacrifice of our souls and
bodies, with all the cords of holy vows and resolutions, even to the horns
of the Altar, and there sacrifice and offer up our selves, even unto our
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57113:193"/>
blouds, if God call to it, all our fat and entrails, the inwards of our
souls, our hearts and all our inward spirits, the fat of our estates, our
good works and best actions, the best we have, the best we can do, all we
have, or are, even at the Altar of our God with joy and gladness; glad
that we have any thing to serve him with, any thing that he will accept;
that we have yet day and time to serve him, that he has not cut us off
in the midst of our days, but let us all live to see this <hi>day</hi> again, and have
the liberty as well as occasion yet to rejoyce in it. Upon this comes in
<hi>David</hi> now presently with <hi>Thou art my God and I will thank thee, Thou art my
God and I will praise thee:</hi> O let us do so too. cry out one to another, as
the <hi>Psalm</hi> concludes, <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord for he is gracious, and his
mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Turn all our rejoycings into thanks and praise,
make it a <hi>day</hi> of praise, that so rejoycing worthily this day we may be
thought worthy to rejoyce in that <hi>day,</hi> opening and dilating our hearts
and mouths with joy to <hi>day,</hi> in this <hi>day</hi> of Christs particular Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we may have them fill'd with joy and gladness at the day of the
general Resurrection, this <hi>day</hi> of the Lord convey us over happily to that,
these our imperfect joys be advanced or translated into everlasting ones,
into a day where there is no night, no sorrow, but eternal gladness and
rejoycing for evermore.</p>

now, 'Tis but a sad place now <hi>He</hi> is gone. No
place worth the seeing or the being in, if <hi>He</hi> who is
our <hi>being</hi> be not there. Old <hi>Iacob</hi>'s <hi>descendam lugens in

with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p>But <hi>fear not,</hi> though. Our <hi>Lord,</hi> indeed, is gone,
but risen and gone away himself; they have not <hi>stoln him away.</hi> He's past

find him anon again in some better place. Had we found him here
in the <hi>grave</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> it had been sad indeed. <hi>He</hi> had been lost, and <hi>We</hi>
had been lost, and both lost for ever. <hi>He is risen, He is not here,</hi> are the

            <p>And indeed it was no more then needed when this <hi>day</hi> first arose; no
more then what needs still to those who <hi>seek Iesus</hi> which was <hi>crucified,</hi>
who go out with these tender hearts to the <hi>grave</hi> to weep. <hi>They</hi> need com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Matthew</hi> mentions here but one. St. <hi>Mark</hi> no more. St. <hi>Luke</hi> two.
St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s <hi>Angel</hi> sate upon the stone which was rolled away from the
mouth of the <hi>Sepulchre, ver.</hi> 2. St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s sate on the right side of the
<hi>Sepulchre</hi> within, <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Angels stood by the women
as they stood <hi>perplexed</hi> in the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s xxiv. 4. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
speaks of two <hi>Angels</hi> more, the one sitting at the <hi>head,</hi> the other at the
<hi>feet</hi> where the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> had lain. St <hi>Iohn</hi> xx. 12. And yet in all these
diversities no contradiction. The story runs smoothly thus.</p>
            <p>These pious <hi>women</hi> mention'd here come early to the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm
their <hi>Masters Body;</hi> whilst they yet stood without for <hi>fear,</hi> this <hi>Angel</hi>
in the <hi>Text</hi> that sate before the door upon the <hi>stone</hi> he had rolled away,
invites them to come in, where they were no sooner entred, but they
saw a second <hi>Angel</hi> sitting, who entertain'd them almost with the same
words, and is <hi>he</hi> remembred by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> when they had a while per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd
the bowels of the <hi>grave,</hi> and found nothing there but the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>linnen</hi> in which their <hi>Lords body</hi> had been wrapt, being somewhat
<hi>perplexed</hi> at the business they were comforted by two other <hi>Angels,</hi> which
immediately appear'd to resolve their doubts, and sent them to the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
to tell the news, and are those spoken of by St. <hi>Luke;</hi> whereupon
away they hast, only <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> returns again with St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who having lookt and entred into the <hi>grave,</hi> away they goe,
but she stands still without and <hi>weeps,</hi> till two other <hi>Angels,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
relates, shew forth themselves to stop her tears and divert her moans, and
shew her her <hi>Lord</hi> standing at her back.</p>
            <p>Thus we need no <hi>Synechdoche's,</hi> no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> no strein'd <hi>figures</hi> to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57113:194"/>
make things agree. But thus you see <hi>Angels are all ministring Spirits, sent
forth to minister for them, who shall be heirs of salvation,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells
us, <hi>Heb</hi> i. 14. They stand by us when we think not of them. They speak
to us often when we do not mind them. In the very <hi>grave,</hi> in our
deepest melancholies, in our saddest conditions; at the <hi>head</hi> and at the
<hi>feet</hi> of them they take their places and sit to comfort us. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when we descend into the <hi>grave</hi> to seek our <hi>Lord,</hi> when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be satisfied unless we may even die with him, when we are <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and dead to the</hi> whole <hi>world</hi> but <hi>him;</hi> when our only business is both
in life and death to be with him, then to be sure we shall not want
<hi>Angels</hi> to attend us; at every turn they stand ready for us, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
they are still at hand. A strong consolation, this, in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
A brave encouragement (2.) in all good undertakings. A good
Item (3.) too for our good behaviour, to carry our selves well, soberly,
modestly, piously in all conditions, <hi>because of the Angels</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 10. that thus stand about us, that are every where so
near us.</p>
            <p>So near us, that they often answer our desires ere we can speak them.
We read not of a word the <hi>Women</hi> said to the <hi>Angel,</hi> yet says the <hi>Text,</hi>
He <hi>answer'd.</hi> Thus, many times God answers us by himself, or by his
<hi>Angels</hi> ere we utter our necessities, or breath out our thoughts. He does
not always delay his mercy till we beg it, he prevents us with his loving
kindness, <hi>Psal.</hi> ciii.</p>
            <p>He did so (to be sure) to <hi>day</hi> by sending it by such Messengers. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
have wings (so they were grav'd and painted in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the
<hi>Temple,</hi>) His comforts had so too, to <hi>day.</hi> The message of the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
the greatest of our comforts could not upon this account come
by a better hand. By an <hi>Angel</hi> then (1.) that it might be with the
greater speed.</p>
            <p>By an <hi>Angel</hi> (2.) that it might be with the greater honour. <hi>Angels</hi>
are glorious things, honourable Embassadors; and such are not sent
on petty errands; nor can that embassie be slight, on which such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
come.</p>
            <p>By an <hi>Angel</hi> (3.) that the benefit might look with more convenience.
It was an <hi>Angel</hi> that shut the Gates of <hi>Paradise</hi> against us, and drove
us thence into the Territories of the <hi>grave;</hi> the more convenient sure
that the <hi>Angel</hi> again should roll away the <hi>stone,</hi> and open the gates of
<hi>Heaven</hi> out of those confines of death into which he drave us. He had
(2.) been imploy'd in the news of our <hi>Lords Incarnation</hi> and first <hi>birth</hi> out
of the <hi>womb;</hi> the fitter to be sent with the tidings of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and
<hi>second birth</hi> out of the <hi>grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By an <hi>Angel</hi> (4.) that it might be told with all the advantage it
could possibly. Such news is fittest for <hi>Angels</hi> tongues; men know not
how, worthily enough to speak it. Thus for the greater speed, and <hi>so</hi>
our greater comfort; for the greater honour, (2.) and so our greater
and humbler thanks; for the greater convenience; (3.) and so the
greater confirmation of the <hi>Analogie</hi> of our <hi>faith;</hi> for the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
(4.) and <hi>so</hi> our greater and readier acceptance of it, was this
first news of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> given us by an <hi>Angel,</hi> though nor men, nor
<hi>Angels</hi> sufficiently fit for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angels</hi> certainly the fittest of the two, they the fittest for the news,
and yet methinks meaner Embassadors might be fitter for the <hi>Persons</hi>
to whom 'tis told. <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> the <hi>Sons of God and the Daughters
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57113:195"/>
of men</hi> are no good matches; though I must tell you too, such <hi>women</hi> as
these, such who out-run the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves in affection and duty to
their <hi>Lord,</hi> whose love triumphs over the power of death, whose early
piety prevents the morning watch and shames the Sun, are company for
<hi>Angels</hi> to make up their <hi>Choires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not without reason that the <hi>Angel</hi> first appears to <hi>women,</hi> that
they are honour'd here with the first news of a <hi>Resurrection.</hi> There's a <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
in it. The <hi>woman was first deceiv'd</hi> by an <hi>Angel of darkness,</hi> 'twas
therefore most convenient she should first be undeceived by an <hi>Angel of
light.</hi> The <hi>woman</hi> (2.) was the first that fell, somewhat the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that she should hear first of the hopes to rise again. Thus does
the <hi>Almighty Wisdom</hi> proportion all things to us: Thus does the <hi>Eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
contrive all things for us with order and convenience, <hi>&amp; respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ultima primis, and all things answer one another</hi> first and last.</p>
            <p>Yet all must not look for <hi>Angels</hi> to comfort or instruct them. St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> came to the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> but found no such favour, they came
too late; the <hi>Angels</hi> were gone before they came. The <hi>women</hi> had been
before them and had gotten the blessing. 'Tis they that watch and rise
up early to find their <hi>Lord,</hi> that meet <hi>Angels</hi> at their Prayers. When
the day breaks the <hi>Angel</hi> must be gone, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 26. to say his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,
says the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> He'l stay no longer. When we come lagging in
with our devotions, God's answers come lagging too: extraordinary
favours are the rewards only of extraordinary attendance.</p>
            <p>But what? those two great <hi>Apostles</hi> not so highly favour'd as poor
silly <hi>women?</hi> What's <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> the sinner too among the rest, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
above them? <hi>'Tis so,</hi> Women, and sinners, and any above us, above
the greatest <hi>Apostles,</hi> the greatest Clerks in Gods favour, if above them
in their devotion and and piety to their <hi>Lord;</hi> 'Tis so, and we must
be content; nay, if God please, to prefer the weak and meaner things
of the world, upon any account, either such as are so, or such as we
conceive so, at any time before us, we have no more to say, but even
so it pleased thee O <hi>Father;</hi> and learn upon it to be humble, and not
think too highly of our selves; As those weaker things are hereupon
also not to be afraid, or terrified at their weaknesses, but called to here
by the <hi>Angel</hi> not to fear. <hi>Fear not ye:</hi> Which is the <hi>Proem</hi> or first Part of
his speech, to which we are <hi>now</hi> come.</p>
            <p>Four things here there were, that possibly they might fear, (1.) The
glorious presence of the <hi>Angel;</hi> (2.) The ghastly countenances of the
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> (3.) The unsetled face of the yet almost quaking <hi>Earth,</hi> (4.) and
the sad sight and horror of the <hi>grave.</hi> Yet <hi>fear not</hi> says the <hi>Angel,</hi> not
any of these.</p>
            <p>Not <hi>me,</hi> not an <hi>Angel</hi> first. <hi>Angels</hi> are our <hi>fellow-servants,</hi> and <hi>of</hi> our
<hi>brethren that bear the testimony of Iesus</hi> as well as we, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 10. We
need <hi>not</hi> fear <hi>them,</hi> they'l do us no hurt; nay, they are always ready
to do us good. Somewhat I confess there is in it, that makes <hi>them</hi>
commonly thus Preface all their speeches, as <hi>Fear not Zacharias,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>
i. 13. and <hi>ver. 30. Fear not Mary,</hi> and <hi>fear not</hi> to the <hi>Shepheards,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>
ii. 10. All is not so well between Heaven and us as should be, all not
so wholly well but that we may be afraid sometimes of a messenger
from thence. Yet fear not for all that, they come not to us thence but
with <hi>good tidings,</hi> especially when they come in raiment, white gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the <hi>Angel</hi> does, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. or a long white garment, as St. <hi>Marks
Angel, Chap.</hi> xvi. 5. That's neither a fashion nor a colour to be afraid
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57113:195"/>
of, for any that <hi>seek Iesus which was crucified,</hi> or hope to see the face
and enjoy the company of Holy <hi>Angels;</hi> though some now a days are
much scar'd with such a garment, when the <hi>Angels</hi> or Messengers of
the <hi>Churches</hi> appear in it. But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Fear it not,</hi> 'Tis but an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Robe,</hi> no more hurt in it than in the <hi>Angels</hi> that wore it. 'Tis the
Robe of Innocence, and the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> No reason to fear it. <hi>Fear not
ye,</hi> not this bright appearance.</p>
            <p>No nor (2.) that black one neither, of the ghastly countenances of
the amazed <hi>Souldiers.</hi> They alass are run and gone. There was no look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them upon him they had crucified. They indeed had reason to
be afraid, that the <hi>earth</hi> that trembled under them should gape and
swallow them, that the <hi>grave</hi> they kept, being now miraculously opened
might presently devour them: that he whom they had crucified now
coming forth with power and splendour, might send them down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into eternal darkness for their villany. Nay the very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
brightness and whites in which the <hi>Angel</hi> then appear'd, might
easily strike into them a sad reflection and terror of their own guilt, and
confound them with it. (and I am afraid when the <hi>Angels</hi> long white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
does so still, 'tis to such guilty Souls and Consciences as these
Souldiers that it does so; such who either betrayed their <hi>Lord</hi> to death,
or were set to keep him there.) Such I confess may fear even the
Garments of Innocence that others wear. But they that seek <hi>Christ
crucified,</hi> may be as bold as Lions. <hi>Non timent Mauri jacula nec arcus,
nec venenatis gravidas sagittis Christe pharetras.</hi> Thy <hi>Discirage ples O B. Iesu,</hi>
now thou art risen, will fear nothing, nor Darts, nor Spears, nor Bows,
nor Arrows, nor any force, or terror, any face or power of man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
And ye good innocent souls, ye good <hi>women, fear not ye,</hi> your
own innocence will guard you, these Souldiers shall do you no hurt,
their shaking hands cannot wield their weapons, nor dare they stand
by it, they <hi>are</hi> running away with all speed to save themselves. So
(2.) Fear not <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor fear (3.) the quaking <hi>earth,</hi> that seems ready either to sink them,
or sinks under <hi>them;</hi> 'tis now even setling upon its foundation. The
<hi>Lord</hi> of the whole earth has now once again set his foot upon it, and it
is quiet, and the <hi>meek,</hi> such as seek <hi>Christ,</hi> they <hi>shall now inherit</hi> it. But
<hi>though the earth were mov'd, and</hi> though <hi>the hills were carried into the midst
of the Sea,</hi> yet <hi>God is our hope,</hi> the <hi>Lord is our strength,</hi> and we <hi>will not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
fear,</hi> says <hi>David,</hi> Psal. xlvi. 1, 2. No, <hi>though the waters thereof rage
and swell, and though the mountains shake at the tempest of the same,</hi> do earth
what it can to fright us, <hi>God is a present help in trouble,</hi> Why then should ye
be afraid? <hi>Fear not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No not, lastly, the very <hi>grave</hi> it self, that King of Terrors, That is
now no longer <hi>so,</hi> to you. Though Tyrants should now tear your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
into a thousand pieces, grind your bones to power, scatter your
ashes in the air, and disperse your dissolved <hi>atomes</hi> through all the winds,
no matter; this <hi>Angel</hi> and his company are set to wait upon your dust,
and will one day come again and gather it together into Heaven. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can keep us thence, nothing separate us, <hi>nor life, nor death,</hi> says
the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. viii. 38. Fear nothing then at all: Not <hi>ye,</hi> however;
For <hi>ye seek Iesus which was crucified;</hi> that's an irrefragable argument
why you should not fear. And such, give me leave to make it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I handle it, as an encouragement of our endeavours; an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(1.) against our fears, before I consider it as an encouragement to
our work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:57113:196"/>And indeed, Ye who dare <hi>seek Iesus that was crucified,</hi> amidst Swords,
and Spears, and <hi>Graves,</hi> of what can you be afraid? He that dreads not
death needs fear nothing. He that slights the torments of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and
despises the shame of it; He that loves his <hi>Lord</hi> better than his life, that
dares own a crucified <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a profession that is like to produce
him nothing but scorn, and danger, and ruine, He cannot fear; <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
si fractus illabatur orbis, impavidum ferient ruinae; The World it self,
though it should fall upon him, cannot astonish him.</hi> Nothing so undaunted as
a good Christian, as he that truly <hi>seeks Iesus that was crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there's good reason for it. He that does so is about a work that
will justifie it self; He needs not fear <hi>that.</hi> He whom he seeks is <hi>Iesus,</hi>
one who came to save him from his sins; he needs not fear <hi>them.</hi> This
<hi>Iesus</hi> being crucified has by his dying conquer'd death; O death where is
thy sting? He needs not fear <hi>that.</hi> And though die we must, yet the Grave
will not always hold us, no more than it did him. He is not here, nor
shall <hi>we</hi> be always here, not always lie in dust and darkness, no need to
fear <hi>that.</hi> Nay, <hi>he is risen</hi> again, and we by that so far from fear that we
know we shall one day rise also. For the Chambers of Death, ever since
the time that Christ lay in them, lie open for a return, are but places of
retreat frome noise and trouble, places for the Pilgrims of the earth to
visit, only to see <hi>where the Lord lay.</hi> Thus is every <hi>Comma</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> an
Argument against all fears that shall at any time stop our course in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jesus that was crucified. And having thus out of the words vanquisht
your fears, I am now next to encourage your endeavours: <hi>For I know ye
seek Iesus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know it,</hi> says the <hi>Angel:</hi> That is, I would not only not have you be
afraid of what you are about, as if you were doing ill, but I commend
you for it, for 'tis well that you <hi>seek Iesus which was crucified,</hi> you need
not be afraid, you do well to do it.</p>
            <p>Yea, but how dost thou know it, Thou fair Son of light that <hi>they</hi> seek
<hi>him?</hi> Alas! 'tis easie to be known by men and womens outward deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whom they seek. Let us but examine how these <hi>women</hi> sought, and
we shall see.</p>
            <p>1. The come here to his <hi>Sepulchre;</hi> they not only follow'd him to his
<hi>grave</hi> a day or two ago, (the common office we pay to a departed
friend) but to <hi>day</hi> they come again to renew their duties, and repeat their
tears. Nor do they do it slightly or of course.</p>
            <p>They (2.) do it <hi>early, very early,</hi> St. <hi>Mar.</hi> xvi. 2. as if they were not,
could not be well till they had done it; So early, that it was scarce
light, nay, <hi>while it was yet dark,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> they thought they could not
be too soon with <hi>him</hi> they loved.</p>
            <p>They (3.) came on with courage as well as haste. They knew there
was a guard upon the <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> ver. 66. of the former <hi>Chapter,</hi> yet for all
that venture they would, they feared them not. The <hi>day</hi> they knew, too,
would come on apace, and there would be eyes upon them, so may be
presumed not to be ashamed of their <hi>Master,</hi> or their work. No, nor
were they neither afraid (4.) of cost or charges, for</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They had bought rich Spices,</hi> and sweet ointments, and had brought them
with them <hi>to anoint him,</hi> St. <hi>Mar.</hi> xvi. 1. They were resolved to be at charges
with him.</p>
            <p>That (5.) would not be done without solemnity, and ceremony nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>that</hi> they were resolved on too; resolved to pay their last duty to
their Lord with all funeral solemnities and honours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:57113:196"/>And by this time we have more than a guess when men <hi>seek Iesus that
was crucified.</hi> (1.) If they follow him day after day. (2.) If their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
be so eager on him, that they give him their attendance at the
earliest hours, <hi>suffer not their eyes to sleep, nor their eye-lids to slumber, nor the
temples of their head to take any rest</hi> till they have found him. (3.) If
neither the fear or shame of men can keep them from <hi>Him.</hi> (4.) If the
<hi>Grave</hi> it self be more their desire than their fear, willing to be dissolved
to be with him. (5.) If shame for his name be (as it was to the <hi>Apostles</hi>)
the matter of their rejoycing. (6.) If for his sake they spare no cost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Altars which represent his Tombe, and present his body, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poor who are the members of his body. (7.) If they think much
of no cost, pains, or time; no duty or reverence too much for him;
when we find any thus disposed and doing, we may confidently say of
<hi>them,</hi> They <hi>seek Iesus that was crucified,</hi> and we thus know it of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>And indeed we had need of good certain signs to know it by. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there are that <hi>cry Lord, Lord,</hi> and yet <hi>Christ</hi> himself does not know
them he professes; Many that talk of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and pretend to cast
out devils too sometimes, and do miracles in his name, have his name
the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> commonly in their mouths, and talk of it at every turn,
yet if you mark it, 'tis one <hi>King Iesus;</hi> if any <hi>Iesus;</hi> 'tis in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not on his <hi>Cross;</hi> not <hi>Iesus crucified.</hi> No, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Cross</hi>
was to the <hi>Iew a scandal,</hi> and to these men <hi>foolishness.</hi> The very sign of
the Cross disturbs them. Fools they were thought (you know) a while
ago that would take up the Cross and follow him, when they might
with more ease follow him in his Kingdom, (as was then much talkt of
when the Kingdom was in their own hands) and reign with him. But
whatever was the business of those times, the business of this is, <hi>Iesus
crucified.</hi> And if we had no other proof that they still seek not <hi>Iesus
which was crucified,</hi> but that they are yet ashamed to give any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to his <hi>name,</hi> so to acknowledge him; ashamed too of the very
badge of <hi>Iesus crucified,</hi> the <hi>sign of the Cross</hi> upon which he was; not only
ashamed of it neither, but not ashamed to oppose it, and write and
preach against it, and disturb the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> and simple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> souls
about it; if, I say, we had no other Argument against them that
they <hi>seek not Iesus which was crucified,</hi> I know not how they would inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate
and less answer it. He certainly that cannot endure the sign
would less endure the thing it self, nor seek him certainly that hung upon
it, if he must succeed him there.</p>
            <p>Nay, we our selves who profess right enough, live not, I am afraid,
sometimes, as if we sought or served a crucified <hi>Iesus,</hi> or indeed a Jesus.
Our devotions to him are dull and heavy, slow and careless; we come to
<hi>Church</hi> as if we cared not whether we came or no; we are niggardly and
sparing in the embalming of Christs <hi>Body;</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the poor;
we are afraid of pains and charges in his service; we are ashamed too
often to be found doing well, lest the Wits and Gallants of the Age
should laugh at us; afraid to be too ceremonious lest we give offence to
I know not whom; ashamed of patience or humility lest we should be
thought poor spirited Christians, that is, the servants of so poor spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
a <hi>Lord,</hi> that would rather suffer himself to be so horribly abused and
crucified than to head his fathers Legions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight for him.</p>
            <p>He that sees how we have kept our <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> how we always keep it;
how little we mortifie our lusts, how little we restrain our passions, how
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57113:197"/>
much we indulge our appetites, how far we are from crucifying our sins,
or subduing our flesh, or dying to the world; how profuse men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are in their apparel, how studious of vanities, how pour'd out in
riots and excesses, how given up to their sports and pleasures, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
taken up in some or other of these when they are even walking
to their Tombs, and should be thinking upon their Graves; how every
day they still post off all serious and religious thoughts and never think
of <hi>Christ</hi> or of his <hi>Cross,</hi> either what he did, or what he suffered for them,
or what he would have us to do upon it; He cannot but say, I know ye
seek <hi>not Iesus that was crucified.</hi> I see no Balms in your hand, no Spices in
your laps, no tears in your eyes, no sorrow in your faces, no funerals by
your garments, no solemness or seriousness at all in any of your demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that carries any semblance of relation to <hi>Iesus crucified;</hi> All so
loose, so fine, so quite of another fashion, that certainly it were a
tyranny over my faith, to impose upon me to believe that you <hi>seek</hi>
any such as a <hi>Iesus that was crucified,</hi> that any such as you do so at
all.</p>
            <p>I did not think to have made so severe an observation, but that I find
men think commonly that strict devotion is but womens work, they
themselves may live with greater freedom, but so it is not; 'tis only this
seeking <hi>Iesus</hi> we have spoke of can really arm us against the <hi>Grave,</hi> or fit
us for the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> And great persons do so too; too often think 'tis
for those only of lesser rank, the simpler and the mean ones: <hi>they,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
have enough to do to dress, and visit, and talk idly, and take a
liberty from morn to night answerable to their <hi>greatness,</hi> their fortune,
or their youth; This story of <hi>Iesus crucified</hi> spoils all the sport, and lays
all their honour too soon in the dust. Well, notwithstanding we had
better all of us have the <hi>Angel</hi> here than <hi>they</hi> commend us, <hi>his</hi> testimony
rather that we <hi>seek Iesus that was crucified,</hi> than <hi>their</hi> wits that make light
of it.</p>
            <p>III. And yet methinks they here are but slenderly rewarded for it, for
all their pains. Now they have done all, <hi>He is not here.</hi> That we call'd the
correction of their search.</p>
            <p>And however we think of it, 'tis a good reward, to have an <hi>Angel</hi> set
to keep us right, to tell us when we do amiss. Let <hi>me</hi> never want one, <hi>O
Lord,</hi> to do so; <hi>Let him smite me friendly, and reprove me.</hi> There are even
Balms, says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> that will break ones head, <hi>Psal.</hi> clxi. 6. and
smooth ways we often stumble in; smoothing and anointing does not
always cure us; too often betray us. To tell us always, O Sir, you are
right, you do well, excellently well, is but a way to ruine us. <hi>Thou art the
man</hi> is better far; you are out, <hi>He is not here;</hi> you seek wrong, when we
do so, as necessary, as to tell us, we seek right, when so we do. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the <hi>women</hi> were right both for him they sought, and the way they
sought him; but for the place, <hi>that</hi> they were amiss in. Even <hi>in many
things we offend all,</hi> says St. <hi>Iames,</hi> Jam. iii. 2. For <hi>there is no man that sinneth
not,</hi> 2 Chron. vi. 36. And 'tis our happiness when we are timely told it,
that we go not wrong too long.</p>
            <p>And it was timely here indeed. The <hi>Angel</hi> would not have them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in an error. It was a good work they came about, but he would
not let them do it upon false Principles. Men do so often, do that which
is good upon a wrong ground; <hi>seek Christ</hi> too often so.</p>
            <p>Sometimes (1.) they <hi>seek him in the Grave,</hi> that is, in fading dying things,
in earthly comforts, or for such things. But he is not there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:57113:197"/>Sometimes (2.) they <hi>seek him in the Graves</hi> of sins and lusts, whilst they
yet continue in them; whilst they are yet in their Rebellions, Schisms,
Pride, Covetousness, Malice, Envies, and Disorder, they pretend to
seek <hi>him,</hi> even none but <hi>him;</hi> but his body fell not, as those <hi>Israelites,</hi> in
the graves of lust. He is not there.</p>
            <p>Sometimes (3.) they seek him in a melancholy fit, in a humour sad
as the grave, in a mood of discontent, all godly on a sudden; they have
buried a Friend, or Son, or Wife, or Brother, are disappointed of a Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have miss'd of an Estate, lost an Expectation, and are now forsooth
for a fit of heaven, a seeking <hi>Christ,</hi> but, <hi>He is not here;</hi> you'l see it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the day clear up again; the Monk will quit his Cell, the Dog will
to his Vomit, he's presently where he was.</p>
            <p>Sometimes (4.) they seek him in outward Elements, in meer Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and Formalities, and mind no further; think if we hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or come to Prayers, make a Formal shew of Piety and Religion,
all's well; But if we bring not somewhat also within, some hearty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
devotion with us too, <hi>He is not here</hi> neither; A few <hi>linnen Cloths</hi>
you may find perhaps that look fair and handsom, and the External
Lineaments of a sad sober Piety, like the dimensions of the <hi>Grave;</hi>
but dead mens cloths they are; and a <hi>Grave,</hi> an empty <hi>Grave</hi> it is still;
if our hearts be taken up with them, stopt and buried there, <hi>He is not
here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes (5.) we seek him perfectly in a wrong place, where the
malice of his enemies only thrust him for a time amidst dust and rubbish,
He is not there; He will be sought in the <hi>beauty of holiness;</hi> now <hi>he is
risen, there</hi> shall you find him: for he does not love to dwell in dust,
though amonst us that are so. We must find him a fitter place to be
in; Now <hi>he is risen,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are risen, our low condition chang'd into a
higher, our Poverties into Plenties, our Rags into Robes, our Houses
almost into Courts; 'Tis fit his House and Courts should also rise into
lustre and glory, and he not be in Badgers skins whilst we dwell in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars,
nor lie upon the cold stones or earth, whilst we lie upon Silks and
Velvets.</p>
            <p>And now you see why it is when we <hi>seek Christ</hi> we so often miss him.
We seek him where he is not to be found, amidst Graves and Sepulchres,
whilst we are dead in trespasses and sins; or buried over head and ears in
earth and earthly interests; or only in some sad distemper, when we are
so weary of our selves that we wish for death; or only in dead Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Rites without the life or spirit of devotion; or with that
slightness and neglect as if we thought any thing good enough for
him, or that he would be content with any clod of earth to lay his head
on.</p>
            <p>But these are the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Grave.</hi> He was not to be found, last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
even in the <hi>Grave,</hi> without a <hi>Mystery.</hi> He could not be held in the
<hi>Grave</hi> they laid him. <hi>It was not possible,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> ii. 24. God had
promised he would not leave him there, <hi>Psal.</hi> xvi. that his flesh should see
no corruption. Here was the mistake these good <hi>women</hi> made; they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
understood not, or had forgot this promise; and believed not his
own, that he would rise again. This is that St. <hi>Lukes Angels</hi> even chide
them for, for forgetting: <hi>Why seek you,</hi> say they, <hi>the living among the dead?
Remember what he spake to you while he was yet in Galilee, saying, the Son of man
must be delivered into the haads of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day
rise again,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 5, 6, 7. It was a piece of infidelity, it seems, now
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57113:198"/>
to seek him in the <hi>Grave,</hi> so that well may the <hi>Angels</hi> ask them why they
do it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, our <hi>Angel</hi> here is not so rough: But you must know this was
the first time of their error. When they had been told it once or twice
before, first, by St. <hi>Matthews Angel,</hi> and then St. <hi>Marks,</hi> that he was not
there, 'twould make even an <hi>Angel</hi> chide to see them still continue in
the same mistake. At the first 'tis <hi>Angels</hi> method to be smooth in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of reproof.</p>
            <p>Nay, and some times to pave our way to it, with a <hi>Fear not,</hi> I do not
mean to hurt you, what I am to tell you is only for your good. This is
but with <hi>Balaams Angel</hi> to stand only in our way with a Sword drawn
to hinder us from a fruitless journey, or at the worst but to smite
us friendly with it, that we may go no further on upon wrong fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Fear not, He is not here!</hi> is not the Inference ill? Are they well
joyn'd? <hi>Why, he is not here,</hi> and therefore <hi>fear</hi> seems a better conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
If he be not here we have lost all our labour, all our cost. If he
be not here, some body has stoln him hence, and taken away even that
little comfort that was left us of seeing him once again, and doing our
last office to him. Thus <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> complains indeed, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xx. 13.
Well, but for all that, depose your fears, if you should find him here
you might fear indeed, and despair for ever. He had deluded you, he
had broken his promise with you, that he would come again; he was <hi>no</hi>
Saviour, but his body a meer dead trunk like other mens; your hopes
were all taken away, and all of you undone for ever. But now he is not
here you may hope better, and dread no longer, and I shall quickly put
you out of all fear indeed, for I shall tell you now, <hi>He is risen,</hi> as he
said.</p>
            <p>IV. And now indeed, <hi>O blessed Angel,</hi> thou saist something: Away all
my fears, <hi>He is risen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why then (1.) He is above the malice of his enemies, and of all that
hate him. <hi>They,</hi> and the Souldiers that crucified him, may be dismaid,
and look all like dead men for fear, but I shall never be dismaid hereafter,
seeing death has no more dominion over him.</p>
            <p>For (2.) if he be risen we shall rise one day too. If our head be risen,
the body ere long will rise also. He is <hi>the first fruits, 1 Cor.</hi> xv. the whole
lump of course will follow after. So certain, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that
in <hi>him</hi> we are all already made alive, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and with indignation asks
how some among them durst be so bold to say there was <hi>no resurrection of
the dead,</hi> seeing <hi>Christ is risen,</hi> ver. 12.</p>
            <p>But is he not rather <hi>raised</hi> than risen (3.) that they durst say so? Was
it by his own power or anothers? By his own sure; for all the <hi>Evangelists</hi>
say unanimously <hi>he is risen.</hi> Indeed, 'tis said, <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 10. that God rais'd
him from the dead. It was so; for he was God himself, he and his
Father one, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> x. 30. so God rais'd him, and yet he rais'd himself;
was not rais'd as the <hi>Widows</hi> Son, or <hi>Iairus Daughter,</hi> or his Friend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
but <hi>so</hi> as none other ever were or shall be rais'd and risen, and
yet so risen as not rais'd by any but himself, that's a third note upon <hi>He
is risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (4.) risen <hi>so</hi> as to die no more. All <hi>they</hi> did, but he not. He
convers'd a while with his Disciples upon earth, so by degrees to raise <hi>them</hi>
too; but after forty days he ascended into heaven. Risen surely to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
risen above all heavens, risen into glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:57113:198"/>And if thus risen, we have good cause, (1.) to raise our thoughts
up after him, entertain higher thoughts of him than before; though
then we knew him after the flesh, yet now with the <hi>Apostle.</hi> henceforth to
know him so no more.</p>
            <p>Good cause, (2.) If He be risen, to raise up our affections after him;
set our affections, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> infers it, upon things above, <hi>Col.</hi> iii.
1, 2. and no longer upon things beneath; set them wholly upon him.</p>
            <p>Nay, and (3.) Raise our <hi>selves</hi> upon him, build all our thoughts and
hopes upon him; build no longer upon Sand and Earth, but upon that
<hi>Rock</hi> that is now risen higher than we, in whom we need fear no storms
or tempests; we cannot miscarry.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, lastly, Now <hi>he is risen,</hi> let <hi>us</hi> rise and meet
him; rise in hast with <hi>Mary,</hi> yet not to go to the <hi>grave</hi> to weep, (as
they thought of her) but to cast our selves at his feet, and cry, <hi>Lord, If
thou hadst been here,</hi> if I had found thee in the <hi>grave,</hi> my brother and I,
and all my brethren had died indeed, been irrecoverably ruin'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
And yet for all that, <hi>Come</hi> now and <hi>see where the Lord lay.</hi> Be your
own eyes your witnesses that <hi>He is risen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis but just, that in so doubtful a condition of affairs, and a
change so unheard of, you should seek an evidence not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.
<hi>Come</hi> then and <hi>see</hi> it. <hi>The place</hi> will shew it, and your eyes
shall behold it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, that <hi>he is risen,</hi> as he said, to a tittle, to a day, assoon as ever
it could be imagined day, is an argument, that <hi>not being</hi> here, <hi>he is</hi> truly
<hi>risen.</hi> Yet 'tis fit that we should be certain he is not there.</p>
            <p>For 'tis fit that we should be able to give a reason of the faith that is
in us, says St. <hi>Peter.</hi> We can neither believe unreasonable things our
selves, nor imagine others should believe them. We are not to take
our Religion upon trust from an <hi>Angel. Si Angelus de Coelo,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
Not from an <hi>Angel</hi> coming from Heaven it self. Some <hi>Angel</hi> it seems
thence may (speaking to an absolute possibility) preach some other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
then what we have received, but believe him not, says the
<hi>Apostle</hi> if he do, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8. But suppose an <hi>Angel</hi> thence can speak no
other, yet there is an Angel that is from below, from the pit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that can <hi>transform himself into an Angel of light.</hi> We had therefore
need take heed to our own eyes too, as well as to our ears. The best
way to fix them is to look first into the <hi>grave</hi> of <hi>Iesus that was crucified,</hi>
see what we can find there to make good what the <hi>Angel</hi> tells us, be he
who he will. <hi>Try the spirits,</hi> says St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> i. 4, 1. <hi>Whether they be of God,</hi>
before we trust them. See whether things are as they are presented. 'Tis
but dark day yet, we may be deceived if we look not narrowly into the
business, even to the very inmost corners and cranies of the <hi>grave. Come
see</hi> then what is there.</p>
            <p>Nothing but the <hi>linnen cloths</hi> that wrapt him in, says S. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xx. 6, 7.
and <hi>two Angels,</hi> says St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 4. Well, this was enough indeed to
prove he was not there. But how proves it that he was risen? had not
some body stoln him thence? The grave was clos'd, the stone was seal'd,
the guard was set, and who durst come to do it? His <hi>Disciples?</hi> why,
they were stoln away themselves for very fear. And it is not probable
they would venture for him through a guard of Souldiers when he was
dead, that ran from him when he was alive. The <hi>Iews?</hi> Why, they
set a watch to keep him there. The <hi>Souldiers?</hi> why, who should hire
them? or, Why should they take money to deny it, if they were hired
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57113:199"/>
to it? Besides, it was against the <hi>Iews</hi> interests, to give so fair a ground
to the report of his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi> had so little subtilty to
maintain so forlorn an interest as theirs, that it looks not like a piece of
their contrivance; and so poor a purse, God knows they had, that they
could not see so largely as to reach it. Nay, and the <hi>linnen cloths</hi> left all
behind are a kind of witnesses against it. 'Tis not probable they would
have stoln the dead body and left <hi>them</hi> when they came to steal; and the
laying them so in order by themselves, requires more leisure than a
theives hast. So being clearly gone, and clearly none to own the theft,
and none to prove it, and nothing to evince it, 'tis plain, he must be
risen, as he said. We have now, then, no more to do, then <hi>see the
place where,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And <hi>where he lay,</hi> we call the <hi>grave:</hi> A good place sometimes to go
into: the house of mourning better to go into than the house of mirth,
says <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had tried both: best to recal our wandring thoughts to
prepare both for a comfortable death and joyful <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Christs grave</hi> (2.) or <hi>Sepulchre</hi> has more in it than any else. There sit
<hi>Angels</hi> to instruct and comfort us; there lie cloths to bind up our wounds,
there lies a <hi>napkin</hi> to wrap up our aking heads; there is the fine linnen of
the <hi>Saints</hi> to make us bright white garments for the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may now descend into the <hi>grave</hi> with confidence it will not
hurt you; <hi>Christs body</hi> lying in it has taken away the stench, and
filth and horrour of it. 'Tis but an easie quiet bed to sleep on <hi>now;</hi> and
they that die in <hi>Christ</hi> do but <hi>sleep in him,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Thes. ix. 14. and
<hi>rest</hi> there <hi>from their labours,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Revel. xiv. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come</hi> then and <hi>see the place,</hi> and take the dimensions of your own
graves thence. Learn there how to lie down in death, and learn there also
how to rise again, to die with Christ and to rise with him. Tis the
principal <hi>Moral</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> and the whole business of the <hi>day.</hi> In other
words, to die to sin, and live to righteousness, that when we must lie
down our selves, we may lie down in peace and rise in glory.</p>
            <p>I have thus run through all the Parts of the <hi>Text.</hi> And now I hope, I
may say with the <hi>Angel, I know ye</hi> also <hi>seek Iesus that was crucified,</hi> and are
come hither to that purpose. But I must not say with the <hi>Angel, He is
not here.</hi> He is here in his <hi>Word,</hi> Here in his <hi>Sacraments,</hi> Here in his poor
<hi>members.</hi> Ye see him go before you, when ye see those poor <hi>ghosts</hi> walk;
you hear him, when you hear his <hi>Word,</hi> or read, or preacht. You even
feel him in the blessed <hi>Sacraments</hi> when you receive them worthily.
The eyes, and ears, and hands of your bodies do not, cannot; but your
souls may find see and him in them all.</p>
            <p>Some of you, I know, are come hither even to seek his <hi>body too,</hi> to pour
out your souls upon it, and at you holy Sepulchre revive the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the crucified <hi>Iesus;</hi> yet take heed you there seek him as you
ought. Not <hi>the living among the dead,</hi> I hope. Not the dead <hi>elements</hi> only,
or them, <hi>so</hi> as if they were corporally himself. No; <hi>He is risen and gone</hi>
quite off the earth as to his corporal presence: All now is spirit, though
<hi>Spirit and Truth</hi> too, truly there, though not corporally. <hi>He is risen,</hi> and
our thoughts must rise up after him, and think higher of him now then
so, and yet beleive truly he is there. So that I may speak the last words
of the Text with greater advantage then they are here; <hi>Come see the
place where the Lord lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And come <hi>see the place,</hi> too, <hi>where he lay;</hi> go into the <hi>grave,</hi> though not
seek him there. Go into the <hi>grave</hi> and weep there, that our sins <hi>they</hi>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:57113:199"/>
were that brought <hi>him</hi> thither. Go into the <hi>grave</hi> and die there; die with
him that died for us; breath out your souls in love for him, who out of
love died so for us. Go into his <hi>grave</hi> and bury all our sins and vanities
in that holy dust. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Go we into the <hi>grave</hi> and dwell there for ever rather
than come out and sin again, and be content (if he see it fit) to lie
down there for him, who there lay down for us. Fill your daily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
(but now especially) with his death and passion, his agony and
bloudy sweat, his stripes and wounds, and griefs and pains.</p>
            <p>But dwell not always among the Tombes. You come to seek him;
seek him then (1.) <hi>where</hi> you may find him; and that is, says the
<hi>Apostle, at the right hand of God. He is risen</hi> and gone thither. And seek
him (2.) <hi>so</hi> as you may be sure find him. Not to run out of the story,

shake and totter under you: Go on with courage, do your work, be not
afraid of a <hi>crucified Lord,</hi> nor of any office, not to be crucified for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Seek him (3.) with your holy <hi>balms and spices,</hi> the sweet odours of
holy purposes, and the perfume of strong Resolutions, the bitter Aloes
of Repentance, the Myrrhe of a patient and constant Faith, the Oil of
Charity, the spicie perfumes of Prayers and Praises; bring not so much
as the scent of earth, or of an unrepented sin about you; seek him so as
men may know you seek him, know by your eyes, and know by your
hands, and know by your knees and feet, and all your postures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors,
that you <hi>seek Iesus that was crucified;</hi> let there be nothing vain
or light, or loose about you; nothing but what becomes his Faith and
Religion whom you seek, nothing but what will adorn the <hi>Gospel of Christ.</hi>
You that thus <hi>seek Iesus which was crucified,</hi> shall not want an <hi>Angel</hi> at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
turn to meet you, to stand by, support and comfort you in all your fears
and sorrows, nor to encourage your endeavours, nor to assist you in your
good works, nor to preserve you from errors, nor to inform you in truths,
nor to advance your hopes, nor to confirm your faiths, nor to do any thing
you would desire: You shall be sure to find him too whom your souls
seek; and He who this <hi>day</hi> rose from his own <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> shall also raise
up you from the death of sin first to the <hi>life of righteousness,</hi> and from the
<hi>life of righteousness</hi> one day to the <hi>life of glory;</hi> when the <hi>Angel</hi> shall no
longer guide us into the <hi>grave,</hi> but out of it, out of our Graves and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
into Heaven, where we shall meet whole Choires of <hi>Angels</hi> to
welcome and conduct us into the place where the <hi>Lord</hi> is; where we shall
behold even with the eyes of our bodies <hi>Iesus that was crucified</hi> sitting at
the <hi>right hand of God,</hi> and sit down there with him together in the glory
of the Father.</p>
            <p>To which He bring us, who this day rose again to raise us thither,
<hi>Iesus which was crucified:</hi> To whom though crucified, to whom for that he
was crucified, and this <hi>day</hi> rose again to lift us up out of the graves of
sins and miseries and griefs, be all honour and power, praise and glory
both by <hi>Angels</hi> and Men, this <hi>day,</hi> henceforward and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Happy then this <hi>Day</hi> to us. Happy we that this <hi>Day</hi> came, which
opens to us a door of <hi>hope,</hi> have reason therefore to remember it, and
with Joy to keep it, as the first dawning of a better hope, the <hi>day-spring</hi>
of all our happiness. This <hi>Day</hi> our <hi>Head</hi> is risen, and with him our <hi>hope</hi>
has enlarg'd its borders, and made a prospect into the other World, sees
some comfort there for our sorrows here. This <hi>Days</hi> bright-shining
beams have lightned our eyes, that now we shall not sleep in death; a
<hi>Sun-day</hi> indeed, the first true <hi>Sunday</hi> that ever shone, wherein the <hi>Sun
of righteousness</hi> arose out of the Chambers of the Grave, to guide our
feet out of misty darkness into marvellous light, out of the paths of the
dead into the land of the living, out of this miserable into a blessed life
by <hi>Christs</hi> Resurrection.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Apostle</hi> gathers his Argument somewhat otherwise: <hi>If there
be no Resurrection,</hi> says He, <hi>then is Christ not risen. If Christ</hi> had not, be not
risen, say We, there is not, will not be a Resurrection. To the same
purpose both he and we, both of us making <hi>Christs</hi> rising the cause, the
ground of ours. If He, then We; if not He, not We neither. Our grounds
the same.</p>
            <p>And the inferences the same too. For whether we say, If there be no
Resurrection <hi>Christ</hi> is not risen; or, if <hi>Christ</hi> be not risen there is no Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
we affirm both, <hi>Christs</hi> rising and our own. And if either be
false, <hi>we are found false witnesses,</hi> both, nay all. Not St. <hi>Paul</hi> only, who
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57113:200"/>
saw him last, but those also that saw him first, but <hi>Cephas</hi> also and the
Twelve, but five hundred brethren at a clap, who saw him all at once.
St. <hi>Iames</hi> too, and all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who both eat and drank with him after
his Resurrection, who bare witness of it, and preacht it to the World,
preacht our Resurrection from it. <hi>False witnesses,</hi> liars all, all the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
all the Preachers ever since, who preacht nothing so much as both the
one and the other. So if either be false, our preaching is vain, (but
that perhaps is little in the worlds account, who could peradventure
willingly spare both Preachers, and Preaching too) nay, but <hi>your faith
is</hi> also <hi>vain,</hi> your hope is vain, <hi>you are yet in your sins,</hi> and when you die,
you perish, and miserable you are both alive and dead. Miserable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
We, to preach; Miserably deceived, You, to trust a Saviour
who could not save himself, but is dead and perished. Miserable both You
and We to continue in a Religion so groundless, so unprofitable, so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
so uncomfortable, so hopeless, whence little good is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
here and less hereafter, as it must needs be, if there be no other
hope in <hi>Christ,</hi> but only here.</p>
            <p>But the comfort is the <hi>Text</hi> is but a Supposition, What would become
of us, if our hope were only here. Now a meer Supposition, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
a necessary consequence upon the supposal: So being but a meer
Supposition, it as evidently proves a real truth contrary to the Supposal.
<hi>If in this life only we have hope</hi> supposes, that so it is not truly, though,
truly, so it might be. And we were most miserable, says in effect, that
so we are not, though upon the supposal so it would be.</p>
            <p>So that by this we have two general parts to handle in the <hi>Text,</hi>
(1.) What our <hi>Hope</hi> might be, and what then might be the Issue. It
might be <hi>only in this life,</hi> (such hopes there are) and then the Issue would
be Misery. Then (2.) what our <hi>Hope</hi> is, and what therefore the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
It is not in this life, therefore in the other; or not in this life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then in both, a double <hi>Hope,</hi> a lasting, and everlasting <hi>Hope.</hi> And
then the Effect sure will be good, if the other end in misery, happiness
must be the close of this. The first of these is true only upon Supposal,
the second true without it. The first the <hi>Apostle</hi> only supposes, to prove
the absurdity of denying a Resurrection, or our <hi>hope</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. The second he truly means; That the <hi>Christians hope</hi> in Christ
is not only here, and he is therefore the most happy of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not, though if it were, he of all were the most desperately
<hi>miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sum must be to teach us, (1.) Where not to place our <hi>Hope;</hi>
And (2.) where to place it; (3.) What is the Effect of an ill placed
hope; And (4.) what of that which is rightly set. By both, shewing us
even the necessity of a Resurrection, and of a faithful expectation of
it.</p>
            <p>And two Kinds of <hi>Hope,</hi> now, with their several Effects shall divide the
Text, a False one, and a True one.</p>

                  <p>I. A False <hi>Hope.</hi> In <hi>Christ in this life only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And its Effect. Misery, misery, both in this life and in the other.
<hi>Most miserable,</hi> of all men most miserable: then in both lives to be

                  <p>With its Effect. Happiness, double happiness: here and hereafter
both. That, also, not <hi>in this life only;</hi> for if the other makes its
owners the most miserable; this then by the Law of contraries
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57113:201"/>
makes most happy in this world, as well as in the other. Though
there most, because there is most, yet here too, because here is
some.</p>
                  <p>The First, <hi>Hope</hi> and its Effect more plainly exprest: The Second and
its Effect as necessarily implied, both of them together, the full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I shall for once begin with the False <hi>Hope,</hi> because the <hi>Apostles</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
here seems more especially to be, to beat down that. Which once
done, a few words, and a little time will serve for the other; and as
the <hi>Apostle</hi> here does but only intimate it, so it shall serve us anon but
to touch it, lest we too much transgress the bounds both of <hi>Text</hi> and
time.</p>
            <p>To search then throughly into the vanity and misery of a <hi>Hope</hi> that
reaches short of heaven, we shall consider these four Particulars: (1.) That
such a <hi>Hope</hi> there is, a false <hi>hope</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi> That (2.) that which is in him
<hi>in this life only</hi> is such a one. That (3.) the Effect of it is misery, all those
that have it <hi>miserable;</hi> they that have <hi>hope in Christ in this life only miserable,</hi>
they. Yet (4.) of those, some more miserable than others, some <hi>most
miserable.</hi> We of all, We <hi>Apostles,</hi> We the Ministers, We the Preachers
of it <hi>most miserable</hi> of all, of all the rest. <hi>If in this life only we have hope,</hi> We
of all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a False <hi>Hope</hi> there is even in him,<note place="margin">I. General.</note> who is <hi>the hope of all the ends of
the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. That a false hope in Christ there is.</note> I would we could not say. But a false belief there is in him,
nay, many false ones, therefore a false <hi>hope</hi> too, yea, many such. For
all hope presupposes a belief, and such as our belief, such is our hope
also.</p>
            <p>We could easily, peradventure, bear it, were that hope only false,
which is in things below, in things transitory. Why? They deceive
themselves, are inconstant to themselves, no wonder then if so to us.
Health loses it self when it fails it Master. Riches decrease not more to
their owner than to themselves. Pleasure fades at the same time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it leaves the pursuer. Honour becomes but air when it is departed
from him it honoured. All earthly hopes only therefore fail us, because
their own natures fail them. The things we hope for perish, and we
therefore lose them. All this might be endured to be fail'd by failing
hopes.</p>
            <p>But that a <hi>Hope</hi> in him who cannot fail should fail us, a <hi>hope</hi> in him that
cannot deceive should delude us, who could think it? Yet too true it is.
Such a <hi>hope,</hi> many such a one there is.. When though the object be right,
or at least materially so, even <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour; yet either (1.) the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
or way of apprehending him is wrong, or (2.) the ground
false, or (3.) the reason none, or (4.) the order ill, or (5.) the managing
of it naught, or (6.) the nature of it not right, or (7.) the strength of it
not competent, or the continuance too short. We shall best understand
what this false hope in <hi>Christ</hi> is, by considering what is required to make
up that which is the true one. And to it are required (1.) a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
(2.) sure grounds,<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a true hope in Christ.</note> (3.) good reason, (4.) order, (5.) discretion,
(6.) purity, (7.) stedfastness and constancy.</p>
            <p>1. True <hi>hope</hi> should have a right apprehension of its object,<note place="margin">The several kinds of false hope compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with true ones.</note> as well as
an object that is right. 'Tis not enough to justifie our hope that we say it
is in <hi>Christ,</hi> unless it be in <hi>Christ</hi> truly apprehended. To conceive <hi>Christ</hi>
so to be the Saviour of sinners, as remaining sinners; to imagine he will
give us heaven because we imagine it; to expect he should violently
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57113:201"/>
draw us thither whether we will or no: to hope that he will save us
without doing any thing our selves is presumption at the easiest I can
speak it, but some part of it is <hi>Blasphemy, viz.</hi> To make <hi>Christ</hi> so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
sinners as even to approve the sins, by taking the persons into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and justifying them, or declaring them to be just and righteous
whilst they wilfully continue in them; and so far from truth it is, as that
himself professes he came not to save them otherwise than by calling them
to repentance,<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> St. <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. 13. Yet as bad a hope as it is, it is too common
now, commonly profest and preacht too, as well as practised, though most
injuriously to <hi>Christ,</hi> and as dangerously to themselves.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Hope,</hi> that is, true <hi>Hope,</hi> should be well grounded, now there is a
groundless one, that must needs be nought. The ground of hope is the
Word of God.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 81.</note> 
               <hi>In thy Word do I hope,</hi> says <hi>David, Psal.</hi> cxix. 81. And, that
in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ye <hi>might have hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note> says St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xv. 4. That which
hath other foundation is without foundation. Gods Word, not mans
Comment. <hi>Christs</hi> Promise, not mans Fancy must ground our <hi>hope.</hi> To
hope we shall be saved only because we hope so; To hope God will save
us only because he is merciful, infinitely merciful; or that we shall to
heaven because we perswade our selves we are Elected and Predestinated,
or conceive our selves the only <hi>Saints</hi> and darlings of the most High;
To make either our own groundless and sudden hopes, or Gods general
mercies only, or temporal successes and prosperities (which are common
also to the most wicked) or rash and obscure fancies of Predestination
and Election, or our own meerly imagined holiness and Saintship: or,
yet, some new revelation or inspiration, or some extraordinary strange
light and motion within us, (which may as well proceed from him, who
too often changes himself into an Angel of light, as from the <hi>Father of
lights,</hi> for ought we know; nay, for we know it does so, if it be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to any parcel of Gods revealed will in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that from God it is
not, if it be so) upon any of these, I say, nay, upon all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(yea, though the Prophets we have chosen to our selves, add their
word to it to assert it) to found our hope is to build it upon the sand,
that when any storm shall come from heaven, any wind or tempest of
Gods displeasure beat upon it, when temptations, afflictions, or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
sickness, or death shall smite the corners of this specious building
of our hope, down it falls, and in the dust, there, lies our hope; yea,
the fall is great, so much the greater by how much the higher, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
built. He that will ground his hope aright. must not be too sudden.
<hi>Qui crediderit ne festinet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 28. 16.</note> says the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Let him not be too hasty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<hi>He that believeth shall not make haste.</hi> To Gods general goodness and
Promises he must add some inward feelings: For his opinion of being
Predestinated or Elected he must find some ground from his effectual
calling, inward Sanctification and Renovation, constancy of faith and
resolution, as well as from Gods goodness and mercy. His holiness and
Saintship too he must not measure by his own conceit, but by the square
of Gods Commandments; Does he do that which is holy and just?
Then a <hi>Saint,</hi> not otherwise in the <hi>Scripture Phrase.</hi> New Revelations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Word of God he must renounce if he mean not to reject the
Word of God as insufficient; and his new lights and inspirations he
must bring to the light of Gods written Word, his Teachers Doctrines
must be tried also by the same evidence and rule, and answer to it too, or
his hope will be as groundless as his who never heard of <hi>Christ</hi> or God,
only serve to make him miserable. For so he is, and so will be, who thus
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57113:202"/>
fixes not his ground, who has nothing else but those forsaid imaginations
to go upon.</p>
            <p>Nay (3.) Reason too is required to our <hi>hope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3 15.</note> 
               <hi>Be ready,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter,
always to give an answer to every man that asketh a reason of the hope that is in
you.</hi> 1. Pet. iii. 15. <hi>Hope</hi> without reason is an unreasonable hope, fit for
beasts not men; unreasonable to be required of reasonable men. He
that requires me to hope contrary to reason, requires of me either an
impossibility, or a folly. I cannot truly hope that which is impossible to
my reason, that which I really conceive impossible; or I am a fool to go
about, desire, or pursue it, whilst I think so. <hi>Hope</hi> above <hi>hope</hi> I must;
nay, <hi>hope</hi> against <hi>hope</hi> I may too, sometimes, as <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have
done, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 18. that is, against the ordinary course of Nature, or
Affairs; but then only, though when greater reason perswades me to
hope against it, then to fear with it; when God expresly sends me
word, or some other way assures me he will transcend the ordinary
way with me, and not bind himself to Laws of inferiour nature and
course, and then indeed it is greater reason that I should believe God
than rely upon natural reason and ability, or ordinary providence and
common course. But then I must have either an Angel from heaven to
tell me so, or an evidence from God, which I can neither resist nor deny;
a full evidence besides that it is God that so assures me, that he it truly
is who requires my belief. Otherwise I am to trust no further than
reason will assure me, nor hope more, nor otherwise from Christ or God,
then true reason grounded upon Gods holy Word, and possibilities,
and probabilities, too, will move me to. To hope other is but to be our
own deceivers.</p>
            <p>4. True <hi>hope in Christ</hi> should be rightly ordered. First Faith, then <hi>hope,</hi>
then rejoycing in <hi>hope,</hi> then assurance, not assurance at the first dash, nor
rejoycing neither. <hi>Hope</hi> hath a kind of torment with it at the first, when
the thing we hope for is either delay'd, or a great way off. The nearer
we draw to it, the lesser is our torment, the nearer are we to our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
Whatsoever joy rises before we come somewhat nigh the thing
we hope for, is either none, or very little: and if Faith enter us not into
our <hi>Hope,</hi> if <hi>Hope</hi> be grounded upon Opinion only, not on faith, it will
scarce hold a shaking fit, See the <hi>Apostles</hi> order, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 3, 4, 5. first <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi>
then <hi>Patience,</hi> then <hi>Experience,</hi> then <hi>Hope,</hi> then, <hi>and</hi> not before,
that <hi>hope</hi> which <hi>maketh not ashamed.</hi> Till you have been tried and tried
again, patiently endured affliction and temptation, till your Patience be
grown into Experience, till you are become an experienced Christian,
have had experience both of Gods favours, and his frowns, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an experienced Souldier in the Christian Warfare, one well vers'd
in that holy trade, you cannot have the <hi>hope</hi> which maketh not ashamed.
All hope that rises not in this method will but shame you. In a word,
first the <hi>hope</hi> of righteousness in the order I have told you, then the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>hope</hi> of glory. All other is preposterous, and no better in the upshot,
than that which is in this life only, for it will not hold, or not hold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, though it talk never so much of another. No, without the <hi>hope</hi>
of righteousness here, a <hi>hope</hi> that expresses it self by righteousness in this
life, no <hi>hope,</hi> no true <hi>hope,</hi> I am sure, of glory in the other.</p>
            <p>5. There is a fifth <hi>Hope</hi> that is as vain, which neither knows how to
go about, nor pursue its ends, nor entertain them neither when they
come. A kind of people there are who lay claim to much <hi>hope in Christ,</hi>
yet when good motions arise within them to beget this <hi>hope,</hi> they either
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:57113:202"/>
carelesly neglect, or wilfully quench them; when God shews them ways
to confirm it, they mind it not; nay, when Salvation it self seems to
knock at their very doors, they sit still, and stir not so much as to open
and let it in; or if it fall out that they entertain it, 'tis with so much
vanity and self-conceit, so much empty prattle and boasting of it self,
so much shew and specious profession, that Christ in whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be all, is least of all seen in it. True <hi>hope</hi> is never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
humility and discretion, it takes all opportunities to confirm and
raise it self, manages its motions with all carefulness, sobriety, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and godly fear, expects nothing but what in prudence it may,
slips no time but what of necessity it must, uses whatsoever means it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
can, yet without the least vain ostentation, to attain what it wishes
and desires.</p>
            <p>6. To this end (sixtly) it endeavours after holiness. The <hi>hope</hi> that
does not so is no <hi>true hope in Christ</hi> at all. <hi>Every one that hath this hope pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
himself,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 Epist. iii. 3. <hi>hath his soul purified in obeying
the Truth unto unfeigned love of the Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note> adds St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epist. i. 22.
St.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a <hi>hope of righteousness,</hi> Gal. 5. 5. And the <hi>Psalmist</hi> joins
to it doing good.<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 5.</note> Hope, and be doing good, <hi>Psal.</hi> xlii. 5. as if there
could be no good <hi>hope</hi> without doing good, unless it did purifie us to all
obedience and love. This is the only <hi>hope in Christ</hi> we read of for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
and sound; a pure, holy, obedient, operative, charitable <hi>hope.</hi>
Whatever hope else is said to be in Christ, does but usurp the name,
and is no such, and brings us no whither but to the end of the <hi>verse,</hi> to be
<hi>most miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet (7.) Stedfastness and constancy must be added to make <hi>hope</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
Upon Faith it must be grounded (as we told you) and Faith can
admit no wavering.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Sure and stedfast,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 19.

<hi>Heb.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 11.</note> vi. 11. No doubtful, sad, melancholick, wavering or unconstant piece
of business, as the hopes of the world are, now up, now down, now
merry, now sad; nor as those false hopes in Christ without ground taken
up, without discretion pursued, and with impurities and impieties daily
defiled will one day prove. No, nor yet any impatient expectation, but
a hope with patience,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 3.</note> as the blessed <hi>Apostle, 1 Thes.</hi> i. 3. a quiet and
<hi>patient waiting for Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes. 3. 5.</note> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> iii. 5. to be content to endure any thing
though never so hard, any time, though never so long, and think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
too much for his sake. There are so many mens hopes of the
contrary nature, so impatient of any service or hardship, or endurance
for Christ, that with most it is come to more then an <hi>If,</hi> If they have
only a false hope in Christ, so it is without an <hi>If</hi> too evident, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
the more the pitty.</p>
            <p>I have been somewhat long in discovering the false hopes we have in
Christ, which little differ either from impudence or presumption, (to say
the least) because the religious world (as they would be accounted) is too
full of them; because so many deceive themselves with their false glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings,
and will needs be (forsooth) the <hi>Saints,</hi> the only <hi>Saints</hi> who <hi>have
hope in Christ,</hi> who neither know the nature nor feel the power of it. More
false hopes even in Christ there are, but such as may well be reduced to
these heads; as many false hopes as false beliefs, and they are more then
I can tell you, more then any can, more however then the day would
give us leave to tell you, if we would, or could.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:57113:203"/>A <hi>hope in Christ,</hi> (1.) that misconceives him, (2.) a groundless, (3.) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,

no, nor themselves neither, though by an uncouth kind of holy
language, through spiritual pride, they would fain seem to speak mysteries.
No, <hi>the Father of Lights</hi> uses no Dark-Lanthorn language. If they
mean good, why may we not understand them? If they fear not the
detection of their falshoods, why do they cloud themselves and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in unscripture-like phrases? If they hop'd like Christians, they
would speak like such, not like Barbarians, and then should we plainly
understand them. For St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hope in the place fore-mentioned, and
the hope of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever since was in plainess of speech (we know
what it means) from which these men so professedly swerving, we may
justly suspect they are swerved also from the hope of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and
all Christian <hi>Fathers,</hi> have set up also a new hope different from theirs,
and are become a kind of Christians different from them. This is a note
you shall scarce meet with; but the observation of the hopes of our
times compared with those of the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words
brought it to my hands; and it almost seems the symptom, by through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examining it, of all false, heretical and groundless hopes through all
ages in <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi> as they rose; the changing the <hi>Catholick</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
phrase into other terms: a new uncouth language for new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
faiths and hopes.</p>
            <p>By what has been said, you may now easily find out, whether your
<hi>hope in Christ</hi> be as it should be, whether it will make happy or miserable.
And by the same you may as easily perceive how false hopes generally
delude the world. Yet to give you only a short prospect of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
now at last, that you may see them fully and yet briefly too,
take it thus:</p>
            <p>For men to play the <hi>Devils,</hi> and yet pretend to hope in God; to
study <hi>Schism,</hi> Faction, and Contention, and yet pretend hope in the
<hi>Prince of Peace;</hi> to run all the ways of destruction, and yet hope Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
to strive for nothing but this world, this only in all their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and yet hope for another; to look for their portion and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
hereafter, and yet will needs have all that is here; to hope for
another life, and lead this no better; to be so solicitous to place <hi>Christs
Kingdom</hi> here, and yet mind none other but their own; to keep a do to set
up <hi>King Iesus</hi> here (as they love to speak) and yet not suffer him to reign
or rule in any of themselves; to hope for the reward of Peace-makers, to
be call'd the <hi>Saints and Children of God,</hi> and yet be the only Peace-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Peace-disturbers in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> nay, and the great War-makers
too; to hope for the reward of being persecuted for Christ, and yet
daily persecute him in his members, and that even for his sake too, for
his Religion and a good Conscience; to hope for the reward of the
meek, the poor in spirit, the pure in heart, which amounts to as much
as Heaven and Earth, and yet be the most impure and proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57113:203"/>
exalting themselves <hi>above all that is called God,</hi> proud of vertues and
graces, and proud of sins, enormous sins too, are such riddles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
are such groundless, senslless, impudent hopes, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pretend of Christ, they are not only such as are in this life
only, fading, vanishing and vain, but so only in Christ, as in the meer
sound and noise and <hi>eccho</hi> of the name, and even the greatest injury that
can be done it, the vilest abuse that ever the name of Christian hope yet
suffered.</p>
            <p>Yet are we to proceed to another still. A hope in Christ, only for
this life, the Second Particular we propounded, a hope that pretends
no further then this present life: In this so much the more modest than
the other, in that it pretends no further then it acts; in this only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the other: This denies the Resurrection, the other the power
of it; this more expresly, the other implicitely; this sometimes both
in words and deeds (so much the honester,) the other in deed only, in
words never, so much the proner to deceive us: But who are they, now,
whose hope in Christ is only in this life? Or, what is it to hope in Christ
in this life only? Lets see a little.</p>
            <p>1. They plainly <hi>have hope in Christ in this life only,</hi> who deny his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
For if he be not risen,<note place="margin">2. That hope in Christ in this life only is a false hope also, and what it is.</note> if he be yet in the Grave, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
among the atoms of the dust (alas!) there must needs our hope end
too, thither must it go and sleep there for ever. He was no more then
a poor man as we, if he be not risen; and if our hope be in man <hi>whose
breath is in his nostrils,</hi> then when God takes away his breath he dies,
and our hopes die with him. The point of Christs Resurrection then
is the hinge of all our hope. Best to keep close to that Article, or we
lose all our Religion quite, and must go seek some other. If he that
should save us be not able save himself; if our hope be hid in him, and
he hid for ever in his ashes; if he that should deliver us, delivered
not himself from death, we have no reason to expect beyond it, and
then little comfort to look beside it upon any good we can here get by it.</p>
            <p>2. They who deny our Resurrection, can hope no further in Christ
then in this life only. If we rise no more here's all we look for. And
if Christ, in whom we hope, can do us any good, it must be here, for
he has no where else to do it, if when we die we perish. So to deny a
Resurrection, is plainly to confine our hope within this present world,
to the narrow limits of an uncertain life. Yet such there were in the
<hi>Apostles</hi> times,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. some among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who said
there was no Resurrection of the dead. Of which sort also were <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Philetus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 18.</note> who affirm'd the Resurrection was past already, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
ii. 18. nothing more to be expected, and thereby says St. <hi>Paul, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the faith of some.</hi> I cannot punctually point out to you amidst
the confused rout of Errors and Heresies, which now swarm and reign
amongst us, any such who dare yet expresly say so much. Yet if they
who are so hot for Christs temporal reign upon earth (of which there
are good store) be not such, they look very like them; like men, I am
sure who <hi>have hope in Christ in this life only,</hi> or at least too much in it,
more than they should; and if we may guess at them by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they and many other of that pious rabble seem to mean it, and
would express it, if it were time to do it; or it may be, do it already
in their Congregations and private Meetings, if we could come to hear
them. I am sure it concerns them much that there be no Resurrection,
and to think so too, if they desire to go on confidently and quietly,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:57113:204"/>
without the throbs of an accusing and condemning conscience in the
courses they are in.</p>
            <p>3. Such are they also truly in effect, who deny Christs satisfaction,
who will acknowledge no other benefit from his Life, or Death, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
than good example. If he be risen only for himself, or not risen
at all, 'tis all one to us; all one, I say, to us, if we have no benefit by his
Resurrection: I think they will not say themselves we can rise out of the
grave, only by a pattern. If there be no power in his Resurrection that
extends to us, well may he be risen, but we shall not rise if he raise not us.
We know then quickly where is all our hope.</p>
            <p>4. Such are they again, who only follow Christ for loaves, who only
therefore embrace or follow the Christian faith, and take up Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
only to mantain themselves, and such or such a Sect thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the only way they see to live and thrive by. Here at this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
now, you see there are more hopes in Christ in this life only than
perhaps before you did imagine; whilst you behold so many change their
Religion, new-form their faith, new-model their profession, alter and
assume opinion after opinion for this poor thing we call a life, for the
poorest things of it, to save the skin or gain a peny. An act so unworthy
of a Christian that it blasphemes the name, and makes us yet put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>If,</hi> to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> If this be faith in Christ, any is. If this be true,
there is none vain. If these be <hi>Christi fideles,</hi> who are <hi>Infideles? If these be
Christs faithful ones, who are infidels?</hi> Who, but those who look for another
World, who believe that Christ is risen, and they shall one day rise after
him, and therefore in the interim rise above this foolish world and the
things of it in all their thoughts?</p>
            <p>5. Many other hopes there be which have too much tincture of this
life in them, too much infected with the interests of this present life;
which seem so much to be possessed with it, that upon loss of Friends, or
Liberty, or Estate, or Honour, or the fear of such probable or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
losses, the men that have these hopes only, they grieve, and moan,
and fear, and are perplext, and troubled, and amazed, as men <hi>without
hope,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> stiles them, without hope of a recompence of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as if Christ either could not, or else would not make them a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for all their sufferings, all thir losses, and therefore go like men
forsaken and forlorn, not weighing how infinite ways Christ can at any
time both return them here, and beyond desire or imagination reward
them all hereafter, but grieve as if there were no other World but this,
nothing to make amends for ever. I say not, that these kind of hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
hopes are any thing near so bad as the other, yet bad they are, and
have too much both of distrust and worldly interest in them. Though
they deny not a Resurrection, they seem to fear it; though they reject
not quite the thoughts of another World, yet they seem to doubt it;
though they now and then think well of Christ, they dare not trust him,
unless they can feel him and his reward in present with him. The other
indeed bid defiance to him, or else march impudently against him in his
own colours; these only shrink from him, yet do enough to make us see
too much of their hope in Christ is fixed here, enough to embitter all
their lives, and make them miserable, if they settle not their souls a
little better, and rouze up their spirits to eternal hopes.</p>
            <p>6. Nay, more than so. Those very spiritual joys and inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
which we feel within us, and which sustain us in all our miseries,
are but delusions, dreams, and fancies if there be no Resurrection, if
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:57113:204"/>
we or they must end here; poor slender hopes to uphold us, if they rest
only in present complacences. The <hi>Turk</hi> (for ought we can say) has as
much in the service of his <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Idolater</hi> feels the same, if
perhaps not more, when he has done his sacrifice to his <hi>Idol;</hi> he is pleas'd
no doubt, and much rejoyces in it when he has done his Worship. Every
false <hi>Sect,</hi> no doubt, has some like complacences within, whereby it is
confirm'd in its Superstitions; and, it may be, the more to fasten them,
<hi>Satan,</hi> that <hi>metamorphos'd Angel of light,</hi> does, by adding somewhat of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pleasure to them, make those inward illusions and delights far
sweeter in the apprehension than the true Christians many times. Nay, and
the resolute Sinner shall find a kind of subtle delight and appearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in the custom of his sins, (especially of spiritual sins, false Zeal,
Heresie, Schism, Singularity, or the like) does so commonly for a while,
till Conscience begin a little to remember him; would do so for ever but
for the tang and touch of conscience, which ever and anon strikes in on
a sudden and thwarts or allayes them, which yet it could not do if there
were no Resurrection to call them to accompt. So that those great
pledges and fore-runners of our eternal happiness would be either none,
or not what they are, or but the fading glances of a perishing hope, if
they had not a relish from those infinite and everlasting joyes we look for.
And whoever he is, that shall endure what a Christian must, only for
those slender (and peradventure uncertain) contentations here (which
yet truly are not so much, or it may be, none at all to fully reasonable
souls if they bring not with them the promises of a fuller stream of a
yet-to-be-expected satisfaction) whoever he be, he does but vainly
place his labour. It is the glances of the other World that make any
thing look beautiful in this. It is only those eternal sweetnesses above,
which give the taste to all these below of what kind soever, if they
relish truly well. And be our hopes, though in Christ himself, fed
with any thing but them, or with things that have relation to them, we
may put them all into this number, that the Apostle reckons only to make
<hi>most miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be they hopes in Christ without an eye (1.) to his rising out the
grave, or (2.) without our rising thence; (3.) Do they deny the power of
Christs Resurrection, or (4.) mind him only for worldly things, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other, or (5.) through infirmity fix too much upon things of this
life, or (6.) please themselves only in some inward complacences and
delights without reference to eternal blessings, they are no other. If any
of these ways only we have hope in Christ, we have hope in him in this
life only, and are of all men most miserable. Which close puts me in mind
now of the third Particular. The Effect of all these If-Hopes, these
but supposed, vain hopes, Misery, and the worst the most misery. <hi>We
are then of all men most miserable.</hi>

               <note place="margin">3. The Effect of false Hopes, Misery.</note> But what should make us so? What, but that which
makes up misery? Pain and Loss. Lost joyes, deluded hopes, and real
pains, troubles, and infelicities. We shall not need to go out of this very
Chapter, which has given us the <hi>Text,</hi> to find enough to make up a bulk
of Misery.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">1. Loss. Los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of all good.</note> For Loss.</p>
            <p>1. We have lost our head. Christ is not risen if our hope be only here.
He is dead still if there be no Resurrection, and we are at the best but
walking Ghosts, horrours to others, and to our selves. We may well
go with the <hi>Disciples</hi> to <hi>Emaus,</hi> a word that signifies forlorn people; go
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:57113:205"/>
among forlorn people indeed if he be dead still. We have lost our spirits,
our senses, our life and all, if our head be gone; we are a generation of
senseless, liveless, silly people to be Christians still.</p>
            <p>2. We have lost our labours and our sufferings too. <hi>What availeth it,
that we stand in jeopardy every hour if the dead rise not</hi> at all? <hi>ver. 30. If after
the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if
the dead rise not?</hi> ver. 32. What are all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> labours and travels, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and fastings, whippings, and imprisonments, his suffering cold and
nakedness, hunger and thirst, contumelies and reproaches, his journeys
and his shipwracks, his so many perils both by Sea and Land, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening
his body and keeping it under, his so often perils of death by
treachery, by hostility, many other ways, his so many persecutions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them even death it self? To what purpose all these if there be no
place or opportunity hereafter to reward them? What mean these
foolish Christians so to subject themselves to cruel mockings and
scourgings, to bonds and imprisonments, to stoning, burning, sawing in
sunder, to Swords, and Racks, and Gibbets? What mean they to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
up and down in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, when they may have
better clothing far cheaper? To wander up and down from house to
house, when they may at an easier rate have houses of their own? To
wander up and down in Deserts and Mountains, in Dens and Caves of
the earth, when they may with greater ease have stately buildings and
glorious Palaces to dwell in? Why are they so foolish to be thus tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and tormented, and accept of no deliverance, if it were not that
they might obtain a better Resurrection,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 35.
and so on. Else if there be no such business, <hi>Let's eat and drink,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul, for tomorrow we die.</hi> Let's crown our heads with rose-buds in the
the spring, and take our fill of loves, let's stretch our selves upon our
beds, and drench our selves in pleasures, deny nothing to our desires,
abridge our selves of no delights, care not by what means we rush into
Riches, Pleasures, Lusts, and Honours: If there be no other World,
let's take our portion here, and let's not be such fools and mad men to
lose all here and hereafter too. This is better doctrine then the cold
Precepts of Christianity if there be no other hope than what is here.
But <hi>be not deceived</hi> for all this, says our <hi>Apostle, ver.</hi> 33. 'tis but evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
this; though so it were not, but good, wise counsel rather,
if there were nothing beyond this life. But <hi>awake, awake to righteousness,</hi> for
there is a Resurrection, where both our labours and our sufferings shall be
remembred all.</p>
            <p>3. We have lost our Faith <hi>if our hope in Christ be only here; Your faith is
vain,</hi> ver. 14. Our Religion's gone, there's no such thing as that in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
then. Religion is our busines towards God, but if Christ be not
risen (as he is not, if we can hope in him no further than this life
only) then he is no God, so our Religion is but foolery, and we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
fools to busie our heads so much about it, about the name,
and nature, and worship, and service, and trusting of a dead Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that can neither help himself nor us, no nor hear a Prayer,
nor grant a Request, nor reward a Duty, nor punish an Injury done to
him.</p>
            <p>Nay, (4.) we have lost our very hope too. If we have no hope but
here, we have none at all, we can hope for nothing that flees not from us.
Do we hope for honours or riches by following Christ? We see daily we
are deluded. Do we hope for happiness by it upon earth? We see
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57113:205"/>
nothing but misery about us, and death before us. Nay, do we hope
indeed for any good by Christ yet lying in the Grave? What is it that
a dead Saviour can give us more than the dead Idols of the Heathen?
We see and feel our hopes in this life already vain, and for hereafter we
can see nothing at all without a Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Yes, say some now adays. If the soul live we may be happy without
a Resurrection, though the body rise not, if the soul be but immortal.
Fond men! who consider not how <hi>if</hi> the body <hi>rise not, then Christ is not
risen</hi> (the <hi>Apostles</hi> own way of arguing, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.) and then our faith,
which was in Christ being perished, as being no other than in a helpless,
hopeless man, the soul can neither enjoy, nor expect a happiness from,
or by him, and has lost all other by following him already. Not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
again how the greatest misery that can betide the soul is to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
desolate and disconsolate for ever without both her body and her
Christ, depriv'd eternally of all kinds of hopes. Not considering, last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the souls immortality necessarily infers a Resurrection, it being
but a fore-runner and a harbinger for the body, to which it hath so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
a reference and inclination, that happiness it could have none, when
separated from the body, if it did not perceive the certainty of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
rising a while after to accompany it. It could not without that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
but be incessantly tormented with its own unsatisfied and ever to
be unsatisfied longings, which it could throw off no more, than it could
its own nature and essence, it being essentially created and deputed to the
body.</p>
            <p>But Loss makes not all our misery.<note place="margin">2. Pain or sense of evil.</note> Not only loss of good, but sense of
evil concurs also to make us miserable. And here's enough of this, too, for
us, if in this life only be our hope. <hi>You are yet in your sins,</hi> that first. And
what greater evil, I pray, than sin? What greater misery than to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dominion of it? To be torn in pieces with the distractions of our
sins, to be tormented with inordinate desires, to be hurried up and
down with exorbitant lusts, to be enslaved to the drudgeries of so base
commands, to be rackt with the terrors of a wounded conscience, to be
distracted quite with the horrours of inevitable damnation, to be at war
continually within our selves, to be commanded by every petty lust, to
be a drudge to every filthy sin, to have a soul and body full of nothing
but pollution, nothing clean, nothing pure, nothing quiet, nothing
peaceable within it; thus to persist and continue, thus to live and die,
neither our own Masters, nor our own men, no misery more miserable.
You talk of slavery and tyranny, there's none like this of sin and lusts.
<hi>Ye shall die in your sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> says <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> viii. 24. as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
misery he could leave them under. Sin'd we have all, and die in them
too we must all of us as well as they, for all Christ, if we have no hope
in him but here. He is not such a Saviour as can deliver us, if he have not
delivered himself; or if he have, and we yet will not hope in him beyond
this life, and the things of this life, we shall also die in our sins and be <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi>
as well as they.</p>
            <p>This is ill enough, yet there is a worse misery behind: We shall perish
too. <hi>Then all they also who are faln asleep in Christ are perished,</hi> ver. 18. perished for
ever; whether you take it for <hi>annihilation,</hi> or for <hi>damnation,</hi> whether for
being dissolved into nothing, or being damn'd for ever, either of them is
misery enough.</p>
            <p>Let the best befall you that can, 'tis to perish into nothing, (and yet
there are that say it is the worst, that to be annihilated is worse than to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57113:206"/>
be damn'd; perversly, I fear, more to maintain a cruel opinion against
Gods goodness, (which in some mens favour meerly they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
obstinately to defend) by setting up an absolute reprobation, then
that either sense or reason can perswade any unprejudiced judgment, that
it is so.) Well, be that kind of perishing what it will, let that be it, to
have our breath vanish into the soft air, as the <hi>Wise man</hi> Phrases it, and
have our bodies disperse into insensible <hi>Atomes,</hi> or rather to become truly
nothing, you cannot think it but a misery; if for nothing else, yet for
this, that men of honour and understanding should become no better
than the beasts that perish, to have so fair and glorious a building as
mans moulder into nothing. And if death alone be terrible, to die into
nothing is to nature much more, insomuch as it is further from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of it than any the most horrid corruption or putrefaction. If a
man die, shall he live again? In <hi>Iobs</hi> worst <hi>agony</hi> was but a question: but
if a man once fall into nothing, He, the same He, cannot live again is
no question at all. He shall not, cannot. Something may be made of
nothing, but the same thing cannot be re-made out of it. There is not
any thing, hell only excepted (for we however, for our parts, will except
that) can be so bad, so far from all the properties of all kind of good,
<hi>Metaphysical, Physical,</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> too, as this <hi>Non ens,</hi> this <hi>Nothing</hi> we must
resolve into at the best that can befall us if there be no Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But I may go a strain higher, and tell you but the truth. If there be no
Resurrection, yet they that <hi>sleep in Christ,</hi> sleep (if I may use so soft a
word) in damnation too. The Soul is immortal (however some in this
worst of Ages are so impudent to give out it is not, because they truly
wish it were not, and it much concerns them that it should not, yet) the
Soul, I say, is immortal and cannot die, must therefore upon necessity be
miserable, if it depart its lodging without hope either of seeing its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Saviour, or her beloved body ever again; must needs wander, and
pine, and fret, and desire, and despair, and be never satisfied, find no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in any thing, no ease in any turn of thought, or motion of desire,
restless and unsatisfied every way, every where for ever.</p>
            <p>Nay, again, whether there be any Resurrection or no; <hi>If Christ be not
risen</hi> too, we may yet perish everlastingly, amidst the everlasting fires.
For our Saviour will prove none, our Religion none, our recompence no
other than those burnings.</p>
            <p>Nay, lastly, if there be a Resurrection, and if Christ be risen too, yet
if our <hi>hope</hi> be not risen also, if we believe, and hope, and desire no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than this life only; if our endeavours and labours be only for this
life we live, if our hopes be none other than one or other of those
false ones, which I have told you of, the place of eternal torment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
is only what we can expect, even so to perish, there to be miserable
for ever.</p>
            <p>Sum up now the issue of our hopes, without relation to another life,
and tell me what they are all else but misery. To lose our head, our life,
our Saviour, our pains and labour, all our sufferings too; to lose our faith,
our Religion, our hope and all, to live and die without it; to live perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
under the tyranny of Sins, and Lusts, and Devils, and in death to
depart uncomfortably into torments, or, at the best, to be no more, to
become meer nothing; to live a miserable, wretched, tedious life, full of
rigours and austerities, denying our selves the freedom and pleasures that
all others take, a life full of afflictions and miseries too, for no better a
recompence than meer nothing at the last, nothing at the best, yea, worse
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57113:206"/>
rather than what we can imagine nothing at the most, and that without
any hope for ever, has all the ingredients of the utmost misery.</p>
            <p>And yet in miseries there are degrees, and of miserable persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
too; some more miserable than others, some most miserable. 'Tis
the last of the four Particulars of the first General. <hi>We of all men are most
miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> Christians,<note place="margin">4. The persons which are most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all.</note> that you have heard, <hi>we</hi> of all Religions the <hi>most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
But of all Christians, <hi>We</hi> the <hi>Apostles, We</hi> the Ministers of Christ, <hi>We</hi>
the <hi>most miserable</hi> of those, who are the most miserable company, <hi>We</hi> more
more miserable than all the world beside. This is still behind.</p>
            <p>Two things the Holy <hi>Apostle</hi> in this very <hi>Chapter,</hi> adds to make it so. <hi>We
are</hi> then <hi>found false witnesses of God, ver.</hi> 15. What could be said more to
our dishononr? To be nothing else but a company of base, impudent ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
to make a Trade and Profession of it to gull people into misery, to be
the Devils own Embassadours and Agents to bring in souls daily into
Hell, to add this dishonour to our misery, not only to be miserable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but both the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sers of their miseries by so dishonourable a base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as a perpetual course of lying, and the wilful Authors of our own, is
that which adds much height to our already too great misery.</p>
            <p>To this there is an addition, yet, <hi>Our Preaching is</hi> also <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in</hi> and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<hi>ver.</hi> 14. We are persons of whom there is no use, our Function so
far from holy, that it is but folly; our labour and studies (from the first
of those tedious days and broken nights of studies, of our exhausted spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and neglected fortunes and preferments to attend our work) to no
purpose at all. Thus besides those common miseries of a hopeless life
with other Christians, We have most vile dishonour, and a whole lost
life, and a whole vain course of labour added to encrease our misery.</p>
            <p>A third addition we have by the same Pen in this <hi>Epistle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9, 10, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. <hi>v.</hi> 9.
and so forward to augment our misery beyond a Parallel. <hi>We</hi> are <hi>men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
unto death, made a spectacle unto the World, unto Angels, unto Men; fools
for Christs sake, weak</hi> and <hi>despised, hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> and <hi>buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted,</hi>
and <hi>without any certain dwelling place,</hi> outed at any bodies pleasure,
labouring day and night, reviled, persecuted, defamed by every tongue,
made the filth and off-scouring of the world, and of all things even to
this day, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. hated and envied of all kind of men; the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
you,<note place="margin">S. Joh. 15. 19.</note> says our <hi>Master,</hi> for whose sake it does so, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 19.
hated of all men said I; yea, hated of God too, if our preaching be
vain, and there be no hope in Christ but here; <hi>Miserable</hi> fools sure, no
such fools in the world again as we, to endure all this in vain, to place,
or keep our selves in so slavish, so dishonourable, so troublesom, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive,
so contemptible a condition, when with the same or easier pains,
less cost, fewer broken sleeps, more worldly content, larger liberties,
fuller friendships, freer entertainments, greater hopes we might take
many several ways and courses of life more profitable, more pleasurable,
more honourable: Nor can we be so ignorant of our selves and parts
many of us, nor find we, else, any other reason to distrust, but that we
might in any other way promise to our selves as much power to mannage
other means of thriving then Books and Papers, as any others, if we
would apply our selves to the same ways and undertakings with them.
And had we no other hope but here, you should quickly find we could
do so, were we not confident we serve a <hi>Master</hi> the <hi>Lord Christ, whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
as it <hi>is perfect freedom,</hi> so it is perfect honour, whatever the world
imagine it, or please to call it; were it not for the hope of a Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57113:207"/>
when we shall find a sufficient recompence for all the affronts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and ill usages we suffer here, where these ragged blacks shall be
guilded over with the bright beams of glory, where we, whose office it
is to turn many unto righteousness, (whatever be the success) if we do
our duty, shall shine like <hi>Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. xii. 3. So now you
see the scene of the <hi>Text</hi> is altered quite, there is evidence enough by our
willingly and knowingly subjecting our selves to all these fore-mentioned
sufferings, that our <hi>hope in Christ</hi> is not only here, and we no longer,
never <hi>miserable.</hi> All before but a Supposition, this the Truth (which I
told you should be the Second General, though only summarily and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
briefly) that, Our <hi>hope,</hi> the true Christians <hi>hope</hi> is not <hi>in Christ</hi>
for <hi>this life only;</hi> and therefore whoever is, he, to be sure, is not <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That our <hi>Hope</hi> is not only here,<note place="margin">II. General. The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hope is not in Christ for this life only.</note> is evident by so many signs, that I
shall only need but shew and name them as I pass. We willingly suffer
hardships, bear restraints, deny our freedoms, debar our selves many
lawful liberties, lay by our hopes of worldly honour, think not of the
most profitable and probable preferments, we contend to rigours and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities,
we watch our paths, we mark our steps, we make scruples
where the world makes none; we accept restrictions in our lives, that
the worldling and gallant laugh at, the whole business of our life is to
be accepted of Christ our Saviour, we remember his benefits, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his days, we believe his Resurrection and keep this Feast upon it; we
solemnize the memory of all his other glorious actions, sufferings, and
mercies, with all holy reverence and godly fear, with thankfulness and
love; we hear his Word and study it, we strive to do his will and fulfil
his Commandements, at every point passing by the satisfactions of our
own inclinations and desires; we receive his Sacraments and believe
their power, we by this <hi>days solemnity</hi> confess his rising, and profess our
own; we leave all worldly interests for his, bid adieu to all contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which stand not with that, which is in him; we suffer any thing
gladly for his sake, to be counted fools and mad-men, despised and
trampled on, revil'd and persecuted, exil'd and tortur'd, and slain for
his sake, for our hope in him, for that we fear to displease him, to lose
his reward. These are full manifesto's of the true Christians hope, what
it is he looks for, what he means. For who now can think by the very
naming of these doings and sufferings, truly acted and willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
that our hope is either not in Christ, or not in him beyond this
life, who so easily contemn this, all the glories and pleasures of it, and
choose with deliberation and full consent that only in it, which the
world counts misery, or affliction? Especially if he but consider that we
are not crazed men that do so, but have our senses perfect, our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
clear, clearer many of us than the greatest part even of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
men, the same passions with other men, as sensible of any evils
or afflictions naturally as any others, and yet notwithstanding choose all
this for our hopes sake in Christ only.</p>
            <p>And when all these shall be new heapt, and more imbittered to the
Ministers of the Gospel above others, through the spite of the world, and
the malice of the Devil on purpose to drive them from their hope, and
they daily see and know it, are they such miserable fools and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
think you, not only to perswade others to these courses, but
themselves also so readily to undergo them when they might enjoy
all liberties and pleasures at an easier rate as well as others, did
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:57113:207"/>
they not verily believe and hope, and even see and feel already by
evident testimonies both within and without, an abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
hovering over them, laid up for them, superabundant, in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>

thou so much maligned'st shall reign in glory.</p>
            <p>Miserable they were not here, maugre all the world could do against
them; they had that peace, that joy, that contentment still within, which
the world could neither give, nor take away. They found an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as well pleasure as glory in their very afflictions and bitterest suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
being exceeding glad, and counting all joy to be made so like their
<hi>Master,</hi> whose <hi>Ministers,</hi> or whose Servants they were; with him, <hi>despising
the shame</hi> and trouble of a contemptible and afflictive life or death, for
the joy set before them, for the hope they saw at the right hand of the
Throne of God. Thus feeling nothing that could be truly or properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
misery, whilst they took pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
he did,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 10. whilst it all serv'd only to their contentment
here, and augment their happiness and glory hereafter, they sure lost
nothing then, they are not miserable now, who are so faln asleep. And lift
up your heads, ye drooping Christians, still, they shall not be miserable,
that so at any time fall asleep, but rise and live again, and be yet more
happy, every one in their order, every star their glory, every star a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ray, according to their hope and sufferings here; as no men so
little miserable here, if all things be truly pondered: so no men so happy
hereafter as the Christians; they of all men, above all men, souls and
bodies, both Pastor and People, all that live and die under the glorious
hope of a Resurrection by Christ, who place not their hopes or affections
in this life, but in Him and in the other, of all men, they, most blessed,
most eternally blessed.</p>
            <p>To which blessed estate after this life ended, He who is our <hi>Hope,</hi> and
who (we hope) will keep us in it. He in whom we trust, and I trust, shall
do so still, not for this life only, but the other too, but for ever. He of

               <q>
                  <p>Vho shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand up in
his holy place?</p>
                  <p>Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, and hath not lift up
his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho shall ascend,</hi> indeed, if none must ascend but he that
is clean and pure, and without vanity and deceit?
The question is quickly answered, None shall, for
there is none <hi>so:</hi> dust is our matter, so not clean; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
is our nature, so not pure; lighter the heaviest
of us than vanity, and deceitful upon the balance the
best of us, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxii. 9. so no ascending so high for any
of us.</p>
            <p>Yet there is one we hear of, or might have heard of to day, that
rose and ascended up on high, was thus qualified as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks
of, all clean and pure, no chaff at all, no guile sound in his mouth,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 22. Yea, but it was but one that was so; What's that to
all the rest? Yes, somewhat 'tis. <hi>He</hi> was our <hi>head,</hi> and if the head be
once risen and ascended, the members will all follow after in their
time.</p>
            <p>Indeed, 'tis not for every one to hope, any but such as are of <hi>his,</hi> that
follow <hi>him,</hi> that belong to <hi>him.</hi> 'Tis a high priviledge that the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
stands admiring at, and therefore not for all; yet for all that will, for a
who shall here is a who will, set up for all that will accept of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Quis ascendet,</hi> is who <hi>will,</hi> as well as who <hi>shall.</hi> They that will take
the pains, will do what they can to be clean and pure, <hi>they</hi> shall. His
innocence and purity shall help out for the rest when they have done their
best. But if any man will ascend he must do his best, must be clean and
pure with Christ, and through him, or he shall not ascend and rise up
after him. 'Tis the Lesson we are to learn, from <hi>Ascension day</hi> to <hi>Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
how to ascend after Christ into the hill of the Lord, how to rise up
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57113:208"/>
in his holy place, <hi>even to have clean hands</hi> and <hi>pure hearts,</hi> not <hi>to lift up our
minds to vanity,</hi> or <hi>swear to deceive our neighbour,</hi> to have our hands ascend,
and our hearts ascend, and our minds ascend, and our words ascend, as
into his presence, all ascend after him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalm</hi> is one of them which the <hi>Church</hi> appoints for <hi>Ascension day,</hi>
and I see not but it may very well pass for a kind of Prophesie by way of
an extatical admiration at the sight of Christs Ascension. So it pass'd
with the Fathers, and with our Fathers too, may so with us; for never
was it so fulfill'd to a tittle as by Christ and his Ascension. He the
only <hi>he</hi> of clean hands, and pure heart, and holy mouth, and holy <hi>all,</hi>
he the first that entred heaven, that got up the hill, that entred into
the holy place not made with hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 24, &amp;c. Not any doors so
properly everlasting as those of heaven, nor they ever open'd for any
King of glory to come in, as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 7. but him. I cannot tell how we
should expound it otherwise, without much more metaphor and
figure.</p>
            <p>Yet I will allow it too for the <hi>Prophets</hi> admiration at the fore-sight of
the happiness of Gods peculiar people, and their condition: that God,
whose the whole earth is and all its fulness, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. should out of all its
places choose <hi>Sion</hi> for his place; he whose the World is, and all that
dwell therein (as it follows there) should choose out the <hi>Iews,</hi> amongst
all the dwellers, to dwell among, them only to serve him upon that hill;
that, further, this God, whose all is, should still of this <hi>all</hi> so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
honour some, as to give them the priviledge of his hill and holy
place, his solemn Worship and Service, to go up first into his holy places
upon earth, and then afterwards ascend into the holy places the heavens
(for the words mean the one as well as the other.) Who are they? What
a sort of people are they that are so happy, so much exalted upon the
earth, and over it? 'Tis worth the admiring, worth the enquiring, and
we find it presently who they be, even such as have <hi>clean hands,</hi> and
<hi>pure hearts,</hi> that <hi>lift not up their minds to vanity,</hi> not <hi>their mouths to wickedness
or deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Sum,</hi> these are the only men that shall ascend those everlasting hills,
those eternal holy places, that are only worthy to enter into Gods houses
and holy places of the earth too, obtain those admirable priviledges,
that are innocent, and pure, and just, and true, the only <hi>men</hi> worth the
admiring, as the Church and heaven, the hill of the Lord and his holy
place are the only <hi>things</hi> are worth it; Heaven is for none but such, and
when we enter into the holy places we should all be such, as none have
right to enter them indeed but such.</p>
            <p>Well, now the business of the Text is in brief the way to <hi>Sion,</hi> and to
Heaven, to the hill of the Lord, and his holy place, both that here, and
that hereafter, where we have,</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Condition of being admitted</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Condition of them that are.</hi> The first in the former of the two

               <item>
                  <p>I. The Condition of being admitted or ascending into the hill of the
Lord, or standing up in his holy place, what it is, that is, what,
or how great a business it is to be Gods peculiar people, to be
allow'd to enter into his Courts here, and into Heaven at last; what
it is; why!</p>
                  <p>'Tis (1.) a <hi>priviledge;</hi> some one, not every one; some few, not all;

                  <p>'Tis (3.) a <hi>holy one,</hi> 'tis to the hill of the Lord, to a holy place.</p>

these priviledges, is,

            <p>The Priviledge we are to speak of is a real one, a high one, a holy
one, an admirable one, a glorious one; and though hard to be come by,
yet to be come by (though) through him. The condition upon which we
are to come by it, (1.) Innocency, (2.) Purity, (3.) Righteousness,
(4.) Truth, yet all too little without him. He ascended to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that we also might ascend after him, that's the Lesson we are now
to teach you; two parts it has, the Condition of the Priviledge of the
hill of the Lord, and the Conditions of our Performance for it; the one
the Condition to be obtained, and the other the Conditions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
the admission into the hill of the Lord and his holy place, that
the Condition to be obtained; Innocence and Purity, freeness from
vanity and deceit, they the Conditions to obtain it. I now enter upon
the first, to shew what is the Condition we may ascend to, what a great
and glorious one it is to ascend into the hill of the Lord, and to rise up in
his holy place.</p>
            <p>I. Several senses I intimated to you of the words: (1.) Some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by the hill of the Lord and his holy place, the <hi>material</hi> hill and
house of <hi>Sion,</hi> and thence our Christian Churches; (2.) Others the
<hi>spiritual</hi> house and building, the faithful and true members of the Church;
(3.) Others the <hi>eternal</hi> house of heaven, the hill of <hi>Sion</hi> which is above.
Each of them is called Gods hill or holy place. <hi>Sion</hi> Gods hill, <hi>Psal.</hi> ii. 6.
and lxviii. 15. The <hi>Temple</hi> his holy place, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxvi. 33. The <hi>Church</hi> the
house of God, not to be us'd like our own houses, and therefore a holy
place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 22. The Faithful the <hi>Temples,</hi> the <hi>Dwellings,</hi> the <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
the <hi>House of God, 1 Cor.</hi> iii. 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 6. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
lastly, is called <hi>Mount Sion, Heb.</hi> xii. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 1. The holy place,
<hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 12. The true Tabernacle and Sanctuary, <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 2. Be it which
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57113:209"/>
of these it will, or be it all, to ascend into any of them is a condition
worth the considering; to be admitted into Gods House and Temple, to
be admitted into the Family of true Believers, especially to be exalted
so high as into heaven. To be in any of these Conditions, is to be in good
condition, a Condition which is,</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Priviledge;</hi> a peculiar favour, not for every body to arrive at, 'tis
a question who shall get it; not every one, says Christ. The faithful they
are a little flock, St. <hi>Luk.</hi> xii. 32. A chosen Generation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 9. Few
there are of such, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xx. 16. only a parcel that Christ has given him
by his Father, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> vi. 39. To you it is given, says he himself, St. <hi>Mat.</hi>
xiii. 11. to some it is given, to some it is not. So a priviledge it is to stand
thus upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the <hi>Lamb, Rev.</hi> xiv. 1. to be in the number of
those that follow him whithersoever he goes.</p>
            <p>And it will prove a Priviledge (2.) to be of those that go up to the
House of the Lord, among them that keep holy day, that is, that go up
to serve him there. Now he has not dealt so with any Nation, any but
his own, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlvii. 20. If <hi>I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, then he
will bring me again, and shew me his Ark, and his Habitation,</hi> says <hi>David,
2 Sam.</hi> 15. 25. And if a favour it be, not to be debarr'd the House of God
in <hi>Shiloh</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> is it less, think we, to be allowed the liberty
of Christian Churches, to praise God in the great Congregations?
St. <hi>Paul</hi> counts it a mercy, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> ii. 1. this gathering together unto him;
much comfort in it, as in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is
there joyn'd with it. <hi>Non omnis,</hi> I am sure we find it, all have not the
Priviledge: we are out of Gods favour the while, and he seems to
have no delight in us, when he denies us at least to suspend the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, as he did there to <hi>David</hi> when he fled from <hi>Absolom;</hi> a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
sure all count it to have a place to serve God in together,
there would not else be such contention for it, who should, and who should
not.</p>
            <p>But for that hill of hills, (3.) far exalted above all hills, to ascend
thither, to be lift so high, that's a priviledge without contradiction.
'Tis given to none but for whom it is prepared, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xx. 23. few
there are that find it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 14. 'tis meerly at our Fathers good
pleasure to give it, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 32. neither of him that wills, nor him
that runs, but of God that shews mercy; we have no other claim but
mercy to it. Only, fear not for all that, says Christ, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 32. he
ushers in the priviledge so; And (2.) strive to enter too, says he, for all
that; though the gate be streight, 'tis not impassable for them that
strive and labour for it; And then (3.) too admire his goodness, say we,
who yet leaves ope the gate to enter to any penitent sinner, that will strive
and labour for it; who sets up a <hi>Si quis</hi> in the Market-place, sets it upon
the doors and skreens of our Churches and Chappels, sets his Prophets
too to proclaim and cry it, Who will ascend, who will come and stand up
in his holy place, come serve him here a while, and reign with him for
ever? This Priviledge, though all attain not to, is not such as any are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
excluded from; that no more enjoy it, is because they volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
exclude themselves: they shall not, because they will not take the
pains; 'tis no <hi>Decree</hi> against any, though a <hi>Priviledge</hi> for some.</p>
            <p>Such a one indeed it is, and a <hi>high</hi> one too, a <hi>high</hi> Priviledge (2.) to be
Sons and Heirs to the most High can be no less, to be raised so to the tops
of the hills, above all the Nations of the World: You <hi>only have I known
of all the Families of the earth,</hi> Amos iii. 2. to be the only men that God
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57113:210"/>
knows, that he takes notice of in the World to be a <hi>Kingly Priesthood,
1 Pet.</hi> ii 9. made Kings and Priests, <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 6. this is high. And,</p>
            <p>High it is (2.) too to be admitted into his House and holy Temple.
Every one came not there, not all the <hi>Levites,</hi> not all the <hi>Priests.</hi> A high
favour it was, allow'd to some only to enter there. Why, the <hi>Lord loveth
the gates of Sion more than all the dwellings of Iacob,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist;</hi> all the
high places and Palaces of the earth are not in so high esteem with God
as the very Gates and Ports of <hi>Sion;</hi> to be suffered but to peep in there
is a higher honour, to be a door-keeper in the House of God a greater
happiness than to dwell in the most magnifique buildings of the World.
<hi>David,</hi> a King himself, had rather be there than any where. And he that
shall consider the Primitive Zeal of Christians to these hills, how they
never thought enough bestow'd upon them, how often they frequented
them, how they would not pass without going in and worshipping; how
the pious and devout souls thought it a happiness to look that way, and
a great comfort in the midst of their desolations and captivity; cannot
but confess they all thought high enough of the favour that God allowed
them in receiving them into those hills and holy places.</p>
            <p>A higher Priviledge yet it is to get up the other hill, to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven when all is done, so high, that Christ says it is not his to give,
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xx. 23. the Father hath reserved it to himself; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
higher situated than it. The very name of hill the Phrase of
the Text sufficiently shews if it be a priviledge it is a high one; Hills
are the highest places of the earth; the Church is a <hi>beacon upon a hill,</hi>
every true Disciple a light there at least; The Houses of God used to be
thought high places too, and so had in honour. And for Heaven 'tis stil'd
the <hi>everlasting hills.</hi> So to be admitted to the priviledge of any of them
must needs be a high one.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>High</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> too, that's a <hi>third</hi> addition to the Priviledge. Many
high Priviledges that are not <hi>so.</hi> Holy is the highest, most like to the most
High. To be Saints, to be called to holiness, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> say we are; to
be a holy Nation, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 9. to be Priests, as you heard
before; to have holiness engraved upon our foreheads is to be holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
every Pot in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to be <hi>holiness to the Lord,</hi> Zech. xiv. 21. is a
priviledge, and a holy one too.</p>
            <p>To go up like Saints to the hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> to keep holy-day there, to
worship before the holy Altars of the Lord of Hosts, to drink and eat in
holy vessels, to be part of his holy portion, to be made partakers of his
holy Word, and there praise the God of holiness in his holy Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is a holy honour that is done us. The highest Priviledge that wants
this, the highest Palace that is without this is but the Tents of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and they, says <hi>David,</hi> will but make us afraid. Let my Priviledge,
O God, be holy, or I care for none; that's that must bring me to his
holy hill, and to his dwelling; that hill in which he dwells amidst <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,</hi>
and <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and all his Host. Whither thirdly to ascend is the
height of the holy Priviledge.</p>
            <p>3. His holy heaven, that's the stile, the Holy of Holies St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls
it, the very Seat of the most holy God, and holy Angels, and holy Saints.
It cannot there sure be suspected to be the holy Priviledge, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the holy only to come thither.</p>
            <p>4. This holiness must needs make it to be <hi>admired</hi> too. An admirable
Priviledge we told you it was 'tis our <hi>fourth</hi> Point now. And <hi>David,</hi> as
if he had been all this while in a kind of swoon at the contemplation
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57113:210"/>
of it, breaks out now upon a sudden, with a Who is he? and what a thing
is this to ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and to rise up in his holy
place.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we cannot sufficiently admire it, that God should raise up dust
and ashes to such a height, as to make it a coheir with Christ, as to make
a Hill and holy Place of it for himself to dwell in? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, says the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi>
O the depth! Who can find it out? Who, who can reach it!</p>
            <p>That he should pitch his place and dwell among us, give us free access,
liberty to come and go unto him, to approach him when we will, speak to
him what we will, eat and drink with him when we will too; what can
be stranger? Who can wonder at it enough? How terrible is this place!
it put poor <hi>Iacob</hi> into a cold sweat to think of it before 'twas built, <hi>Gen.</hi>
xxviii. 17. Will the Lord dwell on earth? Is it true, says <hi>Solomon,</hi> Can
it be so? Lord, What am I, says <hi>Holy David,</hi> and my people, that we
should but offer to it? Lord, What is it, that we should be allow'd to
touch so holy ground with our unhallowed feet, look upon so holy a sight
with our unholy eyes, that such a <hi>glo-worm</hi> as Man should be set upon
a Hill?</p>
            <p>But above all (3.) Lord what is man, Lord what is man that thou
should'st so regard him as to advance him also into the holy Hill of
Heaven too, Lord, what can we say, what can we say? Shall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
inherit incorruption, dust, Heaven; a worm creep so high;
What? he that lost it for an Apple, come thither after all; he in whom
dwelleth no good thing, be let stay there where none but good, and
all good things are? He that is not worth the Earth, worth nought but
Hell, be admitted Heaven? Lord, What is Man, or rather, what art
Thou O Lord! how wonderful in mercies that thus priviledg'st the sons
of men! Admirable it is, worth the whole course of your days to admire
it in, and you can never enough. It will appear yet the more by the
glory that accompanies it. It is a <hi>glorious priviledge</hi> indeed, even admirable
for its glory.</p>
            <p>Even in all the senses we take the words, 'tis (5.) a <hi>Glorious Priviledge.</hi>
Glorious to be Sains, they are heirs of Glory. Glorious to be Saints in
Churches; for the Angels that are there 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 10. to wait upon us
and carry up our Prayers, for the beauty of holiness that is seated there,
for the God of Glory whose presence is more glorious there. But it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comparison to be Saints in Glory. Grace is the portion of Saints,
that's one ray of Glory. The Church, the House of God is the Gate of
Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 17. that's the entrance into Glory. What then is
Heaven it self? What is it to enter there into the very Throne of the
King of Glory? Lift up your heads O ye Gates, lift up your heads,
and let us poor things in to see the King of Glory; the Hill of the Lord
can be no other then a Hill of Glory. His holy place is no less than the
very place and seat of Glory.</p>
            <p>And being such, you cannot imagine it (6.) but <hi>hard to come by,</hi> the
very petty glories of the World are so. This is a <hi>Hill</hi> of Glory, hard to
climb, difficult to ascend, craggy to pass up, steep to clamber, no plain
campagnia to it, the broad easie way leads some whether else. St. <hi>Mat.</hi>
vii. 13. the way to this is narrow, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 'tis rough and troublesome.</p>
            <p>To be of the number of Christs true faithful servants is no slight
work: 'tis a fight, 'tis a race, 'tis a continual warfare; fastings and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and cold, and nakedness, and hunger, and thirst, bands, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
dangers and distresses, ignominy and reproach, afflictions and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57113:211"/>
persecutions, the worlds hatred and our friends neglect, all that we call
hard or difficult is to be found in the way we are to go. A man cannot
leave a lust, shake off bad company, quit a course of sin, enter upon a way
of vertue, profess his Religion, or stand to it, cannot ascend the spirtual
Hill, but he will meet some or other of these to contest and strive with.
But not only to ascend but to stand there, as the word signifies; to continue
at so high a pitch, to be constant in Truth and Piety, that will be hard
indeed, and bring more difficulties to contrast with. And yet to rise up
(to keep to that Translation) that is, to rise up in the defence of holy
ways, of our Religion, is harder still; to bloud it may come at last, but to
sweat it comes presently, cold and hot sweats too, fears and travels, that's
the least to be expected.</p>
            <p>Nor is it easie, as it often proves, to gain places to serve God in.
Temples are long in building, that of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> 64 years together. Great
preparation there was by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>that</hi> before, and no little
to the rearing of the Tabernacle. It was 300 years and upward that
Christianity was in the World before the Christians could get the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Sanctuaries and Churches. The more ought we sure to value
them, that we come so hardly by them. We would make more of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
if we considered what pains and cost, and time they cost, how
unhandsom Religion looks without them, how hard it is to perform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the holy offices where we want them, how hard it would be to
keep Religion in the minds of men, if all our Churches should be made
nests of Owls and Dragons, and beds of Nettles and Thistles. Yet I
confess, it is hard too to enter into those holy places with the reverence
that becomes them, to rise up holy there. Every one that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, does not ascend, he leaves his soul too oft below, comes
but in part; his body that gets up the Hill, the mind lies grovelling in
the Valley, amongst his Grounds and Cattel. Nor may every one be said
to rise up or stand in his holy place, that stand or sits there in it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his thoughts rise there, unless his attention stands erect and stedfast
up to Heaven when he is there: he is indeed in the place, but he unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
it; it is no longer holy in respect of him. He must ascend in
heart and soul, raise up eyes and hands, voice and attention too, that
can be properly said to ascend into the Hill of the Lord, or rise up in
his holy place. Which how hard it is, the very stragling of our own
thoughts there will tell us; we need not go to the Prophet to find a
people that sit there as if they were Gods people, and yet are not; that
hear his Word and stand not to it; that raise up their voices, and yet
their hearts are still beneath: We can furnish our selves with a number
too great of such, enow to tell us how hard it is to ascend into the Hill
of the Lord, and rise up in his holy place, so few do it.</p>
            <p>And if these two ascensions be so hard, what's the third? the very
righteous are scarcely sav'd, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 18. If by any means I may, says
St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> ix. 27. supposes he may not; he is afraid, at least, after all
his Preaching, he should become a cast-away, fall short of the goal, miss
the Crown, come short of the top of the Hill, of the holy Place. So hard a
thing is Heaven; so clogg'd are the wings of our soul, so heavy and
drossie are our spirits, and our earth so earthy, that it is hard to ascend
so high. We feel we find it; and they but deceive themselves that think
'tis but a running leap into Heaven, a business to be done wholly or easily
upon our Death-beds, when we can nor stir, nor raise up our selves, or
our heads. Who shall ascend? Whatever question it is, it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57113:211"/>
an assertion of difficulty. Who shall ascend? no man can read it,
but he will read hardness in the ascending.</p>
            <p>And yet it would be harder but for the last consideration of the words,
that 'tis a kind of admiration of the Prophets at the foresight of Christs
Ascension, He in his spirit foresaw his <hi>Saviour</hi> climb this Hill, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it. From his ascending some of the difficulty is abated. He has
led one way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> I need not tell you he has ascended in
all the senses of the words, no <hi>height</hi> of <hi>holiness</hi> but he has, none frequenter
in the <hi>Temple</hi> than he was, none in <hi>Heaven</hi> till he came thither: He the
first that made our dull earth ascend so high. He rose and ascended up on
high without the least help of metaphor or figure, rose from the Grave,
ascended into the Hill, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cended thence into the Hill of the Lord, stands
there at his right hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw him so, <hi>Acts</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ii. 53. Never said
<hi>Prophet</hi> any thing that more punctually fell out than this, he may well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
it, and so may we.</p>
            <p>Yea, and praise him too. To him we owe all our <hi>Ascensions,</hi> all the
height and ascensions of our spirits in grace and goodness, all our <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
to worship him in holy places, all our assurances and <hi>hopes</hi> of Heaven,
and the possession of it. His rising raises us, his ascending makes us
ascend. He the only prime singular one, we only as parts and members
of him.</p>
            <p>What is then left us to do? What for all this priviledge? Why? if
Christs grace, and Gods Worship, and Heaven it self be such priviledges,
I hope we will not be so silly to forgo them, or betray them. Seeing they
be so high ones, we cannot be so unworthy now to do any thing beneath
them, any base or unworthy thing. Being holy ones too, we will not be
so profane to pollute our selves or them with lusts and sacriledges. Being
so admirable priviledges all we cannot certainly but adore Gods mercy in
them. Being glorious ones too, we must glorifie him for them, count
all things dross and dung in comparison of them. Being yet hard to
come by, the more need we have to labour for them, set all our powers,
make it all our work to get them, to get grace and worship, and glory,
to ascend the hill and holy place with all holiness as the way to glory. In
a word, seeing all this priviledge comes by Christ, 'tis him we are to
thank and serve, and worship upon his own hill, and in his own holy place,
till the time come till we ascend in glory. And yet there is something
more behind, the way to this hill, the conditions required to obtain this
priviledge, what we are to perform, that we may attain it. To have
<hi>clean</hi> hands, and <hi>pure hearts, minds not lift</hi> up to <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>mouths that will
not swear to deceive</hi> our neighbour. For he only shall ascend into the hill of
the Lord, he only shall rise up in his holy place; he only is a true Believer,
he only truly worships God, when he comes to Church to worship, he
only shall go to Heaven, that hath clean hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To do both right we shall joyn both senses, understand the words as a
similitude made by our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> to instruct both <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>us</hi> in
the ways of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in the knowledge of the spiritual Regeneration
by the likeness of the <hi>Wind.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:57113:212"/>
So two <hi>Simile's</hi> there will be in the <hi>Text. Sicut Ventus sic Spiritus,</hi> and <hi>Sicut
spiritus sic spiritualis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Similitude is between the <hi>Wind</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> between the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>spiritual</hi> man, or him that is born
of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the similitude betwixt the <hi>Wind</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. The <hi>Nature</hi> of them both in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>breath,</hi> or <hi>Wind,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
them <hi>all.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. The <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> both of the one and of the other, they blow
both of them where they list.</item>
               <item>III. The <hi>Plainness</hi> of their sounds; Thou hearest the sound thereof;
both of them easie enough to be heard.</item>
               <item>IV. The <hi>Obscurity</hi> yet of both their <hi>Motions,</hi> ye know of neither of them
<hi>whence</hi> they come, or <hi>whither</hi> they go.</item>
            </list>
            <p>According to these <hi>four</hi> points will the <hi>second</hi> similitude be extended
too. He that is born of the Spirit will be like the Spirit in all four. In
his <hi>Nature,</hi> in his <hi>Operations,</hi> in his <hi>Plainness</hi> in some particulars, and his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity</hi>
in others. <hi>So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to tell you fully the true Condition of him that is <hi>born</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
I must tell you first the Nature, the Operations, and the Properties
of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And to tell you the Nature, the Operations, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> I must shew you also those of the <hi>Wind;</hi> that so by
the more perfect discovery of them we may the more perfectly admire
them, and adore and magnifie him to day who this day gave us both the
occasion and means to hear and understand them.</p>
            <p>I begin now to compare the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
word is and may be translated both. It is so in the Text. Some are for
<hi>Ventus,</hi> some for <hi>Spiritus:</hi> Breath they are both. The one, the breath of
<hi>heaven;</hi> the other, of the <hi>air:</hi> The one, <hi>Gods;</hi> the other, the <hi>Worlds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the wind is a kind of breath or spirit, but a spirit in the nicest
and subtilest sense it is not. A <hi>body</hi> it <hi>is,</hi> and not a <hi>spirit;</hi> yet the nighest
thing it is we have to liken the spirit to, as near a simile as we can find
for it; but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> is so a spirit as in <hi>no</hi> sort a body. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
with an <hi>Article</hi> and an <hi>Emphasis,</hi> a Spirit above all Spirits, the prime Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
A Spirit by <hi>Essence,</hi> an essential Spirit, or essentially a Spirit. A Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by <hi>Procession,</hi> the Spirit proceeding: <hi>personally</hi> that Spirit which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from the Father,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xv. 26. and <hi>from the Son,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xvi. 7.
which was this <hi>Day</hi> breath'd first of all solemnly into the World to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it to a heavenly life. <hi>Spiritus Dei,</hi> and <hi>Spiritus Deus,</hi> the Spirit of God,
and the Spirit which is God, and the only Spirit that can bring us all to
God.</p>
            <p>But this great Nature is too great to comprehend, too infinite to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
Nor can the Simile reach it. It falls short, and so must I and you
when we have done our utmost. 'Tis an easier Project for us both to fall
upon the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of it, though I foresee we shall often there
be at a stand too. Yet, to help our selves as well as we can, we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Operations; first by <hi>themselves,</hi> then by their <hi>Effects,</hi> and then
thirdly by their <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Compass.</hi> By <hi>themselves</hi> first.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>wind,</hi> you hear, <hi>blows,</hi> and so the <hi>Spirit blows.</hi> Yet the Spirit <hi>is</hi>
not, <hi>blows</hi> not neither like every wind. There are whirlwinds that make
a horrid noise, that whirl every way about, and turn the World up top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
turvy, upside down; the wind that is but <hi>Spiritus,</hi> a direct and orderly
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:57113:213"/>
breathing does not so. <hi>Spiritus vertiginis</hi> is but <hi>Vertigo Spiritus,</hi> the spirit of
giddiness that the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks of, <hi>Isa.</hi> xix. 14. is but the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the brain, an abuse of the name, not a spirit, but a meer humour
that makes us giddy; has made this <hi>Nation</hi> so too long.</p>
            <p>2. Blustring, and stormy winds there are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> rather than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Graves violento flamine venti,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> no such. <hi>Spiritus</hi> rather than <hi>Ventus</hi>
ours is here; a calm and peaceable one, a breath rather than a wind, a
Spirit proceeding from the <hi>God</hi> of peace, bequeathed and sent us by the
<hi>Prince</hi> of peace; so still and even, that it did not so much as disorder a
wreath of that holy flame, which this day encircled the heads of
the Disciples, but let that heavenly fire sit quietly upon them,
<hi>Acts</hi> ii. 3.</p>
            <p>3. Nor is it of this wind to which this Spirit is compared, said <hi>flat</hi>
here, but <hi>spirat,</hi> not said to blow by a word that signifies commonly only
the ordinary and natural blowing. All is supernatural here. 'Tis neither
<hi>whirling,</hi> we told you first, nor <hi>blustring,</hi> we said secondly, nor <hi>puffing</hi> wind
we tell you now; 'tis a meek, an humble Spirit; from the beginning it
mov'd upon the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. but did not swell them into waves or
billows, as natural winds commonly do, not does it now; but only
guides all our waters, passions, and motions into their proper place with
sweetness and order; which is meerly a supernatural work.</p>
            <p>4. And yet as soft and smooth as it blows, it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> a
<hi>mighty wind,</hi> Acts ii. 2. and rush in it does oft times at first with a little
sudden, and eager violence; yet two syllables, one single <hi>fiat,</hi> and all is
done; strange things we know are done by a very little wind, and that
<hi>one</hi> word of this one Spirit made the World out of nothing, and can as
easily make a nothing of the World. He can remove the greatest rocks
and mountains not only with the breath of his displeasure, but of his
pleasure too, his easiest breath. He blew the Gods of the Heathen out
of their Thrones, and spake all their <hi>Oracles</hi> dumb, blew all their spirits
in a moment thence, and yet the voice of his breathing was scarce
heard. He does so still, throws down all the <hi>Holds</hi> and <hi>Fortresses</hi> of the
<hi>devil</hi> in us <hi>sine strepitu</hi> without noise. Some rushing mighty wind some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may go before it to rouze our dulness and awake us, but the spirit
is not <hi>there.</hi> Some Earthquake of servile fear may shake us first, and
affright us from some ill action, but the Spirit is not <hi>there.</hi> Some fire or
fiery trial may first burn or scorch us, and thereby make us look about us,
or some kinder fire warm us into a better temper than formerly we were
in, but the Spirit is not <hi>there</hi> neither. But when these outward dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have sufficiently disposed us to attention then comes the <hi>still small
voice,</hi> 1 Kings xix. 12. and <hi>there's</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> that silently glides into our
souls as the small dew into a fleece of wool. Such a still, smooth, sweet
breath of wind is the true resemblance of the Spirit, and when this comes
it works wonders; that minds me of the next Particular, the <hi>Effects</hi> of
both the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two</hi> especial effects the <hi>Wind</hi> has: To <hi>purifie,</hi> and to <hi>refresh.</hi> These are
the prime Effects of the <hi>Spirit</hi> too.</p>
            <p>1. When the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> enters into the heart it purifies and cleanses it
from all pollution. This made <hi>David</hi> pray, <hi>Psal.</hi> li. 10. <hi>Create in me, O Lord,
a clean heart.</hi> Yea, but how? O blessed <hi>Prophet;</hi> why, as it follows, <hi>by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
a right spirit within me.</hi> That's the way to make him clean. No
way but <hi>that,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> will. For the Spirit is compar'd to fire, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 3.
and <hi>that</hi> purifies. To water, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> iv. 10. and that cleanses. And here
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57113:213"/>
to <hi>wind,</hi> and that blows away all the chaff and dust that is either in us
or about us.</p>
            <p>(2.) This Spirit <hi>refreshes,</hi> too. It <hi>renews the face of the Earth,</hi> Psal. civ.
30. It <hi>giveth rest and quiet,</hi> Isai. lxiii. 14. It <hi>upholds and establishes the
faint and decaying spirit,</hi> Psal. li, 12. It refreshes us in our Bonds, and sets
us free, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 15. It comforts us in all distresses, for he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the <hi>Comforter</hi> that should come into the world, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 26.</p>
            <p>(3.) Nay I may add one thing more. It not only refreshes us when
we are faint and weary, and almost dying, but it revives us even when
we are dead, is a <hi>quickning Spirit,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> vi. 63. Like that wind the
<hi>Naturalist</hi> tells us of, which in the Spring time quickens the dull dead
Earth into Herbs, and Flowers. Such a wind is this Spirit, that gives
life to every one that comes into the world; for he is the <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi>
Rom. viii. 2.</p>
            <p>But that which adds somewhat still to the fuller glory of these effects,
and must not be pass'd without a note, is, that 'tis <hi>Spirit</hi> still, this wind
blows still. For however the winds are not always in a noise and bustle,
yet some spirit of air there is that moves in the deepest stillness. <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
there is always, though not <hi>ventus;</hi> some tender <hi>breeze,</hi> though no
<hi>gale</hi> of wind, there is always stirring. And if there were not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
some such sweet breathings of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> upon us, when
those strong and louder blasts seem to be lull'd asleep; we were but
dead men, and might sleep for ever, but such there are, and we live
by them.</p>
            <p>I might, but I will not add any more to the Effects either of the
Wind, or of the Spirit. I pass on to their <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Compass,</hi> to shew
you how far their effects and powers reach. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit where he willeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I must tell you, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Vbi vult</hi> is a large circuit. <hi>Vbi</hi> is
<hi>where,</hi> and <hi>Vbi</hi> is <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>Vult</hi> is <hi>what</hi> you will, especially when 'tis
<hi>his</hi> who <hi>worketh all things according to the counsel of his will,</hi> Ephes. i. 11. So
that 'twill be no stretching to say either of the Wind, or of the Spirit,
that it bloweth (1.) <hi>Where</hi> it lists, and (2.) <hi>How</hi> it lists, and (3.) As <hi>much</hi>
as it lists, and (4.) On <hi>whom</hi> it lists, and (5.) <hi>When</hi> it lists.</p>
            <p>(1.) The <hi>Wind</hi> blows <hi>where</hi> it lists, on this side, or on that side, or on
any side, any where, and every where. The <hi>Spirit</hi> does so too, only
with more propriety to <hi>Vbi vult,</hi> doing out of the <hi>liberty</hi> of its own will,
what the wind only does out of the <hi>subtilty</hi> of its nature. No place lies
exempted from the power of his will.<note place="margin">Acts 16. 15.</note> It finds St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the
prison, and blows up the organs of their voices into Songs and Hymns.
It finds <hi>Manasses</hi> in the dungeon,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 35. 10.</note> blows there with his wind, and the
waters flow out of his eyes. It finds St. <hi>Matthew</hi> at the receipt of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
and blows him out of a <hi>Publican</hi> into an <hi>Apostle.</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mat. ix. 9.</note> It blows St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and St. <hi>Andrew</hi> out of their Boat to the stern of the Church of Christ.<note place="margin">S. Mat. 4. 18.</note>
He blows upon some in their journey,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 3.</note> as upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon others at
home,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 44.</note> as upon <hi>Cornelius;</hi> upon one in the <hi>bed,</hi> upon another at the <hi>Mill,</hi>
upon <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly.<note place="margin">St. Luke 17. 34.</note> No place beyond his compass, not the
<hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mat. 24. 41.</note> not the land of <hi>Vz,</hi> not the Deserts of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Here
and there even amongst <hi>them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jon. 2. 1.</note> he blows some into his Kingdom. In a
word, no chamber so secret, but it can get into; no place so remote, but
it can reach; none so private, but it can find; none so strong, but it
can break through; none so deep, but it can fathom; none so high,
but it can scale; no place at all, but it can come into; and none so bad,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57113:214"/>
but some way or other it will vouchsafe to visit. It makes Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
cry out as in an extasie, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 6. <hi>Whither shall I go then from
thy Spirit?</hi> or, <hi>Whether shall I go then from thy Presence? If I climb up into
Heaven, thou art there; if I go down to Hell, thou art there also. If I take the
wings of the morning, and remain in the uttermost parts of the earth, even there
also shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</hi> No place,
it seems, in Heaven or Earth, or Sea, or Hell it self, can hold him
out.</p>
            <p>Nor can any hold him to this or that way of working neither? for He
bloweth (2.) <hi>How</hi> he lists; sometimes louder, sometimes softer, sometimes
after this manner, sometimes after that. He raises new inclinations, or he
cherishes the old; He changes the tempers of men, or disposes them; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
opportunities of doing ill, or he propounds opportunities of doing
good; he scares us with threats, or allures us with promises; he drives us
with judgments, or he draws us with mercies; he inflames us within, or
he moves us from without, which way soever it pleases him. No wind
so various in its blowing. Different ways he has to deal with divers men:
and <hi>diversities of gifts</hi> he has for them too, <hi>differences of Administrations,
diversities of Operations,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 5. To one he gives the <hi>word of wisdom,</hi>
to another the <hi>word of knowledge,</hi> to another <hi>faith,</hi> to another the <hi>gift
of healing,</hi> to another the <hi>working of miracles,</hi> to another <hi>prophesie,</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>discerning of spirits,</hi> to another <hi>divers kinds of tongues,</hi> to another the
<hi>interpretation of tongues,</hi> all from the Spirit, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Chapter. Nor was this only for those times. He still breaths di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of gifts and graces, as he pleases. On some sanctifying graces,
on others edifying. On others both. To some he gives a cheerful, to
others a sad spirit: to some a kind of holy lightness; to others a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gravity; to one a power wholly to quit the World, to another
power to stand holy in it; to one an ability to rule, to another a
readiness to obey; to one courage, to another patience, to a third
temperance, and so to others other graces, as he thinks fittest.</p>
            <p>(3.) Yet of these gifts, to some more, to some less, not to all alike:
nay, not to the same person always alike neither, but (3.) as <hi>much</hi>
only as this Spirit will. All have not faith alike nor hope alike, nor
charity alike, nor courage alike, nor patience alike; neither all vertues,
nor any vertues all alike. Upon some the <hi>abundance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> dwells,
upon others he breaths only: some have had exstasies, others but only
moderate breathings. <hi>Eliah</hi> had abundance of the Spirit, yet <hi>Elisha</hi> has
it <hi>doubled, 2 Kings</hi> ii. 9. And yet this very same <hi>Elisha,</hi> that presently
upon it divides <hi>Iordan</hi> with the wind of a Mantle, and restores waters
to their sweetness, and earth to its fruitfulness by a cruse of Salt,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> ii. 21. in but the very next <hi>Chapter</hi> cannot so much as prophesie
without a <hi>Minstrel, ver.</hi> 15. is not so much as in a disposition to receive
this divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> without the help of an Instrument of Musick to rally
his spirits into harmony and order. St. <hi>Paul</hi> who was but even now
caught up into the <hi>third Heavens, 2 Cor.</hi> xii. 1. feels by and by such a
<hi>thorn</hi> in the <hi>flesh, ver.</hi> 7. that of all that great extraordinary proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he has no more left him than a poor pittance, a mere sufficiency,
<hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>(4.) And the Person is as much in his own power as the measure is.
He blows not only what, but upon <hi>whom</hi> he will. <hi>He is no mans debtor,</hi>
Rom. xi. 35. <hi>He will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy,</hi> Rom. ix.
18. What? if He to shew his justice, will no longer breath upon some
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57113:214"/>
persons who have so long despised his mercy, and yet to make known
the riches of his glory, will yet breath somewhat longer upon others, that
for ought we know, may have deserv'd as little, Who can complain?
seeing he blows sufficiently upon all, and is not obliged either in justice
or mercy to do more, but justly may do all, where or upon whom
he will.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Vbi</hi> there is behind. He is free also for his own time; for he
(5.) bloweth <hi>when</hi> he listeth. Upon some in the <hi>womb,</hi> as upon St. <hi>Iohn
Baptist;</hi> upon others in the <hi>Cradle;</hi> upon some in their <hi>child-hood,</hi> upon
others in their <hi>youth,</hi> upon others not till <hi>gray-hairs</hi> cover them. In the
morning, at the third, the sixt, the ninth hour, in the evening, in the
still of night, in our sleep, and when we are awake, are all his times as
he pleases to make them, or dispose them. In prosperity, in adversity,
in the midst of tears, or in the midst of smiles, in health, in sickness,
whensoever it pleases him. He call'd <hi>Samuel</hi> in his childhood, <hi>David</hi> in
his youth, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his manhood, <hi>Manasses</hi> in his age, and that which
without contradiction shews the unlimittedness of his power, the <hi>Thief</hi>
upon the Cross.</p>
            <p>I shall dismiss this Point, if you please, to take home with you these
<hi>Corollaries</hi> or Lessons hence.</p>
            <p>(1.) If the Spirit <hi>bloweth where</hi> it listeth. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are not certainly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any place, or Nation, from these blessed gales, or with the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
to confine him to any corner of the world, or to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
we are of, as if he could blow no where else. Learn Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>(2.) If the Spirit bloweth <hi>How</hi> he listeth. We do but shew our folly
to prescribe <hi>him</hi> his way. He knows what best he has to do, how best
to mannage us to Salvation. Learn <hi>Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) If it be as <hi>much</hi> too only as he lists. 'Tis not sure our merit or desert
if we have more of him than others, nor perhaps their demerit always
who have less. Whatever it is, 'tis more than we deserve, both they
and we. Let that suffice to humble us, and make us thankful. Learn
<hi>Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4.) If it be only upon <hi>Whom</hi> he pleases, 'Tis certainly sometimes
upon some we know not. So we have no reason to pass a censure upon any
mans soul. Learn to <hi>think well of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so much the rather in that (5.) he bloweth <hi>When</hi> he will. If
he has not already, he may hereafter breath, upon him or her thou
doubtest most. If thou perhaps thy self feel'st him not within thee now,
thou may'st ere long. Learn hence, to despair neither of thy <hi>self</hi> nor
<hi>any one else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, seeing all his actions are so free, all his blessings, and all
the ways of them so wholly in his own breast. Let us all resign up all our
wills to his, and submit them wholly to his pleasure for time and
place and manner and measure, and bid him do with us what he
pleases.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, Would we not now willingly know somewhat of
these mysterious and stupendous operations? There is somewhat, I
confess, towards it in the next Point, and I shall shew you it, that
though you cannot perfectly discern the motions of the Spirit, you may
yet hear the sound thereof; that's the <hi>third</hi> General of the <hi>Text,</hi> the
<hi>plainess of the sound,</hi> both of the <hi>Wind</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> easie enough both
of them to be <hi>heard And thou hearest the sound thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:57113:215"/>
III. For the <hi>Wind,</hi> I need not tell you it, it speaks loud enough some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to wake the drowsiest sleeper; though we cannot see it, we
can hear it. And so we may the <hi>Spirit</hi> too, as invisible as he is.
Now two sounds there are of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> An <hi>Outward</hi> and an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that heard the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> preach, they
heard the outward; so in St. <hi>Stevens</hi> case the <hi>Iews</hi> are said to resist
the <hi>Spirit by which he spake,</hi> Acts vi. 10. They that now hear them
read or preacht, they still hear the sound of the Spirit. For so <hi>Christ</hi>
tells us, It is not they, the Prophets and the Apostles that speak, but the
<hi>Spirit that speaketh in them,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 20.</p>
            <p>The <hi>inward</hi> sound of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to be heard too. When thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest
pious and godly motions rise within thee, when at any time
good desires come upon thee, when holy resolutions spring up within
thy bosom, when thou feelest thy soul overspread with heavenly
light, and the divine truth preaching to thine understanding, then
thou hearest the inward sound, then this Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> begins to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and converse with thee. And truly though none of these be
properly sounds, but only <hi>metaphorical,</hi> yet they are plain expressions
of the Spirit, and may well go for the sounds of it to discern it by.
Yet that you may not mistake false sounds for true ones; if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
what has been spoken scatteredly already in the discourse of the
<hi>Nature, Operations</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the Spirit, you will easily find the true
ones to be these.</p>
            <p>If the motion that at any time within us be pure and heavenly,
calm and gentle, if it purifie our hearts, if it cleanse our affections,
if it penetrate the bones and marrow, if it cool the feavers of our lusts,
if it blow out the coals of our wrath; if it blow down the fortresses
of sin, if it blow up good resolutions, if it blow away the dust that
hangs too often upon our good actions, the interests and by respects,
if it refresh the wounded spirit, if it warm us with holy flames; if
it quicken us to all obedience to God and Man; if it cause the
the fruits of the Spirit, the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. to bud up in us,
then 'tis doubtless from this Spirit, and they are all as so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds of sounds that loudly speak his being and breathing in us.
Whatever motion, sound, or language is not consonant to one or other
of these, let men talk of the Spirit what they will, they are not of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> nor does it make them spiritual men that
have it.</p>
            <p>Thus far our <hi>knowledge</hi> of the Spirit extends, these are the sounds it
makes within and without us. But our <hi>ignorance</hi> of it extends further.
More of it there is that we know not, than that we know; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this deciphering of the nature, effects, and sound of the
<hi>Wind</hi> or <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Obscurity</hi> of the course it takes, and the <hi>Motion</hi> it
moves in is far greater; <hi>for thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
it goeth.</hi> Nor <hi>wind</hi> nor <hi>spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. For the <hi>Wind</hi> first; They are but general notions we entertain
of it. <hi>God brings the winds out of his treasure,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> cxxv. 7.
Out of those hidden chambers they come, but where those chambers
are we cannot tell. On a suddain they arise, ere we are aware, and away
they go; and who can follow them? Who can trace their steps, or
track their way, or over-take them in their lodging at night, or tell
us where it is?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:57113:215"/>
Ask <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and let that answer you. <hi>Whence</hi> is it that the winds
arise? It answers you, from a thin and airy vapour drawn up out of the
earth towards the middle Region of the Air, but repercust or beaten
back by the grossness of some intervening cloud which drives it down
obliquely with that violence we hear and feel. This, or something as
obscure, is all the knowledge we can get of it. For ask now where
that vapour rose? It cannot tell. Which way it went? It know sit
not. In what part of heaven it first became a wind? It cannot point
it out. What is become of it now 'tis gone? It resolves you not. Into
what part of the world it is retir'd when all is still? It cannot answer you.</p>
            <p>We use to say, from the <hi>East,</hi> or from the <hi>West,</hi> from the <hi>North,</hi> or
from the <hi>South,</hi> yet so uncertain must we needs confess the first point
of their motion, and so many points do they vary ere they come
at us, and so quickly are they gone by us, that the wisest of us all
cannot tell exactly either whence they were, or whither they will.</p>
            <p>But yet again, if it be no more than such a kind of wind as is in the
<hi>Text,</hi> not <hi>Ventus</hi> but <hi>Spiritus,</hi> a meer <hi>breath</hi> of wind or air; <hi>that</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we know not whence it comes, or whither it goes.</p>
            <p>And yet the ways of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are more unsearchable: We know not
any thing at all of his eternal <hi>Procession,</hi> it was before any time we can
imagine; We know nothing of his course or motion all that infinite
while before the World began. We understand nothing distinctly of it
ever since. His motions are so intricate, so various, and so infinite we
cannot comprehend them. The dispositions, the gifts, the graces he
works daily in us we know not how they rise, or how they spread, or how
they vanish. Descend we a little to particulars.</p>
            <p>We are sometimes mov'd, we feel, by the words of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> by
the reading of a Chapter, by a devout Book, or a godly Story, and yet
we know not why more now than at another time; why at this time by
a little touch, and not before by long perswasions; why sometimes by
weak and slender, at other times not by any means; why to vertue oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
contrary to our former natures and dispositions without any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given, all sensible interests and motives clear against it, whilst to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
more easie and kindly to us we cannot be wrought. Nor know we
what becomes of any of those holy motions when they depart, or we
thrust them from us.</p>
            <p>But if we should go about to dive into those hidden secrets of his
Counsel, why he should blow upon us, and not upon others as good as we;
why upon the <hi>Iews</hi> so fully, upon all the world besides so sparingly; why
he should take this <hi>woman</hi> from the <hi>Mill,</hi> and not the other that works by
her; why of two in the same bed he should refuse the one, and choose
the other; why he should by the same words and motions to two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men of the same tempers and education, and at that time, as
near as can be conjectured, in the same way and disposition breath effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
upon the one, and not the other, save this man presently, and
leave the other to himself; we are here wholly at a loss, they are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of which we can say neither whence it is, nor whither it tends, but
only to the glory of his grace, and because it so pleases thee O <hi>blessed
Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing now we have told you all we can of <hi>Sic Spiritus,</hi> of the first
similitude, the similitude betwixt the Wind and the Spirit, let's now see
what we can make of <hi>Sic Spiritu natus,</hi> of the second similitude betwixt
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and every <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>born of it. So is every,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:57113:216"/>
II. General. That He that is born of the <hi>Spirit</hi> should be some way
like it, is no wonder, because he that is begotten may well be like him
him that begets, he that is born like her that bore him. But how he
comes either to be so begotten or born, or be so like, <hi>that</hi> may easily put
us to a stand, yet <hi>that</hi> too will come in as one part of the similitude. For
four Points of likeness we shall observe between the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>him</hi> that
is born of it, as we did before between the Wind and the Spirit it self.
Like they are in their <hi>Natures,</hi> in their <hi>Operations,</hi> in their <hi>Sounds,</hi> and in
their <hi>Motions,</hi> in the <hi>Evidence</hi> of those, and the <hi>Obscurity</hi> of these.</p>
            <p>1. They are like in <hi>Nature</hi> first. The Spirit spiritual and heavenly,
and so is he that is born of it. He breaths nothing but heaven, speaks
nothing else, lives there, his Conversation wholly there, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 20.
his affections all upon things above, his fashion not according to this
World at all; his face, his eyes, his hands, his feet, his ways look
thither all. He is so like him that he is now perfectly another thing than
what he was before, new soul, new understanding, new will, new affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
new all, body and all; <hi>that</hi> fram'd into new obedience, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a new life, a meer new creature, every way; nothing of earth or
flesh, but all Spirit now. You shall see the likeness of his nature plainer
in the second Resemblance, the likeness of his <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> to
those of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Operations of the <hi>Spirit</hi> we told you, (1.) were calm, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and so are His who is born of the Spirit. Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering,
Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance, these
are the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 22. and he that has the Spirit, has all
these: He that has not, is none of his.</p>
            <p>The Effects (2.) of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are purifying, refreshing, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And he that has this Spirit, as well as he that has this hope the
Apostle speaks of, (1.) <hi>purifies himself from all uncleanness both of flesh and
Spirit.</hi> Then (2.) refreshes and comforts others, all that need it. And
(3.) brings forth also all good fruits, is fruitful in good works;
they mistake sadly that think themselves or others spiritual men without
them.</p>
            <p>And yet the strangest Operation is behind. <hi>The Spirit bloweth where it
listeth.</hi> And can we make the Spirit and spiritual man agree here too?
Let's try a little. Two things there are in it: A <hi>power</hi> and a <hi>liberty</hi> of
blowing. 'Tis evident there must be power to do any thing every
where, and as evident there must be liberty to do every thing any
where. And both in power and liberty we shall find them like; and first
in <hi>power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is a Spirit of <hi>power,</hi> he that is born of it is a <hi>man</hi> of <hi>power.</hi>
An <hi>host of men cannot so much as make him affraid,</hi> Psal. xxvii. 2. Sin it self
cannot overcome him; He that is <hi>born of the Spirit he sinneth not,</hi> 1 John
v. 18. He is able, with <hi>Simeon,</hi> to break all the cords of it, to smite all
such <hi>Philistims</hi> before him, when this Spirit comes upon him. Nor <hi>Death,</hi>
nor <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> nor <hi>Principalities,</hi> nor <hi>Powers,</hi> nor <hi>things present,</hi> nor
<hi>things to come,</hi> nor <hi>Height,</hi> nor <hi>Depth,</hi> nor any other <hi>Creature</hi> can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 38. Over all these he is more than Conquerour.
Those things which before we were regenerate seem'd impossible, when
we are once born again are light and easie; we can do any thing then
through his Spirit that dwelleth in us. Stablish us once with this free
Spirit, and 'tis not cold or nakedness, hunger or thirst, wearisome jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
or dangerous shipwracks, stripes, or imprisonments, racks, or
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:57113:216"/>
gibbets, fire or faggot, that can force us from our hold, or over-power us.
This very Spirit upholds us in all our pains, and at length blows away
every thing that troubles or offends us.</p>
            <p>Nor is this <hi>Spirit</hi> only a Spirit of <hi>Power,</hi> but (2.) of <hi>Liberty</hi> also, and
<hi>where the Spirit is, there</hi> there is <hi>Liberty,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, 2. Cor.</hi> 3. 17. that is,
he that has it, is free too. Free he is (1.) from the bondage of
<hi>Moses Law,</hi> redeem'd from under that, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 5, 6. Free (2.) though
not from the <hi>Obligations,</hi> yet from the <hi>Rigours</hi> of the Moral Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> iii.
13. <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 6. Free (3.) from <hi>Sin,</hi> made free from that, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 18.
from the <hi>Dominion</hi> of it. Free (4.) from the <hi>Captivity</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi>
recovered out of his snares, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 26. Free, lastly, from the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>
of <hi>Death,</hi> the sting of it is lost, the victory of it gone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
xv. 55. So is every one free that is born of the Spirit. Well may
now his fame go out into all the World, and his name into all the
corners of the earth. And indeed, it does so in the next words, in
the next <hi>Point</hi> of the similitude, <hi>Thou hearest the sound thereof.</hi> Evident it is,
and evident it is to any, heard it may be, and any one may hear it, <hi>Thou,</hi>
and <hi>Thou,</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> every <hi>Thou</hi> that will.</p>
            <p>Evident it is first. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is not a <hi>fancy,</hi> nor are the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it so neither. The <hi>Spirit</hi> though it cannot be seen it self,
yet something there is <hi>of</hi> it that may be <hi>heard,</hi> heard, <hi>somewhat of
it,</hi>
by the hearing of the ear; the effects not always in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
only; these very ears we carry are oft refresht with the
sound of it; our very senses sensible of the strength and power of
it. And he that tells us of grace or Religion all within, of so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God in the Spirit, that neither our own, nor other bodies, are
the better for it, or shew any signs of it, has turn'd his Religion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
into air and imagination, and not to Spirit. By <hi>his</hi> fruits you shall
know as well the <hi>spiritual</hi> man, as the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor has he, secondly, one peculiar <hi>ear-mark,</hi> one tone and cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dialect to discern him by. He that is born of the Spirit is a
free, and noble, and generous Spirit, uses a Language that every
body may understand. 'Tis not the Mystery of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but the
Mystery of <hi>Iniquity</hi> that thus invelops it self in a private and affected
Phrase, which sounds ('tis to be fear'd) the Spirit of <hi>Schism, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,</hi>
and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>not of Love and Peace.</hi> And yet as plain a
sound as the <hi>Spirits</hi> is, it is not lastly without some <hi>obscurity,</hi> but
<hi>that</hi> is not of the sound; <hi>that's</hi> plain and open; but of the <hi>motion</hi>
and <hi>course,</hi> of which we may have leave to be ignorant, and in many
things can be no other. That's the last point wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi>
man are like. <hi>Thou canst no more tell whence or whither those great things the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man acts are, than whence the wind or Spirit comes, or whither it goes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. But that so it is, the amazements and doubts that this <hi>Day</hi>
possessed those who were the witnesses of the wonders of this days
work, and their several judgments and conjectures concerning the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
this day filled with this holy <hi>Spirit</hi> will make it without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Some said, <hi>What meaneth this?</hi> Others said <hi>mocking, these men are
full of new wine;</hi> All <hi>were amazed and in doubt,</hi> Acts ii. 12, 13. The
<hi>Apostles</hi> seem'd such strange things to them <hi>now,</hi> since the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> had
faln upon them, that they knew not <hi>new</hi> what to make of them, or of
any thing they did. In the progress afterward of their lives and courses,
they were as little understood, as much misconstrued by the world. They
were thought <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>mad-men,</hi> when most <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>sober,</hi> Acts xxvi. 24.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57113:217"/>
condemn'd for <hi>wicked</hi> when they were most <hi>innocent,</hi> reckon'd the <hi>scum</hi> and
<hi>off-scouring of the world,</hi> 1 Cor. iv. 13. when they were the Treasures and
Jewels of it; judg'd as dying, when <hi>they only truly</hi> liv'd; accounted <hi>sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
yet were always <hi>rejoycing;</hi> esteemed <hi>poor,</hi> yet so far from being so, that
they made many <hi>rich;</hi> thought to have <hi>nothing,</hi> and yet <hi>possessed all things,
2 Cor.</hi> vi. 9, 10. So it was then, so it always was, so it ever will be. The
World <hi>will</hi> never, never <hi>can</hi> conceive the nature and way of him that is
born of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14. We know not what to make even of his
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>Text,</hi> whether to read it born or begotten, for 'tis both;
and how he should be both by the same Spirit, or how the same <hi>Spirit</hi>
should be both Father and Mother to him, we cannot tell. How he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by the Spirit; how he is new born; the ways of his brith, the
ways of his life, the way of his death; how he is wrought, and form'd,
and moulded out of his old, stiff, stubborn temper into mildness and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
how the old man is mortified in all his members; how the new
man rises and grows in all his parts; how he resists so many strong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
how he can so chearfully renounce the World, how he can so
wholly deny himself, how he can so merrily pursue a troublesome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
vertue, why he should do all this when there appears nothing but
trouble, sorrow, and disadvantage by it, are all mysteries so obscure and
dark, that night it self is mid-day to them. Nor is it less to see with what
calmness and contentedness he passes hence through pains and tortures,
nor can we conceive the glory and happiness that attends him. Thus is
the spiritual <hi>Heroe's</hi> life and death a mystery, so far above the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of dull-ey'd earth, that it knows no more of its course or motion
than it does of the winds, neither <hi>what</hi> it is, nor <hi>whence</hi> it comes, nor <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
it goes.</p>
            <p>But after all these mysteries I end in plainness. 'Tis a <hi>Day,</hi> indeed, as
well as a <hi>Text</hi> of mysteries and wonders, but both <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi>
and <hi>Spirit</hi> will be all satisfied if they can leave these plain Lestons upon
our Spirits.</p>
            <p>That (1.) we now get us up with <hi>Elij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, 1 King.</hi> xix. 11. to the Mount of
God, get us often up to his holy places to expect this holy wind and spirit.
(2.) That there we wrap our faces in our <hi>Mantles</hi> as he did his in his, <hi>v.</hi> 13.
<hi>cover</hi> them with all <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> to receive him. That (3.) we go
<hi>out</hi> with him too, and stand in the entry of our Caves, every one in his
place ready to <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him when he comes. That (4.) we there
listen carfully to the sound he makes as he passes by, attentively to hear
his voice, and know his will, and do his pleasure. That (5.) we take the
<hi>wings of the morning,</hi> as holy <hi>David</hi> speaks, our earliest devotions and prayers
to convey us to his presence, that he may blow and breath upon us, and
we daily find and feel him purifying, quickning, and refreshing us, and
every day more and more drawing nearer to us, or us nearer to himself.
And then no matter whether we know whence he comes, or whither he
goes, so he thus take us with him when he comes, and carry us thither
with him when he goes where he eternally with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in glory.</p>
            <p>Even so, O blessed and Eternal <hi>Spirit,</hi> blow upon us, and this day keep
thy <hi>Festival</hi> among us for <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> his sake, to whom with the <hi>Father</hi>
and thy <hi>self</hi> be all our wonder and admiration, all Worship and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all our praise and glory from this day for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

day this Promise made good, The Spirit of Truth came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> this day; so that from this day forward they
spake all tongues and truths, who before were both ignorant of the one,
and could not bear many of the other.</p>
            <p>Well, but the <hi>Apostles</hi> are dead, and all the <hi>Disciples</hi> that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to those gifts and prerogatives are dead, and we neither speak
with tongues by the spirit, nor understand all truths any of us, nor can
yet hear of any that do; Is his Promise then utterly <hi>come</hi> to an end for
evermore? Certainly either come he is not, or lead us he does not, or
into Truth he does not, or into but a little, and that but very few of
us; or we at this end of the world have no part or portion in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
something or other there is, some reason or other to be given why
this Wind, this Spirit does not blow upon us.</p>
            <p>That he is come, this day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> plainly tells us; that he is
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57113:218"/>
come not to go again, Christs own promise that he should <hi>abide with
us for ever,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 16. does assure us; that to us too it is he comes,
though not visibly, as this day, yet invisibly every day, (which is as
much for truth, though not for tongues) St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us in his Sermon
this day out of the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit is to be poured upon all flesh,</hi>
Acts ii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. so upon ours too; and the Spirit for his part is always ready
ever and anon calling us to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. 17. So that the fault will
lie upon our selves, not the Spirit, that he guides us not into all
truth.</p>
            <p>The truth is, men are not disposed as they should be. He that looks
into their ways and pursuits after truth may see it without Spectacles.
Other spirits are set up, new lights advanc'd, private spirits preferr'd,
all the people are become leaders, every man thinks himself of age to
answer for himself, and to guide himself, so that there is either no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be guided, (all the Lords people being Kings and Priests, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets)
or else no body will be, but according to their own fancies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
interests and humors. This is the true posture, the very face of
Religion now adays, and the true reason that this Spirit of Truth
ceases to guide them into truth: For, He leads none but those that will
be led, and they will not. He is only sent to guide, not to hale them on,
or drive them forward. To you Disciples, such as are willing to be
taught, not to them that will be all Masters. To those that could not
bear all truths then, not to those that would not then, nor to those that
will not now, who make Christs promise of none effect to themselves by
their own perversness.</p>
            <p>Time was (and this day it was) when He found men better disposed
for his coming, found them together at their Prayers, not, as now, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ears; of one accord, not in Sects and Factions, waiting all
for the Promise of his coming, not preventing it as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Samuels</hi> with
a foolish Sacrifice, only as himself confesses, lest the people should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xiii. 11. and as is usual now, not to stay the coming
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> but to set up one of their own, no matter of what,
to keep the people from scattering and forsaking them, any spirit, so
it can keep them to them. They were to wait for the Promise of the
Father, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 4. which was the Spirit of Truth. They did, and had it.
Do we so, and so we shall too. Our case still is the same with theirs.
They could not bear all truths together, no more can we. They stood in
need of daily teaching, we do more. They wanted a guide, we cannot
go without him. Truth is still as necessary to be known as then it was.
To this purpose was the Holy Spirit promised, to this purpose sent, to
this purpose serv'd, and serve he does still, the necessity being the same,
like to be the same for ever; only fit we our selves to receive him when
he comes; and howbeit things look strangely, and this promise seems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible now, the Spirit of Truth will come, and <hi>when the Spirit
of Truth is come, he will guide them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words are Christs Promise of sending the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> now the
fifth time repeated, to raise up the spirits of the drooping Disciples, now
ready to faint and die away, upon the discourse of their Lords depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He was now shortly to bid adieu to the world and them; yet so
much he lov'd them, that he would not leave them comfortless, though
himself, who was their only joy and comfort, was to go away, yet he
would not leave them without another Comforter. Though he that
was the way, must ascend, yet a guide should presently descend to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57113:218"/>
guide them after him; though he who was the Truth must back to
Heaven, yet the Spirit of Truth should forthwith come down to guide
them into all truth to bring them thither. So that here, even without a
guide you may easily find two Considerables.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Advent,</hi> or coming of the Holy <hi>Spirit, when He the Spirit of

               <item>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Intent</hi> or purpose of it, the end and benefit of his Advent or
coming. He <hi>will guide you into all Truth;</hi> that's the business.</p>
                  <p>In the First we shall consider,
<list>
                        <item>1. His title, <hi>He</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. His motion, <hi>Is Come.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. His time, <hi>When,</hi> indefinite it is here, but a due time it has, and
we will strive to learn when it is.</item>
                        <item>
                           <p>4. His manner of coming, (1.) Invisibly as a Spirit; (2.) Effectually
as a Spirit of Truth; (3.) Gently and (4.) Softly: both implied
in the word or term of <hi>Coming.</hi> (5.) Suddenly too sometimes, <hi>when</hi>
he is come; as if so suddenly, that we should not feel or know
it till he is.</p>
                           <p>In the Second, the Intent or Benefit of his coming we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
                           <p>(1.) The benefit, What it is; To <hi>lead.</hi> (2.) Whether? <hi>into truth.</hi>
Into Truth, (3.) How far? <hi>Into all Truth.</hi> Yea, but (4.) to Whom
all these? to <hi>you,</hi> even to lead <hi>you; You</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> all of
us, in our way, in our order, one after another: Yea, but lastly,
<hi>lead</hi> us, and into <hi>truth,</hi> and into <hi>all</hi> truth; but How? <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> says

            </list>
            <p>When have thus considered them single and apart, we will joyn
them again together and so leave them. Tell you how the leading is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
proportionate to his coming, as he comes, so he leads, If he comes
miraculously and extraordinarily, so he leads; if invisibly and ordinarily,
so he leads; as much as he comes into us, so much he leads us; as
is his coming, so is his leading and no other, the one answerable to
the other.</p>
            <p>And lastly, all this we shall make good from Christs promise here,
(1) That <hi>his</hi> Promise we have for it, who will not, cannot fail us, (2.) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
upon promise, (3.) a promise with a <hi>non obstante,</hi> with a <hi>Howbeit;</hi>
that howbeit, all else should fail, this should not; howbeit to the world
this Spirit may prove something else then a Guide, a Reprover or a
Judge, yet to us he shall be a guide into the way of truth. This will
be the sum, these the heads of my Discourse, which that I may happily
pursue; <hi>Come thou O Spirit of Truth, and guide my thoughts and words
this day, that I may teach thy ways unto the people, and declare thy Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are to begin with the <hi>Spirits Advent,</hi> or his Coming; for come to
us he must before he guide us; and that his entertainment may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording,
enquire we; first, Who it is? His Titles here will best inform
you; <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He,</hi> What's <hi>He?</hi> He, is a relative, relates to an Antecedent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to some person mentioned before. Who's that? (1.) the <hi>Comforter,</hi>
ver. 7. Who's <hi>He?</hi> the Comforter, (2.) which is the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Chap. xiv.
26. (3.) One that the <hi>world cannot receive,</hi> ver. 17. of the same Chapter,
so great that the world, as wide as it is, cannot contain him: so good,
that the world, which (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks) lies in wickedness, cannot
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57113:219"/>
receive him; (4.) a Comforter that shall <hi>abide for ever,</hi> ver. 16. an eternal
Comforter, (5.) whom I will send unto you <hi>from my Father,</hi> Chap. xv. 26.
a <hi>heavenly</hi> Comforter; which <hi>proceedeth from the Father,</hi> the same verse, a
Comforter who is the very <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> proceeding.
This is <hi>He</hi> we speak of, this is He that is said here to come, that is said
still to come.</p>
            <p>2. Well may the <hi>Evangelist</hi> stand and stop at his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here, stand
and take breath here at this <hi>He;</hi> as if he knew not how to go further,
how to call him, how to express him: He, the Comforter; he, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
for ever; he, whom the world cannot receive; he, the Holy Ghost;
he that proceeds from the Father and the Son, all this he had said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and more he thought he could not say, and therefore now here
makes a halt, as I may say, He and no more, to give us time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of the greatness of the person that is to come, and to prepare for
his coming.</p>
            <p>Yet to confirm all that before he has said of him, as he began the
promise of him, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. under the name of the Spirit of
Truth, so he concludes it with the same Title, that we might know, all
that he has said is truth, all that Christ has promised of him is no more
than truth; for he is the Spirit of Truth: <hi>The Spirit of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To make good and true all that Christ had promised, the very <hi>seal</hi>
and signature of our <hi>Redemption, Ephes.</hi> iv. 30. to seal the conveyance of
our Inheritance to us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> i. 14. to make that good, to <hi>bear witness with
our spirit that we are the Children of God,</hi> Rom. viii. 16. to make all good
to us both in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
            <p>2. He is the Spirit of Truth, because the Spirit of God and Christ. God
is Truth, and Christ is the Truth, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 16. and the Spirit of God
he is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 11. and the Spirit of Christ he is, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 19. so to be sure,
the Spirit of Truth, if of God and Christ.</p>
            <p>3. The Spirit of Truth is the Spirit of Prophesie, <hi>Rev.</hi> xix. 10. those
holy men spake as <hi>they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 21. <hi>who spake
by the Prophets,</hi> says the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> and Prophets they are not, but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
who speak not the truth, nor is it Prophesie, if it be not truth.</p>
            <p>4. The Spirit of Truth, for that as he inspires grace, so he doth truth
too, all supernatural truths to be sure: For truths there are many, and
spirits there are many, but no truth but from him, nor no Spirit of
Truth but he himself; He is the Fountain of Truth, as in him and
from him it is we live and breath; He breaths into us this breath of
life, the spirit of life from this Spirit; so from this Spirit of Truth
all the truth that at any time breaths from us, even natural truths and
the truths of reason; but that's not it. Inspired truths, spiritual truths,
they, are the proper effects of this Spirit: Other truths may be from
him, nay, are originally all from him, as all good from God that eternal
source of goodness; but they may sometimes arise and breath from our
own spirits within, or be put into us by other spirits, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Angels from without, but inspired truths from this Spirit
alone.</p>
            <p>Angels indeed are sometimes the <hi>messengers</hi> of it, but never called
the <hi>spirits</hi> of it; they bring it, they do not breath it: When they have
brought it and done their message, be it never so true, never so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
it will not comfort, but amaze us; it will not sink into us, but
ly only at our doors till this Spirit breath and work it in. He alone <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
Veritatis,</hi> the Inspirer of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:57113:219"/>
Hence it is that this Spirit of of all Spirits is only call'd the <hi>Comforter,</hi> for
that he only lets in the comfort to the heart whatever Spirit is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger.
Be it the Angels, those Spirits and Messengers of heaven, or
be it the Ministers, those Messengers upon earth, with all the life and
spirit they can give their words, no comfort from either, unless this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth blow open the doors, inspire and breath in with them.
Truth it self cannot work upon our spirits but by the spiration of this
Spirit of truth. 'Tis but a dead Letter, a vanishing voice, a meer piece of
articulate air, the best, the greatest, the soundest truth no other, it has no
spirit, it has no life, but from this Spirit of truth.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point. It is not, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>truth is come,</hi> or
when <hi>He,</hi> that is, the <hi>Comforter</hi> is come, though both be but one, he shall
guide you, neither title single, but <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> both together;
to teach us first, That the truth which this Spirit brings is full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
always comfortable. Startle us it may a little at the first, but then
presently, Fear not, comes presently to comfort us; trouble us it may a
little at the first, nay, and bring some tribulation with it, as times may
be; but ere the verse be out, ere the words be out almost, <hi>Be of good chear,</hi>
says Christ, 'tis but in the world, and I <hi>have overcome</hi> the world, and in
me <hi>ye shall have peace,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xvi. 33. that came before; so that tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is encompassed with comfort. <hi>Ye shall be sorrowful</hi> indeed, but your
<hi>sorrow shall be turned into joy,</hi> ver. 20. the first is no sooner mentioned, but
the other follows as fast as the <hi>Comma</hi> will let it. Christs truth, and this
Spirits truth is the Comforters truth as well as the Spirits, and have not only spirit to act and do, but comfort also in the doing, and after it to be
sure. Nay,</p>
            <p>Joyn'd so (2.) <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> to teach us again, that nothing
can comfort us but the truth, no Spirit hold up our Spirits but the Spirit
of truth. Lies and falshoods may uphold us for a time, and keep up our
Spirits, but long they will not hold; a few days will discover them, and
then we are sadder than at first. To be deluded adds shame to our grief;
'tis this Spirit only that is the Spirit of our life, that keeps us breathing
and alive; tis only truth that truly comforts us; which even then when
it appears most troublesome, and at the worst, has this comfort with it,
that we see it, that we see the worst, need fear no more, whilst the joys
that rise from false apprehensions, or lying vanities, indeed from any
thing below this Spirit of truth and heaven, bring so much fear of a
change, or close, or too sudden an end, that I may well say they have
no comfort with them. They flow not from this Comforter, they come
not from this Spirit, that's the reason they have no Comfort, no Spirit in
them. It may well occasion us as soon as we can to look after this <hi>He,</hi> the
<hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> and for our own sakes enquire <hi>where he is,</hi> watch his motion,
what, and whence, and whither it is.</p>
            <p>2. To understand the motion and coming of the Spirit, what it means,
we can take no better way than to peruse the Phrases of the holy Book,
under what terms it elsewhere does deliver it. The first time we hear of
it we read it moving, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 3. The next time striving with man, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. 3.
Then filling him, <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxi. 3. Then resting upon him, <hi>Num.</hi> xi. 25.
Sometimes he is said to come, <hi>Iudg.</hi> iii. 10. Sometimes to enter into us,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> ii. 2. Sometimes to fall upon us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xi. 5. Sometimes to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, <hi>Num.</hi> xi. 29. Sometimes to be put into us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 27. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to breath, sometimes to blow upon us, <hi>Isa.</hi> xl. 7. All these ways is
he said to come; whether he move us to good, or strive with us against
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:57113:220"/>
evil, or fill us with sundry gifts and graces, or rest upon us in their
continuance; whether he comes upon us in the power of his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
or whether he enter as it were and possess us wholly as his own;
whether he appear in us, or without us; whether he come upon us so
suddenly, and unusually, that he seems even to fall upon us, or be put
upon us by ordinary ways and means; whether by imposition on, or
breathing in; whether by a softer breath, or a stronger blast; whether
he come in the feathers of a Dove, or on the wings of the wind; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Fire, or in Tongues; whether in a visible shape, or in an invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power and grace; they are his comings all, sometimes one way,
sometimes another, his comings they are all: Yet but some, not all of
his comings, for all his ways are past finding out, and teach us a Lesson
against curiosity in searching his out-goings.</p>
            <p>And yet, this word <hi>Come</hi> sounds somewhat hard for all this still: Did
we not say he was God? And can God be said to come any whither, who
is every where? Nay, of this very Spirit expresly says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal.
cxxxix. 7. <hi>Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit?</hi> And if I cannot go from
him, what needs his coming? <hi>Coming,</hi> here, is a word of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and certainly, be we never so much under his eye, we need
that, need his grace, need his favour: Nay, so much the more because
he is so near us, that so we may do nothing unworthy of his presence.
But He speaks to us after the manner of men, who if they be persons of
quality, and come to visit us, we count it both a favour and honour: So
by inversion when God bestows either favours or honours on us, when
this holy Spirit bestows a grace, or a gift, or a truth upon us that we had
not before, then is he said to <hi>Come</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>I need not now trouble my self much to find out <hi>whence</hi> he comes.
<hi>Every good and perfect gift comes from above,</hi> says St. <hi>Iames, Iam.</hi> i. 17. From
heaven it is he comes, from the Father, <hi>he</hi> sends him, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 26.
From the Son, <hi>he</hi> sends him too in this very <hi>Chapter,</hi> ver. 7. And this is
not only the place whence he comes, but here are the persons too whence
he proceeds. So that now we have gain'd the knowledge, not only of his
temporal, but his eternal coming to; his eternal Procession, which
though it be not the coming promised or intended here; yet, <hi>coming,</hi>
here upon the Context and Coherence, relating so evidently to send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gives us but a just occasion both to remember to whom we owe
this benefit, the Father and the Son, the greatness of it, in that it is no
less than infinite, the Spirit of God, God himself.</p>
            <p>And 'tis but fit here and every where to take notice of it, that as the
whence is above, so the whither is beneath, very much beneath him. But
we reserve that to a fitter place, when we come to the persons that are
guided by him. 'Tis best now to suspend a while the search of the nature
to enquire into the time and manner of his coming. But the time is next.
<hi>When</hi> he is come.</p>
            <p>3. Yea, but when is that? <hi>Sane novum supervenisse spiritum nova desideria
demonstrant,</hi> says St. <hi>Bernard;</hi> you may know he is come by the desires
he works in you, when those begin to be spiritual, hearty, sincere, and
true to God, then is the Spirit of truth come into you; if you begin to
long, and breath, and gasp after heaven 'tis a sign some heavenly breath
of the Spirit, at least, is slipt into you.</p>
            <p>2. When this Spirit that pants and beats after God within, breaths
out at the lips too ere it be long in prayers to God, and praises of him, in
good communication; all bitterness, and malice, and evil speaking,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57113:220"/>
and vanity too being laid aside as becommeth Saints. This is a good
sign too, a true sign too, if it be not meerly, godly Phrases taken
up to make a shew, or to deceive; if it proceed from the heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. But the surest sign of it is in the hand, in the works, if <hi>they</hi> be
such as are the genuine fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,</hi> Gal. v. 23. These are the Spirits
perpetual attendants when he comes. Boast men may of the Spirit, but if
they have no love, if they be not the Sons of peace, if patience and
long-suffering be no vertue with them, if gentleness appear not in their
carriage, if goodness and bounty to the poor abound not in them as well
as faith, if they be not meek, and humble, and sober, and temperate,
temperate in diet, in apparel, in language, in passion, and affections,
and all things else, boast they while they will of the Spirit, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth, that they have it, work and move by it, are guided by it,
it will prove but the Spirit of error, or the Spirit of giddiness, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of slumber, (they do but dream it) or but their own Spirit, at the
best, for such a one we read of, and of Prophets that went according to
it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xiii. 3. foolish Prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have
seen nothing; ignorant Prophets, who know nothing, yet pretend they
know more than all the Learned, all the Fathers that are gone; crafty
Foxes only they are, says the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. cunning to spoil and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
that seduce the people, saying, peace, when there is no peace,
<hi>ver.</hi> 8. they build and dawb with untempered morter, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. build up
<hi>Babel</hi> the house of confusion, and plaister up all the Scriptures Texts
that are against them with incoherent Comments, wild distinctions and
interpretations, that stick together like untempered mortar; they make
the righteous sad, and strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should
not return from his wicked way, by promising him life, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and yet
they there pretended the Spirit; that he was come to them, and God
had sent them, when indeed it was no other Spirit from the Lord than
such a one as came from him upon <hi>Saul</hi> when the good Spirit was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from him. The Spirit of truth wants no such covering, no such
morter, makes not the righteous sad, makes no body sad by any oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
joy is the fruit of it; strengthens not the wicked in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it is all for justice and righteous dealing. And where it comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any, it as <hi>Samuel</hi> foretold it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 6. and <hi>Saul</hi> found it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 9.
gives him another heart, turns him into another man. The new man
St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, created in righteousness and true holiness, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 2.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there was another kind of coming of his this <hi>Day.</hi> He came
to day not only into the hearts, but upon the heads of the Apostles; sate
there, and thence disperst his heavenly light into rays and flames; came
down in wind, and fire, and tongues; in wind, to shew that it was the
Holy Spirit, the very breath of heaven; that came in fire, to signifie
the light of truth it brought; and in tongues, to express it to the world.
But it was his Inauguration day, the first solemnity of his appearance,
that so both the Disciples and the World might know that come he was
whom Christ had promised, and be convinced by a visible apparition,
who else would not have been convicted by any inward evidence which
had been without it.</p>
            <p>But thus he appeared but only once. In the effect of Tongues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but not in the appearance of them, he twice afterwards fell upon
some Disciples, upon the <hi>Centurion</hi> and his Company the first fruits of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:57113:221"/>
the <hi>Gentiles, Acts</hi> x. 46. and upon those Disciples at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who knew
nothing but <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism, that so they might sensibly find the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism and <hi>Christs, Acts</hi> xix. 6. They both, assoon as
they were baptized, spake with tongues, says the <hi>Text;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd,
to teach this truth, that in all Nations, whoever doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
shall be accepted, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> now in Christ as well accepted
as the <hi>Iews;</hi> the other so highly favoured, that imperfect Christians
might be encouraged to go on, and not be dismaied to see so many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Professors</hi> so exceedingly transcend them.</p>
            <p>These comings were miraculous; only to found Christianity, and settle
an Article of Faith, the Article of the Holy Ghost, never distinctly
known to the world till Christianity arose. Christ himself was fain to
confirm his Divinity by signs and miracles; and the God-head of the
Holy Ghost can be perswaded by no less. But this once done, he was to
lead us by an ordinary tract, no longer now by sight, but faith, that <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
might be through faith,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 5. and the blessing upon them who
have not seen, and yet have believed, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xx. 29.</p>
            <p>This I must needs say seems the prime and proxime meaning of the
words, but not the full, <hi>When he is come,</hi> points chiefly and nearest at this
his first and nearest coming, but not only at it. Else are we in an ill
case now, if no spirit to come to us, no guide to lead us, no truth to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
us. It must extend beyond that his visible coming, to the ways of his
coming unto us still, unseen and unheard; or <hi>however expedit vobis,</hi> it was
expedient for them that Christ should go away, that the Comforter
might come, for us it is not I am sure, if we have none to come. Settle
we therefore this for an Article of our faith, that he comes still. I told
you before how you should know it by his breathings inwardly in you
good thoughts and desires, his breathings outwardly good words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
by his workings with you, good life and actions, in a word, by
his gifts and graces.</p>
            <p>But if this be all, why is it now said, <hi>When he is</hi> come? Came he not
thus before to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets?</hi> were not they partakers of his
gifts, mov'd and stirr'd and actuated by him? why then so much ado
about Christs sending him now, and of his coming now, as if he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sent, never came before?</p>
            <p>We read indeed in the Old <hi>Testament</hi> often of his coming, never of his
sending but by way of promise, that God would send, or of prophesie,
that he should be sent, and that but once neither expresly, <hi>Psal.</hi> civ. 30.
<hi>Emittes spiritum &amp; creabuntur.</hi> So, though come he did, in those days of old,
yet voluntarily, meerly we might conceive never sent, never so distinct
a notion of his person then; then only as the Spirit of God, now as the
Spirit of the Father and the Son; then only as the Power of God, now as a
Person in the God-head. This the <hi>first</hi> difference between his coming then
and now.</p>
            <p>2. Then he came as the Spirit of Prophesie, now as the Spirit of
Truth, that is, as the very truth and fulfilling of it, of all the former
Prophesies.</p>
            <p>3. Then upon <hi>Iudea,</hi> and few else besides, it may be <hi>Iob</hi> in the land of
<hi>Vz,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> in <hi>Iericho,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> in <hi>Moab,</hi> here and there, now and
then one; now upon <hi>all flesh;</hi> upon <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> both alike, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall
like the walls of <hi>Iericho,</hi> blown down by the breath of this
Spirit, by the blast of this <hi>horn</hi> of the most High.</p>
            <p>4. Then most in types and shadows, now clearly and in truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:57113:221"/>
5. Then sparingly, they only sprinkled with it, now poured out,
<hi>Ioel</hi>'s <hi>Effundam</hi> fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 1. a common phrase become now;
<hi>full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts vii. 55. and <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. v. 18.</p>
            <p>6. Then he came and went, lighted a little, but staid not, <hi>motabat,</hi> or
<hi>volitabat,</hi> flew or fluttered about, mov'd and stirr'd them at times, as it
did <hi>Sampson, Iudg.</hi> xiii. 25. coming and going; now 'tis he <hi>is</hi> come. He
sate him down upon the <hi>Apostles, Acts</hi> ii. 3. sate him down in the Chair
at their <hi>Synod,</hi> Acts xv. 28. <hi>Visum est Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis;</hi> calls us his
<hi>Temples</hi> now, not his Tabrnacles, places of a during Habitation, and is
to abide with us for ever.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Then he came to help them in the observance of the Jewish
and Moral Law, now to plant and settle an obedience to the Christian
Faith. For Christ being to introduce a more perfect and explicate faith in
the blessed Trinity, and a Redeemer, to wean men from the first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and beggarly rudiments, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls them, to raise them
from earthly to heavenly promises, to elevate them to higher degrees of
love and hope, and charity, and vertue and knowledge, and being
besides to arm them against those contradictions and oppositions that
would be made against them by the world, those persecutions and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
ways of martyrdom they were to encounter with in the propagation
of the Christian Faith; for these ends it was necessary that the Spirit
of Truth should come anew, and come with power, as it did at first with
wonder, that by its work and power those great and glorious truths
might be readily received and embraced. For this seems the very end of
his coming, to <hi>convince the world,</hi> ver. viii. of this Chapter, and <hi>to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
of him;</hi> Chap. xv. 26. and <hi>to glorifie him,</hi> in the very next verse to
the text, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to evince this new revealed truth to the souls and
consciences of men, that <hi>Messiah</hi> was come, that Jesus was the Christ,
that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sacrifices were now to have an end, that the Prophesies
were all fulfilled in him, that his Law was now to succeed in the place
of <hi>Moses</hi>'s, that he justified where the Law could not; that through him
now, in his Name, and in none other Salvation henceforth was to be
preached to <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and God had open'd now that door of hope
to all the world. To bear witness to this, and perswade this truth, so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to Natural and <hi>Iewish</hi> reason, or so much above the ordinary reach
of the one, and the received customs of the other; thus to enhance Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Perfection, thus to set up Christ above the Natural and Mosaick
Law; thus now to glorifie God in Christ, and Christ as Christ; need there
was, great need that the Spirit of Truth himself should come himself,
after a new fashion, in a greater manifestation of his power than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, bring greater grace because he required of us a greater work.</p>
            <p>All this while we have given you but general notions of his coming,
either when he first came in his fulness, on the Apostles and first Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
or when, secondly, he comes on any, as the Holy Spirit, in good
motions and affections: We are yet to see when he comes as the Spirit
of Truth: to descend now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thirdly, to a distinct and particular enquiry,
When the Spirit of <hi>Truth</hi> is in us, or come to us; when we have him
in us?</p>
            <p>Nor is this way of consideration less necessary than the other;
though (it may be) harder far, forsomuch as we daily see many a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christian Soul seduced into Error, in whom yet we cannot doubt
but the Holy Spirit has a dwelling: many a good man also err in many
opinions; of whose portion of the good Spirit we make no question:
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:57113:222"/>
whilst some, many, others of less Piety, it may be none, more fully know
the truth than either of the other.</p>
            <p>Understand therefore there is a double way of knowing even divine
truth, (1.) the one by the way of natural reason, by principles and
conclusions rationally and logically deduced out of the evidences of
Scripture: (2.) the other by particular assents and dissents of the
Understanding and Will purified and sanctified to all ready obedience to
Christ.</p>
            <p>By the first, it comes that the greatest <hi>Scholars,</hi> the most learned and
rational men know always the most truths both speculative and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick
both in their Principles and Inferences, and are therefore always
fittest to determine doubts, and give counsel and direction both what
to believe and what to do, in all particular controversies and debates
which concern either Truth or Error, or Justice and Injustice, Right or
Wrong, the practices and customs of former times and Churches, or
their contraries and disuses; and this may be done without the Spirit
of Sanctification, or the holy sanctifying Spirit, under that title at
least, though indeed under another title it comes from him; as the gift
of Tongues, or Interpretation, or Prophesie, or the Word of Wisdom,
or the Word of Knowledg, are reckoned by the <hi>Apostle</hi> to come from
the same Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 8. it may be, most properly from him as he is
the Spirit of Truth.</p>
            <p>By the second way of knowledg it comes to pass, that men of less ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities;
and lower understandings, applying their affections as well as
understandings to embrace the Truth, do know and understand it more
effectually, are more resolute in the defence of it, express it better in
their lives, and know more sometimes of the particular ways of God
in his particular Providence and Direction of the affairs of his Saints,
(for of this kind of wisdom the <hi>fear of the Lord always is the beginning</hi>) and
it often happens of the passages of the World too, as they relate to Gods
disposing order. Yet by reason of the inabilities of understanding, or
want of the course or means of knowledg, it falls out that they oftener
err in the conceits and apprehensions of things than the other. And
more than so, it as often comes to pass, whether to humble them when
they begin to be proud of their holiness and piety, and think themselves
so much above other men, wiser, better, more holy, more righteous
than they; or to punish them for some particular sin, as disobdience, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of enquiring into depths above them, singularity, discontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
self seeking, or the like; or to stir up their endeavours now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to languish; or to make them yet more circumspect and wary
in their ways; for these or some such causes, I say, it comes to pass that
God suffers them to run into grand and enormous errors, foul and foolish
extravagancies of opinion, which if once they trench on practise, and
are deliberate in, or might with easie industry have been avoided, even
grieve and quench that Holy Spirit that was in them, and expel him too;
but if their errors be unvoluntary, not easie for them at that time to be
avoided, or of lesser moment, stand they may with the Spirit of Grace,
and they good men still.</p>
            <p>How therefore now shall we know what is from the Spirit of Truth,
when he comes so to us, is but a necessary enquiry; yet the resolution
is hard and difficult I know no better way to resolve you than by search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of this Spirit of Truth, as Christ has pleased to express him
in his last most holy and comfortable Discourse, of which the Text is
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:57113:222"/>
but a part, the several expressions of whose nature and office set toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
will I am confident assure us of a way to discern the Spirit of truth,
when it is that <hi>He</hi> speaketh in us. You may turn your leaves and go along
with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. 17. The Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive;
so then (1.) if the Article or Opinion which we receive be such an one
as the world cannot, if it be contrary to worldly interests, carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
sensual pleasures, 'tis a good sign at first. If it cannot enter into
a carnal or natural mans heart, if mans wisdom teach it not, as the
Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 13. if it grow not in the garden of nature, that's
a good sign 'tis the Spirit of truth is come that thus enables us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Doctrine so disadvantagious and displeasing.</p>
            <p>Look into the next verse, <hi>ver. 18. I will not leave you comfortless;</hi> If then
(2.) it be such an assertion that has good ground in it to rest upon, that
will not fail us in distress, that will stick by us in our deepest agonies,
comfort us in our greatest discomforts, not leave us when all earthly
comforts do, then 'tis from above, then 'tis a true comfort, a truth from
this <hi>He,</hi> this Spirit of truth that is the Comforter too.</p>
            <p>See next. <hi>v. 26. He shall teach you all things, bring all things to your remembrance
whatsoever I have said unto you.</hi> If then (3.) it be an assertion that carries
the analogy of faith along with it, that agrees with all the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Christian faith, that is, according to the rule of Christs holy
word, that soberly and truly brings to our remembrance what he has
said at any time, or done for us, that remembers both the words that he
spake, and the deeds that he has done; his actions and example, if it
be according to his example of humility, obedience, patience, and love,
if it bring us heartily to remember this Christs pattern in our lives and
opinions too, then it comes from him that should come, and is worth your
receiving and remembring it.</p>
            <p>In the same verse again, in the words just before, he is called the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi>
and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who is also there promised to teach us too. And if
the Doctrine be such, that not only comforts us in the receiving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
but such also as becomes Comforters too, that teaches us to
comfort others, the poor and needy, the afflicted and distressed, and to
do it holily too as by the Holy Ghost, that is with good and pure inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and do it even to their Ghosts and Spirits as well as to their bodies
if it teach true holy Ghostly spiritual counsel, and all other convenient
comfort to them our Christian brethren: Then 'tis (4.) a doctrine from
this Spirit of truth, he comes in it.</p>
            <p>Turn ye now to <hi>Chap.</hi> xv. 23. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will
send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from
the Father,</hi> &amp;c. When the Doctrine (5.) is no other than what either
establishes the Doctrine of the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost; or contradicts it not, and in all benefits received refers thanks
and acknowledgment to the one as well as the other; as from the one,
through the other, by a third. In this particular it is no other than the
Spirit of truth, for no other Spirit can reveal it.</p>
            <p>Go on now through the vers. <hi>He shall testifie of me.</hi> The Doctrine (6.) that
bears witness of Christ, that he is God, that he is Man, that he is Christ
the Saviour of the World, that he came to save sinners, all whosoever
would come to him, not a few particular ones only; that he is a complete
and Universal Saviour, such as he profest himself by entertaining all
comers, sending his Spirit and Apostles into all Nations, commanding
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:57113:223"/>
them to preach to every creature, which are no other than his own words,
this is also from the Spirit of truth; a Doctrine worthy Him that is the
Comforter, that brings so general a comfort with it.</p>
            <p>Step now into the next Chapter, <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi. to which we owe the Text.
<hi>When he is come he will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
ver. 8. When the Doctrine is (7.) such as it reproves the world
of sin; that it can do no good of it self, that it is full of evil and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
convinces it, and finds fault with it for infidelity and unbelief;
sets up Christs righteousness, and blames the world for neglecting it, and
following its own vanity, interests, and humours; professes the Prince
of the world cast out by Christ, the devil overcome and brought to
to judgment by him, our sins forgiven, we acquitted, and the World
condemned; this cannot be from the Spirit of the World, nor from the
Spirit of the Flesh, nor from the Spirit of darkness and error, (for this
were to bear witness against themselves) but from the Spirit of light and
truth.</p>
            <p>Read the Text now over again, <hi>When he,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he shall guide you into all
truth.</hi> If it be the Spirit of truth that informs you, it will (8.) dispose
you equally to all truth, not to this only, or to that, which most agrees
with your education, humour, temper, or disposition, condition, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
interest, or estate, but universally to all, to any though never so
hard or opposite to them, so they be truths. He that is thus affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
truth, is not only probable to be directed into truth, in all his
Doctrines and Assertions, but may most properly be said to have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth already come, speaking and residing in him.</p>
            <p>Yet go a little further to the next words. <hi>He shall not speak of himself,</hi> but
whatsoever he shall hear; that Spirit (9.) that does not seek it self, that
opinion which renounces the glory of a Leader, the ambition of a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the affectation of Singularity, the honour of himself, that speaks
not of its own head, but what he has heard with his ears and his Fathers
have declared as done in the time of old; that makes not new opinions,
but takes up the old, such as Christ delivered to the Apostles, they also
to the Fathers, they downward to their successors, this is most probably,
if not most certainly the Spirit of truth. The Spirit sure of humility it
is, that trusts not, relies not on its self or its own judgment, and the
Spirit of humility is the Spirit of truth; for them that be meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
them shall he guide in judgment, and such as be gentle, them does he
learn his way, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxv. 8.</p>
            <p>Yet on a little: And <hi>he will shew you things to come.</hi> Those Doctrines
(10.) that refer all to the world to come, which mind nothing seriously
but things above, and things to come, which ever and only teach us to
fix there, they are surely from the Spirit of truth, because no truth
like that which is to fulfil all promises, and that to be sure is yet to
come.</p>
            <p>One more glance and I have done with this; and 'tis but a glance to
the very next words: <hi>He shall glorifie me.</hi> Those Doctrines which give
God all the glory, which return the glory of all to Christ, which so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
man only as the better thereby to glorifie God; so set up Christ, as
that they make him both the healer of our nature, and the preserver of
it, the remitter of our sins, and the conferrer of Grace; the first mover
of us to good, the assister of us in it, the sanctifier of us with it, the
justifier of us thorow it, the rewarder of us for it, and yet all this while
the accepter of us when we have done the best; which accuses not Christ
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:57113:223"/>
of false judgment in justifying the sinner whilst he is no better, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
him just when he is no other than wicked and unjust, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the efficacy of his grace to make us clean, to have a true cleansing,
purifying, sanctifying power, as well as that which they call the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
these Doctrines which take not this glory away from Christ,
but give the power as well of making as pronouncing righteous to his
grace, that thus magnifie and glorifie his Justification and Redemption,
they certainly glorifie Christ, are the only Doctrines that glorifie Christ
truly, and according to the Spirit of truth.</p>
            <p>So now let's sum up the matter. Those Doctrines which are contrary
to worldly, carnal, sensual respects, not conceivable by the natural or
carnal man; That (2.) stick by us when worldly comforts leave us;
That (3.) are according to Christs Word and his Example, accompanied
with Meekness and Obedience; Which (4.) teach us charity and love
to one another; Which (5.) inform us rightly in the prime Articles of
the Faith; Which (6.) witness nothing more than Christ an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Saviour, as <hi>Adam</hi> the universal sinner; Which (7.) reprove the
sins and infidelities of the World, and show us the way to be acquitted
from them; Which (8.) have a kind, of conduct and sincere affection
with them to all truths whatsoever, under whatever term or name,
though never so odious, so contrary to interest or honour; Which
(9.) seek not their own name, to get a name, or set up a Faction, but
are consonant to the ancient Fathers and Primitive Antiquity, with
humble submission to it; Which (10.) lift up all our thoughts to heaven;
and (11.) by all means possible can give God, and Christ, and the holy
Spirit the glory, deny nothing to them that is theirs, under a foolish
pretence only to abate and vilifie man beyond the truth; these Doctrines
are truth, so much of them, at least, as agree with these Rules, are from
the Spirit of truth, and are manifestations, that the Spirit of truth is
come to that soul that embraces them: If all these together, then the
Spirit altogether; if but some of these, but some, so much of that
neither. All Doctrines and Opinions (1.) that savour of worldly
or carnal interests; that (2.) change and wheel about according to the
times, and will not hold out to the last; which (3.) are not regulated by
the Word of God, or are any way contrary to Christs Example of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Obedience; Which (4.) are not for peace and charity; Which
(5.) deny any Article of the three Creeds we acknowledge; Which
(6.) confine the mercies of our Saviour, and bear false witness of him;
Which (7.) advance any sin, or suffer men to live in it; Which (8.) love
not truth because it is truth, but for other ends; Which (9.) seek any
other title to be distinguished by than that of Christian, or glories in it,
which disagree from the stream and current of Antiquity; Which
(10.) fixes our thoughts too much below; Or (11.) rob God, or Christ,
or the holy Spirit of the glory of any good, or the perfection of their
work; be they cried up never so high for truth, and Spirit, the new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Christ, and new light of truth, and the very dictate of the
Spirit, they are not so; it is not <hi>when,</hi> nor <hi>then</hi> that the Spirit of truth
is come; there is not that in them by which Christ has described the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth.</p>
            <p>One thing there is behind, when all these requisites before are found
in any Doctrine or Opinion; this Doctrine indeed may be such as comes
from the Spirit of truth, yet accepted and entertained it may be through
some other Spirit, upon some sinister end or ground; that therefore it
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:57113:224"/>
may not only be the truth of the Spirit, but have the very Spirit of truth
with it, that it may be evident it not only comes from him, but that he
also is come with it, it must be sincerely and intimately embraced with
our very hearts and spirits out of love to truth, not any interest or by-respect,
and well habituated and actuated in us, before we can say di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
that the Spirit of truth is come. Some truth or other may be
come, some ray and beam of his light be sent before him, but himself
not yet fully come; for all truth comes along with him, though not
actually altogether, yet a hearty resolute affection to all of it, all truth
altogether, as God shall let it come.</p>
            <p>I have been somwhat long in this particular, about the Spirits coming,
because I see the World so much mistaken in it, so often crying, Lo! here
he is, lo! there he is, lo! here he comes, lo! there he comes, when indeed
he is nor here, nor there, with neither of them, nor coming to them. A
word now of the manner of his coming.</p>
            <p>4. And that is (1.) Invisibly, for so comes a Spirit. This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we hold by, and had he not come, when he came, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly
into the hearts as visibly upon the heads of the Disciples, their
Tongues, though all the tongues of men and Angels would have profited
them nothing; the fire then, had it not enflamed their hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with a holy flame, as well as encompassed their heads; would have
only lighted them with more glory into eternal fires. Had not this wind
blown as well within as that did without them, it would have blow'd
them little good. Tongues, and Prophesie, Interpretations, Miracles,
and the rest, are but <hi>dona gratis data,</hi> gifts more for others good than for
our own; they do not make us better in his sight, 'tis the invisible grace
that makes us accepted. Nay, yet those very gifts and administrations,
however the appearance was without, were wrought within by his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
operation. So that to the Apostles as much as to our selves, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
coming is the only, truly, comfortable coming.</p>
            <p>That (2.) is Effectual too. To come truly is to come effectually; and
in that he is called the Spirit of truth, 'tis plain he must effect what it
is he comes for, or 'tis not true and real. It was a mighty rushing wind,
he this day came in; so mighty, so effectual, that it at once converted
three thousand souls; the Spirit of power is one of his names, and the
pulling down of strong holds, casting down every thing that exalts it
self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Christ is one of his works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>3. He comes gently, (that's the common pace of one that is only
said to come.) Gently, step by step, grace after grace, gift after gift,
truth after truth, leads by steps, comes by degrees; not all grace at a
clap, all gifts in a trice. Nay, as hastily as it seem'd to come this day,
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the chief of them, was a while after at a loss for a truth, had
not, it seems, all truths together: <hi>Of a truth now I perceive that God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter
of persons,</hi> Acts x. 34. before it seems he perceived it not; no more
did the other <hi>Apostles</hi> neither, who were all in the same error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him about this new truth, and contended with him about it.
<hi>Acts</hi> xi. 2.</p>
            <p>4. Nay, softly too; as dew into a fleece of Wooll, without noise,
without clamour, no way like the Spirits now adays; <hi>I will put my
Spirit upon him, and he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
in the streets,</hi> Isa. xlii. 1, 2. He is the Spirit of meekness who is the
Spirit of truth, and truth is never taught so soon, so effectually as by
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57113:224"/>
softness and meekness; the meek the best to teach, the best to be
taught.</p>
            <p>5. Yet as gently and softly as he comes, he is often upon us on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ere we are aware. God uses to prevent us with the blessings of
goodness, as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxi. 3. He is come, sometimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we think of it. Our hearts are in his hand, and he suddenly turns
them whither he will. <hi>Saul</hi> does but turn him about from <hi>Samuel</hi> and God
gives him presently another heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> x. 9. <hi>Samuel</hi> no sooner anoints
<hi>David,</hi> but from thence-forward the Spirit came upon him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvi. 13.
And this note is made, not that you should always look for miraculous
changes, and expect the Spirit without so much as setting your
selves to seek him, but to make you watch continually, and wait
for him, that though he come suddenly, he may not find you unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the doors shut upon him, that he may not go as he comes for want of
entertainment.</p>
            <p>Yet the Phrase will bear another expression of the manner of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>When he is come,</hi> that is, when he is grounded and well setled in us,
the <hi>Tense</hi> is the <hi>Aorist,</hi> a Preterperfect signification; signifies not coming,
but perfectly come. This is not actually always to every one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he comes
to, yet his intent it is in all his coming, to stay and abide with us, and
so he does till we drive him thence. But if we do not, if we let him stay,
and dwell, and remove him not, then will he guide us into all truth;
that's the End and Intention of his coming the next Point. But I am
beyond my intent and time already; I shall only sum up this last particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the manner of his coming and let you go.</p>
            <p>You will peradventure understand it best by considering how the Spirit
mov'd in the Creation, the order the same in creating the new man in the
soul that he there observed in creating of the World.</p>
            <p>Now in the first Creation of the World,</p>
            <p>He first moved upon the waters, then created light, and divided it
from darkness; he next divides the Waters, and places a Firmament
between them; then (3.) gathers the Waters together, and makes dry
land appear, and bring forth grass, and herbs, and trees, bearing seed;
then (4.) makes two glorious Lights to rule the day, and night, and
times, and years; then (5.) creates fowl, and fish, and beasts; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes man after his own Image.</p>
            <p>Thus does he in this new Creation, or Regeneration. He first moves
and stirs us up to good, then darts in some glimmerings of light to shew
us our own darkness, sins, and wretchedness; Then next (2.) divides
the passions and powers of the soul, and sets them their bounds, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
some in things above, whilst some other are left beneath; Then
(3.) presently makes the dry and barren soul sprout out, bring herbs, and
leaves, and seeds, into green flourishing desires, holy resolutions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
which carry with them seed, much hope of encrease; (4.) To
cherish these green and tender sprouts, to direct and rule these resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
desires, and endeavours, two Lights he makes, true rectified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and supernatural grace, to guide them what to do at all seasons,
days, and years, and many little Stars, many glimmerings of truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
then to discover themselves, which before did not. After all this
(5.) the sensitive faculties in their course and order bring forth
their living creature according to their kind, submit themselves to
the command of the superiour reason; And then lastly, when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
has thus totally renewed the face of the earth, of our mind and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:57113:225"/>
affections is the new man created after the likeness and image of God in
righteousness and true holiness. This the course, this the order of the
Spirits coming, He comes moving upon the waters of repentance, and
first enlightens the darkness of our souls, he orders all our faculties and
powers, he makes us fruitful to good works, he daily encreases divine
light and heat within us; he reforms our sense, subdues our passions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates
our reason, sanctifies them all, comes in light, comes in grace,
comes in truth, comes in strength, comes in power, that we might in his
strength and power come one day all in glory.</p>
            <p>And now, he that thus created the old World, and still creates the
new, new create and make us new, and pray we all, with holy <hi>David,</hi>
Psal. li. 10. <hi>Create, O Lord, in us new hearts, and renew right spirits within us.</hi>
Cast us not, O Lord, for ever, though we are now full of errors, from thy
presence, and keep not thy holy Spirit from us, but let thy Spirit of truth
come down and guide us out of our wandrings, give us the comfort of
his help again, guide us again into the ways of truth, and stablish us
there with thy free Spirit, and that for the merits and mercies of thine
only Son, who here promised to send him, and this day accordingly sent
him to guide us to himself, from grace to grace, from truth to truth, from
truth below to true happiness above, Jesus Christ our Saviour. To
whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND He this day began to guide; has continued
guiding ever since, will go on guiding to the end,
began it with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> continued it to the <hi>Church,</hi>
and will continue it to it to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Indeed he that looks upon the face of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches now, would be easily tempted to
think, that either the time was not yet come, that
it should be fulfilled, or that it had been long ago,
and his <hi>promise come utterly to an end for evermore.</hi> For
so far are we from a guide into all truth, that we have much ado to find
a guide in truth, false guides and false spirits are so rise; so far from
being guided into all truth, that 'tis neerer truth to say into all error; as
if this guide had quite forsaken us, or this promise belong'd not at all to
us. Yet for all that, to us it is.</p>
            <p>For the truth is; 'tis not this Guides, this Spirits fault, but ours,
that this <hi>all</hi> truth is so nigh <hi>none</hi> at all. <hi>He</hi> will guide still, but <hi>we</hi> will not
be guided. And into all truth too he will, but we will not; we will have
no more than will serve our turn, stand with our own humour, ease and
interest; that's the reason why he guides not now as in the days of the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> the first times, the times of old. We will not let him; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear it, as it is in the verse before; or worse, we will not bear, we
will not endure it, every one will be his own guide, go his own way,
make what truth he pleases, or rather what him pleases the only truth,
every one follow his own spirit, that's the reason why we have so little
of the Spirit of Truth among us. There are so many private spirits that
there is no room for this.</p>
            <p>Yet if into all, or indeed any truth that's worth the name of saving,
we would be guided; to this One we must return, to <hi>one</hi> spirit, or to
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57113:226"/>
               <hi>no</hi> truth. There is but one Trurth and one Spirit, all other are but
fancies. He that breaks the unity of the Spirit, that sets up many spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
sets up many guides, but never a true one; chance he may perhaps
into a truth, but not be guided to it, and as little good come of it where
the <hi>analogie</hi> of Scripture and Truth must needs be broken by so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and divided spirits. 'Tis time we think of holding to one Spirit,
that we may all hold the same Truth, and in time be led into it all.
The only question is, Whether we will be led or no? If we will not,
the business is at an end. If we will, we must submit to this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
his guidance, his manner and way of guiding: By so doing we shall
not fail in any necessary saving truth; <hi>He will guide us into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which that he may, as I have heretofore out of the former words told
you of his coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so shall I now by his assistance out of these latter tell
you of his guiding; for to that intent and purpose he came to day, and
comes every day, came at first, and comes still, comes (1.) to guide, to
guide (2.) into truth, (3.) into all truth, (4.) even you and all into it,
yet (5.) to guide only, not to drive or force us; to guide after his own
way and fashion, not our fancie; of which, lastly, we need not doubt
or make a question, he <hi>will</hi> do it.</p>
            <p>So that now the Parts of the Text will plainly rise into these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That though Christ be gone, he has not left us without a guide,
but has sent <hi>Him</hi> that shall guide us still.</item>
                  <item>2. That He that shall do it is <hi>He,</hi> that very <hi>He,</hi> that is, the <hi>Spirit of
Truth,</hi> just before. No other can.</item>
                  <item>3. That guide therefore into truth, he will, no other will.</item>
                  <item>4. That he will guide not into this truth, or that truth only, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>all.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. That he will guide even <hi>us</hi> too. You, and you, and you, us as well
as those that were before us; all's but <hi>You.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. That he will do it yet but after his own way and fashion, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
after the way he comes; after as he comes, so will he guide, set
us a way to find the truth, and guide us after <hi>that way</hi> and no other.</item>
                  <item>7. That for certain so it is. He <hi>will, Howbeit</hi> he will, though yet he
has not, though yet we peradventure will not or cannot endure to be
guided, yet when we will set our selves to it, He will guide us into
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it shall be no fault or failure of his, for he for his part will,
is always willing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The sum of all is this, to assure us (1.) that notwithstanding all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and false spirits now abroad, there is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> still ready and
willing to guide us into all truth yet; and (2.) to shew us how he will
do it, that we may learn how to be guided by him. This the sum. And
the <hi>Vse</hi> of all will be, that we submit our selves to him and to his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
to be taught and led and guided by him; to his guiding and to
his truth, and to <hi>all</hi> of it, without exception. To guide and to be
guided are relatives, infer one another. If we will have him guide us he
will have us be guided by him, and give up our selves to his way of
guiding. Oh that we would, that there were but a heart in us to do so!
we should not then have so many spirits, but more truth, one Spirit
would be all, and all truth would be one, this one single Spirit would
be sufficient to guide us into all truth: He would guide us into all truth.
But I must from my wishes to my words, where we see first we have a
guide; that though Christ be ascended from us into Heaven, yet we are
not without a guide upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:57113:226"/>
I. <hi>I will not leave you comfortless,</hi> said he, when he was going hence, St. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
xiv. 18. Had he left us without a guide he had so, comfortless indeed in
a vast and howling wilderness, this earth is little else. But a <hi>Comforter</hi>
he sends, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. such a one as shall <hi>teach us all things,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 26.
that's a comfort indeed, none like it, to have one to guide us in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and uncertain way, to teach us that our ignorance requires, to
do all the offices of a guide unto us, to teach us our way, to lead us, if
need be, in it, to protect and defend us through it, to answer for us if we
be questioned about it, and to cheer us up, encourage and sustain us all
the way.</p>
            <p>II. Such a guide as this, is (2.) this <hi>He</hi> we are next to speak of. <hi>He,</hi>
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> so 'tis interpreted but immediately before. He shall
teach you, teach you the way, reveal Christ to you, for unless he do
you cannot know him, teach you how to pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26. teach you
what to say, how to answer, by the way, if you be called to question in
it, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xii. give you a mouth and wisdom too, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 15. teach
you not only to speak, but to speak to purpose. He (2.) shall lead you
too, <hi>deducet,</hi> lead you on, be a prop and stay and help to you in your
journey. He (3.) shall protect and defend you in it as a guide, free you
from danger, set you at full liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 17. be a cover to you by
day, and a shelter to you in the night; the breath of the Holy Spirit,
will both refresh us and blow away all our enemies like the dust. He (4) if
we be charged with any thing will answer for us like a guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.
'Tis not <hi>you</hi> says Christ, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of your <hi>Father,</hi> that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in you, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 20. He, lastly, it is that quicken our spirit
with his Spirit, that encourages and upholds us like a guide and leader, for
without him our spirits are but soft air, and vanish at the least pressure.
He guides our feet, and guides our heads, and guides our tongues, and
guides our hands, and guides our hearts, and guides our spirits; we have
neither spirit nor motion, nor action, nor life without him.</p>
            <p>III. But here particularly he comes to guides us into the <hi>Truth.</hi> And
God knows we need it; for surely <hi>men of low degree are vanity,</hi> says the
<hi>Psalmist,</hi> and <hi>men of high degree are a lie,</hi> Psal. lxii, 9. not lyars only, but a
very lye, as far from truth as a lie it self, things so distant from that
conformity with God, which is truth (for truth is nothing else) that no
lie is further off it. Nor soul, nor body, nor heart, nor mind, nor upper
nor lower powers conformed to him, neither our understandings to his
understanding, nor our wills to his will, nor any th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of us really to
him, our actions and words and thoughts all lye to him, to his face;
we think too low, we speak too mean, we deal too falsly with him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
all his, yet give most of it to our lusts and to our selves, and we
are so used to it, we can do no other, we are all either verbal or real lies,
need we had of one to guide us into the truth.</p>
            <p>God is Truth, to guide us to him. Christ is the Truth, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 6.
to guide us to him. His Word is Truth to guide us into that, into the
true understanding and practise of it. His Promises are Truth, very <hi>Yea</hi>
and <hi>Amen,</hi> to guide us to them, to rest and hold upon them. His way is
the way of Truth, to guide us into that, into a Religion pure, holy and
undefiled; <hi>that</hi> only is the true one. Into none of these can any
guide but this guide here. He sheweth us of the Father, He reveals to
us the Son, He interprets the Word and writes it in our hearts, He leads
and upholds us by his Promises, seals them unto us, seals us again to
the day of Redemption, the day of truth, the day when all things shall
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:57113:227"/>
appear truly as they are. He sets our Religion right, <hi>he only</hi> leads us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>that.</hi> Man cannot, he can speak but to the ear, there his words dye
and end. Angels cannot, they are but <hi>ministring spirits</hi> at the best to
this Spirit. Nature cannot; these truths are all above it, are <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi>
and no other truth is worth the knowing. Nay, into any
truth, this Spirit only can; we only flatter and keep ado about
this truth and that truth, and the other, but <hi>into</hi> them we cannot get,
make nothing of any truth without him; unless he sanctifie it, better
else we had not known it: Knowledge puffeth up, all knowledge that
comes not from this Spirit: so the <hi>very</hi> truth of any truth, that which
truly confirms it to the divine will and understanding, that makes truth
the same with goodness, is from this Spirit, from his guiding and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his breathing it, or breathing into it, or upon it.</p>
            <p>IV. Thus we are faln upon the <hi>fourth</hi> particular, that he will guide us
into <hi>all</hi> truth.</p>
            <p>Gods mercies and Christs are ever perfect, and of the largest size, and
the conducts of the Spirit are so too, into all goodness, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 9. into all
fulness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> iii. 19. into all truth here, into all things. That we are not
full is from our selves; that we are not led into all truth, is for that all
truth does not please us, and we are loth to believe it such if it make not
for us: he for his part is as ready to guide us into <hi>all</hi> as into <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For take we truth either for <hi>speculative</hi> or <hi>practical,</hi> either for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
against types and shadows, or the discerning the substance through
those shadows; or take we it in opposition to obscurity and doubting,
understand we it for what is truly to be believ'd, or lov'd, or hop'd, or
fear'd, or done, (as under these is contain'd all that is saving truth,) so
they are all taught us by this Spirit. The signification of all old
types and shadows, sacrifices and ceremonies, the things, which whilst
Christ was with us we were not able to bear, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. the things, which
when they were done we did not understand, all that we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and do, what to hope, and what to fear, what to desire and what
to love this Spirit teaches. And that first,</p>
            <p>Not as other spirits teach, which teach by halves, so much only as may
serve to nurse up their <hi>faction</hi> and their side, but nothing more, but <hi>all,
whatever is commanded,</hi> keeps back nothing, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> professes for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Acts</hi> xx. 20. nothing that is profitable unto you, that is, nothing
profitable to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Not secondly, as other spirits, which teach impertinent or idle truths,
or meer natural ones; indeed for such truths as have neither spiritual
profit or command, he is neither bound nor binds himself; is neither
sent nor comes to teach them; such truths as appertain not unto holiness,
the Holy Spirit is not promised for. Yet all that is necessary to be
known, hop'd, fear'd, expected, desired, or done, in reference to the
Kingdom of grace and glory he never fails us in.</p>
            <p>Not, thirdly, as other spirits that never teach all truth and nothing
else, whose truths are commonly mixt with error, but what he
teaches is truth <hi>all.</hi> By this you know that it is his Spirit, 'tis he that
teaches every part, when the doctrine is <hi>all</hi> truth. The doctrines of the
world are like those bastard children in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> xiii. 24. that spake half
<hi>Ashdod,</hi> and half <hi>Israel;</hi> one part of them is truth, the other falshood;
one part <hi>Scripture,</hi> the other a <hi>Romance;</hi> one part spirit, the other flesh;
one part Heaven, the other Earth, earthly humors and respects, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else. There is not an Error or Heresie so gross or impudent, but
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57113:227"/>
has <hi>Iacob</hi>'s voice though <hi>Esau</hi>'s hands, speaks well what ere it does, speaks
fair and smooth though its deeds be rough and cruel; with <hi>Napthali</hi>
gives good words, though with <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> it be as a Serpent by the way, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n
Adder in the path that biteth the Horse heels, so that the Rider does fall
backward, speaks well though it mean ill, and overthrow all that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. Thus the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> says true, when he says the Apostles bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
men and women, but he says false, when he says none else, or that
they baptized any twice with Christs baptism. The <hi>Antinomian</hi> and
<hi>Solifidian</hi> say no more than truth, when they say faith justifies without
the works of the Law, for they say with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but they say a lie when
they separate the works of the Gospel from that faith that justifies, if
St. <hi>Iames</hi> say true, <hi>Iam.</hi> ii. 26. Innumerable multitudes of such half-fac'd
truths there are abroad, vented and vaunted by private spirits, such as
this spirit has no hand in. <hi>Every truth of his is truth in all its parts;</hi> all
truth, though it be but one, keeps the analogie of faith inviolable, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
correspondence with all the rest. So that now every truth of his is all
truth, truth all of it; but that's not all, for (4.) there is not a truth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
or convenient for us to know but in due time he reveals it to
us, unless we hinder him, <hi>all things</hi> says Christ in another place,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 26.</p>
            <p>V. But all this while, to whom is all this promis'd, this guiding Spirit
into all truth; to whom is it? To whom but <hi>you; You,</hi> says the Text,
What you Apostles only? no such matter; you <hi>Disciples</hi> present then? no
such matter neither: 'Tis but a little word this <hi>you,</hi> yet of large extent,
few letters in it, but much spirit: You <hi>Believers,</hi> all of you, as well as
you <hi>Apostles.</hi> For for <hi>all</hi> he prays in the next Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. for all that
should believe on him <hi>through their Word.</hi> And 'tis promis'd St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 16.
that he shall abide with them for ever; and if ever, sure then beyond
their <hi>persons</hi> and <hi>their</hi> times; So that to ours too, is the promise made, or
it cannot be for ever.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Apostles</hi> indeed in greater measure, after a more eminent way,
with miracles and wonders to confirm the truth he taught, yet to us also
after our measure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To them to</hi> bring to their remembrance all things whatsoever he had said
unto them, <hi>St.</hi> Iohn <hi>xiv. 26. Whence we read so often, they</hi> remembred his
words, <hi>St.</hi> Luke <hi>xxiv.</hi> 8. Acts <hi>i.</hi> 16. remembred what he said, <hi>St.</hi> Iohn <hi>ii.</hi> 22. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
what was done unto him, <hi>St.</hi> Iohn <hi>xii.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>To <hi>them</hi> (2.) to guide them into the understanding of old Types
and Prophesies, what was any where said or written, or meant of him,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xii. 16.</p>
            <p>To <hi>them</hi> (3.) to explain and manifest what they before either did not
understand, or made a question of.</p>
            <p>To <hi>them</hi> (4.) to teach them those things which till <hi>he</hi> (this Spirit) came
they could not bear, as it is just before the Text.</p>
            <p>To <hi>them</hi> (5.) to settle the Rites and Ceremonies, the Discipline and
Government of the Church, to take order about things indifferent, <hi>Acts</hi>
xv. 28. It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost and to us, to define things
not before commanded: Of these Christ had given no commandment, we
read of none, St. <hi>Paul</hi> professes he had received none about them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
vii. 25. yet he determines them, and tells us, he thought also <hi>he had the Spirit
of God,</hi> ver. 40. even to those truths as well as others does the Spirits
guiding reach.</p>
            <p>To <hi>them</hi> the Spirit came to guide them into all these kinds of truths;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57113:228"/>
to <hi>us</hi> to guide us in them, or guide us after them, in a larger sense <hi>into
them</hi> too. However to one effect it comes, we and they have the same
truth from the same Spirit; the <hi>way</hi> only, <hi>that,</hi> is different, <hi>they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
from the Spirit, <hi>we mediately</hi> by their Writings dictated to them by the
Spirit. This now guides me to the way and manner of his guiding,
which comes next to be considered, and must be fetcht both from the
nature of the word, and the manner of his coming, for after that manner
is his guiding, as after he comes so he will guide too.</p>
            <p>VI. From the word first. And the word here for guiding is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Now in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is first, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, first way, then motion in
it. He first sets us down a <hi>way</hi> that will bring us into the truth, then <hi>acts</hi>
or <hi>moves</hi> us in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> way or means is the <hi>Word</hi> of God. <hi>Thy Word is a light unto my
feet, and a lanthorn to my paths,</hi> says holy <hi>David, Psal.</hi> cxix. 105. <hi>All Scripture
is given by inspiration,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and is <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect,
thorowly furnished unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. Inspir'd purposely by
this Spirit to be a way to guide us into all truth and goodness. But this
may all pretend to, and every one turns it how he lists. We must adde a
second.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>second</hi> is the <hi>Church,</hi> for we must know this, says St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
know it first too, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 20. That no <hi>Scripture is of any private interpretation.</hi>
There are some things so hard to be understood both in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,
and also other Scriptures, says he, that they that are <hi>unlearned and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wrest them unto their own destruction, 2 Tim.</hi> iii. 16. and therefore present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his advice follows, to beware least we be <hi>led away with that error,</hi> the
error, as he calls it, of the <hi>wicked,</hi> and so fall from our own stedfastness,
ver. 17. When men unlearned or ungrounded, presume to be interpreters,
or even learned men to prefer their private senses before the received
ones of the Church, 'tis never like to produce better. The <hi>pillar</hi> and
<hi>ground</hi> upon which truth stands and stays is the <hi>Church,</hi> if St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be
allowed the judge, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16. <hi>The pillar and ground of truth.</hi> In matters
of discipline when a brother has done disorderly, <hi>tell it to the Church,</hi> says
Christ, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. and <hi>if he neglect to hear that, let him be unto thee as a
heathen man, and as a Publican.</hi> He is no Christian. In matters (2.) of doubt
and controversie, send to the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and
Elders there conven'd in <hi>Counsel,</hi> and let them determine it, so we find it
done, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 2, 28. In a lawful and full assembly of the learned Fathers
of the Church such shall be determined, that's the was to settle truth. In
matters (3.) of Rites and Ceremonies the Spirit guides us also by the
<hi>Church.</hi> If any man seem to be contentious about them, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> appeal
is presently to the <hi>Churches Customs We have no such custom neither the Churches
of God,</hi> that's answer enough full and sufficient thinks the <hi>Apostle, 1 Cor.</hi>
xi. 16. If the Churches custom be for us, then 'tis good and true we think,
or speak, or do. If against us, 'tis all naught and wrong, whatever puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or piety be pretended in it. Nay, so careful was the <hi>Apostle</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the publick Authority of the Church, and beat down all private
ways and fancies (by which ways only Schism and Heresie creep in)
that he tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> though a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and one well read and exercised in
the Scriptures from a child, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 14. <hi>of a form of sound words he would
have even him hold fast to,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 13. and the <hi>Romans</hi> he tells of a <hi>form of
Doctrine to be obeyed,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. so far was that great and eloquent <hi>Apostle</hi>
from being against forms, any forms of the Church, (though he could
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57113:228"/>
have prayed and preached <hi>ex tempore</hi> with the best, had tongues and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and the gift of interpretation to do it too) so far from leaving
truth to any private interpretation, or sudden motion whatsoever. Nor is
this appeal to the Fathers any whit strange or in Christian Religion only
first to be heard of, it was Gods direction from the <hi>first. For ask now,</hi> says
<hi>Moses, of the days that are past, that were before thee,</hi> Deut. iv. 32. <hi>Stand you
in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way,</hi> says God,
<hi>Ier.</hi> vi. 16. As if he had said, Look about, and see, and examine all the
ways you can, yet the old way that's the good one. <hi>For enquire, I pray thee,
of the former Age, and prepare thy self to the search of their Fathers, for we are
but of yesterday, and know nothing, Iob</hi> viii. 8. See how slightly things of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
new interpretations, new devices, new guides are accounted
of. And indeed in it self 'tis most ridiculous to think the custom, and
practice, and order, and interpretation of all times and Churches should
be false, and those of yesterday only true, unless we can think the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth has been fifteen or sixteen hundred years asleep, and never
wak'd till now of late, or can imagine that Christ should found a Church,
and promise to be with it to the end of the World, and then leave it
presently to Antichrist to be guided by him for above fifteen hundred
years together. Nor can I see why the Spirit of truth should now of
late only begin to move and stir, except I should think he were awak'd,
or delighted with noise and fury. Nor is it reasonable to conceive a
few private Spirits, neither holier nor wiser than others, (for ought
appears) nor arm'd with Miracles to confirm their Doctrines, should
be more guided by the Spirit of truth, than the whole Church and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Christians, and Christian Fathers, especially wherein at any
time they agree.</p>
            <p>Yet (3.) not always to go so high. <hi>Thou leadest thy people like sheep,</hi>
says the <hi>Psalmist, by the hand of Moses and Aaron,</hi> Psal. lxxvii. 20. <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> were the Governours of the Church, the one a Priest, the
other a Prophet; by such God leads his People, by their lawful Pastours
and Teachers. The one, the Civil Governour, is the cloud to cover
them from the heat: The other, the Spiritual, is the light to lead them
in the way. The first protects, the other guides us; and we are bid to
obey them, <hi>those especially that watch for our souls,</hi> Heb. xiii. 17. <hi>Such as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 17. By such as God sets over us in
the Church, to teach and guide us into truth, we must be guided if we
will come into it. In things <hi>unlawful</hi> nor one nor other is to be obeyed:
In things <hi>indifferent</hi> they always are; In things <hi>doubtful</hi> 'tis our safest
course to have recourse to <hi>them,</hi> provided that they be not of <hi>Corahs</hi>
company, that they exalt not themselves against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor
draw <hi>us</hi> to it. If they do, we may say to them as <hi>Moses</hi> did to those,
<hi>Ye take too much upon you you Sons of Levi.</hi> God leads his People like a
flock in peace and unity, and by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Thus
(3.) the Spirit guides into all truth, because the Spirit is God, and God
so guides.</p>
            <p>You have heard the way and means, the first part of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
guiding. The <hi>Second</hi> follows, his act and <hi>motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He <hi>leads</hi> or <hi>guides</hi> us only, he does not drive us, that's not the way
to plant truth, by force and violence, fire and fagots, not the Spirits sure,
which is the Spirit of love.</p>
            <p>2. Yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is we told you in it. Some <hi>Act</hi> of the Spirit, He
moves and stirs up to it, enlightens our understandings, actuates our
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57113:229"/>
wills, disposes ways and times, occasions and opportunities to it, that's
the reason we hear the truth more willingly at some time than other.
<hi>Paul</hi> may plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> water, but the increase is this Spirit of Gods;
when all is done, that man can do, he must have his act, or it will not be
done.</p>
            <p>3. He leads on <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>easily,</hi> for <hi>diducet,</hi> it is no <hi>Iehu</hi>'s pace, that pace
is only for an earthly kingdom, not an heavenly. The Spirit leads soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on, like <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. xxxiv. 14. according as the Cattel and Children
are able to endure, according as our inferiour powers signified by the
Cattel, and our new begun piety and capacities intimated by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are able to follow. 'Tis danger, else, we lose them by the way. He
that presses even <hi>truth</hi> and piety too fast upon us, is liker to tire us, and
make us give out by the way, than to lead us out to our journeys end.
By degrees it is that even the greatest perfection must be come to.
Truths are to be scattered as men are able to bear them. Christs own
method in the verse before. <hi>The way into all truth is by some and
some.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This guiding is by <hi>teaching;</hi> one Translation has <hi>docebit,</hi> shall teach,
and <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. 26. it is so too; he shall teach you, teach us the necessity
of a Teacher. <hi>How shall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Rom. x. 14. To this
purpose the Spirit set <hi>Teachers</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 28. <hi>Pastours and
Teachers,</hi> Eph. iv. 11. Pastors to rule, Teachers to teach, both to guide
us into the truth. Yea, but Teachers we now have store, that to be sure
guide not into the truth, for they teach contraries and contradictions.
What Teachers then are they that teach the truth? <hi>Such as be sent,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. x. 15. sent by them that have authority to send them, if
they come without authority, or from a false one, from them that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
receive'd power themselves to send others, though they were sent
themselves, they are not sent by the Spirit, and though they may guide
now and then into a truth, teach something that is true, into all they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
their very Function is a lie, and their preaching of it.</p>
            <p>5. Leading or guiding into all truth as one, <hi>omnem veritatem</hi> in the
Singular, will tell us that unity is his way of guiding. <hi>No truth in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
we cannot so much as see our faces true in the clearest water if it
be troubled; cast but a stone in, and divide its surface, and you spoil
your seeing true; cast but a stone of division into the <hi>Church,</hi> and no
seeing truth. 'Tis the spiritual man that only truly discerns and sees the
truth, the natural and carnal man he cannot, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 14, 15. And if
there be <hi>Divisions or Schisms among you are you not carnal?</hi> says St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the
next Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 3. Yes, you are; so the <hi>Schismatick,</hi> or he that
causes rents and divisions in the Church is but a carnal man, for all his
brags, and cannot see the truth how much soever he pretend it. 'Twere
well if men would think of this, we were likely then the sooner to see
truth, to be guided into all truth if we could once keep all together,
peace and truth go both together.</p>
            <p>Thus far one word has led you: The Connexion of that and the
other with the former, of his guiding with his coming, will lead you
further. When <hi>He, the Spirit of truth, is come,</hi> then <hi>he will guide you,</hi> When
<hi>he is come,</hi> is, when he is so grounded and setled in us that we can say he
is come indeed, he is in us of a truth, then all truth will follow present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
When the holy Spirit has once taken up his lodging in us, that we
also begin to be holy Spirits too, then truth comes on a main. <hi>If any man
will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> vii. 17.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:57113:229"/>
till our hearts be well fram'd to the obedience of Gods Commandments
no truly knowing truth. Divine knowledge is contrary to other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
they begin in speculation and end in action; this begins with
action, and ends in speculation, seeing and knowing God, <hi>What man is he
that feareth the Lord, him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose,</hi> Psal. xxv.
11. When the Spirits holiness is come into us, his truth will follow as
fast as we can bear it, till we come to the fulness of the measure of the
stature of Christ, to Christ himself that is the Truth; the way now
to come to the knowledge of truth is by holiness and true obedience.
Nor yet so to be understood, as if the good man only knew the truth,
or that every one that has Christ, or the Spirit dwelling in them were
the only knowing men, and therefore fit only to teach others. Indeed
if you take knowledge for practical and saving knowledge so it is, no
man knows God but he that loves him, no man so knows truth but he
that loves and follows it, and no man is saved by knowing, but by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But that which may serve to save a mans self will not serve to
save others, to bring them to salvation. 'Twas one of <hi>Corah Dathan</hi> and
<hi>Abirams</hi> Doctrines indeed, <hi>Numb.</hi> xvi. 3. <hi>All the Congregation is holy every one
of them, wherefore then do you Moses and Aaron lift up your selves above the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Lord?</hi> Why do you Priests lift up your selves so much to
think you only are fit to teach and rule the people? <hi>But the earth opened
her mouth,</hi> ver. 30. and confuted the madness of these men. Be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
never so holy, if he have no Function to it he must not presume to
teach others though he must teach himself. Holiness is one gift, the
power of teaching is another, though both from the same Spirit; and
no venturing upon <hi>Aarons,</hi> St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> or St. <hi>Peters</hi> Office, unless the Spirit
has set us apart to that end and purpose. 'Tis enough for any other that
he has truth enough to save himself: and 'tis but Ambition, Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and Sacriledge, and by that a lessening of his goodness, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to that which God has not call'd him to, but his own preposterous
zeal, or too high conceit of his own holiness and abilities, and so far
from being like to guide into all truth, that our own days are sufficient
witnesses all Errors and Heresies have sprung from it.</p>
            <p>The way that the Spirit guides into all his truth is by the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by the Church, by the decrees, and determinations, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of it; by the hand of our lawful Pastors and Teachers, himself
inwardly acting and moving in us, inwardly working and perswading
us, outwardly ministring opportunities and occasions to us, leading us
by degrees, preserving us in peace, keeping us in obedience, and holiness,
and charity. Thus he guides into all truth, ordinarily, and no way else.</p>
            <p>VII. And to be sure, lastly, <hi>thus</hi> he will. Christ here promises for him
him that he <hi>shall,</hi> for so we may render it, He <hi>shall.</hi> And he is the Spirit
of truth, says the Text. So he will make good what Christ has promised,
and what <hi>he</hi> comes to be, the guide into the way of truth. We need not
either mistrust or fear it. For though Christ himself must go away and
leave us, because it is expedient that he should, yet this Spirit will stand
by us howsoever. <hi>Howbeit</hi> he will. He is a mighty wind, and will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disperse and blow away the mists of ignorance and error; He is a
fire, and will easily purge the dross, and burn up the chaff that mixes
with the truth, and hides or sullies it; nothing can stand before him,
nothing shall. He comes to us with a Howbeit, a <hi>non obstante,</hi> be it how it
will, though we be blind, and ignorant, and foolish, and full of infirmities
and sins, so we be willing, he will come and guide us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="452" facs="tcp:57113:230"/>
Yet if now we will so be guided, to close up all, We must, lastly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our selves wholly to his way and guiding, to the truth, and to all
of it.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>way</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> (1.) no teaching him how he should teach us. <hi>Them
that be meek shall he guide in judgment, and such as be gentle them shall he learn
his way,</hi> Psal. xxv. 8. No teaching without humility, we must be willing
to be guided or he will not guide us. Men will not now, thence come so
many errors and mistakes.</p>
            <p>To <hi>truth</hi> too (2.) we must submit. If it be truth no quarrelling against it.
No seeking shelters and distinctions to defend us from it: though we have
been long in error, and count it a dishonour to revoke it, revoke it we
must, be it what it will, or we endanger the loss of the whole truth, the
Spirit will not lead us.</p>
            <p>And to <hi>all</hi> (3.) too. We must not plead our interest, or any thing
against it, be it never so troublesome, never so disadvantageous, never
so displeasing, we must resolve to embrace it, because 'tis truth.</p>
            <p>With this submission too we are now to come to the holy <hi>mysteries,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our hearts, and judgments, and affections here, not to presume to
pry too much into the way and manner of Christs and the Spirits being
there, but to submit our reasons to our faith; and open our hearts to
Christ as well as our mouths to the outward elements, and keep under
our affections by holy and godly doing, that so the Spirit of truth may
come into them all. And so doing, the Spirit will come, and he will guide
us, guide us into all necessary and saving truths, guide us to Christ, guide
us to God, guide us here, and guide us hence, guide us in earth, and guide
us to heaven.</p>

our hearts warm'd by the same fire, our words fram'd by the same
tongues that this day appear'd so miraculously upon <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:57113:231"/>
We have done so in the unity of the Church several times before in
the year for <hi>Christ</hi> the second <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> do we so now also for
the <hi>third,</hi> the benefits and glory which this day came from him, which
they this day did after a strange miraculous way receive, we may this
day also receive in an efficacious way, though not externally and visibly,
yet internally and invisibly from the same <hi>Spirit.</hi> For this Feast is
his, and our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eech this day principally of him, and our praises for
him.</p>
            <p>Now the best way to keep the Feast, so as to be partakers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and benefits of it, is to place our selves in the same fashion, set
our selves in the same posture, dispose our selves after the same order
with them here, both for the receiving of him, and after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him. For 'tis part of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> not the <hi>Gospel</hi> that I have read
you, and the business of the <hi>Epistle</hi> is commonly Doctrine and Instruction,
as the matter of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is usually history. So we then to be instructed
by it, how to demean our selves for the receiving of the Holy Spirit, how
to know how and where, and when it is he comes, how to distinguish
him and his coming from other <hi>spirits,</hi> what to do also when we have
received him, and when more especially to do the one or expect the
other by the pattern and example in the Text. This will prove the best,
the only celebration of the Feast, the most glorious manifestation this
day on our parts for the more glorious manifestation this day on Gods;
the manifestation of <hi>our</hi> thankfulness for the manifestation of <hi>Gods</hi>
goodness.</p>
            <p>Thus without either nicety or much Art; I shall divide you the Text
into these Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Disposition</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> that the <hi>Spirit</hi> comes and lights upon, them
that are all with one accord in one place, that are there quietly sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and expecting Christ there, especially upon the solemn days,
upon the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> a solemn Festival.</item>
                  <item>2. The way and manner and order of the Holy <hi>Spirits</hi> coming, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
from Heaven, like a sound thence, <hi>like the sound of a rushing
mighty</hi> wind <hi>filling all the house,</hi> in the appearance of <hi>cloven fiery tongues
sitting upon each</hi> on whom he comes.</item>
                  <item>3. The effect and issue immediately upon it. They are filled, all filled,
<hi>filled with Ghost and Spirit,</hi> the Holy Ghost or Spirit, begin to speak,
speak strangely, strange tongues too, yet in measure and order too
no other then the <hi>Spirit gives them utterance.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. And lastly, though first it be in the Text, yet because it is but the
circumstance and time of the story, and not the main business or
second of it, and fittest to close up all in good time and order, The
Time when all this was done, when these things came to pass, when
the <hi>Apostles</hi> were so dispos'd, when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> thus descended, when
this strange issue fell out, <hi>When the day of Pentecost was fully come,</hi> in
very good time, the promis'd time, Christs time, Gods own time,
such as he had prefigur'd them in in the <hi>Law</hi> too, at the fifty days
Feast after the <hi>Passover,</hi> a solemn day and somewhat more, as you
shall hear anon. Thus we best join the History and the Moral, the
Doctrine and Use of <hi>Pentecost</hi> or <hi>Whitsunday;</hi> nay, the very <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of the day, and our souls to day together, that we may not be
like men that only come to hear news, a story and away, but such as
hear the Word and profit by it.</item>
               </list>
Which that we may, Come O <hi>mighty wind</hi> and blow upon us, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:57113:231"/>
O <hi>holy Fire</hi> and warm our hearts, give me a tongue, O blessed
Spirit, out of this days number and <hi>utterance,</hi> give thy servants capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirits and remembrance, that thy Word may rush in upon them as
a <hi>sound from Heaven,</hi> and fill the houses of all our souls with joy and
gladness with holy fire of Piety and Devotion, that we may with one
accord, one heart and mind speak forth thy praise and glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> Point in the order I have set you, is the <hi>disposition</hi> of them
that the Holy Spirit will come and light upon. (1.) They are of <hi>one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
(2.) in <hi>one place,</hi> (3.) <hi>sitting</hi> quietly and expecting there, and that
(4.) also upon the <hi>solemn</hi> day, when the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> any solemn day
or occasion is presented them.</p>
            <p>They are first of <hi>one accord</hi> whom this <hi>Spirit</hi> vouchsafes to descend into.
This unity draws the Spirit to them, that keeps it with them, the house of
unity is the only Temple of the Spirit of Unity. That soul which breaks
the bond of unity, and divides it self from the Church of Christ, from
the company of the Apostles and their Successors, the still Fathers of it,
cannot hold this holy wind, cannot enclose this holy fire, they are broken
and crackt, crack only of the Spirit, but are really broken from that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in which only the Spirit moves. Take and divide a member from
the body, be it the principal, that in which most spirit was, the heart or
the head, and once divided, the Spirit vanishes from it, will not sit nor
dwell in it: just so is it it in Christs Body the Church. If one of the
chiefest members of it, one erst while of the devoutest and most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in it, once grow so proud of his own wisdom or gifts, so singular in
his conceits as to separate himself from his fellows, from that body
whereof Christ is the head, he goes away like a member from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body, and leaves the Spirit behind him, <hi>that</hi> retires from him, for it is
one Spirit, and cannot be divided from the body, though it work di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
in it.</p>
            <p>If, this being of one accord, of one mind, be the temper for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of the Holy Spirit, as here you see it is, and in reason it can be no
otherwise, it being the Spirit of love and unity: What spirit are they of,
Whose Religion is Faction, whose chief pretended Piety is <hi>Schism,</hi> whose
business is to differ from all the World? Nothing can be more evident,
than that men are now adays much at a loss for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> however
every one claim to it, seeing there is no accord, but discord, not diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
only but contrarieties, but contradictions amongst them that most
pretend the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed were this <hi>they</hi> any less a <hi>They</hi> than the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, and
the whole number of the then Disciples, or had there been but the
least division among them either about the manner of staying or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christs Promise, or which is less about the place to stay in; It may be
these men might have had a shadow for their separations: but <hi>Apostles</hi>
they were, and <hi>in one place</hi> they were too altogether, agreed in all, were
all in unity, were all in uniformity; not their minds only, but their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
too together. Men thought it nothing a while since to withdraw
themselves from the Houses of God, as if no matter at all for the place,
they could for all that be of the same faith, but too woful experience has
prov'd it now, that with the one place the one faith is vanisht, with
the ceremony the substance gone too, with the uniformity of Worship,
the unanimity of our minds and the uniformity of our faith too blown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the air. How shall we do, O blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> in so many crackt ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to retain thee? Needs must the Spirit expire out of that body which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:57113:232"/>
has so many breaches and divisions in it, so many divided houses, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
broken Churches, so many rotten Congregations.</p>
            <p>I know if it be only necessity divides us, and drives us into several
dens and caves, as it did the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians in the days of those
fiery persecutions, that the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> will ransack all the cranies and
search out all the privatest corners be they above ground or under it,
but it is because the mind of all those several places is but one, and in
that respect they are no more than so many several <hi>cells</hi> of the one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church;</hi> but where choice and not necessity, wilfulness and not
force, singularity and not purity of Truth or Conscience makes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
and draws Disciples into Chambers, Parlors, <hi>Barns,</hi> or <hi>Mills,</hi>
Woods or Desarts, <hi>go not</hi> says Christ <hi>out after them,</hi> say they what they
will of <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> there, believe it not, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxix. 26. <hi>Two in a
field, and yet one taken and the other left, two at the mill, and one taken and the
other left,</hi> ver. 40. So at the most, I fear, great hazard that any, if they
be no better, no more orderly gather'd when the <hi>Master</hi> comes.</p>
            <p>Or were they yet perhaps in several places sitting as they are here, that
is <hi>quietly,</hi> and in true peace and faith, expecting the promise of their Lord,
something might be said to excuse their separations, but not only actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to break the unity of the Spirit and the bond of Peace, but to breath
out nothing but war, contention and dispute, to be so far from sitting
down and either suffering for Christ, or humbly expecting his time of
assistance and deliverance out of their perplexities and discomforts, as to
take the matter into their own hands, and prevent the coming of the
Spirit of Peace, by rising and raising spirits of war and confusion, they
must give me leave to tell them, they know not <hi>what spirit they are of,</hi>
a heady, guiddy, furious spirit, <hi>zeal</hi> I bear them witness with St. <hi>Paul,
Rom.</hi> x. 2. without <hi>knowledge,</hi> and spirit without holiness, for the <hi>Spirit of
the Prophets is subject to the Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. 32. much more to the God
of the Prophets, to his time and order.</p>
            <p>And yet there is another disposition to be observed in those upon whom
the good Spirit lights, to make either instruments of glory to the
Church, or Piety to God. 'Tis sitting and <hi>expecting,</hi> if you mark it, till
the <hi>day</hi> or days of <hi>Pentecost</hi> be fully come and accomplisht; souls willing
to keep a <hi>holy-day</hi> or <hi>holy-days</hi> to the Lord; neither to be scar'd from the
attendance of their Master and their Devotions, nor to be shortned and
interrupted in their pious course of faith and piety by the now so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
scare-crows of set Feasts, as <hi>Iewish,</hi> legal and superstitious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
as the new <hi>zelots,</hi> are so wise to term them, because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not terms or times. The spiritual man (if they be what they boast)
discerns the things of God, though hidden in darker mysteries, knows
better to distinguish <hi>Iudaism</hi> from Christianity, Piety from Superstition,
and is not only content, but studies to wait upon his Lord upon any
day, glad to get it too, <hi>Passover</hi> or <hi>Pentecost,</hi> makes use of them all, and
turns them fairly from their old <hi>Iudaism,</hi> and consecrates them anew to
his Masters service: and this doing, the very <hi>Spirit</hi> himself authorizes
and abets, whilst he thus seems to pick out the time for his own coming
at the <hi>Iewish Pentecost,</hi> so to sanctifie a new Christian <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the
Christian <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> to all Christian Generations by this solemn glory
of his benefits to day to be remembred for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus we have the disposition he vouchsafes to descend upon, <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
uniform, peaceable, orderly expecting</hi> souls. Such as set apart and keep
days to God with faith and patience, and in obedience and order; the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57113:232"/>
contrary tempers are too rough lodgings for the Spirit of meekness, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and peace; be we so prepar'd and he will come.</p>
            <p>II. Now see we how he comes, the manner of the Holy Spirits coming.
Double it is, to the ear and to the eye. To the ear first; and that (1.) <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,</hi>
from Heaven <hi>secondly;</hi> (3.) like a <hi>sound</hi> thence, (4.) the <hi>sound of
a rushing mighty wind;</hi> that (5.) <hi>filled all the house,</hi> yet (6.) the house
only where they sate; thus to the <hi>ear:</hi> Then (2.) to the <hi>eye</hi> in the <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of tongues, cloven tongues, tongues</hi> of <hi>fire, tongues sitting;</hi> and lastly, <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon each of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We take first what came first, the <hi>sound;</hi> and that first was <hi>sudden,</hi>
suddenly says the Text, yet as sudden as it came, go it shall not so, not
without a note or two.</p>
            <p>Suddenly then it came, to shew the <hi>freeness</hi> of Gods grace, so far above
desert, that it is also above apprehension, it out-runs that, and is upon us
ere we are aware; so little probability have we to deserve it, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
have not time to do it: and when we have, yet so suddain does it
fall, that we may well see it comes not from our selves, so dull a piece
as earth and sin has made us.</p>
            <p>To shew (2.) the <hi>readiness</hi> of his goodness, beyond expectation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
far to give than we to take, comes commonly upon us sooner then we
expect or wish, <hi>prevents us with his goodness,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> observes to us,
Psal. xxi. 3. and runs very swiftly, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlvii. 15. flying upon the <hi>wings
of the wind,</hi> Psal. civ.</p>
            <p>To shew us (3.) the vanity of men who think it comes with <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
It does not says Christ, St. <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 20. 'Tis not at our command.
The <hi>Prophets</hi> themselves could not Prophesie when they listed, 'twas <hi>ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Spiritus,</hi> the Spirit fell upon them, the common phrase in Scripture,
and then they prophesied, till that fell (and fall it did but at times, what
times it pleased) the motions of the Prophet were but as other mens. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I remember <hi>Elisha</hi> willing to prophesie to <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> the King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
2 King.</hi> iii. 14, 15. calls for a Minstrel, and it came to pass that while
the <hi>Minstrel play'd the hand of the Lord came upon him.</hi> Not that either the
<hi>Spirit</hi> was at the will and under the power of the Minstrel or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but to shew the disposition that the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> vouchsafes soonest
and suddenest to come to, a sweet and tunable soul dispos'd to accord,
to love and peace, and unity. And by the way you may take notice Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
and the Spirit are at no discord, as the late spiritual men (forsooth)
would have us to believe; the <hi>Prophet</hi> you see thought it the only way and
medium to raise his spirits into heavenly raptures, to make himself ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of new Inspirations to call for an Instrument of Musick, and as it
were to perswade the heavenly <hi>Spirit</hi> down by some grave and sober
Musick; which may make us wonder how these great pretenders to the
Spirt, and gapers for it, should be so furious enemies against the Church
Musick, so ever employ'd and approv'd both by God and his Prophets
and Apostles, (for singing with melody, says St. <hi>Paul</hi> too, <hi>Ephes.</hi> v. 19.) to
fit and sweeten, and raise our dull and rougher spirits to the service
of Heaven and the entertainment of the heavenly and gentle motions of
the Spirit in those holy performances. But all this while this is but to
dispose our <hi>selves,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> it self is at its own disposal for all this, and
when he comes comes on a sudden.</p>
            <p>Even to awake (4.) and rouse us up. We are drowsie souls to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
&amp; want some sudden change to startleus; things that come leisurely
will not do it. It must be a sudden turn that will turn us out of our selves,
or from our follies, or so much upward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:57113:233"/>
And sudden (5.) it is again to shew the activity of the Spirit of God,
how <hi>wonderful he is among the Children of men;</hi> that he cannot only turn
the world upside down when ere he please, but assoon as he pleases, does
but <hi>blow with his wind and the waters flow,</hi> casts but a sudden glance of
an eye at St. <hi>Peter</hi> and out run the waters out of his; he that was but
just now afraid of the voice of a silly <hi>girl,</hi> fears not presently the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and thunders of the greatest Tyrants. <hi>Nox ut tetigerit mentem do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,
solumque tetigisse docuisse est, Mam humanum subito ut illustrat immutat
affectum, abnegat hoc repente quod erat, exhibet repente quod non erat, S. Greg.</hi>
He does but touch the mind and teaches it, shines into it and changes
it together, forgets immediately what it was, and is what it was not.
All the quickest ways of men must have time and leisure, be it but to
cast an eye; but O <hi>qualis est artifex iste Spiritus!</hi> But how wonderful an
Artist is thy <hi>Spirit</hi> O Lord, that knows not the least hinderance or delay,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it comes so suddenly, there is no appearance often of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not so much as a whiff or shadow before it to give us warning of
its approach, for this reason among the rest, least we should attribute
any thing to our own preparations, yea, though they be such as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>Sudden, last of all, to shew us our duties not to neglect the light and
sudden motions of the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> though we know not how or when,
or whence they rise, so we know but whether they go and lead us; if
to good catch at them, let them not go as they came, but leap we into
the water while it stirrs; fan we our selves with this wind while it
moves; for how long it will stay, or whether ever come again we know
not; take it in the present while we may, omit no good motion, no
opportunity or occasion of any doing well; suddenly it comes, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
it may be gone if we lay not hold upon it and make use of it. Thus
from the quickness and suddenness of this Spirits motion, Gods grace and
goodness, his incomprehensible power and operation, and our readiness
to lay hold upon it, are preached to us.</p>
            <p>But from Heaven what next is preached to us? but that thence it
is all holy winds and breaths, and spirits come; from Heaven, not of
men; no humane wit can teach what this Spirit does, the <hi>spirit of man
but the things of a man,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 11. it knows no further; the things
of Heaven from the Spirit of Heaven; <hi>de Caelo,</hi> from the very Heaven of
Heavens, not any lower Heavens, or any other spirits of Heaven, but
that which has no plural number, is but one, and is an Heaven it self;
not only a Spirit of Heaven, but Heaven that is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Heaven
in whom all of us live and move, and have our being as in our Heaven
of Glory.</p>
            <p>Yet again, from Heaven, that we may at any time know what wind
blows in us; if our affections, intentions and endeavours are only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twards
Heaven, set upon Heaven and heavenly things, if what moves
us be only heavenly and not earthly interests, then 'tis the good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that reigns and rules in us, then 'tis the Wind and Spirit, and Fire
and Tongue, a wind out of Gods own treasury, a Spirit out of Gods
own bosom, a fire from that Eternal Light, a tongue from that Eternal
Wisdom, but if our actions come but so much as collaterally and glancing
at other respects than God and Heaven, 'tis no Spirit, no motion, no
work of his Spirit, but some others; this comes directly straight from
Heaven.</p>
            <p>3. Now from Heaven, what is it that comes here? <hi>there came sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57113:233"/>
a sound from Heaven:</hi> a sound! yes a sound, and 'tis a good hearing,
the best news we ever heard since Christs departure; a sound that is
<hi>gone out into all Lands, and into the end of the World. Sonus coelorum,</hi> the sound
of the Heavens, the very true Pythagorical harmony of the Spheres, the
sweetest sound was ever heard, the sound of the Gospel, of the Kingdom
of Heaven, and the knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>We perhaps lookt when we heard of something coming down from
Heaven, for some glorious Host of Angels, <hi>Cherubims</hi> or <hi>Seraphims,</hi> some
or other of them at least, or for the new <hi>Hierusalem</hi> we read of, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi.
2. coming from above, down from God out of Heaven; and we think
much to be put off with a <hi>sound:</hi> yet I must tell you this sound sounds bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in our ears, the sound of an Eternal Comforter that should abide
with us for ever, and bring us in due time to that new Hierusalem and
those blessed Spirits in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And with a fitter convoy he could not come than with a sound, who
was now to send and constitute such as should sound out the Gospel over
all the World, so many Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers.</p>
            <p>Nor yet of all sounds with any so correspondent to him could he come
as that of the wind; nothing more to express his Glory and Godhead,
that this Spirit he, is that very he that <hi>cometh riding upon the wings of the
wind;</hi> a fit blast to stop the idle breath of those saucy enquirers of our
age, who dispute this blessed Spirit out of his Deity.</p>
            <p>Need had he appear it seems (4.) as a rushing <hi>mighty wind</hi> to rush down
these enemies of his and overthrow them. Indeed he came to day with
so mighty and powerful a blast, that we might see both his Power and
Godhead, as well as his Mercy and Goodness to us; his goodness in
coming like a <hi>wind,</hi> his power in coming like a <hi>rushing mighty</hi> one.</p>
            <p>The benefits we receive from the wind represent the benefits we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so (1.) present his goodness.</p>
            <p>The Wind, first, purges and clears the Air from noisom and infectious
vapours; the <hi>Spirit</hi> clenses and purifies our souls and bodies from the
stinking and unwholsom steams of sins and lusts.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Wind sometimes gathers up clouds and rains, and sometimes
scatters them again. The Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> one whiles gathers clouds into the
countenance, and brings showers into the eyes of the penitent sinner;
and other while it blows away all blackness from our faces and makes
the soul look up, and the Spirits smile and dance in our hearts and
eyes.</p>
            <p>(3.) The Wind cheers and refreshes the Plants and Trees; the blessed
<hi>Spirit</hi> cheers the Plants of Grace within us, and makes them fructifie and
prosper, puts life and spirit into the root, verdure and freshness into the
leaf, fineness and subtilty into the rellish of the fruit of all holy actions
and vertues.</p>
            <p>4. The Wind cools the heat, and revives the fainting spirit; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Spirit</hi> does so too, allays the inordinate heat of concupiscence within
us, cools the over-hotness and ardors of our Passions, revives us and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
us when we are almost choakt with the fumes and flames of our
own corruption, affections and lusts.</p>
            <p>(5.) The Wind, again, kindles the fire, and blows the spark into a
flame; and the Holy Spirit it is that kindles all heavenly warmth and
flames within us, without his breath we are all but dead coles.</p>
            <p>(6.) The Wind scatters the chaff and skreens the dust out of the corn;
the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> blows away all our chaff, and dust, all our dross and rubbish,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57113:234"/>
our vanities and follies, and makes us fit corn for Gods own Garners.</p>
            <p>(7.) The Wind it is that drives home the Ship into the Haven, and the
Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> it is that drives our poor torn and tatter'd Vessels into the
Haven where we would be, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks; drives us up and
down over the troublesom Sea of this tempestuous World, into the Port
of everlasting bliss, into the Haven of Heaven it self.</p>
            <p>You see the goodness and graces of the Holy Spirit not unfitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the resemblance of the Wind. See we now his Power as well
resembled by it, by the <hi>rushing mighty wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wind is but a thin and airy puff, so subtile that we cannot see it,
yet what a rattling does it make? rattles the Ships of <hi>Tharsis</hi> together,
tears up Trees by the roots, throws down Houses and Buildings; nay
<hi>rends the Mountains and breaks in pieces the Rocks before it,</hi> 1 Kings xix. 11.
But never did Wind so tear up Foundations by the roots, never did so
strong Buildings fall before that tumultuous vapour, as this rushing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Wind that this day came down from Heaven hath cast down before it.
All the high things of the earth, Wisdom and Learning, and Might and
Majesty have faln as easily as so many Paper Turrets at its breath, all
have given up themselves and thrown all prostrate at the Word of this
<hi>Spirit,</hi> so that the whole World stood wondring and amaz'd to see it self
so turn'd about by the meer words of a few simple Fishermen, without
force, or eloquence, or craft, to see it self so tamely submit its glory to
the humility of Christ, its greatness to his littleness, its majesty to his
baseness, its wisdom to the foolishness of his Cross, its ease, pleasure,
to the pains and patience of it. But <hi>manus excelsi fecit hoc;</hi> 'tis the hand
of the most Highest that has done it, such a wind could come from none
but God, such a Spirit can be none but his, none but he could do it, and
it is marvellous in our eyes, his power as marvellous as his mercy, both
of them above any created ones whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Well may such a Wind as this now <hi>fill the house,</hi> as it follows in the
fifth Consideration. And yet commonly the wind fills the open air and
not the houses. Common winds do so indeed, but this peculiar Wind
fills the house and every corner, comes in even when the doors are shut,
or else opens and shuts them as it pleases; a sign 'tis more than air or airy
spirit; 'tis he only that searches the hearts and reins, that can glide so
into these close rooms of ours; and 'tis our happiness it is so, that he thus
blows into the house of his own accord and power: For give me a Ship,
says St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> with all its tackling, sails and anchors, spread all in
order too, and let the wind lie still, let there be no gale stirring, and all
its furniture and men are nothing; no more is the soul with all its prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
without the blowing of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> nay, no more is all our elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
all our arguments and perswasions, the subtilty of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the richness of our conceipt and notion, the sweetness of the
voice, the rhetorick of words, the strength of reason, the whole tackling
and furniture of the <hi>Orator</hi> or <hi>Preacher,</hi> unless the Spirit come and fill
the sail, and stretch the canvas, and so drive on the Vessel. 'Tis this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevit</hi>
we must hold by, 'tis his filling our empty house, our lank and lither
sails that blows comfort to us.</p>
            <p>And 'tis the enhancing of the benefit, which is the last considerable in
this similitude of the wind, that it fills the house only where <hi>they are sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
It is no ordinary or common favour that God vouchsafes in filling
our houses with the Spirit; he hath not dealt so with any other Nation,
with any other people than the Christian people. It is the Church only,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57113:234"/>
and the souls of Christians in it, that this mighty wind as rushing and
mighty as it is does content and contain it self in. All other houses and
places stand empty, cannot get this Tenant. 'Tis the property of this
Wind, and no other, to blow where it lists, in <hi>this</hi> house and no other,
within <hi>doors</hi> all, within the Church, none without at all; or the sound of it
only passes out to call others in, that they may see and wonder at the
things that are come to pass this day, that <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Proselytes, Cretes</hi> and
<hi>Arabians, Parthians</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> and all Nations under Heaven may bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
witness of the wonder; and if they come in, in some sort partake of
it too, of the wind, though not of the tongues, of some graces of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> though not of the other. Only come in they must, into the Church
of Christ, which is his body, before their veins be filled with this <hi>Spirit,</hi>
before they feel any motion of it.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Wind</hi> I say, such a portion of the Spirit as may breath into them
the breath of life; but tongues of fire are for those only who were sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there before, fitting as Governors of the Church, to whom that
baptism of fire was promised, who were bid to tarry and expect it, and
when so enabled; to go abroad then and use their tongues, and blow the
flames of divine love and charity through the World.</p>
            <p>I should now proceed to these miraculous tongues, the second repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of the Holy Spirit. And me thinks I am unwilling to leave them
unspoken of, to which we ow our speech. But your ears are already fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the wind, yet I hope 'tis the proper wind of the day, and the
sound of it shall not vanish as the wind, as ordinary winds and sounds,
nor my words as the soft air.</p>
            <p>So much the rather in that this Point of the <hi>wind</hi> comes more home
to us than that other of the <hi>tongues.</hi> Tongues were <hi>for them that believe
not</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> but the Wind, the rushing mighty Wind from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to cast down all the strong holds of Sin and Satan, for them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
even for us all. The fiery tongues concern the <hi>Apostles</hi> as a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
enabling of them to the work of the Apostleship, to the preaching
and divulging the Gospel of Christ: but the breath and blowing of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> concerns all Christians whatsoever, under every notion. To that,
<hi>our</hi> proper tenure is from this Wind, nay so much the more, because it
is the breath of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not the tongue that makes us Christian; the
wind like that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> quickens our dead bones into the life of Christ,
and by it we live to our own Salvation; by the tongues only to anothers.
So having gotten our share already in this Wind from Heaven, we may
the easier bear the deferring of the discourse of the tongues thence.</p>
            <p>And truly if we can now get the Spirit to blow upon these dead ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and quicken them to us into the body and blood of Christ, we shall
quickly by the vertue of that blood of the Vine speak with new tongues,
the Spirit will give utterance, and we shall sing the praises of the Lord.</p>
            <p>That should be indeed the whole business of our tongues to day, to be
as loud as the loudest wind in our Thanksgivings; O <hi>ye winds of God, bless
ye the Lord,</hi> say the three Children in the fire; O <hi>ye Children of the Lord,
bless ye the Lord in the Wind</hi> say I, in this mighty rushing Wind, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his goodness, admire his power, confess his praise, who thus blows
the sparks of grace up in us, who clenses our souls from all impure airs and
vapours, who scatters the clouds of sorrow, shews us the fairest face of
Heaven, who cools and refreshes, and revives and purges us, and wafts
us to our heavenly Countrey by this holy <hi>wind,</hi> who daily does won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
things in us, and for us, and by us, through the mighty rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:57113:235"/>
of it, and fills and replenishes us, with all the benefits and comforts
of it, whilst he passes by others without so much as a breathing on them.</p>
            <p>Yet the business would be how to catch this wind, and serve our uses
of it. Why! in the Word and in the Sacraments, and by Prayers we may
have it, and be filled with it. Come then and fill your souls; you have
heard the Word already, treasure it up, (for there are treasures for the
winds) and you shall feel it blow, move and stir in you. The blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
is a second way to be filled with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> 'tis reacht out and
proffer'd to us there; we may there take it into our mouths as before into
our ears, and it will rush down all before it that stands against it, down
it will into our bowels and fill us with all heavenly fulness: And then
draw it in and breath it out we may by devout and holy Prayers; only
remember always the disposition of that soul this <hi>Spirit</hi> only will abide
with, peace and unity. Thus dispos'd you must be to receive the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
thus dispos'd to receive the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and then the Spirit will discend
upon our Sacrifice, and the wind of Gods benediction upon our offering,
and we shall return hence with mighty rushings in us, the rushing down
of sin, the raising up of grace, mighty mighty things will be done in us by
the power of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this <hi>Wind,</hi> and as it came from Heaven, so
thither will it back again and carry us upon its wings to keep a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Feast, an Eternal Whitsunday, all in the white Robes of everlasting
Glory.</p>
            <p>Blow O blessed <hi>Wind</hi> upon us this day; blow away our chaff and dross,
and dust out of our performances, breath into thy holy mysteries the
breath of a life-giving life, rush down all our sins before thee; purifie and
clense and refresh, and revive and comfort us by thy saving breath, that
this wind may bring us good, all the good of Heaven and Earth, fill both
our ears and hearts here with sounds and songs of joy, and hereafter
with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> for evermore.</p>

                  <p>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place.</p>
                  <p>And suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p>
                  <p>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sate
upon each of them.</p>
                  <p>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the day of Pentecost</hi> here <hi>was fully come,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>they
were all filled,</hi> says the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and began to
speak. Now the day is fully come again, we also are
<hi>full of matter</hi> (as <hi>Elihu</hi> told <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> xxxii. 18.) and <hi>we
must speak.</hi> For 'tis a day of <hi>Tongues,</hi> a day to speak
<hi>in,</hi> and a day to speak <hi>of</hi> too, to speak <hi>magnalia</hi> in it,
and of it, of the great things of God, and the great
things of the day, the wonderful works of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. which were
this day wrought by the descent of the holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> To this end the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
descended, to this end the Tongues came, to this end <hi>both</hi> appeared,
that we might learn to use our Tongues and Spirits to set forth his praise,
every one according as the Spirit gives him utterance according to the
gift and place that God has given him; <hi>We,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Ministers
of the Spirit; <hi>you,</hi> as <hi>Disciples</hi> to be taught by us; you, to ask with those
hearers, <hi>ver. 37. Men and brethren what shall we do?</hi> We, as St. <hi>Peter,
ver.</hi> 38. to tell you <hi>what</hi> to do; <hi>We,</hi> faithfully to preach the Word, the
remission of sins, and the gifts of the holy Ghost, <hi>ver. 38. you,</hi> gladly to
receive it, <hi>ver. 41. We,</hi> to begin the <hi>Anthem, you,</hi> to make the <hi>Chorus</hi> for
the service of this days solemnity; both of us to bear our parts to
day in praises and thanksgivings, for the benefits we receive from this
days business.</p>
            <p>We have the last year begun to speak of it out of this Text, we begin
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:57113:236"/>
again to speak of it hence this year, shall do as the Spirit shall give us
utterance. To hold our peace to day were to sin against the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
who this day gave us all our tongues to speak. And I hope nor we
nor you will be silent of his glory, no such evil shall befall us.</p>
            <p>For a day of good tidings it is, was so when it came first, will be so
now 'tis come again, and when ever it comes about, was so to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
will be so I hope to us to hear the voice of a Comforter, to see his
appearance, or out hear of it. The Text is the Story of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Relation
of the coming of the Comforter, the descent of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> In it,
when time was, we observed these four Particulars:
<list>
                  <item>I. The <hi>disposition</hi> of them the Spirit comes upon.</item>
                  <item>II. The <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> and order he comes after.</item>
                  <item>III. The <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Issue</hi> that comes upon it. And</item>
                  <item>IV. The <hi>Time</hi> when it came to pass.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. The <hi>disposition</hi> of those the <hi>Spirit</hi> comes upon is such as makes men to
be of one accord, that brings them all to one place, upon such days as
<hi>Pentecost,</hi> on the solemn feasts, makes them then and there sit quietly,
and orderly expecting Christ, a unanimous, Church-like, orderly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,
and religious disposition. Upon such, and such only, is it that the
holy <hi>Spirit</hi> comes.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>way, manner,</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of his coming is as a <hi>mighty wind,</hi> and
like as <hi>fire.</hi> Suddenly he came, came as a sound, as a sound from heaven,
as a sound of a rushing mighty wind, and such a one too as filled all the
house. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me (2.) as fire, as tongues of fire, as cloven tongues of fire,
such fire yet as sace upon them and did no hurt, heavenly and coelestial
fire. Thus he came to day.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Issue</hi> is filling, the filling of all that then were present
with ghost and spirit, <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> and spirit, then with words, and tongues,
and speech, even according to the measure or pleasure of the Spirit.
This the issue of the holy Spirits coming, fulness, and spirit, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and utterance, new hearts, and new spirits, new languages, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
to use them.</p>
            <p>IV. The <hi>time,</hi> the Time of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when it was fully come, when
all was ready, persons, and place, and time fully disposed and fit, then
comes the holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> then came all these things to pass. I put this last,
though it stands first, that I might close up all at least in good time and
order.</p>
            <p>There wants nothing now, O blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> to go on and finish, but
that thou shouldst come and order all our thoughts and spirits, that we
may humbly receive the sound of thy holy Word; that I thy servant
may have utterance, this thy people give thee audience, all of us obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and all our hearts and tongues be so thorowly heated with
thy holy fire, that they may be filled with thy praise and honour all the
day long.</p>
            <p>That we may do so, here are tongues given in the Text, <hi>ver. 3. Cloven
tongues, as it were, of fire;</hi> there we left, there we begin again, at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Way and Manner of the holy <hi>Spirits</hi> coming down to day. And
<hi>there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sate upon each of them.</hi>
Where (1.) of the <hi>Order;</hi> (2.) Of the <hi>Appearance;</hi> (3.) Of the <hi>Manner</hi> it self;
And lastly, of the <hi>Continuance</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For the Order, 'tis the second way of the Spirits coming here, first in
the <hi>wind,</hi> then in the <hi>fire.</hi> The holy fire within us is not kindled but with
a mighty wind. The divine spark or soul cannot be blown up into a fire
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:57113:236"/>
till some mighty wind has shaken all our powers, blown off the dust and
ashes, those earthly, worldly affections that choak'd and cover'd it, till
it has rais'd a tumult in all the corners of us, dispers'd the vanities and
irregularities of all our motions, and scatter'd every thing that hinder'd
it from the obedience to the Spirit; then, and not till then, the fire bursts
forth, and, as the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> we speak with our tongues.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Order</hi> (2.) is the same between the sound and the tongues. The
Sound first, the tongues second. We are first to hear before we speak, so
the Spirits order tells us here. Not turn Teachers at the first dash; not
presume to teach others before we are thorowly taught our selves, that's
none of the <hi>Spirits</hi> way of teaching, how spiritual soever they think
themselves that do so, that speak what they have neither seen nor heard,
their own fancies and imaginations, the divisings of their own hearts,
such as the Christian world never heard before, whereof there is not so
much as the sound, or any thing sounding like it in all the Writings of
the Church.</p>
            <p>The sound too (3.) before the fire. The <hi>Spirit</hi> manifests it self by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
first, more obscurely to the ear, then more evidently to the eye.
<hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi> says <hi>Iob, Chap.</hi> xlii. 5. that was a
favour: but now <hi>mine eye seeth thee,</hi> that's a greater. The <hi>Spirit</hi> comes
by degrees. Gods favours rise upon us in order. There comes first a great
and strong wind that rends the mountains, and breaks in pieces the
rocks before him, that throws down our mountainous thought and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
breaks them all in pieces, crosses our designs, thwarts them with
some great affliction, or some strange thing or other, breaks our very
hearts, our stony hearts; then follows an earthquake in all our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we begin to shake and tremble with the fear of the Almighty;
then comes the fire and burns up all the chaff, scorches our very bones,
and warms us even at the heart; whereupon presently there issues
out a still small voice out of our lips, the tongues follow upon the fire,
or are even with it. This was signified to us thus by Gods appearing to
<hi>Elijah, 1 Kings</hi> xix. 11, 12. and the same order the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God uses
here to the <hi>Apostles;</hi> the same method still he keeps with us. For he thrusts
not in upon us unprepared, he makes himself a way into us, gives us not
so clear an evidence as seeing him at the first, not till the sound has well
awaken'd us, and the wind well brush'd and cleans'd our houses for him.
Yet then appear he does.</p>
            <p>For we now presently hear of his appearance. <hi>There appeared tongues.</hi>
The <hi>manifestation of the Spirit,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, is given to every man to profit
withal,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 7. Not the <hi>Spirit</hi> only, but the <hi>manifestation</hi> too. No Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
without some manifestation. If the Spirit be an extraordinary Spirit,
the manifestation will be so too: If it be but ordinary, the manifestation
will be no more.</p>
            <p>1. If God sends any with an extraordinary commission to preach or
teach, he enables them with an extraordinary Spirit, appears with them
after some extraordinary fashion, tongues, or miracles, or some high
heavenly fires come with them. They but blaspheme the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
usurp upon the Office who take it upon them without such a warrant;
they <hi>run</hi> without <hi>sending,</hi> says God, <hi>Ier.</hi> xxiii. 21. their tongues are but
their own, and (however those perverse fellows in the <hi>Psalm</hi> infer, they
are they that ought to speak, who is Lord over them? <hi>Psal.</hi> xii. 4.) they
ought not to speak, there is a Lord over them, what ere they think,
that will one day call them to accompt, and make them know it; their
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:57113:237"/>
fire they bring is but <hi>Nadabs</hi> and <hi>Abihu's,</hi> their <hi>zeal</hi> without <hi>knowledge,</hi>
they have no tongue but what their mother taught them, the holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
has taught them none, made no appearance to them either by fire or by
tongues, they are filled with some other Spirit, the Spirit of Pride, of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
or Rebellion, or somewhat worse; where the <hi>Spirit</hi> sends with an
extraordinary commission, it will appear by some gift extraordinary and
miraculous, somewhat will appear.</p>
            <p>But (2.) if our mission be but ordinary, the ordinary way that the <hi>Spirit</hi>
has now left in the power and authority of the Church will be sufficient;
yet that must appear too, our authority appear thence; our tongues
serve to it too, to the edifying of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 12. to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it up, not to the pulling of it down. Every gift of the holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
is to have its manifestation, tongues, and interpretation, and prayer,
and Prophesie, and all the rest, yet all in order. Every one to employ,
not hide his talent; he who has a <hi>ministery to waite on that,</hi> he that is to
<hi>exhort</hi> to <hi>attend to that,</hi> he that is to <hi>teach</hi> to <hi>busie himself in that,</hi> though
<hi>all according to proportion,</hi> Rom. xii. 6, 7, 8. all to appear to the glory of
God.</p>
            <p>Yea, even those saving graces of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are not always to be kept
within, they are to appear in tongues or fire, so shine that others may
glorifie, so speak and act that others seeing our good conversation may be
affected with it, and perswaded to grace and vertue by it. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is
not given to be hid under a bushel; the wind cannot, the fire will not,
the tongue is not usual to be kept in so. They all appear'd here after
their way, the wind after its way, the tongues and fire after theirs; in
this verse to the fight, the most certain of the senses that we might
not be deceived by pretended Spirits, might have somewhat manifest to
judge by, to tell us that the graces of the Spirit, whether those for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of others, or sanctification of our selves, are for manifestation,
to appear to others as well as to our selves, we receive them to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to profit others, and to <hi>approve</hi> our selves.</p>
            <p>These may serve for reasons why the <hi>Spirit</hi> appears, but why the <hi>Spirit</hi>
appears now, now first, and not before; now first visibly to the world, is
worth enquiry. And 'tis to shew the preheminence of the Gospel above
the Law: That stood only in <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>drinks,</hi> and divers <hi>washings</hi> and
<hi>carnal ordinances,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Heb. ix. 10. was but the Law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Commandment, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 16. The Gospel is a Law of spirit and life;
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> a dead a killing Letter, but the Gospel of Christ a
quickning Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6. the Law a course of shadows, the Gospel
only the true light. It will appear so by the next Particular we are to
handle, the manner of his appearing. In tongues, in cloven <hi>tongues,</hi> in
<hi>tongues as it were of fire:</hi> I shall invert the order, for the fire it is that gives
light unto the tongues to make them for to appear; of the fire then first,
to shew <hi>them</hi> the better.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Spirit</hi> to appear as wind or breath is nothing strange. It carries
them in its name. <hi>Spiritus à spirando</hi> every one can tell you. But that
this breath should not only blow up a fire, but be it self also blown into
it, the Spirit here appear as fire, that's somewhat hard at first perhaps
to understand: Yet you shall see many good reasons for it. Four great
ones I shall give you, which comprehend more under them: (1.) To
shew the <hi>Analogy</hi> and correspondence of Gods dealings and dispensations,
how they agree both with themselves, and with one another. (2.) To
insinuate to us the nature and condition of the holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> (3.) To
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:57113:237"/>
signifie the several gifts and graces of it. (4.) To declare its operations
also and effects.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> here appear'd like fire, that we might see it is the
same God that gave both Law and Gospel, the same <hi>Spirit</hi> in both <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
The Law was promulgated by fire, <hi>Exod.</hi> xix. 18. the Lord descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> then in fire. The Gospel also here is first divulged by
tongues as it were of fire in <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> The difference only is that there
were here no lightnings, thunders, clouds, or smoke, as there were
there; nothing terrible, nothing dark or gloomy here, all light, and peace,
and glory.</p>
            <p>2. Under the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> the Prophets oft were Commissionated by
<hi>fire</hi> to their Offices; the Angel takes a live coal from off the Altar and
lays it upon <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s mouth, <hi>Isa.</hi> vi. 7. <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet stood up as fire,
<hi>Ecclus.</hi> xlviii. 1. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> first Vision was of appearances of fire, <hi>Ezek.</hi> i. 4, 13.
The Commissions therefore of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were drawn here also, as it
were, with pens of fire, that they might the more lively answer, and the
better express the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That the nature of the Law they were to preach might be exprest
too. It was the Law of love, and the holy fire of Charity was it they
were sent to kindle in the World.</p>
            <p>4. It was to teach them what they were to expect in the World them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
fire and faggot, affliction, and tribulation, the lot and portion both
of them, and of their followers ever since.</p>
            <p>5. It was to teach them what they were to be, <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>shining
lights</hi> to lead others into heaven.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That so all righteousness, Law and Prophets, might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
the types of the one, and the promises of the other, from the
first of them to the last, to St. <hi>Iohn Baptists,</hi> that they should be baptized
with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> and <hi>with fire,</hi> that the fire that Christ came to send
into the earth, and was then already kindled, might now burn out into
the World. And all this to shew the Almighty Wisdom, who thus
agreeably orders all his doings from the first unto the last, that we
might with the greater confidence embrace the Doctrine of the
Gospel which so evenly consented with the Law, and was added only to
bring it to perfection, to raise up the fire of devotion and charity to the
height.</p>
            <p>2. But not only to manifest the wisdom of the Father, and perform
the promise of the Son, but secondly to intimate the nature of the holy
<hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fire</hi> is the purest Element. The holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is pure, and incorruptible,
<hi>thine incorruptible Spirit,</hi> says the <hi>Wise man,</hi> Wisd. xii. 1. No evill can dwell
with it. It will not mingle with humane interests; By this you may
know it from all <hi>other</hi> Spirits. They intermix with private hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and self-respects, and great ones fancies: The holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is a
fire, and will not mix, it must dwell alone; has not a tongue now for
this, and then for that, to please men, and ease it self, but is always pure
and incorrupt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fire</hi> (2.) is the subtilest Element, it pierces into every part; And
<hi>whither can I go then from thy Spirit,</hi> says holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cxxxix. 6. <hi>If I
climb up into heaven, thou art there; If I go down to hell thou art there also. If I take
the wings of the morning, and remain in the uttermost parts of the Sea, even there
also will it find me out.</hi> Darkness cannot cover me, thick darkness cannot
hide me, night it self cannot conceal me from thee, O thou divine
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:57113:238"/>
               <hi>Spirit.</hi> O keep me therefore that I may do nothing that may make
me ashamed and hide my self, seeing thy eyes will quickly pierce into
me.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Fire</hi> is an active nature, always stirring, always moving. Nothing
can be found better to express the nature of the holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> It mov'd
from the beginning, actuated the first matter into all the shapes we see,
breath'd an active principle into them all; renew'd again the face of the
Earth when the waters had defaced it; blows, and the waters flow;
blows again, and dries them up; guides the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> inspires the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
rests upon the Governours of the People, from <hi>Moses</hi> to the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Elders;</hi> gives spirit and courage to the <hi>Martyrs; Non permanebit spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
meus in vagina,</hi> says God, <hi>Gen.</hi> vi. My <hi>Spirit</hi> will not endure to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as in a rusty sheath; it will be lightning the understanding, it will
be warming the affections, it will be stirring of the passions, it will be
working in the heart, it will be acting in the hand, it will be moving
in the feet, it will be quickning all the powers to the service of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
nothing so busie as this holy fire, nothing so active as this <hi>Spirit.</hi>
Though the nature and essence of it cannot be full exprest, it is thus very
powerfully resembled.</p>
            <p>3. The gifts of it more easily by this fire. Seven there are numbred of
them out of <hi>Isa.</hi> xi. 2. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>ghostly strength,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>true godliness,</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>holy fear,</hi> all very naturally represented to us by so many
properties I shall observe to you of the fire. Fire, it ascends, it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates,
it tries, it hardens, it enlightens, it warms, it melts. You have
all these again in the seven gifts of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For (1.) the holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
elevates our souls by the Spirit of Wisdom, <hi>coelestia sapere,</hi> as it is <hi>Col.</hi>
iii. 2. to <hi>those things that are above. Sapientia est rerum altissimarum,</hi> says
the divine <hi>Philosopher,</hi> Wisdom is of things of the higest nature, of a high
ascending strain. (2.) It penetrates and pierces like the <hi>fire</hi> by the
Spirit of understanding, understands that which the Spirit of man cannot
understand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 11. <hi>the very things of God,</hi> pierces into them all. (3.) It
tries like fire, by the Spirit of counsel, and advice, teaches us to prove
all things, and choose the best. (4.) It hardens us against all the evils
that can befall us, as fire does the brick against all weather by the spirit
of fortitude and ghostly strength. (5.) It enlightens the darkness of our
souls by the spirit of knowledge, teaches us to know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto our peace, the ways and methods of salvation. (6.) It heats
the coldness of our affections by the Spirit of piety and true godliness,
inflames us with devotion and zeal to Gods service. And (7.) it softens
our obdurate hearts by the Spirit of holy fear that we melt into tears and
sighs at the apprehension of Gods displeasure, even as Wax melteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>fire:</hi> the highest, hardest, rockiest mountains melt and flow down
at his presence, when once his Spirit does but cast a ray upon them. These
are the seven gifts of the Spirit, represented to us by so many properties
of the <hi>fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There are seven other operations and effects of the same <hi>Spirit,</hi> as
lively also exprest by it, and make the fourth reason why the holy Ghost
appears under the semblance of <hi>fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Fire it burns; and the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> calls this Spirit a <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>burning,</hi> Isa. iv. 4. It makes our hearts burn within us, as it did the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 32. puts us to a kind of pain, raises sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and contrition in us, makes the scalding water gush out of our eyes,
you may even feel it burn you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:57113:238"/>
2. With this burning it purifies and purges too; As things are puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the fire, so are our spirits and souls, and bodies purified by the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. For purifie it must needs, for it devours all the dross, the chaff, the <hi>hay</hi>
and <hi>stubble</hi> that is in us; purges out our sins, burns up every thing before
it that offends, is a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> Heb. xii. 29. so is God, so is his Spirit.</p>
            <p>4. Yet, as it is a consuming, so it is a renewing fire. Fire makes
things new again. And do but send out thy Spirit, O Lord, and they
are made, <hi>Psal.</hi> civ. 30. We are all made, for so it is that thou renewest
the face of the earth, the face of this dull earth of ours, by putting into
it the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>5. To this purpose it makes, that like as fire it separates (5.) things of
divers natures, silver from tin, metals from dross. <hi>Separare heterogenea</hi> is
one of the effects of fire, says the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> to distinguish and divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
things of different kinds. And <hi>Spiritus judicii &amp; discretionis,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
styles the Spirit, a Spirit of judgment it is, <hi>Isai.</hi> 4. 4. a discerning
Spirit, teaches us to discern between Dross and Gold, Truth and Error,
between Good and Evil, and without it we discern nothing. This the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
reckons as a peculiar donation of it, the <hi>discerning of spirits,</hi> 1 Cor.
xii. 10.</p>
            <p>6. Yet as it separates things of different natures, so (6.) it unites
things of the same kind, just as the fire does several pieces of the same
metal into one body. This holy Spirit is a Spirit of unity. They that
separate, they have not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> St. <hi>Iude</hi> 19. Schisms and Divisions,
Strife, Heresies and Seditions are the works of the flesh, not of the spirit,
<hi>Gal.</hi> v. 20. The fruit of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>love</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul</hi> there,
<hi>ver.</hi> 22. And the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Spirit in the bond of peace</hi> we hear of too,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> iv. 3. Into one <hi>Spirit</hi> we are baptiz'd all, for there is but one; <hi>one
Spirit, one Body, one Hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God, one all</hi> that
are of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. nothing so contrary to the Holy Spirit, as divisions
of the members from the head, or from one another; a shrewd witness
this against the spirits of our age, and an evidence that to what spirit
soever they lay claim, they lay false claim to this, they belong not
to this Spirit, which is so much for uniting all the parts of the body of
Christ together,</p>
            <p>7. And this it can do when its sees its time, for lastly, it is an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit, it bears down all before it, turns all into it, like the fire, of
all the Elements the most victorious and triumphant. There is no stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out against this Spirit, 'tis an Almighty Spirit that can do what it
will. It inflames the air into a fire, vain airy spirits into celestial flames of
love and charity. It dries up the water, the raw waterish humors of our
souls, and fixes all waverings and inconstancies. It burns up our
earth, and all the grass and hay, and sprouts what ever that stand against
it. It sets whole houses all a fire, sets us all a fire for Heaven and
heavenly business. Thus it burns, it purifies, it consumes and renews a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
it separates and it gathers, and it caries all before it, dees what it
will in Heaven and Earth, subdues Scepters, vanquishes Kingdoms,
converts Nations, throws down Infernal Powers, and turns all into the
obedience of Christ. To this purpose it is, that it now also here comes
in <hi>Tongues.</hi> The second manner we noted of his appearance; and that
for three reasons; (1.) nothing more convenient to express either our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
or him whose it is.</p>
            <p>The Tongue is the instrument of speech, the Word is express by it;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:57113:239"/>
Christ is the Word, the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it were, the Tongue to express
him, comes to day with an Host of tongues to send this Word abroad into
all the World.</p>
            <p>Nothing more necessary, for the Apostles were to be the Preachers of
it, had receiv'd a Commission to go and preach, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 15.
wanted yet their tongues, some new enablements, went not therefore
till they were this day brought them; and a more necessary thing the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> could not bring them for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Yet they had need (2.) be of fire, sharp piercing tongues, like the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
flames of fire, such as would pierce into the soul, reveal the inmost
secrets of the heart and spirits, and, it seems, so they proved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv.
25. <hi>piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, of the joints and
marrow,</hi> Heb. iv. 12.</p>
            <p>Tongues of fire (3.) to warm the cold affections of men into a love of
Christ; every tongue is not able to do that, it must be a tongue set on
fire from Heaven that can do that. Tongues, and tongues of fire, sharp
piercing tongues, warm with heavenly heat are the only tongues for the
business of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. Yet <hi>cloven</hi> they must be too. 'Tis not a single tongue will do it.
The <hi>Apostles</hi> were to preach to the world, and in the world there were a
world of tongues; that they might therefore so preach as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
as many tongues were necessary to be given them, as there were
people with whom they were to deal.</p>
            <p>Behold the greatness of Gods goodness here. Tongues were divided
for a curse at first; lo, he turns them into a blessing; then they were sent
to divide the world, now they are given to unite it; then they wrought
confusion, now they are given to unite it. Thus God can turn our curses
into blessings when he pleases. And fit it is, that we then should turn
our tongues to his praise and glory.</p>
            <p>This we may do with one tongue alone. But they who would be
Preachers, and teach others, had need of more. Tongues though they
come not now suddenly like the wind, yet come they must as they can
come, by our industry and Gods blessing. God would not have sent so
many tongues, if more then one had not been necessary for his work;
though not now perhaps to preach, yet to understand surely what we
preach. 'Tis a bold adventure to presume to the office of a Teacher with
a single tongue. He is not able to teach children to spell true that knows
no more, much less to spell the mysteries of the Gospel to men, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not so much as that one tongue he speaks if he understand no
more. Unless we be wiser than Christ and his Holy Spirit, we cannot
think any sufficiently endued to preach them, but such as have received
the gift of tongues, more then one or two; the gift I say, for though
to speak with tongues be not given now miraculously, as it was here, yet
given it is to us, it is the gift still of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> as a blessing upon
our labours.</p>
            <p>But there are other tongues besides which come from this days
mercy. The tongue that speaks right things, the tongue that comforts
the afflicted soul, the tongue that recals the wandring step, the tongue
that defends the fatherless and widow, the tongue that pours it self out
in prayers and praises, the tongue that speaks continually of holy things,
the tongue that speaks no evil, nor does no hurt, the tongue that speaks
nothing but a meek and humble and obedient spirit; these are the
tongues of the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> and even from this day they have their rise,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:57113:239"/>
these are for all orders and sorts of men, and if those men who now take
to themselves to be Teachers, had but learnt to speak with these tongues,
they would have spoke to far better purpose, and more to Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
than now they do in speaking as they do, they had not thus blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> to entitle him to the extravagancy of their
tongues.</p>
            <p>Yet fire and tongues, and tongues of fire, are not all the wonders
that this day produced. These fell not only like a flash of Lightning
upon the Apostles, but they sate upon them, or rather, <hi>It sate upon them</hi>
says the Text.</p>
            <p>All these tongues, as divided and cloven as they were, like so many
flames or tongues of fire at top, they were all united in one root below,
with <hi>one mouth,</hi> Rom. xv. 6. with <hi>one voice,</hi> Chap. iv. 24. they spake all but
the same thing. They are not the tongues of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that speak now
one thing, now another, that agree not in the foundation at the least.</p>
            <p>Nor is that fire of the Holy Ghosts enkindling, that cannot sit, for to the
fire we may (2.) refer this <hi>It.</hi> The holy flame is not like the fire of thorns,
that are always crackling &amp; making a noise, it can sit quietly in the heart
and on the lips, and on the head, sometimes in the one, and sometimes
on the other; it sits upon the heads and singes not a hair, it sits in the
heart and scalds it not at all, it sits upon the lips, yet makes them not burst
out into a heat; the firy zeal that is so much cried up for spirit in the
world is too unquiet, too hot, too raging to be of this days fire.</p>
            <p>Yet (3.) we may refer this <hi>It</hi> to the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> it self. That sate upon
each of them too.</p>
            <p>It sate first upon each of them as a crown of glory, so St. <hi>Cyril.</hi> The
<hi>Apostles</hi> were the Crowns and Glory of the Churches, and so this install'd
them.</p>
            <p>It sate (2.) upon them as in a Chair of State, to fix authority upon
them, to set them in their Chairs, to give them power to govern and
guide the Church.</p>
            <p>It sate (3.) upon them so, to call into their mind the promise of their
Master, that he would send one to sit in counsel with them, and be with
them always to the end of the world, for sitting is a posture to denote
constancy, establishment, and continuance.</p>
            <p>It sate (4.) as it were, to teach us to be setled and constant too, to be
establisht and grounded in our faith, not to be wavering and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with every wind of doctrine. There is no greater evidence against
error, then that it is not constant to it self, no greater argument against
these great pretended spirits, then that they cannot sit, know not where
to fix, are always moving, as if the <hi>Psalmists</hi> curse had taken hold upon
them (as it does, and will do without doubt, upon all that take the
houses of God in possession, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxiii. 12. that usurp upon the office or
portion of the Church) as if God had made them like a wheel and as
stubble before the wind, that can sit no where, rest at nothing, but turn
about from one uncertainty to another. The Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> is a Spirit that
will sit still, and be at peace, continue and abide.</p>
            <p>It sate (5.) upon each, to teach each of us peace and quiet in all our
passions, constancy and continuance in truth and goodness, and a setled
and composed behaviour in all conditions, blow the winds never so high,
burn the fires of persecution never so hot against us.</p>
            <p>It were well now if we could say, as it follows next, concerning the
Apostles, that we were filled with this Spirit, that we were filled with the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57113:240"/>
Holy Ghost, that we might arrive at that point within our selves, though
we cannot now arrive at that particular in the Text.</p>
            <p>The only filling now that I have time to tell you of, is that before us,
and 'tis a good one, the filling us with the body and bloud of Christ, which
is a signal filling us with the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Go we will then about it, so to fill our
our souls. The tongues and fire in the Text, we may well apply to it, we
may have use of there.</p>
            <p>For tongues are not to speak with only, but tast with two: O tast we
then how good and gracious the Lord is there, that vouchsafes so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to come under our roofs, to come upon tongues. And</p>
            <p>Tongues (2.) are to help to digest as well as tast, there in the mouth is
a kind of first digestion made. Ruminate we then, and meditate upon
Christ when we have tasted him. Let it be our business to spend much of
our time and days henceforth in meditation of him, that's the way indeed
to be filled with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> while we thus digest him and chew upon him
in our spirits.</p>
            <p>Nor is (3.) fire improper any way to bring to that holy Table. The fire
of charity is to kindle our devotion there, to warm our affections and
desires to it.</p>
            <p>There (4.) our tongues are to be warm'd into praises, that they may
run a nimble descant upon his benefits, and move apace to the glory of
his Name. Thus are our tongues to be imployed, and thus is the fire to
be kindled in us that we may speak with our tongues. This is the way to
be filled with the Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> this blessed <hi>Sacrament</hi> the means to it.</p>
            <p>Come thou therefore O blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> into our hearts and tongues,
lighten our understanding with thy heavenly light, warm our affections
with thy holy fire, purge away all our dross, burn up all our chaff, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our spirits, separate our sins and evils from us; unite us in thy love,
subdue us to thy self, teach our hearts to think, our tongues to speak,
our hands to act, our feet to move only to thy will; settle thy self in us
hence forward, and dwell with us; so teach us with all our tongues and
powers to praise thee here upon earth, that we may one day praise thee
with them in Heaven for evermore.</p>

<hi>they rest not day and night saying it:</hi> and <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts, which
was, and is, and is to come,</hi> there's the form we best do it in.</p>
            <p>In each Part we shall observe a kind of <hi>Trinity,</hi> or three Parts in
each.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:57113:241"/>
In the Pattern, (1.) the Persons; (2.) their earnestness, and (3.) their
continuance. (1.) The persons praising God, and saying it, <hi>They,</hi> the
<hi>four beasts</hi> or living creatures, as the words tell us just before. (2.) Their
earnestness in it, <hi>They rest not saying,</hi> they cannot rest for saying it; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest without the saying it, unless they say it, say it over and over,
<hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> cannot rest but doing it, that's their rest they take, their
praising God. (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) Their continuance at it, <hi>day and night</hi> it is, and without
rest and pause is it, they are continually doing it, saying and doing all to
his honour and glory.</p>
            <p>In the Form of Praise we have a sort of <hi>Trinity</hi> too, three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable:
(1.) The glory or honour given, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy.</hi> (2.) The
Persons to whom it is, <hi>Lord, God Almighty, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> yet
all three in one; one single <hi>Lord,</hi> one only <hi>God,</hi> one alone <hi>Almighty,</hi> and
no more; so there's the <hi>Vnity in Trinity</hi> into the bargain. And (3.) here
are the benefits intimated we praise him for, He was our <hi>Creator,</hi> He is
our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> He will be our <hi>Glorifier.</hi> So you see <hi>Trinities</hi> enough in the
<hi>Text</hi> to make it <hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> in it, to fill all the <hi>Trinity Sundays</hi> after
it.</p>
            <p>The sum is, that we are all to bear our parts in this holy <hi>Doxology,</hi> to
give <hi>glory, and honour, and power</hi> to the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> with the <hi>four beasts,</hi>
and <hi>four and twenty Elders</hi> from time to time for evermore; and <hi>that</hi> which
may here serve well to perswade us to it is the Company, and with them
we will begin. And <hi>they,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But who are <hi>they?</hi> The beginning of the <hi>verse</hi> tells us the <hi>four beasts,</hi> or,
as it may more genuinely and handsomly be translated, the <hi>four living
creatures,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but what, or who are they? That's the question, and
a hard one, too, it seems by the variety of opinions, probably to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
rather by conjecture than resolution. We shall take the likeliest
of them, and pass the rest.</p>
            <p>1. Some by the <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> this <hi>they,</hi> would have the <hi>four Cardinal
vertues</hi> understood, by the <hi>Lion</hi> fortitude, by the <hi>Calf</hi> or <hi>Oxe</hi> justice, by the
<hi>Eagle</hi> temperance, and by the <hi>Man</hi> prudence. And then the sense will be
that God is most signally prais'd and glorified by a vertuous life, no way
like that to praise him. To do righteousness, to walk wisely, to live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
to stand stoutly to God and goodness, that's the true way to give
glory to the whole <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Others by the <hi>four living Creatures</hi> apprehend the four chief faculties
of our souls to be insinuated, <hi>with</hi> which we are to praise him. The ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scible
intimated by the <hi>Lion,</hi> the concupiscible by the <hi>Oxe,</hi> the rational
by the <hi>face of man,</hi> and the Spirit by the <hi>Eagle.</hi> And here the Lesson is,
that we are to do it, to praise God with all our powers, set our affections
and desires upon it, be moved and angry at every thing that comes in to
hinder it, search all the means our reason can find out to perfect praise,
and raise up our Spirits upon Eagles wings to perform it to the highest
pitch.</p>
            <p>3. Some by these <hi>four</hi> conceive the whole world, consisting of the four
Elements, represented to us as praising God. The fire by the <hi>Lion,</hi> whose
nature is hot and fiery; the earth by the <hi>Ox</hi> that tills it; the air by <hi>man</hi>
that breaths it; the water by the <hi>Eagle,</hi> which as other fowl was made
out of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 20. All these indeed we find called in by the holy <hi>Psalmist</hi>
to make up the song of praise, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlviii. and by the <hi>three Children</hi> in
the fiery furnace to make up theirs, that we may know the Fire and all
the Elements, Beasts and all Creatures praise him as well as man; nay,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:57113:241"/>
better, are readier commonly to do it than he; that he is fain, even the
devoutest <hi>he</hi> of all of us to cry out to them to come in with their notes to
help him out, and fill up the Choir.</p>
            <p>4. Some think Gods title of slow to anger, and swift to mercy, is by
these four here exprest by way of <hi>Hieroglyphick:</hi> by the <hi>Oxe</hi> slowness, by
the <hi>Lion</hi> anger, by the <hi>Eagle</hi> swiftness, and by the <hi>Man</hi> mercy represented
to us. And without doubt or question in this slowness to wrath, and
swiftness to have mercy is Gods greatest glory, and for them we most
willingly give him glory, must not cease at any time to give him
glory.</p>
            <p>5. Others suppose it an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, who in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi>
appear'd in the form or face of a <hi>man;</hi> in his <hi>Passion</hi> like a <hi>Calf</hi> or
<hi>Oxe</hi> for sacrifice; in his <hi>Resurrection</hi> like a <hi>Lion,</hi> the <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah;</hi>
in his <hi>Ascension</hi> like an <hi>Eagle;</hi> and if this pass, the meaning is, that
by <hi>Christ</hi> Gods glory is most advanced, by his Incarnation, Passion, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Ascension, heaven and earth is filled with his glory, and
for this above all the rest, for him and his benefits we are to give God
the greatest glory; there, as it were, begins all our praise, thence the <hi>twenty
four Elders</hi> first throw down their Crowns, and fall down and worship, as
it were acknowledging him the beginning of all the good we receive
both of grace and glory, Christ the Author and Original of them
all.</p>
            <p>But (6.) to come a little near. These <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> say others,
represent the <hi>four Evangelists,</hi> that preach <hi>Christs</hi> Life and Death, Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Ascension into glory. The <hi>Lion</hi> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> for he begins his
<hi>Gospel,</hi> as it were, with the voice of a Lion roaring in the Wilderness.
The <hi>Calf</hi> or <hi>Oxe</hi> St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who begins <hi>his</hi> with the story of a <hi>Levitical
Priest,</hi> whose Ministry was about the Sacrifice of Calves and Oxen. The
<hi>Man</hi> St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who takes his rise from the Genealogy of men. The
<hi>Eagle</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who at the very first soars up on high, that we had need
of Eagles wings and eyes to follow and discern him. By these four in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Gods grace and mercy, <hi>Christs</hi> name and glory is spread over the
face of all the earth, and by this we learn, that to preach, and teach, and
publish the things of <hi>Christ,</hi> is to give God praise and glory, a singular and
notable way to do so.</p>
            <p>7. Some that suppose they yet hit it nearer, conceive God here brought
in in the Vision sitting as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Iudea</hi>
in council all about him, as <hi>Acts</hi> xv. it seems they did; and these <hi>four li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures</hi> about the Throne to be those four chief <hi>Apostles,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> there present, rank'd here higher than
the rest. St. <hi>Peter</hi> for his primacy set first, and resembled by the <hi>Lion</hi> for
his fiery zeal and fervour. St. <hi>Paul</hi> deciphered by the <hi>Oxe,</hi> in respect of his
labours more abundantly than they all. St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> intimated by the
<hi>Man,</hi> as being a Son of consolation, humanity, and mercy by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of his name. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> pointed at by the <hi>Eagle</hi> for those sublime
and high speculations of the Divinity of <hi>Christ</hi> above all the rest. These
were the four great Standard-bearers of the <hi>Christian Israel,</hi> (for these
<hi>four living Creatures</hi> were born in the standard of old <hi>Israel,</hi> and here allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to) these the four great Champions, and Defenders, the Planters
and Propagators of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> of the blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God and <hi>Christ</hi> throughout the world. And thus we see to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the business of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to take pains and labour to defend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
it with all our might and main is an actual and real glorifying of
God and <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:57113:242"/>
Yet, lastly, whatever these may be imagined to represent to us, or
whomsoever to point out, or what council, or persons, or judicature so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to resemble, <hi>Angels</hi> to be sure they were that thus represented the
Vision to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and as such if we consider them, we may conclude
all the business with this Lesson, that the business of heaven as well as
earth, of <hi>Angels</hi> as well as men, is to be imployed in Praises and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
to the <hi>Almighty;</hi> an imployment therefore well worth our time,
and pains, and study.</p>
            <p>Now put all these together, and I cannot give you a fuller description
of the way to praise and glorifie him than these have given you. For to
do it as we should, is (1.) to live vertuously; (2.) To employ all the
powers and faculties of soul and body to his service; (3.) To call in all
the Creatures to help us to do it, and to use them to it; (4.) To reflect
often upon both his mercies and his judgments, and acknowledge his
goodness in them both; (5.) To meditate upon the Life, the Death,
the Resurrection, the Ascension of <hi>Christ</hi> with all devotion and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
(6.) To preach and publish it what we can; (7.) To defend and
maintain it to our utmost power; (8.) To reckon it, lastly, an <hi>Angels</hi> work,
a heavenly piece of business thus to spend our days and years in giving
glory to the most highest.</p>
            <p>And if heaven, and earth, and all the creatures else besides sinful
man become thus the Trumpets of their Creators glory, and in all their
several ways and orders ambitiously contrive themselves into the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, what strange creatures must we needs be that either neglect
it, or forget it? <hi>Heaven and earth,</hi> says our <hi>morning Hymn, are full of the
Majesty of thy glory,</hi> we can be no other than hell, then, that are empty of
it, that do not resound it. <hi>Dragons and all deeps,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal.
cxlviii. 7. all but the old Dragon, and the bottomless deep, the deep of
hell, all praise him else. You see what we bring our selves to by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness,
what a sad condition they are in who give not glory unto
God, who delight not in magnifying and praising him, who are against
the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Anthems</hi> to that purpose. Thus you see it done in the
<hi>Text,</hi> by <hi>Saints and Angels</hi> in the Heavens, by <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> on the
Earth. Thus <hi>de facto,</hi> so it was then. But 'tis as well a Prediction of what
should be after: that not only the present Age of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and holy
<hi>Bishops</hi> then, but the succeeding Ages also of the <hi>Church</hi> should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the glory of the undivided <hi>Trinity.</hi> And it fell out accordingly.
Not only that meek and merciful <hi>man</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that valiant <hi>Lion</hi> St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
that laborious <hi>Oxe</hi> St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> that sublime <hi>Eagle</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> (as
some please to fancy these <hi>four beasts</hi>) or the four first <hi>Patriarchates</hi> as
others have interpreted them, but all the <hi>four corners of the earth</hi> have
since profest it, and, with the <hi>twenty four Elders, faln down and worshipt</hi> it;
The lustre and glory of that glorious <hi>mystery</hi> has shone thorow all the
quarters of the World, and all his famous mercies to his people, and his
judgments against their enemies are still daily celebrated and magnified
in all the Congregations of the <hi>Saints.</hi> This St. <hi>Iohn</hi> foresaw, and here
foretels the poor persecuted <hi>Christians</hi> then, that how hard soever things
went with them then, they should ere long turn all their sighs and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
into Songs of praise for their deliverance and salvation.</p>
            <p>This they <hi>should,</hi> and (3.) we <hi>should</hi> as much: It was foretold of them
they should, it is commanded us we should. Therefore glorifie him, says
the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 20. <hi>glorifie him in your bodies,</hi> and <hi>glorifie him in your spirits,</hi>
glorifie him with the bodies that glorifie him, and glorifie him with the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:57113:242"/>
Spirits that glorifie him, bear them all company in so doing; do it all the
ways you can, you can neither do it too many, nor too much. Put on the
faces of <hi>Eagles</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and raise your souls up there and praise him.
Put on the faces of <hi>men</hi> at home, and let the holiness of your conversation
praise him there. Put on the appearance of <hi>Oxen</hi> in your Callings, and
let the diligence of your Actions and Vocations praise him. Put on the
appearance of <hi>Lions</hi> abroad in all places of temptations, and let your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in the resisting and repelling them praise him there. Thus we truly
copy out our pattern.</p>
            <p>Yet to transcribe it perfectly well, we must now secondly also tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
their earnestness: For here they not only give praise and glory
unto God, but they do it earnestly, they rest not doing it, they rest not
saying: that is,</p>
            <p>1. They cannot rest unless they say it. And, <hi>I will not suffer mine eyes to
sleep, nor mine eye-lids to slumber, neither the temples of my head to take any rest
till I have found out</hi> a way to praise my God, till I have offered up the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of my thanks, and added something to his glory, must be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
resolution.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They rest not saying,</hi> is, they say it, and say it again, say it over and
over, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is in some Copies nine times read; <hi>Holy</hi> nine
times repeated; they think they can never say it enough: No more it
seems did <hi>David,</hi> when he so oft repeated, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever</hi>
in one single Psalm, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxvi. And hence it is the Church, to imitate
this holy fervour, so often reiterates the <hi>Doxologie,</hi> and inserts so
many several <hi>Hymns,</hi> and even either begins almost all its Prayers and
Collects with an acknowledgment either of his Mercy, Goodness,
and Providence, or ends them with acknowledgment of his Majesty,
Power, and Glory; <hi>this</hi> both to imitate the glorious <hi>Saints,</hi> and to obey
the <hi>Apostles</hi> injunction of being <hi>fervent in Prayers</hi> and Praises.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>They rest not saying,</hi> is, they rest not but in so doing. That's their
rest, their joy, their happiness to do so, thus to be always praising God.
It would be ours too, had we the same affections to it, or the same senses
of it. We could not go to rest, nor lie down to sleep, could not sit down
and take our rest till we had first lift up our eyes and hearts, nay, and
voices, too, sometimes, till we had first paid our thanks, and given him
praise for his protections in our ways and labours untill then.</p>
            <p>3. But to be thus eager and earnest at it is not all. <hi>So</hi> we might be for a
start and give over presently; but 'tis <hi>day and night</hi> that <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>good
men</hi> do it. There is no night indeed properly with the <hi>Angels;</hi> 'Tis with
them eternal day: yet all that time which we call day and night they are
still a <hi>saying</hi> it. The Morning comes and they are at it: the Night comes
and they are at it still. <hi>Let me go for the day breaketh,</hi> says the <hi>Angel</hi> that
strove with <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. xxxii. 26. And I must sing my Mattens, adds the
<hi>Chaldee Paraphrase;</hi> as if he had said, I can stay no longer, I must go take
my Morning course in the heavenly Choirs. And in the depth of night
we find them by whole hosts and multitudes at their <hi>Gloria in Excelsis, Glory
be to God in the highest,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 13.</p>
            <p>The first fervours of Christian Piety were somewhat like this of the
<hi>Angels.</hi> You might have seen their <hi>Churches</hi> full at midnight, all the
Watches of the night you might have heard them chanting out the
praises of their God, and all the several hours of the day you might have
found some or other continually praising God in his holy <hi>Temples,</hi> as well
as in their Closets. Nay, in the <hi>Iewish Temple</hi> they ceased not to do so.
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57113:243"/>
               <hi>Ye that by night stand in the House of the Lord,</hi> Psal. cxiv. 2. <hi>Praise him ye,</hi>
says holy <hi>David;</hi> for indeed ye stand there to praise him; and the
<hi>Temple</hi> it self stood open all the day for all comers, to that purpose, when
they would. <hi>Therefore shall every good man sing of thy praise without ceasing,</hi>
says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. xxx. 13. <hi>'Tis a good thing</hi> to do so, <hi>Psal.</hi> xcii. 1, 2.
<hi>To tell of thy loving kindness early in the morning, and of thy Truth in the night
season;</hi> so good, that <hi>David</hi> himself resolves upon it, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxlv. 2. <hi>Every
day will I give thanks unto thee, and praise thy Name for ever and ever,</hi> prays
also that his mouth may be filled with Gods praise, that he may sing of
his glory and honour all the day long, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxi. 7. from morning to
night, and from night again to morning, he would willingly do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else.</p>
            <p>Nay, be the night and day taken either in their natural or moral sense,
either properly for the spaces and intervals of light and darkness, or
morally for the sad hours of affliction and adversity, and those bright
ones of jollity and prosperity; good men praise God in them both,
do not cease to do it; if sorrows curtain up their eyes with tears, and
put out all their light of joy and comfort, yet <hi>blessed be the Name of the
Lord,</hi> cry they out with patient <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. i. 21. Again, if their paths be
strow'd with light, and the Sun gild all their actions with lustrous beams;
if Heaven shine full upon them, they are not yet so dazell'd but they see
and adore Gods mercy in them, and in the mid'st of all their glories and
successes they are still upon his praise, and render all to him. Neither the
one night, nor this other day make them at any time forget him. A
good <hi>item</hi> to us hence, (1.) not to suffer our pleasures and vagaries, our
mirths and vanities, our successes and prosperities to steal away the time
we are to spend in giving God thanks and glory for them. Nor (2.) to
permit our selves so much time to the reflection upon our griefs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
as to omit the praising God, that they are no worse, and that he
thus fatherly chastises us to our bettering and amendment, does all to us
for the best. Yet not to cease praising him <hi>day and night,</hi> seems still to have
some difficulty to understand it. The <hi>Angels</hi> perhaps, that neither eat
nor drink, nor sleep, nor labour, they may do it; but how shall poor man
compass it?</p>
            <p>Why! first, Imprint in thy soul a fixt and solid resolution to direct all
thy words and actions to his glory. Renew it (2.) every day thou risest,
and every night thou liest down. Renounce (3) all by-ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that shall at any time creep in upon thee to take the praise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to thy self. Design (4.) thy actions, as often as thou canst, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to Gods service, with some short offering them up to Gods will and
pleasure, either to cross or prosper them, and when they be done, say,
<hi>Gods Name be praised</hi> for them. And lastly, omit not the times of Prayer
and Praise either in publick or in private, but use thy best diligence to
observe them, to be constant and attentive at them. Thus with the Spouse
in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when we sleep our hearts awake; and whether we eat
or drink, or walk, or talk, or whatsoever we do, we <hi>do all to the glory
of God,</hi> and may be said to praise him <hi>day and night,</hi> and not cease, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
And so I come to the second General. The form here set us to praise him
in. In which first we have to consider the glory it self that is expresly
given him; <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To speak right indeed, the whole sentence is nothing else; yet this
evidently referring to that of <hi>Isai.</hi> vi. 3. where the <hi>Seraphims</hi> use this first
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:57113:243"/>
part in their <hi>Hymn</hi> of praise, I conceive this the chief and most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
part of of it, which may therefore bear the name before the rest.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>saying, Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> is attributing all purity; perfection
and glory to God as to the subject of it himself, and the original of it
to others, thereby acknowledging him only to be worship'd and ador'd.
So that saying thus, we say all good of <hi>him,</hi> and all good from him to
our selves.</p>
            <p>Thrice 'tis repeated, which, according to the <hi>Hebrew custom,</hi> is so done
to imprint it the deeper in our thoughts, and may serve us as a threefold
cord, which is not easily broken, to draw us to it.</p>
            <p>But another reason the <hi>Fathers</hi> give. And it is, (1.) they say, to teach us
the knowledge of the holy and blessed <hi>Trinity.</hi> Indeed, why else thrice
and no less or more? Why follows, <hi>Lord, God, Almighty;</hi> three more
words? why: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, three yet again, and yet but three, <hi>who
was, who is, who is to come?</hi> Why do the <hi>Seraphims</hi> in <hi>Isaiah</hi> say no more? yet
say so too? Why have we in the following verses, <hi>Glory and Honour and
Thanks,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>and Glory, and Honour, and Power,</hi> so punctually thrice, and thrice only offered to them? How came it to be so universally celebrated
throughout the World, and put into all the <hi>Catholik Liturgies</hi> every where?
words fall not from <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Angelical Spirits</hi> by chance or casually, The
holy Penmen write not words hap hazard. Nor is it easie to conceive so
hard a doctrine, so uneasie to reason, should be so generally and humbly
entertain'd, but by some powerful working of Gods Spirit. This may be
enough to satisfie us, that the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> is more then obscurely point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out to us here.</p>
            <p>And (2.) to be sure, the Fountain of all Holiness is here pointed to us,
that we may learn to whom to go for grace; that we may see we our
selves are but unholy things; that nothing is in it self pure or holy, none
but God.</p>
            <p>And (3.) it points us out what we should be; <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> says
God. No way otherwise to come near him; no way else to come so near
him, as to give him thanks; for out of polluted lips he will not take them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For in the second place the <hi>Lord God Almighty</hi> it is we are to give this
glory to.</p>
            <p>The three Persons here, me thinks are evident however; <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
the <hi>Lord the Son,</hi> and the <hi>Almighty Spirit,</hi> that made all things, that
does but blow, and the waters flow; that does but breath, and man
lives; that with the least blast does what he will.</p>
            <p>Yet these three, it seems, are still but one, <hi>one Lord,</hi> and <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one
Spirit,</hi> Ephes. iv. 4, 5, 6. all <hi>singulars</hi> here; <hi>nounes, verbs, articles,</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiples,</hi>
all in the <hi>singular number</hi> here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that we might see, though a <hi>Trinity</hi> there be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
yet 'tis in <hi>unity,</hi> though three Personalities, but one Nature, though
three Persons, but one God.</p>
            <p>All the scruple here can but arise from the setting <hi>Lord the Son,</hi> before
<hi>God the Father;</hi> but that's quickly answered, when they tell you, <hi>there is
none</hi> here <hi>afore or after other, none greater and lesser than another,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no matter at all for the order here, where all is one, and one is all,
<hi>Lord God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet now to encourage us the better to our Praises and Thanksgivings,
see we in the last place the benefits they here praise him for, and they
are intimated to us in the close of all, <hi>Who was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first, we understand the benefit of our creation. God it was that
created us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:57113:244"/>
In the second, we read the benefit of our Redemption, the Lord it is
that redeems us daily, pardons and delivers us.</p>
            <p>In the third, we have the benefit of our Glorification still to come, the
<hi>Holy Spirit</hi> here sealing us, and hereafter enstating us in glory.</p>
            <p>In them all together, we may in brief see, as in a Prospect, that all the
benefits we have received heretofore, he was the Author of them; that
all the mercies we enjoy, he is the Fountain of them; that all the joys or
good we hope for, he is the donour of them; he was, he is, he must be
the bestower of them all; without him nothing; he was, and is, and
will be to us all in all.</p>
            <p>And now sure, though I have not the time to specifie all the mercies
we enjoy from this blessed <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> and indeed, had I all time, I
could not, and all tongues, <hi>Si mihi sint linguae centum, sint ora<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> centum,</hi> I
could not, yet we cannot but in gross at least take up a Song of Praise for
altogether; say somewhat towards it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi> holy in our Creation, Holy in our
Redemption, holy in our Sanctification. Holy in Heaven, holy in Earth,
holy under the Earth too. Holy in glorifying of his Angels, holy in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
his Saints, holy in punishing the Devils; Holy in his Glory, and
holy in his Mercy, and holy in his Justice; holy in his <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and holy
in his <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and holy in his Thrones; holy in his Power, and holy
in his Wisdom, and holy in his Providence; Holy in his Ways, and holy
in his Laws, and Holy in his Promises; holy in the Womb, and holy in
Manger, and holy on the Cross; holy in his Miracles, and holy in his
Doctrines, and holy in his Examples; holy in his Saints, and holy in his
Sacraments, and holy in his Temples; holy in Himself, holy in his Son,
holy in his Spirit, <hi>Holy Father, holy Son, and Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Archangels, and with all the company of Heaven,</hi>
and all the Saints in Heaven and Earth, <hi>we laud and magnifie thy glorious
Name, evermore praising thee, and saying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts,
Heaven and Earth are full of the Majesty of thy Glory, Glory be to thee O Lord most
High, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come, Glory and Honour, and
Thanks be unto Thee for ever and ever, Amen, Amen, Amen.</hi>

SERMON
UPON THE
Calling of St. Peter.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>St. LUKE v. 8.</bibl>
               <q>—Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Strange Speech for him that speaks, to him 'tis spoken,
from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his <hi>Saviour.</hi> One would think it
were one of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who thus intreated him to
depart the Coasts. Strange indeed, to desire him to
depart, without whom we cannot be; stranger to give
such a reason for it, a reason that should rather induce
us to intreat him to tarry than to go; for being sinful
men, we have most need of him to stay with us: but strangest of all it is,
for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to desire it, and upon his knees to beseech it. To desire
Christ to go away from us, to go from us, because we have need of his
being with us, and for such a one as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that so earnestly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intreat
it, is a business we well skill not at the first dash.</p>
            <p>Yet if we consider what St. <hi>Peter</hi> was when he so cried out, or what
made him to do it, or how unfit he, being a sinful <hi>son of man,</hi> thought
himself for the company of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> we shall cease to wonder, and
know it is the sinners case for ever so to do, to be astonished at miracles,
not to bear suddenly the presence of our Lord, and when we first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it, to cry out to him, with St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, to withdraw from us for a
while, for that we are not able to endure the brightness and terrour of his
Splendour and Majesty.</p>
            <p>It was a miraculous and stupendious draught of Fish (after they had
given up all hopes of the least) suddenly came to Net, which thus ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Fellows. They had drudged and <hi>toyl'd all night,</hi> and not
a Fish appeared: but when Christ came to them, then came whole
showles, and thrust so fast into the Net, that they brake it to get in, as
if the mute and unreasonable creatures themselves had such a mind to
see him, by whose Word they were created, that they valued not their
lives, so they might see or serve his pleasure. And yet St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes as
much means that he might see him no longer, whom if he had not seen,
and seen again, notwithstanding his desires to the contrary, it had been
better he had never seen, nor been at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:57113:245"/>
But such is our mortal condition, that <hi>we can neither bear our unhappiness,
nor our happiness;</hi> unreasonable Creatures go beyond us in the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them both, according to their kinds; though it may be, here,
St. <hi>Peters</hi> humility speaks as loud as his unworthiness, or inability to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the presence of his <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we must needs say, was not thorowly call'd as yet to be a
Disciple; this humble acknowledgment of his own unworthiness to be
so was a good beginning. Here it is we begin our Christianity; which
though it seems to be a kind of refusal of our <hi>Master</hi> is but a trick to get
into his service, who himself is humble and lowly, and receives none so
soon as they that are such, none at all but such, whom by the posture of
their knees, and the tenours of hearty and humble words, you may discern
for such.</p>
            <p>And to sum up the whole meaning of the words to a brief Head, they
are no other, nor no more than St. <hi>Peters</hi> profession of his own humble
condition, that he is not worthy that his <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Redeemer</hi> should
come so near him, and therefore (in an <hi>Extasie,</hi> as it were, at the sight
of so glorious a Guest) desires him to forbear to oppress his unworthy
servant with an honour he was not yet able to bear.</p>
            <p>Yet we cannot but confess, the words may have a harder sense upon
them, as the voice of a stupid apprehension, or an insensibleness of such
heavenly favours, as our <hi>Saviours</hi> company brings with it. We shall have
time to hint at that anon. It shall suffice now at first, to trouble you only
with two evident and general parts.</p>
            <p>Christs absence desired; And</p>
            <p>The Reason alledged for it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Christ desired to be gone, <hi>Depart from me;</hi> And,</item>
               <item>II. Why he is so, <hi>For I am a sinful man, O Lord.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Desire seems to be the voice of a threefold person, and such is
St. <hi>Peters</hi> now:
<list>
                  <item>1. Of a <hi>man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Of a <hi>sinful man,</hi> and yet,</item>
                  <item>3. Of an humble man, <hi>Me,</hi> that me here, confessing my self a <hi>sinful
man.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Reasons equal the variety of the desires, or Desirers.
Three they are too.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For <hi>I am a man.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. For <hi>I am a sinful man.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. For thou, <hi>O Lord,</hi> thou art <hi>God,</hi> and I a <hi>man.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>'Tis a <hi>Text</hi> to teach us what we are, to whom we speak, and how to
speak to him. And if you go hence home without learning this, you
may say, perhaps, you have heard a Sermon, but you have learnt nothing
by it. It shall be your faults if you do not.</p>
            <p>And unless we cry in a sense contrary to St. <hi>Peters</hi> meaning, <hi>Depart</hi>
from us, <hi>O Lord,</hi> out of a kind of contempt and weariness of his Word,
and not out of the conscience of our own unworthiness of so great a
blessing; then though our words be somewhat indiscreet, though we
sometimes speak words not fitting for our <hi>Saviour</hi> to hear, though they
seem to shew a kind of refusal of him, yet being no other than the meer
expression of the apprehension of his glorious presence, and our own
unworthiness. Christ will comfort us, and call out to us presently as he
doth to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ver. 10. not to fear: we shall not lose by his Word or
Presence, nor by our so sensible apprehension of his glory, though we be
but a generation of sinful men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:57113:245"/>
That our desires, first may be set right, though peradventure not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
speak so, the desires being the hinge upon which good and evil
move on their courses, I begin to examine St. <hi>Peters</hi> desire under a
threefold consideration: Of <hi>a man,</hi> of <hi>a sinful,</hi> of an humble <hi>man.</hi> For
all these St. <hi>Peter</hi> at this time was capable of, and in which of these he
speaks most feelingly, will be perhaps anon the <hi>quere,</hi> and how far they
may pertain to us, be used, or not used by us, will be the business we are
to speak of. If we take all, we are sure to be right.</p>
            <p>Then first of the desire, as it is that of <hi>man</hi> or humane nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
simply in its own imperfection, unable to bear the presence of a
supernatural honour.</p>
            <p>Nature sometimes desires God to depart from it. It loves not to be
forced out of its course, to be screw'd up beyond it self. <hi>Miracles</hi> are
burthens to Nature: and however it be ready to serve the will of the
Supreme Mover, yet when it is diverted from its own way, and strain'd
to a service or quickness, with which its innate slowness is unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it does even by its hasting back to its old wont, in a manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be freed from the present command of its great Controuler.</p>
            <p>'Tis so with man, who being of a corruptible make, cannot endure
the presence of an incorruptible Essence. Angels and Spirits bring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment
to it when they come; we are terrified at the presence of an
Angel, though he bring us nothing but tidings of the greatest joy. Nay,
if we do but think we see a Spirit, (as the Disciples did, when it was
was no other than their beloved <hi>Master</hi>) we are wholly frighted and
amazed. There is so great a distance between our corrupt Mortality, and
their immortal conditions, that we desire not to see them.</p>
            <p>Yea, the body it self is so little delighted with the presence of its own
best companion, the incorruptible soul, (though it enjoy all its beauty
and vigour by it) that by continual reluctances against it, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
throwing off the commands of it, and so daily withdrawing its ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
from the thoughts of, or converse with that nobler part, it
seems to wish it gone, rather than to be bound to that observance which
the presence of that divine parcel requires at our hands.</p>
            <p>And if it fare no better with these natures of Angels and our own
Spirits, which are nearer mortality and imperfection, and have more
affinity to us, and full natural engagements upon us, because their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
breed either a kind of envy, or terrour to us, that we in a
manner say to those that we cannot sunder from us, our very souls, go
away, trouble us not with these spiritual businesses, how is it otherwise
likely than that we should be ready to avoid the presence of that eternal
Purity, in whose sight our best purities cannot stand at all?</p>
            <p>We love not to see our own imperfections; that makes us unwilling to
endure the presence of any thing that shews us them. Now the divine
excellencies above all the rest being that which by its exactness discovers
the most insensible blemishes we labour with, you cannot wonder, that a
creature so much in love with it self, should desire the removal of that
whose neerness of much debases it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, there is terrour besides at the approach of the <hi>Almighty.</hi>
When God drew near to his People upon the Mount, and the <hi>People saw
the thundrings and lightnings, and the noise of the Trumpet, and the mountain
smoaking,</hi> conceiving him to be at hand, whose voice is terrible as the
thunder, at whose presence the mountains smoke, <hi>they removed and stood
afar off,</hi> Exod. xx. 18. <hi>And</hi> ver. 19. <hi>they said unto Moses, speak thou with us,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:57113:246"/>
and we will hear, but let not God speak with us lest we die.</hi> Thus at
least entreating God to withdraw somewhat farther from them, even
lest they should die for fear if he should come nearer them.</p>
            <p>We cannot always say such desires are orderly and good, yet such
there are, we may say in the best created nature. Indeed we commonly
desire what is worst for us; as if we knew not our own good, or did not
study it.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Gods company can do us no harm. In his presence is
life, says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> yet say we, we die if we see him. <hi>In him we live,
and move, and have our being,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Acts xvii. 28. yet say we,
if He come to nigh us, or depart not from us, we shall be no more. Thus
our thoughts and desires run counter to him.</p>
            <p>Nay, there is a Generation that the <hi>Prophet</hi> complains of, that say
plainly unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> depart from us, <hi>Isa.</hi> xxx. 11. We will have none
of thy Laws, we desire not thy Precepts, thy Word is a burthen to us,
thy solemn Worship we cannot away with, we are weary of thy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
we are sick of thy Truth, thy <hi>Priests</hi> are a trouble to us, thy
<hi>Holy Days</hi> take too much time from us, thy <hi>Holy Service</hi> and thy <hi>Holy
Things</hi> they are too chargeable for us, take them away and depart from
us, we will have none of them any longer. This is more than the voice
of Natures imperfection, 'tis the voice of sin and rebellion added to
it; but take we heed, lest while we thus thrust God from us, he go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and come no more, go away, and leave us in perpetual sin, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and discomfort. It may please God, peradventure, to construe
what we have done hitherto as the rash hasty words only of affrighted
or disturbed Nature, not knowing which way to turn it self upon a
sudden, being amazed at the things that (we know not how) are
come to pass in these days; but if we shall persist to desire him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
(which of all sins has most unthankfulness and impiety, I may
add Atheism also, in it) he will go, and he will not return, then shall
we seek him early, but we shall not find him: We shall seek him sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and weeping, and mourning as we go, but we shall not find him;
we shall eat of the fruit of our own way,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 3.</note> and be filled with our own
devices; but we shall see him no more for ever; then shall we beg for
what we have rejected, but he will not hear us, he is departed from us,
and will not come again.</p>
            <p>Thus it was not St. <hi>Peters</hi> desire. He was not tired with <hi>Christs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
nor glutted with it, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> with their despised <hi>Manna;</hi>
only <hi>Christ,</hi> by shewing a Miracle, had so amazed his wits, that he knew
not how, on a sudden, to recollect his Spirits to entertain so great and
holy a Guest, does therefore, not well considering what to say, desire
him to divert a little some whither else, where he might be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
entertain'd, or to stand off a while, and give him breath,
that he might recover his Spirits, and be able more worthily to entertain
him.</p>
            <p>But there was somewhat else which made St. <hi>Peter</hi> so express himself.
He was not only sensible of his mortal lot, but of his sinful condition
tion too. Thus we are (2.) to consider it, as the voice of a <hi>sinful man,</hi> of
humane nature corrupted with sin.</p>
            <p>Though all created Substances contract a kind of trembling, or drawing
back at the approach of God,<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 2.</note> the very <hi>Seraphims</hi> covering their faces
with their wings, yet did not sin and folly cover them with a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
the weakest and poorest of them would draw a kind of solace and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:57113:246"/>
happiness from the beams of that Majesty that so afrighted them. 'Tis
sin that speaks the <hi>Text</hi> in a louder key, that more actually cries to him,
not softly and weakly out of weakness, but aloud and strongly out of
wilfulness, to depart.</p>
            <p>It does more then so. It drives God from us; not only bids him go,
but forces him. It is not so mannerly as to intreat him, it discourteosly
and unthankfully thrusts him out of doors. <hi>Exi a me, Get you out,</hi> says
the sinful soul to God; no <hi>obsecro,</hi> no entreaty added, not go out I pray
thee, or depart I beseech thee. We should do well to think how unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
we deal with God; we are not content to put him out of his own
house and dwelling, the temples of our bodies, the altars of our
souls, by our sins; nay, and his holy Temples by sacriledges and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but sometimes in ruder terms, we bid him be gone, and thrust him
out by wilful and deliberate transgressions, by solemn and legal sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and profanenesses, which we commit and reiterate in contempt
of him, as if expresly we said to him, Go from us, we will have nothing
to do with thee any longer: thou shalt not only not dwell, but not stand,
or be amongst us. The people of <hi>Gennesaret</hi> besought <hi>Christ</hi> to depart
out of their Coasts. These sinners will out with him whether he will or
no; and though he come again, and knock to be let in, and continue
knocking till his head be wet with the dew, and his locks with the
drops of the night, yet can he hear no other welcome from us, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us, we are in bed, well at ease in our accustom'd sins, and
we will not rise to let thee in; we will not be troubled with thy company,
with a course so chargeable or dangerous as is thy wonted service.</p>
            <p>Strange it is, that we should thus deal with God, but thus we do;
yet no man lays this unkind usage to his heart, never considers how he
thus dayly uses God. If good motions arise within us, we bid them
be gone, they trouble us, they hinder our sports or projects, our quiet
or interest. If good opportunities present themselves without, we bid
them go, we are not at leisure to make use of them, they come unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably.
If the Word preached desire to enter in, if it touch our
Consciences and strike home, we bid that depart too, it is not for our
turn, it crosses our interests, or our profits, or our pleasures, we will
not therefore have it stay any longer with us. If God by any other
way, as of afflictions or of deliverances, by blessings or curses, or any
other way come to us, they are no sooner over, nor these any sooner
tasted, but we send them gone to purpose, and think of them again no
more; our sins return and send them going, make us forget both his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and his mercies.</p>
            <p>This is the course the sinner treads to God-ward. From whence it is,
that the soul thus ill apparell'd with its own sins, dares not look God
in the face without the mediation of a Redeemer. She has driven God
from her by her sins, and having thus incens'd him, flees away when
he draws towards her. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> having by sin disrob'd
themselves of their original righteousness, when they hear the voice of
God, though but gently walking towards them, and calling to them,
they run away and hide themselves from the presence of the <hi>Lord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the trees of the <hi>Garden, Gen.</hi> iii. 8. They felt it seems, they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
something to shelter them from the presence of God, into the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
therefore they hie themselves, as if they then fore-saw they had
need of the <hi>Rod out of the stem of Iesse,</hi> the <hi>branch out of his roots,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi>
calls <hi>Christ, Isa.</hi> xi. 1. to bear off the heat of Gods anger from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:57113:247"/>
Under the leaves of this branch alone it is that we are covered,
sheltered from the wrath to come. His leaves, his righteousness it is that
clothes our nakedness; the very garments which our first Parents were
fain to get to themselves, before they durst venture again into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
There is no enduring Gods presence still, no coming nere him,
unless we look upon him through these leaves from under the shelter of
this <hi>branch</hi> of <hi>Iesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tell the sinner, who keeps not under this shelter, that lies not at this
guard, of Gods coming to him, of his looking towards him, of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to judgment, and with <hi>Felix</hi> he trembles at it, puts off the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to another time, refuses to hear so terrible news, as Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, if <hi>Christ</hi> came not with him. Such a one has sin made him, that
he desires not to see him, whose eyes will not behold sin, <hi>Depart from
me, O Lord,</hi> in stead of <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> is his daily Prayer.</p>
            <p>Yet, as hardly or unadvisedly as nature or corruption may deliver this
speech of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, it may be delivered in a softer, sweeter tone, and so
it was by him. It may (3.) be the voice of the humble spirit, casting himself
down at the feet of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and confessing himself altogether unworthy
of so great a favour as his presence.</p>
            <p>If we peruse the speeches of humble souls in Scripture, by which they
accosted their God, or their Superiors, we shall see variety of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
indeed, but little difference in the upshot of the words; <hi>I am but
dust and ashes,</hi> says father <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> xviii. 27. Now how can dust
and ashes with their light scattering atoms endure the least breath of the
<hi>Almighty.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Isaiah saw the Lord</hi> in a Vision, <hi>sitting upon a Throne,</hi>
and presently he cries out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone; because I am a man
of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes
have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Isai. vi. 5. What? undone <hi>Isaiah?</hi>
Yes, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone; for mine eyes have seen the Lord of Hosts,</hi> who
certainly cannot but consume me, for so boldly beholding him. <hi>I am not
worthy</hi> says the <hi>Centurion</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> viii. 8. <hi>that thou should'st
come under the roof of my house, speak the word only;</hi> as if his presence were
so great he might not bear it. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> assoon as he had told us, that
he had seen <hi>Christ, 1 Cor.</hi> xv. 8, tells us he was <hi>one born out of due time:</hi>
was the least of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not meet to <hi>be called an Apostle;</hi> as if
the very seeing of <hi>Christ</hi> had made him worth nothing. Indeed it makes
us think our selves so, of whom we ever think too much, till we look up
to God. Then it befals us, as it fell out to <hi>Iob,</hi> xlii. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard
thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi> [but that was nothing] <hi>now mine eye seeth
thee, Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</hi> Hither it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
that the sight of God depresses us, to think humbly of our selves,
that we profess our just deserts to be no other then to be deprived of
his presence.</p>
            <p>There are like expressions of humble minds towards our Superiours too,
in holy Writ. <hi>When Rebeccah saw Isaac</hi> coming towards her, <hi>she lighted down
from her Camel, and covered her self with her vail;</hi> as if either her humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or her modesty would not suffer her suddenly to look upon his face,
who was presently to be her Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxiv. 65. But <hi>Abigail</hi>'s comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
humility surpasses, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxv. 41. When <hi>David</hi> sent to take her
to him to wife, <hi>she arose and bowed her self to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arth, and said, behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
let thine hand-maid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
And <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> though not so courtly, yet as deeply undervalues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the sight of his Lord and King, when he thus answer's <hi>David</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57113:247"/>
kindness, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> ix. 8. <hi>What is thy servant that thou should'st look upon such
a dead Dog as I am?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Rebeccah</hi> descend from her Camel, and veil her face at the
sight of her designed husband; if <hi>Abigail</hi> term her self the servant of
the servants of <hi>David,</hi> even to the meanest office, to wash their feet: if
<hi>Mephibosheth</hi> count himself a Dog in the presence of King <hi>David,</hi> each of
these thus expressing their humility, it is no wonder if St. <hi>Peter</hi> at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his <hi>Saviour,</hi> it is but just that we in the presence of our God and
<hi>Saviour,</hi> descend from our Camels, from our Chairs of State, from our
seats of ease, from the stools whereon we sit, and bow down our eyes,
our hearts and bodies in all humility, as unworthy to look up to Heaven,
to look him in the face, whom we have so offended, willing to wash
the feet of his poorest servants, to serve him in any thing, in the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
meanest way or office, ready to profess our selves amongst the
vilest of his creatures, who cannot so much as expect a good look from
him.</p>
            <p>You may surely guess by the frame of speech (though nature and
sin may sometimes use some of the same words) that the tenor of them
altogether, is no other then the expression of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his own vileness.</p>
            <p>He confesses plainly he is <hi>a sinful man;</hi> how could he more depress
himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a man that was nothing but a sinner, a very
sinner.</p>
            <p>Thence it is, that he thinks himself unworthy, that he should stay
with him; therefore desires him, to quit his ship, but much more
his company, as far unfit to receive him, or be near about him.</p>
            <p>And (3.) whilst he thus confesses himself to be a sinful man, he
speaks somewhat doubtfully (at least) to him, as if he conceived him
to be the <hi>Lord his God;</hi> thus much however: he acknowledges so great
a disproportion between himself and <hi>Christ,</hi> that whilst he knows what
to call himself, he knows not well what to style him: to be sure, knows
not how to speak, speaks indeed, but knows not what he says, whilst
humbly desiring him to depart, he unwittingly parts with his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
not knowing what he desires or does, in this distraction.</p>
            <p>These three, an acknowledgment of our own wretchedness, a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
apprehension of our our own unworthiness, and <hi>Christ's</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
And (3.) a kind of troubled expression of them, without art or
study, are the signs and effects of true humility, and are here caus'd
by the consideration of Gods miraculous dealing with us; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
shews us Gods Goodness and Grace, his Glory and Majesty, our
own weakness, sinfulness, and misery, and by so setting them so sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
together, render us unable to express either.</p>
            <p>In some perverse natures, there arises, we must confess, sometimes
a pride upon the receipt of divine favours; so that we may say St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
behaviour after so great a miracle shewed towards him, makes
his humility the more commendable. A great and wonderful draught of
fish he had taken, and he had laboured hard for it: some body would
have given at least part of the glory of so good success to his own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or at least triumpht and gloried highly in it, as if he had been
the only favourite of Heaven, the only Saint for his good success: but
St. <hi>Peter</hi> saw by his lost labour all the by-past night, an the uncouth
multitude of fishes now against hope taken up, that his labour did but
little here: there was one with him in the boat he saw, at whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57113:248"/>
the fish came to it in such number. So that now he sees little by
himself, or his own endeavour, but that he was not fit company for the
<hi>Lord</hi> that was with him, neither worthy of that miracle, nor of that
<hi>Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus good men are humbled, even in their prosperous successes, whilst
nothing but miraculous miscarriages can humble the ungodly; and not
then neither, to think ere a whit the worse of themselves, or the better
of others, or understand, but that God himself is notwithstanding
bound still to tarry with them before all the World besides. He is truly
humble whom prosperity humbles, who in the midst of his accomplished
desires, casts himself below all, acknowledging he is less than the least
of Gods mercies, or gracious looks towards him any ways.</p>
            <p>There is yet a way that perfect souls, souls elevated above the height
of ordinary goodness, have spoke these words. There is sometimes a
rapture in heroick souls, over-born, as it were, with the torrent of the
contemplations of the divine beauty, and the delights flowing in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
from it, that some glorious Saints in their several times, have
been heard to say sometimes, <hi>Depart from us, O Lord,</hi> We have enough,
We have enough, oppress us not with pleasure which our earthen Vessels
are not able to bear.</p>
            <p>There have been those that have died with excess of joy: but it was
temporal joy, spiritual joy is not so violent to rent the body: yet it
even sometimes oppresses the soul into a kind of death, and wraps it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it self into an extasie, and after that, it is in danger to be strein'd
into another excess of pride or vain-glory; St. <hi>Paul</hi> was near it, <hi>least I
should be exalted above measure,</hi> (it seems there was great fear of it) there
was given him something to humble him, to bring him down from so
dangerous a height. It is necessary, it seems, sometimes, if not such a
desire, yet such a condition to the most perfect souls, that <hi>Christ</hi> should
depart from them now and then, least they should be puff'd up with the
multitude of those Revelations by which <hi>Christ</hi> reveals his presence in
them, and his favour towards them.</p>
            <p>There are delights in heavenly joys, which these old bottles are not
yet able to hold: and here it is, that some have desir'd God to depart
a while, to hold a while, least they should over-flow at least, and lose so
pretious a liquor, if not break in pieces and lose themselves in so
vast a depth, or at so forciblee a pouring in of heavenly pleasures
upon them.</p>
            <p>But I am too high now for that lean, meagre, creeping goodness,
which is only to be found among the sons of men, in these latter days,
where we meet with this desire in a lower key, if at all. Our souls, you
know, are the vessels of divine grace, old crazie ones, God wot, and
there is a danger, least the new liquor of celestial grace, should cause
them to crack, and break at its approach. There is something which
we are not able to bear away at first. <hi>Christian Profession</hi> must come in to us
by degrees. <hi>Christ</hi> must come a little, and go a little, or come a little, and
hold a little; <hi>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little,</hi>
not all at once; no, go away a little, turn aside a little, <hi>O Lord,</hi> and require
not of us all at once, but by degrees visit us, and bear with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With this
kind of entreaty we may desire him to withhold now and then in mercy
from us, for we are sinful men, and not able to endure other fuller dealings
with us.</p>
            <p>And lastly, in humility we may desire God to depart from us, when he
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:57113:248"/>
approaches to us in thunder and lightning, when he comes armed like a
man of war, then we may cry, and not without cause, O come not to us, or,
go from us, for we are sinful men; <hi>O Lord,</hi> have thou therefore mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
us, and forbear us.</p>
            <p>We have seen by this time, how we may use St. <hi>Peters</hi> words, and
how we must not use them. We may in humility desire God to withdraw
his Judgments, to proportion his Mercies, and to distill them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
to forbear to overthrow our nature, or overwhelm our souls with
a happiness above our mortal capacity. We may, lastly, by such a kind
of speech, declare the sense of our own unworthiness to receive so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a Guest home to us, so even wishing him to chuse a better house to
be in, or make ours such. But we must not through natural imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or impatience, draw back our selves from the service of God, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to draw back from us; nor must we at any time by sin cause him
to depart, or by perverseness and iniquity thrust him out of doors; nor
yet, lastly, grow weary of the gracious effects, and tenders of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in his Sacraments, Word, and Worship: For so we do not so
much confess, as profess, and make our selves to be sinful men; in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you may sometimes use the words, in impatience never.</p>
            <p>We cannot, now you see, say always he does well, that, with St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
says to <hi>Christ, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord;</hi> yet there is
something to make the desire, at least, seem reasonable, and often be so,
when he says it as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And the first Reason why St. <hi>Peter</hi> desires <hi>Christ</hi> to depart here, is for
that he is <hi>a man,</hi> and the first Reason why we are all so willing to have
God gone from us, is because we are men (1.) mutable and inconstant
pieces, which are neither well when God is with us, nor when he is from
us. If he be with us, then presently, <hi>Fac cessare sanctum Israel à nobis, Cause
the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us,</hi> Isa. xxx. 11. We cannot away
with that strictness and exactness he requires of us, his ways are not
pleasing to us. As soon as he is departed, then we are at another cue
<hi>Thou turnedst away thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> Psal. xxx. 7. <hi>Why art thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from us so long? Why hidest thou thy face from me?</hi> And the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Man is a mortal nature, a piece of clay. Now earth cannot
contain heaven. We cannot endure the thunder, as it roars, or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
as they glister, much less him, whose Presence is more terrible,
whose Voice more dreadful, who even shakes the Wilderness with his
breath, at whose Presence the Earth removes, and hail-stones and coals
of fire tumble down.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Flesh is grass,</hi> we are but hay and stubble, and <hi>God is a consuming
fire,</hi> well may mortality then desire him to depart, lest it should consume
it in a moment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It was the opinion of the <hi>Iew,</hi> that man could not see God,
and live, as apears by <hi>Manoah</hi>'s speech, <hi>Iudg.</hi> xiii. 22. and several other
places. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it may be, had such an imagination, whence it is, he
desires <hi>Christ</hi> to depart from him, being no other than God himself, after
whose sight he was perhaps afraid he had seen his last.</p>
            <p>Thus man, as man, thinks he can spare the Presence of his <hi>Lord,</hi> as
feeling his earthly Cottage altogether unable in it self to entertain him.
But (2.) reflecting upon his sin, whereby he is yet made far more unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and undeserving such an honour, he desires the absence of God by
reason of his sin.</p>
            <p>He loves his sin, and is loth to forgo it, and knows God will not be
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:57113:249"/>
content to dwell with it, so he wretchedly chuses rather the company of
sin than of his God, this is the way that men of the World only speak
the <hi>Text.</hi> (2.) Sin even bids defiance to the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and turns him out
of doors, that's the reason men so readily bid God depart from them.
(3.) Sin so dis-enables the powers of soul and body to any handsom
attendance upon heaven, that neither of them know how to receive him
if he should come; and besides such a stench and filth there is from it in
all the soul, that the Divine Purity cannot endure them. Thus sinful
man bids God go from him, because he is a sinful man.</p>
            <p>Now comes the last reason why God is entreated to depart, because
he is the <hi>Lord our God.</hi> A reason not readily conceived, yet this it is. <hi>Thou
art the Lord, a God of pure eyes,</hi> a strickt <hi>Master</hi> over thy servants; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
far above the reach and quality of thy Vassals under thee. They are
therefore no fit company for thee. Thou so infinitely transcendest them.
These are the Reasons, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to alledge, to perswade
<hi>Christ</hi> from his poor wretched company, because both his natural imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and his sinful weaknesses, made him unfit for the company, and
unworthy the favour of his <hi>Savionrs</hi> glorious Presence.</p>
            <p>If we consider the same Reasons, they will serve to humble us as low
as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did himself, to think our selves unworthy of the least glance
of our <hi>Saviours</hi> eye; we will confess, if we remember that we are but
men, that our frail, inconstant, corruptible nature is not answerable to
the glory of so great a blessing; we will acknowledge, if we recollect we
are sinful men, that we are not worthy that those eyes should look upon
us, that infinite beauty come near our polluted ugliness. We will in a word
profess (if we believe he is our <hi>Lord</hi>) we can no less than even desire him
to depart, lest he should see too many errors and miscarriages in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Indeed, the whole sum of all is, but to teach us humbly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our selves unworthy of such a <hi>Lord and Master,</hi> not worthy of his
Miracles, not worthy of his Mercies, not worthy of his Presence, and
ways or methods of his Presence, being no better than sinful men. This
if you carry home, and lay it up, and practice it, you carry enough for
once; and this well done, will be a sure foundation for all Christian
vertues.</p>
            <p>Yet I will not bid you say, with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> expresly, <hi>Depart O Lord,</hi> or
at least when you have said so in humility, say presently again with
faith, rather tarry with us <hi>O Lord,</hi> for we are sinful men. Say to God, as
<hi>Iacob</hi> did to the <hi>Angel</hi> that wrestled with him, <hi>I will not let thee go unless
thou bless me:</hi> Or else, <hi>Lord,</hi> if thou wilt depart, yet come again and take
me with thee, though I be a sinful man; or depart O Lord, as thou art
angry with us, let thine anger go, but turn thy self again in mercy, and
be pleased to stay. What though we be sinful men O Lord? Yet we are
men, thy Creatures, the work of thine own hands, the price of thine
own bloud. Spare us therefore good Lord, and though thou hast departed
from us, for a long, too long a season, return again and save us, for we are
sinful men, people that have need of thy Presence; never so much as
now, who cannot be without it, who though we are not worthy to be
with thee, yet we cannot but desire to be with thee for ever and ever.
Turn thee then, O Lord, and be gracious unto thy Servants, cleanse us
from our sins, free us from our iniquities, fit us for thy Presence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
us with thy mercy, and visit us with thy salvation, salvation here,
and salvation hereafter, where we may enjoy thy blessed and glorious
Presence for evermore.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words are a complaint for labour spent in vain,
yet not quite without hope of better success. And
they are St. <hi>Peters</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> at whose word notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
so much pains already lost he fears not to fall
to his work again.</p>
            <p>And the words have both their <hi>History,</hi> their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and their <hi>Allegory,</hi> they tell us what was, and
what will be; what was St. <hi>Peters</hi> and his Fellows lot, and what will
be ours, both in moral and spiritual employments; to lose all our labour
if Christ, if God be not by us, if our Master look not over us, if his
Word be not with us, both to direct us what to do, and to bless us in
the doing. They, here, toyl'd all the night, and took nothing; that's
the <hi>History.</hi> Men often toil and labour day and night, and catch as little;
that's the <hi>Moral.</hi> Nay, Gods own Labourers, his Fishermen, fish and fish,
labour and take pains, and catch nothing; that's the <hi>Allegory.</hi> Now
what's the reason, but because God is absent all the while? For that as
man lives not, so he thrives not but by every word that proceeds out of
the mouth of God. All we prosper or profit is by the power and vertue
of his Almighty Word; and in the power of that Word we must let
down our Nets if we look for a draught; and though we have laboured
all this while and caught nothing, or but little, or though it must be still
our Lot to labour still and get nothing, yet in confidence of that Word
we must let down again (and now we do) yea, though it be his pleasure
that our Net return again both empty and broken.</p>
            <p>I will not meddle now with St. <hi>Peters</hi> Story as he was a Fisherman;
what he sometimes was it matters not, <hi>God respecteth no mans person.</hi> I shall
consider him only under these two notions: As a man, one of the same
common fortune with the Sons of men; and as a Fisher of men, one
selected by the great Master of the World to ensnare the souls of men,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57113:250"/>
to bring them to his own table; and in this sense I divide the words into
<hi>generals:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. St. <hi>Peters</hi> and his <hi>Partners ill success,</hi> that they toil'd all night, and took
nothing.</item>
                  <item>2. His <hi>conclusion</hi> yet <hi>to go to his work again</hi> upon Christs command, and
confidence of better issues, <hi>Nevertheless at thy word I will let down the
net.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In the First, whether consider St. <hi>Peter</hi> under the common condition of
men, as a man, or under the nature of an <hi>Apostle,</hi> as a man <hi>separate</hi> to a holy
Function, to deal with bringing other men to the Kingdom of heaven
through his Ministry and Office, we have these particulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. That all our labour by it self is but toil and misery if Christ be
not in it to lighten those words, <hi>We have toil'd.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That 'tis uncomfortable, as being in the <hi>night,</hi> a sad dolesom time
if Christ be not by to <hi>enlighten</hi> it.</item>
                  <item>3. That 'tis vain and unprofitable, we <hi>get nothing</hi> by it all if he be not

                  </item>
                  <item>4. That be it whose it will, how seasonable soever, be we as wise and
politick in it as we can, be we never so industrious in our trades or
Works, so it will be. <hi>We,</hi> we men that well enough know our
Trade, we who have toil'd, and omitted no pains, we who have

to our <hi>Master. Master, we have toil'd,</hi> &amp;c. Complain we may, yet not
be discouraged for all that, or lay down our Work, for in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

            <p>I begin with St. <hi>Peters</hi> ill success, and that's no comfortable begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but 'tis the beginning of the <hi>Text,</hi> and I love order every where,
though it cost never sodear to keep that.</p>
            <p>Well then, We have <hi>toiled all the night,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter</hi> for himself and
his Partners, and <hi>have caught nothing.</hi> So say I first for me and my Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
my Partners and Fellows in nature, for all, or most of the Sons
of men, and my Partners and Fellows in Office and Ministry, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ. <hi>We have toil'd,</hi> &amp;c. I am to speak of all our labours, that
all of them, even the best of them, are first but toil and misery.</p>
            <p>For the labours of the Sons of men that have nothing else to sweeten
them but earth, that they are toils you need ask no body but your selves.
Your very pleasures are toils and weariness; tell me, the sweetest and
easiest of your delights and recreations, if they do not quickly weary
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57113:250"/>
you, and grow toilsom to you. Let it be hunting, or hawking, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or walking, let it be any other exercise of the body, let it be your
more <hi>quiet</hi> and sedentary recreations, let it be but talk and discourse you
are weary often before the day runs out, and out of wearisomness change
your seats, and stations, and postures, and discourses too.</p>
            <p>And if your <hi>Pleasures</hi> prove in effect but <hi>toils,</hi> what, think you, do your
labours do? To rise up early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of
carefulness? To break your rests, to wear out your bodies, to consume
your Spirits, is it not a toil somewhat more than labour? Yet thus is all
our labour under the Sun, when Christ is absent from us; for what is
there to sweeten any of our labours when God is gone? Call up the
choicest of those aims you propound as ends to your pains, and rewards
to your labours, and tell us, if you can, whether they be able to take off
the sorrow and trouble from your work, or make amends for them at all.
Riches they are some mens aim, and are not they as troublesome as the
ways you got them by? Do they not afflict as much in the keeping, and
disposing, as they did in the getting? Pleasures are others aims, and I
have told you already what they are, whose very pursuit or enjoyment is
as wearisom as your work. Honours are other mens aims; and what has
honour in it that is not burthensom but a name? Nay, even <hi>that</hi> too, sets
a man upon the rack to behave and demean himself with a kind of nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and scrupulous observance of a respect due to such a title or place,
in which he is as much pain'd sometimes as in little-ease, or a narrow
prison. These ends then not being able to take off the nature of toil
from the means and endeavours by which they are pursued, there can
be nothing said to quit our labours from the true titles of toils and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</p>
            <p>Miseries, indeed, as well as toils, if God be not with them, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him we cannot but be miserable, we, and all we do; we, and all we
have. <hi>Samson</hi> grinding at his Mills is in more ease and happiness than we
without Christ. All our works are like Spiders Webs, good for nothing
but to catch flies, that is, impudent and importunate desires, which are
the daily issues of our ill-spent hours; for our desires and lusts encrease
with our labours, and add to their toil; they suffer us to take no rest
neither day nor night; even upon our beds they trouble us, and make
our downy feathers as hard as rocks and marble; the covetous man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sleep for the importunate buzzings of his desires, nor the ambitious
man for his, nor the luxurious man for his, their eye-lids cannot sleep,
nor can the temples of their head take any rest for the swarms and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
of their inordinate passions.</p>
            <p>The case is somewhat better with him whose labour is for God, but it
is somewhat alike when it finds no success, a meer toiling of the Spirits;
Our studies, and pains, and preachings do but wear out our bodies, and
afflict our souls, when we only go round, as in a circle, without fastning
any where, when we effect nothing with all our pains. Men think the
Ministers have an easie life of it; but if they knew their down-sittings,
and their up-risings, the travel of their pains, even to a sickness, the
labour of their minds even to distraction, the perplexity of Opinions
that molest them, the hard task of reconciling differences that daily lies
sore upon them, the diversity of Judgments that distracts them, the care
of their Pastoral Charge that night and day tortures them, their toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
whole nights, even without a figure, that wear them out, the little
esteem, after all this, of all their pains and persons that dejects their
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:57113:251"/>
spirits; the less success of their endeavours that grieves them to the
souls and heart; if men would but understand the sad toil of these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
thoughts as well as labours, together with those indispositions
of body, that usually grow upon them, and those forc'd retirements, or
debarments from those just pleasures and recreations that men of other
conditions lawfully enough indulge themselves, they would confess free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that our labour too, if we abstract it from the relation it has to God
is but toil and misery.</p>
            <p>And (2.) as uncomfortable too as yours, as any else can be; for what
more uncomfortable then to see so many years of preaching and praying,
reading and studying return back upon us without success? and yet 'tis
common; to have imployed all our time and means, and industry many
years, and to come at last to our Master with this heavy account, <hi>Master
we have fished all night,</hi> all fishing time, and <hi>have caught nothing?</hi> and
yet 'tis usual.</p>
            <p>Yet thus uncomfortable is all our work, when God pleases to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from us. Hence it is that <hi>Moses</hi> draws back so fast, and would
fain avoid Gods embassie. He fore-saw it would prove but an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
piece of work, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 11. &amp; Chap. iv. 10, 13. Hence <hi>Isaiah</hi>
cries out so complainingly, <hi>Who has believed our report?</hi> Isai. liii. 1. Hence
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> grows sad, and out of heart, and bemoans himself, <hi>Ier.</hi> xv. 10.
<hi>Wo is me my mother, that thou hast born me a man of strife, and a man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
to the <hi>whole earth. I have neither lent on usury, nor have men lent to me
on usury;</hi> yet every one of them doth curse me. Heres something indeed to
make our case less comfortable than any others, that do we never so
well, live we never so justly; if, with Christ, we live like other men after
the ordinary fashion, then behold <hi>friends</hi> of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners:</hi> if
somewhat strictly, with St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> in fastings and rigours, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<hi>they have a Devil,</hi> we are Superstitious and Popish, nothing pleases
them; use we people never so fairly, we are always sure to be oppos'd,
to be contradicted, to be evil spoken of, even in those things wherein we
deserve not; and which is sadder yet, to have those which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to our care seduced from us easily, and by troops, and seduced
from God, even by those who care not for their <hi>souls,</hi> but for their <hi>fleece,</hi>
and for the glory of making <hi>Proselytes,</hi> and by that children of Hell (at
least) as much as themselves; all this notwithstanding the painfullest
of our endeavours.</p>
            <p>Thus, of all kind of labours the Ministers, if Gods Word be not by
to comfort them, is in natural reason the most uncomfortable. Yet
(2.) there is no comfort in any, where <hi>he</hi> is not. All mens labours have
something of night and sad darkness with them, where that eternal Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
does not come and clear up the coasts. The wicked man, he toils
and moils, but finds no comfort, the blackness and horror of his own
sins continually afright him. The natural man he works and labours,
but he finds no comfort; none of his works can open him so much as a
window into Heaven, either to be received in, or even to see into it:
without faith it is impossible to see comfort thence. The <hi>Iew</hi> he labours
and sees no comfort of his work, 'tis high night with him; <hi>Moses</hi> veil
is upon his eyes, the shaddows are still upon him, and he sits down in
darkness. The ignorant man he sees no comfort in his endeavours, for
he goes on and toils and moils, and sees not, minds not Heaven at all;
nor is there any labourer in the world, but he that works upon Christs
Word, in his presence, and by his assistance, that meets any comfort in
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:57113:251"/>
any thing he does. The strong man has no comfort in his strength, nor
the rich man in his riches, nor the great man in his honors, (all of them
but a discontented crue) if this Sun of Righteousnes make it not day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. All these mens labours are in the night, the night of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
where there is no light at all, or the night of Nature, where it
is but star-light, or the night of the Law, where it is but Moon-light;
or the night of sin, where all these little lights are dimm'd, and the great
one of grace put out quite. There is no light in any of these to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us, wherein to rejoyce; nay, all the goods of the world, all that we
daily strive and strein, and spend our selves for, cannot afford the
least true comfort or refreshment to an afflicted soul; for get we what
we can, catch what catch we may, we do but toil all night and catch
nothing, if Christ or his grace be absent from us. Our labours also are,
thirdly, <hi>unprofitable,</hi> where the darkness either drives out, or admits not
the bright Sun of Glory; where our toil and labour is in the night.</p>
            <p>3. He that works in any of the aforesaid nights, his labours profit
not, he shall take nothing. To run through them particularly; The <hi>Gentile</hi>
he is the first night-worker, he toils and labours and works indeed, but
can neither find out the knowledg of the truth, nor attain the practice of
true vertue, finds no benefit of all his labour. He walks on, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in
the <hi>vanity of his mind, his understanding being darkned,</hi> Ephe. iv. 17, 18. their
<hi>imaginations vain,</hi> and <hi>their foolish hearts hardned,</hi> Rom. i. 21. They neither
know wherein consists happiness, nor how to come by it. Their wise men
are divided in their opinions about it, and themselves wholly estrang'd
from it; <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle, Ephes.</hi> iv. 18. They
can catch nothing with all their busie Inquisition, but a meer profession
to be wise, and professing, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 22. they <hi>became fools;</hi> a pretty catch
of it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Iew</hi> he labours much to as little purpose, and indeed he labours
in the night too, for his day is none, his time is past, <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion
dead and gone, and nothing now to be gain'd by that. When it was at
the best with them they received not the Promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 39. they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
indeed, but caught little in hand; the full promise, that, was kept
for us, that they <hi>without us should not be made perfect,</hi> ver. 40. their burnt-offerings
and Sacrifices for sin could not truly purifie them one whit, all
were but figures, their whole Religion but one great Type of ours,
their brightest day but night to ours. At the descending of this eternal
Word was all to be perfected, nothing to be obtain'd but from him and
by him, at whose arriving only first appear'd the day, and with him the
only draught worth drawing up.</p>
            <p>3. When any man is involv'd in the night of his own sins, all <hi>his</hi> works
also will prove unprofitable whilst he is so. God will not hear him; his
sins they cannot profit him, (whatever they pretend, how fair soever
they promise him) for what <hi>fruit had you then in those things whereof ye
are now ashamed,</hi> Rom. vi, 23. no fruit, but much shame. Nay, his good
works in that estate, how fair so ere they seem, will do him as little
service; <hi>Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my
body to be burn'd, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 3.
<hi>His prayer shall be turn'd into sin,</hi> Psal. cix. 7. His <hi>fastings shall not be accepted,</hi>
Isai. lviii. 5. His very tears shall be neglected, as <hi>Esau</hi>'s were, <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii.
17. He shall get nothing by all his works, all his labour but grief and
sorrow; for without this heavenly flame of divine Charity (which is put
out by sin) to enlighten that night, even good works themselves will gain
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:57113:252"/>
us nothing; all of them together, will do us no good, but as done in the
faith of his Word, whose Word is in the Text; in the efficacy of his
command, at whose command <hi>Peter</hi> again lets down his net. Without
his Word and presence too to quicken us out of our sins, 'tis but toiling
all night, all our labours nothing else.</p>
            <p>4. No mans labours or endeavours at all can avail any thing as from
themselves; not only as to the gaining of an eternal reward, (to which
they carry no proportion) but not of a temporal happiness neither. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Lord build the house, their labour is but lost that built it,</hi> Psal. cxxvii. 1.
A mans trade cannot help him: <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
waketh but in vain,</hi> ver. 2. A mans vigilance will not keep him. It
is <hi>but lost labour that thou hast to rise up early and go to bed late, and eat
the bread of carefulness;</hi> no care or pains can gain that man any thing,
whom God does not vouchsafe to prosper. <hi>The race is not to the swift, nor
the battel to the strong; neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
nor yet favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them
all;</hi> that is, Gods Providence that by changes of times, and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of accidents and contingencies disposes all, says the Wise man, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
ix. 11. and 'tis the blessing of the Lord that <hi>maketh rich,</hi> says the same
good man, <hi>Prov.</hi> x. 22. 'tis uncomfortable being rich without that
blessing.</p>
            <p>5. But above all, the blessing upon our labours, the Ministers labours
is from God. We may be instant in season and out of season, reprove,
rebuke, exhort, with all long suffering and patience, though we should
speak with the tongue of Men and Angels, words of life and spirit;
though we should every day preach with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even to midnight, and
call out to you to hear and obey, till we were hoarse with speaking, and
can speak no more; yea, though we should speak with that passion, as
if our own souls were melted into it, and were distilling with our words,
and so continue from day to day, till our day were over-clouded in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
night; yet it might be with all this pains we might catch nothing.
'Tis what I need not stand to prove; <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and
all the Prophets are sufficient witnesses some time or other of vast labours
spent in vain. And the times our own eyes have seen, and do yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
are too unhappy an evidence of many mens whole lives and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries
thus spent in vain, where Christ pleases to withdraw himself
either from the Minister, or from the People.</p>
            <p>And indeed, this is the least wonder of all the rest: the gaining of
souls being Gods proper business; and therefore never like to be done
without him. We fish but in the night, as if we knew not what we
did, nor saw how to cast our nets to any advantage without him. At his
Word only, the net is rightly spread; at his Word only the waters
flow and bring in apace; he calls and the fishes come amain, and till he
himself either calls or come, we catch nothing.</p>
            <p>4. Nay, to come to the <hi>fourth</hi> Particular, though we omit no pains,
but even toil and labour what we can, nor slip no time, but even break
our sleep, and take in the nights; nor fail of any opportunity, but take
every hour of the night, ready all the night long, upon the least occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor neglect any policy or art to help us, but make it our whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and business every way to gain our intentions, though we be never
so great, or good, so wise or subtle, so many or so powerful, we shall
gain nothing but labour and sorrow by the hand, unless God be
with us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="497" facs="tcp:57113:252"/>
1. Toil it self, and labour, catches nothing; <hi>We have toiled all night
and caught nothing;</hi> all our labour is but as the running round of a mill,
or the turning of a door upon the hinges, never the further for all its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Consider your ways, says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> you <hi>have sown much and bring
in little; he that earneth wages earns it to put into a bag with holes,
Hagg.</hi> i. 6. he gains somewhat, as he thinks, and lays it up, but when
he looks again for it, it is come to nothing. He that gave his mind to
seek out the nature and profit of every labour under the Sun, returns
home empty, only with this experimental saying in his mouth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> ii.
22. <hi>What has a man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein
he hath laboured under the Sun? for all his days are sorrows, and his travel grief:</hi>
a goodly catch for all his pains.</p>
            <p>2. All the attendance upon times and seasons will effect no more, if you
separate from Gods special benediction, <hi>We have toil'd all night and yet
caught nothing.</hi> Let a man serve seven years for a fortune or preferment,
as <hi>Iacob</hi> did for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and in the morning his fair and long'd for <hi>Rachel,</hi>
will prove but bleer-eyed <hi>Leah</hi> at the best. Whatever it is he gets, 'twill
be but misery to him, or a false happiness. Or let him lie waiting with
the bed-rid man at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> eight and thirty years for the
moving of the waters, he will always be prevented, be never able to get
in, till Christ come to him; yea, let him wait out all his years, and draw
out his days in perpetual expectations and attendances for some happy
Planet, some propitious hour, he will never see it, unless God speak the
word and command it to him. These fishers in the Text had even chose
their time and spent it out to the last minute; the best time to fish, when
the eye of the sporting fish could not see the net that was spread to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
them, nor perceive the hand or shaddow of him who subtilly
laid wait to take them, the time of night; and they pursued their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
till the day came on, <hi>all the night,</hi> says the Text, yet nothing they
could catch, they lost their labour and their hope. Just thus it is, when
men having, as they think, diligently made use of the opportunity, and
expected it out, having never thought of God all the while, find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at last no neerer the end of their desires, then they were at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
Your own eyes see it by many daily experiences that is thus
oft falls out.</p>
            <p>3. Policy comes ever and anon as short of its aims where God is set
aside. Though men be oft so cunning in all the arts of thriving, that
nothing seems to escape their reach; though the net seem full with
fish, their fields stand thick with corn, and their garners full and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
with all manner of store, yet draw up the net when the night is
gone, when the clear day appears to shew all things as they are, and
behold, in all these they have taken nothing; their souls, the best fish,
are lost and gone by their unjust and wicked gains, the true fish is slipt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and there is nothing but the scales and slime, a little glittering
earth, or slimy pleasure left behind. Thus meer policy, I mean, such
as God is not remembred in, proves ever at the last. But it is oft-times
seen, that such policies even deceive them of their own intentions too,
and they fall commonly by what they had determin'd as steps to rise
by. <hi>Laban</hi> thinking to enrich himself by his covetous bargain,
changes <hi>Iacob</hi>'s wages ten times, but still changes for the worst: If <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
says to <hi>Iacob,</hi> the speckled shall be thy wages, then all the Cattel
bare speckled; if he say, the ring-straked shall be thy hire, then all
the Cattel bear ring-straked, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxi. 1. because God was with <hi>Iacob</hi>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:57113:253"/>
and not with <hi>Laban.</hi> These men here, cunning sure enough at their
Trade in which they were bred up, having pickt out their time, and cast
on every side of the Ship, tried all their Art, all their tricks, and sleights,
(for we cannot but think, that being so often disappointed, they used
all their skill) yet for all that <hi>they caught nothing,</hi> for Christ was not
there. <hi>Thy wisdom</hi> and <hi>thy knowledge,</hi> saith the <hi>Prophet, it hath perverted
thee,</hi> Isa. xlvii. 10. And <hi>thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels,</hi> ver.
13. These are of no power if once God leave us. Nay, they serve all to
nothing but to pervert us if Christ be not in them; all our wisdom and
counsels but ignorance and folly without the presence of this eternal
Wisdom, this great Counsellor.</p>
            <p>4. We, be we never so great, never so good, never so many, never
so wise, may toil and trouble our selves, and all for nothing. <hi>All the men
whose hands are mighty have found nothing,</hi> Psal. lxxvi. 5. great men may fail
as well as others. Nay more, <hi>Peter</hi> here and his Partners were good
and honest men, yet success does not always answer such mens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
neither; here they fish, and after Christs Resurrection again,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xxi. 3, 6. They fish all night, but catch nothing till Christ came
to them; there's good men labouring and catching nothing. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
they were together, they joyn hands, and heads, and all their imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet 'tis all to no purpose. <hi>Though hand joyn in hand, the wicked shall
not be unpunish'd,</hi> Psal. xi. 21. And though hand joyn in hand to bring
matters to pass, the issue and event comes from above. A multitude is
nothing against the Lord of Hosts, no, nor without him. There's many
joyn'd together and effecting nothing. And then again, there's <hi>Solomon,</hi> a
wise man, the wisest of the earth, after all his search and labour coming
back with nothing but <hi>Vanity of vanity, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi>
He found it not scientifically only, but experimentally, not only by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
knowledge, but unhappy experience also, too sad a truth. And all
this to inform us in this one truth, that there is neither skill, nor labour,
nor strength, nor policy, nor time, nor opportunity of any prevalence,
not only against the Lord, but without him too.</p>
            <p>We must not, after all these men, think much, nor must you, that
men of our Order should toil and labour day and night and catch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The Text says <hi>We;</hi> 'tis a common misery, that's some comfort,
that 'tis not a personal lot, but a common condition to others with us:
And in this <hi>We</hi> there's a better We than we our selves, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his
Fellows must be reckon'd. 'Tis St. <hi>Peters</hi> the greatest Fishers fortune to
be sometimes disappointed of the end of his labours. It may be so much
the rather his, and such as <hi>he,</hi> Christs skilfullest, greatest fishers, such
as with him, here, fish in the deep, even because they do so, whilst a
company of petty Fishermen, that stand by the shore, and fish in the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
catch fish enough. Will you know the reason?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his followers lay deep, in the depth of heaven, and catch
few fish, because the fish are of the world, and therefore savour not
heavenly baits, care not to leap so high, they are for watry, fading,
transitory pleasures. But others that fish upon the shore, that stir not
from the earth, that stand up and preach nothing but earthly interests
and respects, who fish with flies, vanities, and follies, or earth-worms,
earthly Arguments, or cast into the Shallows of vain fancies and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who make Religions of their own, every day new. These catch
fish enow, because perhaps the silly fish, the frie at least, are most delighted
with such baits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:57113:253"/>
We might have thought it had been these mens faults, that having
fish'd all night they took nothing; but that they were fishermen by their
Trade, expert in the Art, such as were brought up to it, and liv'd by it:
There's therefore something more in it than so. The great Governour
of Sea and Land would not suffer those Inhabitants of the water to come
at that time, as at others, into the Net. 'Tis Gods disposing hand that
thus deceives the Net of its expected prey, and we must be content.
<hi>Noah</hi> was a good man, and <hi>Lot</hi> was a good man, and great men both, yet
<hi>Noah</hi> preaches repentance to the Old World, and <hi>Lot</hi> afterward to the
men of <hi>Sodom</hi> without any success; the one preacht one hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, the other all the time he staid in <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet not one soul gain'd
by all their labour. Many wise men and Prophets have had as sorrowful
success. Miserable is the case the while that the devil thus out-fishes us.
Yet so it is; take we what pains we can, though we were more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
<hi>read</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice than we are, in fastings often, in
watchings oft, in hunger and thirst, in fears and anxities, in cares and
painfulness; watch we our times never so punctually, and fish we never
so studiously in the night, when the passions are at rest, and the deep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the night upon them, no noise or distractions, as we would think,
to hinder the distinct hearing of the Word of Christ; use we never so
much Art and Policy, so much Rhetorick and Argument to perswade,
so that one would think we could not possibly but take; yet even thus
our hopes may be deluded, because nothing comes to Gods Net, but
what he brings.</p>
            <p>We may then first comfort our selves, if we have done our utmost, if
we have discharg'd our duty, that however this unhappiness betide us,
yet we are not alone, nor is it our fault though our misfortune. <hi>Paul</hi> may
plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, yet both be in the same lot with us, if God give
not the encrease. Nay, God himself seems to be in the same case, whilst
he complains, <hi>All the day long have I stretched out my hand to a disobedient and
gain-saying people.</hi> And you all also may chear up your souls in your honest
and painful labours, though peradventure they succeed not; however
that you have done your duty, and rest now only upon the hand of God
to second you and give success; which if it do, you presently grow up
and prosper; if not, Gods over-ruling Providence, and wiser disposing
goodness, well thought upon, will easily teach you to be content.</p>
            <p>And (2.) remember this taking nothing may prove at last more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
than the greatest draught you ever did or could expect. St. <hi>Peter</hi>
and his fellow-fishers by catching nothing caught every thing, because
<hi>him,</hi> who is all in all, who thus call'd them to himself by the occasion of
their ill success. And when the worst of casualties betide us let us think,
that though all our hopes and expectations fail us, all our labours lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
away in utter despair, and we be left confounded with the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of all our pains, yet God can so order it, that out of nothing all
things, all good things may one day after happen to us; and though he
will give us nothing else, yet he will give himself at last, and upon this
not only be comforted, but rejoyce in our miscarriages.</p>
            <p>And (3.) that we may descend to the last particular of St. <hi>Peters</hi> ill
success. Though we may comfort our selves a little in the frustration of
our hopes, that it so pleases God to order them, and must therefore well
be pleased because it is his pleasure, and rejoyce sometimes too that we
are by such means drawn to God ere we are aware: Yet we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to him also, lastly, of the same business, and cry out, with St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:57113:254"/>
Master we have toiled all the night and taken nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis an usual thing to complain of a misery, or miscarriage, and 'tis
as usual to complain to those whom it either does not concern to know it,
or who cannot help us. But this complaint here is set right, to Christ it is,
and he's our Master to whom we are to account for the works of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for the works both of day and night.</p>
            <p>And therefore to thee, first, Master, we complain that we are no better
servants, that we are not worthy to call thee Master, that we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
servants.</p>
            <p>Next we complain that we have wearied our selves in the ways of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
in the works of darkness, and have lov'd the night too well, and
the works of darness more than light.</p>
            <p>Then we complain that all our labours are but toils and sorrows.</p>
            <p>Then again we bemoan our sad condition, that <hi>we,</hi> even the best of us,
that <hi>we,</hi> even all of us, can say no better for our selves.</p>
            <p>Yet lastly we complain again, that notwithstanding all our toil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
notwithstanding thou art our Master, and we thy servants, for all
our hours and pains spent upon our work we have caught nothing. Were
it never so little gain, it would not grieve us; were it but a few little
Fishes (they might serve for thousands) yea, but one, something, any
thing, it would not so afflict us: But this [nothing] is of hard digesture,
this [nothing] in every thing troubles us, every way perplexes us. So
much the more in that it comes often from our own fault, or we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fear it, that we thus miscarry. However, tis a thing we may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, as by such complaints even desiring him to give us better success
in the rest of our labours.</p>
            <p>But whether he will do that or no, if he command us to go on, we
must do so still; all other businesses notwithstanding, whatever success
past or to come, <hi>nevertheless,</hi> at his word we must let down the Net;
which is our <hi>Second general</hi> to resolve notwithstanding all former lost pains
and labours to fall yet, upon his word, to our work again.</p>
            <p>The Net in <hi>moral</hi> businesses, is all those several ways and means by
by which our actions catch their several ends and take effect; and to let
down these nets is to apply our selves to the pursuits of our desires and
and intentions by ways and means probable to effect them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>spiritual</hi> employments: The Net to fish for men is commonly the
Word truly preached; the threds are the words of perswasion, the knots
the Arguments of Reason, the Plummets are the Articles and grounds
of the Faith. This Net is to be wove by study and pains, to be let down
and loosed by Preaching, to be gathered up by calling men to account of
what was heard, what they have done upon it; 'tis washt and cleans'd
by our tears and prayers, and spread and dried by our charity and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
affections. And this is the Net that we must let down, though we
catch nothing. And at his word it is to be let down, his word to be
the length and bredth, the whole rule and measure of all <hi>our</hi> Sermons,
all <hi>your</hi> Actions. Leave off our work we must not, because it does not
answer us with success, but to our work again, and see where we err'd,
and mend it, find what was the occasion of our ill success, our taking
nought, and avoid it. If we prided our selves too much in our own skill
or wisdom, or trusted too much upon the goodness of our own works and
labours, or, through the darkness of ignorance could not well see what
to do, or through the thick night of sins miscarried in it, or for want of
Gods implor'd assistance miss'd of our success, let us now mend all, by
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:57113:254"/>
ruling our selves, and all our actions, according to his Word. His Word
will teach us that Art which shall not fail us; his Word shall give us
humility to cast deep enough; his Word will be a Lantern to enlighten
our night, that we may see our way, and what to do; his Word will
bring us near himself, that we may the better hear his counsel, and obey
his voice, and bring him nearer us that he may bless us. And so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he will, if, with St. <hi>Peter</hi> here, whatever has befell us, or is like to
do, we <hi>nevertheless</hi> at his Word again let down the Net, (1.) readily,
without delaying; (2.) obediently, without murmuring; (3.) confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
without disputing; (4.) resolutely, without wavering.</p>
            <p>And indeed, at his Word to do it, is to do it (1.) <hi>readily</hi> for a word
speaking, not to expect command upon command, with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> even
to be griev'd to be bidden again and again, to have our love or duty
call'd so much in question as to hear a second or third injunction to it.
Our former hard hap must not make us to demur, but rather hasten us to
our work again to make amends for our former losses. <hi>Abraham</hi> leaves
his Country, and his Fathers house for a word speaking: God did but
speak, and away presently goes the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Gen.</hi> xii. 1, 5.
<hi>What ever thy hand findeth to do, do it instantly,</hi> says the <hi>Wiseman,</hi> Eccle. ix. 10.
but if God speak to thee once to do it, let the Word be no sooner heard
than thy hand in action. Do what thou art to do readily, do it chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
That <hi>First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. At his word to do it, is to do it <hi>obediently;</hi> to do it for his Word, for
<hi>his</hi> speaking, because he commands it, <hi>at thy word.</hi> Actions are then
only done in obedience when they are done for <hi>his</hi> sake who commands,
and because he commands them. He that here pleads his own respects,
that preaches for his own ends, or does any thing only to satisfie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself, that frames his actions for gain or pleasure, he aims at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but himself, and does not those labours at Christs word, or in the
power of it. He does it properly at Christs word, that looks for no
other reason of his actions but his Command and Will; nor propounds
any other intention to himself but a full submission to Gods will and
pleasure, that's reason enough to the truly obedient soul, that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it.</p>
            <p>3. And upon this it is that we expound, <hi>Nevertheless</hi> at thy Word, to
be in confidence of the truth and vertue of that Word above all words
besides, above all reason besides. St. <hi>Peter</hi> with his Company had
fish'd and toil'd in fishing all the night, the fittest time to fill their Nets,
and yet nothing would be caught. It was against all reason and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to expect any thing now, they themselves, too, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
with their toil; yet he disputes not with his Lord: but, as if he
confest he could teach him better, he (1.) calls him <hi>Master;</hi> and (2.) as
if his Word were of more power than all their skill and experience far,
he rests himself wholly upon that. And yet more; as if the very loosing
or letting down now of the Net upon his bare word alone were enough
to bring up a full draught of fish, he makes mention no longer of his
own pains or labours, as if they could any thing avail, but professes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>let down the Net,</hi> confident now by the power of his Word only to
obtain what neither his Art nor labour could procure before, nor reason
perswade him to at any time, nay, what <hi>all they</hi> perswade him now
against. This is the right rule of faith and obedience, even against hope
to believe in hope, to believe his Word above our Reason, to neglect all
petty, under-scruples, to rely wholly upon his authority. It was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
               <pb n="502" facs="tcp:57113:255"/>
glory that he considered not his own body now dead, nor the
deadness of <hi>Sarahs</hi> Womb, considered not the strength of nature when
Gods Promise came above it, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. 19. that he was so ready to offer
up <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whom God had promised him to call his Seed; as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
God could raise him up again being dead, or else some way or
other make good his Promise, which was made in <hi>Isaac,</hi> and that he
would do it to though <hi>Isaac</hi> were made a Sacrifice, and so no natural or
reasonable possibility left him for any such hope: Yet nevertheless do
he would as God commanded, offer up <hi>Isaac</hi> at his word as readily here as
St. <hi>Peter let</hi> down his Net.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> lastly, <hi>at thy Word we will;</hi> whether, that is, he please
to bless us according to our wish or not, whether we shall bring up fish
or no, whether he will have us take or not, we will let down the Net
because he bids us. To the former confidence is to be added resolution.
As we know and are confident he can by his Word do what he will,
so whether he will do it, yea, or no, yet for his Word, because it is his
will that we should still continue on our labours and work, we will do so,
we will let down the Net, come what will come of it. Whether they will
hear, or whether they will forbear, Preach we must; for <hi>Woe is me,</hi> says
the <hi>Apostle, if I preach not the Gospel;</hi> the command is hard upon us. And
whether your works be like to prosper in your hands as you desire, or
whether not, labour still you must, and not be idle. To toil all night
and catch nothing is uncomfortable, yet to toil all night and catch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and yet to toil again, is constancy and resolution, and may
challenge the reward of no petty vertue at his hands who so esteems
and accepts it. You shew as much daily in temporal affairs: Ye work,
and toil, and lose your labour, yet you try again; you plow and sow,
and sometimes bring home little, yet you plow and sow again. Be we
but as resolute in our spiritual affairs, and work, and they will succeed
at last to pupose, to make a recompence for all former misfortunes. If
your Prayers after a whole night return empty, if your endeavours to
repentance and amendment, if your wrestling with temptations, or
strugling for mastery with your passions and sins, be not presently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with success, but you yet groan under the dominion of them,
not yet fully able to resist temptations, nor to leave off your sins, or
break off your transgressions, if you cannot by some nights and days
of exercise and endeavour obtain yet those graces and vertues you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
endeavour yet again, strive, and pray, and labour yet again, and
in his name and word pursue your work. In his name you cannot
miscarry at the last, your Net will come at length full fraught with grace
and glory.</p>
            <p>You see the very Apostles of Christ are in the like condition, many
nights and days toil and labour brings them nothing home, yet they
still fish again, and so must we, if at last we may gain but one poor soul
into the Net of the Kingdom; nay though but save our own. And if none
but that, yet we most let down the Net for more, not despair of more;
there may come more at length: We must preach, and you must hear,
again and again, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, and there
a little, cast on this side, cast on that, in season and out, night and day
with all patience and long suffering, as the Apostle speaks, if so be at
last that Jesus will deign to come unto us, that he will vouchsafe to
speak effectually to his servants, and make them hear, that he will please
to stand by and call the fish into the Net.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:57113:255"/>
Master, we have now at thy word let down the Net, O speak the
word only and thy Servants shall hear thee, and hasten to thee, and
obey thee, and be wholly taken by thee. Our labours are vain
without thy blessing, nothing in them but weariness and toil, have
mercy upon this our sad and uncomfortable condition, and relieve
us, both the Fishers and the Fish, and lift us up out of this Sea of
misery, this depth of iniquity, catch us <hi>all</hi> together in thy Net, and
us unto thy self into thy Kingdom where there is no more toil or

               <q>And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three

not knowing what he said.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he thus said he knew not
what, was in the <hi>Mount</hi> with <hi>Iesus, Moses</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
and saw their glory. One cannot blame him for
crying out, 'twas good being, good building there;
though somewhat there was in it that was amiss,
it seems, when St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, he knew not what
he said. But methinks, the words would sound no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
amiss at all, if they had been taken up by us
upon our late being with <hi>Christ</hi> in the holy Mount
at the holy Table, or if used still in reference to that good meeting,
<hi>Master it is good for us to be here</hi> in thy holy presence, let us build <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi>
tarry here, go down no more henceforward in our affections to
earth, or earthly things; Let us build here <hi>Tabernacles</hi> for <hi>thee,</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> that neither thy <hi>Gospel, Law,</hi> nor <hi>Prophets</hi> may go from us, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
henceforth depart out of our hearts and mouths. Sure there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in such a speech of ours, whatever was in St, <hi>Peter</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Indeed somewhat there was faulty in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, as there is commonly
in the most of our best words and actions, <hi>somewhat more or less</hi> (at least)
then should be in rigor, if God should enter into judgment with them.
The sudden apprehension of unexpected or extraordinary joy or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
be it spiritual or be it temporal, makes many affections and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
arise in the best of us somewhat irregular sometimes. Our business
at this time, and upon these words is to rectifie them, by considering
what was here short or over in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, what to be left, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in them, that we may learn how to bear our happiness, the great
favours of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> the extraordinary dignations and discoveries
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:57113:256"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and besides also, all temporal felicities; how to proportion them
to others benefit as well as our own, how so to regulate our judgments,
counsels, expressions and affections, upon any such occasions, come they
when they will upon us, that we may safely say with St. <hi>Peter</hi> here in
any of them, <hi>Master, it is good for us to be here, let us</hi> now build <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>
this condition is good we now are in, let us still be here, and yet not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
St. <hi>Luke's</hi> censure, that we know not what we say.</p>
            <p>The Sum then both of the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Sermon</hi> will be but this; St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
and our common judgments, advice, affections and expressions in any
kind of extraordinary content and happiness, spiritual or temporal,
what they are; usually they are we know not what; and are therefore
so branded here, by the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> that we may henceforth consider and
know what judgments, counsels, affections and expressions pass from us
in any such conditions, before we pass them. So that our work is to be
this, to examine all these in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s speech, and shew you how far it
may be said by any of us, and how it must not, and that in these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How far his judgment may pass, that <hi>good it is to be here,</hi> how
we may say, <hi>It is good for us to be here,</hi> think and say so, and how we
may not.</item>
               <item>2. How far his advice is good to build Tabernacles, how we may say,
<hi>Let us build three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Mose, and one for
Elias,</hi> and how far it is not good to say so, wherein we may not
say so.</item>
               <item>3. How far his affections to his own, or his <hi>Masters</hi> ease and safety
and present glory may be allow'd; how we are to rellish <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Elias</hi> their departing, or desire their staying, and how we may not;
as they departed, <hi>Peter</hi> said unto <hi>Iesus;</hi> as if he would needs be
staying them, that he might stay where now he was.</item>
               <item>4. How far expressions sudden and unwary, such as for hast or passion
and amazement, slip sometimes from us, as this did here from St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
may be born with, how far we may be tolerated to say sometimes
we know not what, and when we may not be allowed it, <hi>Not &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>By this limiting and dividing the particulars of the speech and <hi>Text,</hi>
and giving the several ways and senses it may be spoken in; we shall
neither wrong St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor St. <hi>Luke;</hi> but give both their due, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
saying, and St. <hi>Luke's</hi> censure: his saying, <hi>Master it is good for us to be
here, Let us build,</hi> &amp;c. and that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s speech was not altogether to be
disapproved; and that yet notwithstanding some fault there was in it,
and that therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s censure just, and St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s saying upon it,
that <hi>he knew not what he said.</hi> Say with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and say with St. <hi>Luke</hi>
both, and yet say well with both, when we know what they both said,
and in what sense to say it. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s authority will not in this point
bear us out against St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s; but if we say it as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, with all
the circumstances, St. <hi>Luke</hi> will say of us what he said of him, that we
know not what we say. But if we say the words as they may be said,
he will not say so. Begin we then to sift the saying, and the first part
first; <hi>Master, It is good for us to be here.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s judgment of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was in, and how we may judge and say so.</p>
            <p>And it may be good to be so, and good to say so: good really in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
senses; a right judgment, and a right saying.</p>
            <p>For first, This <hi>here</hi> was in the <hi>Mount,</hi> a place of solitude and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a part by themselves, says St. <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 2. And 'tis good some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57113:257"/>
times to retire our selves from the World and worldly business, to think
and meditate upon Heaven, and heavenly things, especially having late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tasted of those dainties, that we may chew and rellish them; nothing
so good and convenient <hi>then</hi> presently as some retirement, to sit down a
little and bethink our selves of the sweetness we have so lately tasted,
the Covenant we have so lately renewed, the resolutions we have so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken up, and the ways to perform them.</p>
            <p>2. It was <hi>a high Mountain</hi> too, says St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> xvii. 1. Nothing hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
should serve our turn but high thoughts and resolutions; we must do
nothing mean after so high favours and dignations; fix our thoughts, set
our <hi>affections</hi> now henceforward <hi>upon things above,</hi> good to be here.</p>
            <p>3. It was the <hi>Holy Mountain too,</hi> so styled ever since from the authority
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epist. i. 18. And 'tis good to be holy, better then to be
high. High contemplations of God and Heaven are not so good as holy
conversations. 'Tis good indeed, very good to be also in the <hi>holy Mount,</hi>
in holy places, at holy work, where <hi>Christ</hi> is to be seen or heard in beauty
and glory, in the Church, at his Word and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>4. For <hi>into a Mountain to pray,</hi> says our <hi>Evangelist, ver.</hi> 28. So, <hi>To be
here,</hi> is, to be here praying; <hi>Christ</hi> went up to that purpose, as he tells
us there, often went up to that purpose, as we find it, so it must needs be
good; nothing does us so much good at heart as praying. It fills it with
joy and gladness, fills our mouths with good things, fills our hands and
our barns, and our coffers, all our filling comes from thus opening of
our mouths. Be we in sickness, or be we in health; be we in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or be we in adversity; be we full, or be we empty, nothing does
us so much good in any of those conditions as our prayers. Prayer, Why?
in sickness it cheers us, in health it strengthens us, in prosperity it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
us, in adversity it comforts us, in our fulness it keeps us from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
in emptiness from fainting, in all it does us some good or other.
'Tis good indeed to be here, that is, to be praying, especially to give our
selves to it, to go aside on purpose for it, to ascend the Mountain in it, to
go to it with raised thoughts, and elevated attentions; take <hi>good</hi> how you
will, for <hi>honest, profitable,</hi> or <hi>pleasant,</hi> Prayer is all of them. To be with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
in the Mount, entitles us to be called with him for it, The friends of
God, and there's <hi>honestum, honest</hi> even in the honourable sense. To be with
<hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount is profitable against <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lek,</hi> to beat down our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
To be here with St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Mount, gives us the most pleasant
prospect that mortal eyes ever beheld or saw, gives us a prospect of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
glory. <hi>Bonum est esse hic,</hi> 'tis every way good thus being here.</p>
            <p>5. To be here is to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Eliah,</hi> with the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> in our hands, reading and comparing them, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as well as praying. And 'tis good being so, good spending our time
in such employments; <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think</hi> (and ye
think right too,) <hi>to have eternal life, St.</hi> John v. 39. <hi>profitable they are,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (and that is good) <hi>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
in righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. thorowly good, that serves
to make a man so thorowly good: good to be thus in the Mountain here,
upon the tops of our houses, in our close<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and highest rooms, where we
have most leisure, less avocations, that we may the better attend so
holy a work, especially since our late holy work, good to keep the scent
and relish of those heavenly dainties in our souls.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>To be here,</hi> is to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57113:257"/>
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to be in good company. Nothing better to make or
keep us good. <hi>O how good,</hi> yea, <hi>and joyful or pleasant a thing</hi> it is to be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such! Nothing drives away sad and heavy thoughts like such
good company, where the discourse is Heaven, where the entertainment is
heavenly, where we eat and drink with <hi>Christ,</hi> where there is nothing
but sweetness and meekness, and goodness to be learnt; where there
is nothing harsh or horrid, or unseemly; where the news we talk of is
what is done in Heaven, where our meat and drink is <hi>to do the will of our
Father which is in Heaven,</hi> where our talk is not the vain talk of the new
fashions of men and women of the World, but the fashions of <hi>Angels</hi> and
<hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of all ages; where we talk not of other mens lives,
but mend our own; where our musick is the praises of our God, and
our whole business Salvation; where we shall hear no idle words, see no
unseemly gestures, meet no distempers or distasts, but those things only
which become law and order, <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> or Scholars and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of so good a <hi>Master; Good it is to be here,</hi> to be with such.</p>
            <p>7. But above all, 'Tis good being with <hi>Christ,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> would fain be
dissolv'd and gone to be with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 23. would die when you would, to
be with him. Far better, says he, it is; far better then to be any where, or
with any body else. Nothing comparable to it. Be it in life or death. Be it
upon the <hi>Mount</hi> with him, (1.) In a place of safety. Tis, no doubt, good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there with him. Or, Be it with him (2.) talking with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Passion, about <hi>his decease, that he should accomplish at Ierusalem,</hi> as
St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates him, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. in the saddest discourse of his sufferings, or
the saddest sufferings themselves: 'Tis good being with him still. Or, Be
it with him (3.) <hi>in shining and glistering garments</hi> in a condition of glory;
either when his face shines, the heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly light of his countenance shines
out upon us, when eternal Glory encompasses him and us; or (4.) when
only <hi>the fashion of his countenance is</hi> only <hi>altered</hi> towards us, when spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
contentments flow upon us; or (5.) when <hi>his rayments</hi> only <hi>are white
and glister,</hi> when outward blessings glister about us, 'Tis at every turn
good being with him. Yet more particularly.</p>
            <p>'Tis good for us to be with <hi>Christ</hi> in safety and security, if we may so
as St. <hi>Peter</hi> thought he now was here, that we may serve the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distraction. Good to <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> ii. 2.</p>
            <p>'Tis good (2.) again for us to be with him also in his Passion; to suffer
with him; good to be with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ever and anon, thinking
and speaking of the Death and Passion of our <hi>Master,</hi> all his bitter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
affronts, reproaches, whips and scourges, sweats and faintings,
nails and thorns, and spear and scoffs, and tears and sighs, and exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and giving up the ghost; good to be made partakers too of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
with him, to <hi>fill up what is behind of the afflictions of Christ in our
flesh,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 24. <hi>It is good for me</hi> says Holy <hi>David, that
I have been in trouble,</hi> Psal. cxix. 71. good above what <hi>David</hi> thought, to
be with <hi>Christ</hi> in trouble, to be troubled for him, to suffer persecution
for his Name. Blessed are they that do so, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 10. and that's
good, to be blessed; and they that are not yet arriv'd to that, to suffer and
be troubled for him, 'tis good they in the mean time be troubled with him,
troubled that he should be so troubled and afflicted for them, 'Tis good
to be with <hi>Christ</hi> in either of these conditions.</p>
            <p>'Tis good (3.) to be with him in his glory, that to be sure needs
no proving, the only good, the only true and perfect happiness to
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:57113:258"/>
see his face in glory; all good is concentred here, no good beyond it.</p>
            <p>And yet (4.) 'Tis good too, to be with him so as to enjoy some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings
of that eternal light in the mean time whilst we are here, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the happiness of his gracious Presence in our souls, to have him
shine comfortably into our hearts, <hi>this is eternal life,</hi> one ray of it, <hi>to know
Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent,</hi> St. John xvii. 3. to be sensible of those
inexpressible comforts which he oftentimes vouchsafes to give us; to be
partakers of those sensible delights of piety which he sometimes allows
us. 'Tis good, the sweetest good this life can yield us, to feel the sense and
sweetness of his presence, and walk in it; good to be in grace, and good
sometimes to see the glory of this grace, to feel the joy and comfort
of it; so <hi>good to be here,</hi> that it is not good to be any where else, if we may
be so.</p>
            <p>Nay, and (5.) <hi>'Tis good</hi> sometimes to have our Rayments white and
glistering with him, to enjoy outward satisfaction and prosperities
from him. They are not always the portion of the wicked. They are
often happy instruments of grace and glory; and when they are so,
tis good to have them. <hi>'Tis good</hi> so also <hi>to be here,</hi> to be under some
of the fringes of these shining garments, when God pleases that we
shall.</p>
            <p>But last of all, <hi>'Tis good to be here,</hi> be that here where it will, so it be
where God would have us. <hi>'Tis good to be here,</hi> because God would have
us here. So this <hi>here</hi> is any where with God and Christ; good for <hi>David</hi>
to be in trouble; good for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be under the thorn and buffeted;
good for <hi>Manasses</hi> to be in fetters; good for some to be in clouds and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
as good as for others to be in safety and ease, plenty and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
continual light or gladness. But above all in all these, <hi>It is good to
hold me fast by God,</hi> says <hi>David,</hi> to cling close to <hi>Christ, good so to be here,</hi> to
be, to hold so here, and every where, in all conditions, not to stir from
him, to keep always by him, in his ways, under his protection. And yet
as good as it is, and as we may say it is, we had best know what we say.
For we must know sometimes for all this, It is not good to be here, nor
good to say so. <hi>Not knowing what he said,</hi> says St. <hi>Luke</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi> for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus. Let's therefore now know why he said so; when it is we say
amiss, when we say, with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> even upon the Mount, in <hi>Christs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and the presence of his glory too, that <hi>it is good to be here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We know not what we say when we say, <hi>'Tis good to be here,</hi> that
is, in the <hi>Mount</hi> only and and no more, in honour and high places. They
may prove the worst places we can be in. <hi>Summos feriunt fulmina montes,</hi>
when the lightnings are flashing, and the thunders roaring, they are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
the storm and danger than the low valleys.</p>
            <p>2. Nay, even the <hi>Mountain of righteousness,</hi> high speculations are not
always good to be in, we must be sometimes in the plains of action as
well as in the Mount of contemplation. Nay, and even our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
proves too often an offence; when 'tis at the height, we are in
continual fear of falling, fear of being proud of our graces and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
as good as 'tis to be highly righteous 'tis not always safe; 'tis good
at least to come down a little out of the Mountain to humble our selves a
little to the practice of ordinary and common vertue now and then, lest
we grow proud of some extraordinary performances.</p>
            <p>3. And more than so. 'Tis not good always, in all senses, that <hi>Christ</hi> be
with us, or that we know it. <hi>It is expedient for you,</hi> says he himself, <hi>that I
go away,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> xvi. 7. and expedient is always good, and both it is
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:57113:258"/>
that he should sometimes withdraw his Presence, the heavenly gusts and
ravishments, lest we should grow proud, and slack, and negligent. 'Tis
not good always to be here in perpetual and uninterrupted sensible hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
comforts. 'Tis good that <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> all should
draw sometimes behind the cloud, good the sweetness of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
and <hi>Gospel</hi> too, should be curtain'd up from us for a while, that we
might see our wants, encrease our longings, advance our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and grow more earnest to seek, more careful to pursue after
them.</p>
            <p>4. But 'tis not always good to be in continually bright shining gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the region of joy and glory, in daily and hourly happiness. It
will make us forget <hi>Christ</hi> when we are just by him, and not know what
we say though the eternal Word stand by us, scarce know how to look or
speak. Such things too often do so.</p>
            <p>5. But especially it is not good, because it is not fitting whilst others
are all in sadness, others all in the Vale of tears, for us to be then in the
Mount of joy, all afloat in mirth and pleasure. Fit it is, and therefore
good, to have some fellow-feeling of <hi>Iosephs</hi> Irons, of others miseries,
infirmities, and calamities, not good to be here without such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis not good however to <hi>cry</hi> out <hi>Bonum est,</hi> though we be in such a
condition, either of goodness or greatness, grace or happiness, above
our fellows, 'tis not good to hug and please our selves in either of them,
but especially not in temporal successes; no good crying it up, or our selves
for it.</p>
            <p>7. Not good, to be sure, to cry it up as the <hi>only good,</hi> to be in any
worldly glory, or security. The <hi>Transfiguration</hi> will not always last. Christs
face will not always shine like the Sun upon us, nor his garments glister
beyond what any Fuller of the earth can give them; he himself will
back again ere long to lower ground, and have less splendid clothing.
Yet should this continue, it were not yet the only good, that we
should cry out nothing but <hi>Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m est esse hic;</hi> this very being <hi>here</hi>
is enough to allay the goodness, to tell you 'tis not all, nor will be so for
ever.</p>
            <p>'Tis good (1.) neither to be in honour, nor prosperity, nor alone,
(2.) nor with others; neither in high contemplations, (3.) nor sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
consolations, neither in high mountains, (4.) nor high company,
swallowed up in any of them, or so taken with any of them, to conceit
any one of them is the only good, nothing good but that, no good being
but being there. To say so of any of these, is meerly to say we know not
what; an ignorant judgment and sentence upon it.</p>
            <p>II. And secondly to advise to make <hi>Tabernacles</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> here is to advise we know not what. Yet to give the great <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
but his due, see we first in our propounded method how we may be
allowed to say it or go about it.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis no ill advice to take or give, to raise us such <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> as
our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, are to be rais'd with the <hi>unrighteous Mammon,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>
xvi. 10. <hi>Habitations</hi> or <hi>Tabernacles</hi> (for the word is the same, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> both
here and there) that will not fail us when all others do; 'tis good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
everlasting habitations, eternal <hi>Tabernacles</hi> vvith temporal goods,
vvith good vvorks and Alms deeds, rearing <hi>Tabernacles</hi> by building <hi>Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi>
or endowing them.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis no ill counsel neither to make <hi>Tabernacles here,</hi> so they be but
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:57113:259"/>
               <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> so we place not our minds and dwellings here, if we make
them but <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> not houses, <hi>Tabernacles</hi> to lodge in for a night, or
stay in for a shift by the way, have our <hi>abiding City</hi> some where else, have
that above, look for that to come, if we only build us Inns or shelters as
for strangers, make all our buildings, all our contrivements only to help
and shelter us in our way. Then 'tis good.</p>
            <p>Especially (3.) if we make them <hi>here,</hi> that is, upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> not
in the low and dirty Valleys; If in the mids of all our projects, building
and making fortunes, fortresses, and securities, we place them not in
humane confidences, in worldly strength and riches, in that thick muddy
soil, if our refuges be in the <hi>Mount,</hi> as near heaven as we can come, upon
<hi>Christ,</hi> according to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> as the <hi>Law</hi> allows us, and the true
<hi>Prophets</hi> teach us, we may make <hi>Tabernacles</hi> here, and do well in doing
it.</p>
            <p>If (4.) we build them here, here where there is such good company to
live with, <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> good Rulers, and good Priests and
Prophets, good Government, and true Religion, upon such grounds we
may have leave to fix our habitations, and desire to stay and dwell among
them. So we pitch not our <hi>Tabernacles</hi> among <hi>the Tents of Kedar,</hi> nor
chuse to dwell in <hi>Mesech,</hi> if we can keep out of the streets of <hi>Gath</hi> and
<hi>Askelon,</hi> our stay a while upon earth may be desirable.</p>
            <p>And (5.) <hi>three Tabernacles</hi> we may make also in particular: One for
<hi>Christ,</hi> make all the provision we can for <hi>Christ</hi> to stay with us, use all the
ways and means we can imagine to keep him among us, his Presence, his
grace, his <hi>Gospel,</hi> his Sacraments, his Administrations, his Ministers, his
Religion, his Worship still among us; Good advice it is, and a good
thing it is to build <hi>Tabernacles</hi> and Houses, <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> that
<hi>Christ</hi> and his may tarry with us.</p>
            <p>Nay, and (6.) <hi>one for Moses</hi> too; some room we must make for Works
as well as Faith; the obedience of Faith is the only faith of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
to live according to Gods Precepts and Commandments; this part of
<hi>Moses</hi> Law, <hi>Christ came not to destroy,</hi> or dissolve, <hi>but to fulfil</hi> himself, and to
give a new command and grace to us also to fulfil it.</p>
            <p>So lastly, one for <hi>Elias</hi> too. The <hi>Prophets</hi> must not be shut out of doors,
a <hi>Chamber,</hi> a <hi>bed,</hi> and a <hi>Candlestick</hi> for them as the noble woman of <hi>Shunem</hi>
provided for <hi>Elisha, 2 Kings</hi> iv. 8. <hi>that as they pass by they may enter in and
bless us.</hi> A place for the old <hi>Prophets,</hi> that we may confirm our faith out
of their writings, a place for the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it by their preachings; a place too in all our houses for <hi>Elias</hi> zeal
for Gods Worship and Service, that that may be restored and advanced
in all our families and dwellings, in all our habitations, a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> at
least in our hearts for the zeal for Gods glory to reside in, provided that it
be not so heady that it speak it knows not what.</p>
            <p>Thus 'tis no ill but good counsel to say, <hi>Let us build here three Tabernacles,</hi>
if (1.) they be only prepared for here, but raised in heaven, if (2.) they
be only for Inns and shelters here, and not for mansion houses; if (3.) they
be set upon high ground; if (4.) among good neighbours; if (5.) made
for <hi>Christ</hi> and (6.) <hi>Moses,</hi> and (7.) <hi>Elias,</hi> for to keep <hi>Christ</hi> and his Religion,
Faith, good Works, Zeal and Piety among us. Let us make such <hi>Tabernacles</hi>
as fast and as much as we will or can, we need not fear St. <hi>Lukes</hi> censuring
them for the sacrifices of fools, or the actions of men that know not what
they do.</p>
            <p>Yet now, secondly, there is a making <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and a counselling
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57113:259"/>
to do so that will deserve that censure, several such making <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. When we would make the everlasting <hi>Tabernacles</hi> to be here, when
we raise them no higher than <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> seek heaven upon the earth,
living as if there were no other World, building our hopes and fortunes
here as if we were to continue here for ever, then we know not what we
do.</p>
            <p>2. When we will have nothing here but <hi>Tabernacles</hi> to shelter us, when
we think much to descend out of the <hi>Mount</hi> to suffer with our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
would not willingly part with any point of honour, safety, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for him, would have <hi>Christ</hi> glorified before he is crucified, contrary
to his Fathers Decree upon him and us, that we should both first suffer,
and then enter into glory; when we thus shun the <hi>Cross,</hi> and will have
nothing but the comfort; all for <hi>Mount Taber,</hi> or <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> peace,
and quiet, and glory, and triumph, nothing for <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> any kind
of suffering; all for being clothed upon, not being uncloath'd or disro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
at all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 2. would avoid even death it self which we cannot
avoid; when we can brook no Article of the Faith but the Ascension
into glory, then <hi>you know not what you ask,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> said to the <hi>Sons of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedee</hi>
at another time, you know not what you would have, ye know not
what you say.</p>
            <p>3. When we speak of making <hi>Tabernacles</hi> only for our own interests,
that <hi>we</hi> may be in them, and consider not our brethren, when we will be
engrossing <hi>Christ</hi> only to our selves shut all others out, or pass by them,
or at least never think of them, or care what becomes of them, so we be
safe, we then also speak we know not what. <hi>Christ</hi> came to redeem the
World, and not that little pittance of it in the <hi>Mount, Moses, Elias,</hi>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his two Fellows, not any only pittance in any <hi>Mount,</hi> a
few particular elected mountaineers, and leave all the rest in <hi>Adams</hi> dirty
mass. <hi>He</hi> was to be an universal <hi>Saviour,</hi> and pay a general ransom, to
preach not only in the <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but in the <hi>Cabul,</hi> the dirty
Vale of <hi>Galilee,</hi> to be <hi>the God of the Valleys</hi> as well as <hi>of the hills,</hi> of those
that sate <hi>in the vale of the shadow of death, Gentiles</hi> and sinners as well as
those that dwelt <hi>in the hill Countries,</hi> in the Land of light, the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
other righteous. St. <hi>Peter</hi> knew not what he said, nor know they that
say thus after him, that would be keeping him always in the <hi>Mount,</hi> make
<hi>Tabernacles,</hi> bars and fences to keep him from doing his Office to all the
World besides, To talk of such <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> so cooping up <hi>Christ</hi> to our
own Sect and Company, is to talk we know not what.</p>
            <p>4. When we speak of making <hi>Tabernacles</hi> to retire our selves from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our own Office too, from performing those duties we owe our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
which God has designed us to, and requires of us, we talk not
wisely. <hi>Quid dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:57113:260"/>
they do, we say and do we know not what, to pitch upon any <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>
Solitudes or Retreats.</p>
            <p>5. If we think of making <hi>Tabernacles</hi> several for <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and
<hi>Elias,</hi> one for <hi>Christ,</hi> one for <hi>Moses,</hi> and another for <hi>Elias,</hi> think of severing
the <hi>Gospel, Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> 'tis we know not what, they all dwell in one
together, all say the same thing, will not be severed. <hi>Vnum est tabernacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Evangelii in quo lex &amp; Prophetae recapitulanda sunt,</hi> says St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> There
is but one Tabernacle for all those, all agree in one together, all preach
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, though each in his proper way
and fashion.</p>
            <p>6. No talking of <hi>three Tabernacles</hi> at any hand. There is but <hi>one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi>
and <hi>one Shepherd. The Sheep that were led by the hands of</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
The Sheep that were seen in a Vision by <hi>Micaiah scattered upon the
Mountains;</hi> The Sheep which the Prophets led, or fed, in any of their
times, as Pastors sent by God; The Sheep and Lambs that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
all the Pastors of the <hi>Church</hi> are to feed from time to time, are all to make
up but <hi>one fold under one Shepherd,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> x. 16. all to come into one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> to be gathered all into one <hi>Mountain,</hi> into the same ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<hi>Tabernacles</hi> at the last. No <hi>Tabernacle</hi> against <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> no <hi>Altar</hi>
against <hi>Altar,</hi> no <hi>Church</hi> against <hi>Church,</hi> no schism to be made in the <hi>Mount
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. To place the beatifical Vision in <hi>Christs</hi> corporal presence, or think
that the blessed want <hi>Tabernacles</hi> and Tents to dwell in with St. <hi>Peter;</hi> or
which is the same in fine, to place <hi>Christs Kingdom</hi> upon earth, and dream
of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> happiness, <hi>Christs reigning with his Saints</hi> in all temporal
pleasures and satisfactions upon the earth for a <hi>thousand years,</hi> is meer
talking in our dreams. Let us make no such <hi>Tabernacles</hi> in our brains, they
are meer Castles in the Air, rais'd in the <hi>Mount</hi> of our own fancies and
vain imaginations; if we say <hi>so,</hi> we know not what we say.</p>
            <p>No building our thoughts then upon worldly confidences, (2.) no
making <hi>Tabernacles</hi> to shelter us from all storms, even from suffering for
our <hi>Master,</hi> (3.) no building them only for our selves, (4.) No raising
them to keep us from our Christan duty. (5.) No making them to separate
between <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> (6.) No making them to divide the Sheepfold to
set up Schism in the <hi>Church of Christ;</hi> (7.) No making them to anticipate
heavenly happiness, to keep <hi>Christ</hi> upon the Mountains of the Earth, as
if our business were wholly here, or wholly for our selves, or our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
carnal and earthly still. Let us make no such <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> preach
no such fancies, believe no such imaginations, for if we do, St. <hi>Luke</hi>
will tell us were we as good as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we say and believe, and advise
we know not what.</p>
            <p>IV. Now that we may know whence it is that the same words have
thus different senses, why they may be spoken well or ill, we are in the
next place to examine the diverse affections with which they may or
might be spoken. Either out of fear or out of joy; out of fear for his
<hi>Master</hi> and himself, of future sufferings, which he heard them talking
of, <hi>v.</hi> 31. and a desire to avoid them, or out of joy in the contemplation
of his present enjoyment, and a desire to continue it.</p>
            <p>Consider the words spoken, as proceeding out of fear of death and
suffering, and a desire to avoid it, to disturb the method of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by a new kind of <hi>Propitius esto tibi,</hi> a subtle new device to perswade
<hi>Christ</hi> to favour himself and his followers, <hi>Non ita fiet tibi,</hi> to turn off
the <hi>Cross,</hi> to keep with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the <hi>Mount;</hi> or at least, if
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:57113:260"/>
he would go down, keep them from departing, keep them however with
him, <hi>Moses</hi> with his wonder-working Rod, <hi>Elias</hi> with his commanding
Fire to defend him: Consider them thus, and he and his fellows may
well be answer'd with <hi>a nescitis cujus spiritus, Ye know not what spirit ye are
are of,</hi> What you are to look for in the service of your <hi>Master, Christ Cross</hi>
the chief lesson they were to learn.</p>
            <p>Consider them, secondly, as words issuing out of excess of delight and
joy, either in the present glory as the <hi>all</hi> he wish'd for, in <hi>Christs</hi> corporal
presence as the <hi>whole</hi> he expected, in temporal felicities as the sum
of his desires, or in sensible consolations as the only pieces of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so also he is but <hi>nesciens quid diceret,</hi> he says he knows not
what.</p>
            <p>But consider them now again (1.) as arising out of a moderate delight
in spiritual or temporal contentments, with St. <hi>Mathew</hi>'s <hi>Si vis,</hi> submitting
all to his will and pleasure, <hi>It is good to be here, Master, if thou wilt, and let us
make Tabernacles here; Master, if thou wilt,</hi> if thou think'st it good, if
thou knowest it fit (for so St. <hi>Matthew</hi> relates St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, and)
then they may pass without reproof, they are the words of knowledge
of <hi>truth and soberness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or (2.) consider them as spoken in the very rapture of joy and high
delight in the contemplation of heavenly glory, of Gods glory and his
<hi>Masters,</hi> and great hopes of his own desiring what he can to promote
and advance it, the words are the expressions of much love and piety,
not the speech of a <hi>mad fellow,</hi> as <hi>Iehu</hi>'s <hi>Captains</hi> styl'd the <hi>Prophet,</hi> he
knows what he says, and what he desires; or, if through the excess of
joy he said he knew not what, more then he could well express, there
was no fault, but that which such heavenly joys necessarily cause in
humane language by their inexpressible greatness, that if we say any
thing, we must needs say more then we are able to express, they are so
great that we know not what to say, and so St. <hi>Mark</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Disciple</hi>
tells the story, <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. <hi>v. 6. For he wist not what to say, for they were sore afraid,</hi>
almost stupified and amazed.</p>
            <p>And if now, lastly, that be the passion too to be added to the other two,
and St. <hi>Matthew</hi> says the same <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 6. There will be at least an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
for any indiscretion in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s speech; though withal a caution to
us for ours, that we speak no more then we understand; that we meddle
not to settle conditions, to pitch places, to erect buildings, to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
or pass our judgments in things we have no knowledge of, lest St. <hi>Luke</hi>
tell us we are to blame, we say we know not what.</p>
            <p>IV. Yet now in the last place, we are to see how far sudden and
hasty expressions may be born with, and when they may not without
rebuke.</p>
            <p>1. If they rise out of any sinful passion, sinful they are, and have no
allowance.</p>
            <p>2. If they rise out of any wilful heedlesness and indiscretion they are
sins of indiscretion, and the words of folly, foolish words.</p>
            <p>3. If they proceed out of natural infirmity and shortness of wit, they
are at the best but to be excus'd; faulty they are, for why do they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on what they do not understand.</p>
            <p>But (4.) if they proceed meerly out of the excess of holy joy, or any passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unblameable, they are no sins, we may well bear with them, seeing we
know not how to better them. There is a kind of spiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drunkenness, when ravisht and over-gone with the sweetness of some
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:57113:261"/>
inward spiritual and heavenly joy, made drunk with the Spouses Flagons
of Wine in the holy <hi>Canticles,</hi> with <hi>the drink of thy pleasures,</hi> says the
<hi>Psalmist, as out of the Rivers,</hi> Psal. xxxvi. 8. over-bore with the strength
of this celestial liquor, we say we know not what, do things beyond the
ordinary course of action, seem mad though we be sober, as the <hi>Prophets</hi>
did sometimes when the Spirit came upon them, lay down naked, use
strange gesture, or speak words, with <hi>Caiphas,</hi> which at the time we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, run like mad-men with some <hi>Martyrs</hi> into flames and fires,
to blocks and halters upon the sudden, powerful, and miraculous motion
of Gods Spirit or Grace within us. These, for all that, not to be looks
for now.</p>
            <p>Yet 'tis ever to be noted here, that how strange soever the expressions
of some holy <hi>Saints</hi> have been in such excesses, though they have not
understood themselves, yet others have; they never spoke <hi>non-sense by
the Spirit,</hi> never blasphemy, never contradictions to holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> never
any thing against Christian Patience and Obedience. We have heard
of late of the <hi>Pattern in the Mount,</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> talked of to be form'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that <hi>Pattern.</hi> Indeed it seems to have somewhat of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
<hi>Bonnm est,</hi> of his desire to be with <hi>Christ</hi> without the <hi>Cross,</hi> to build
<hi>Tabernacles</hi> here for him, a new Kingdom upon earth, to set up <hi>King Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
a phrase much canted; but to this St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives his dash, 'Tis a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciens
quid diceret,</hi> that neither he, nor they know what they say, what
they would have. 'Tis meer fear of I know not what, <hi>a fear where no fear
is,</hi> a meer stupor, as St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and a desiring what is not to be desired, an
expectation of what is not to be expected, of nothing but ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and glory in <hi>Christs</hi> service. Their present condition and successes
make them say and wish they know not what.</p>
            <p>For, if we truly examine it, we shall find this saying what comes next,
we heed not what, comes from present contentments and successes; when
all things succeed to our mind, then we begin to forget our selves, or not
to know our selves. Worldly felicities commonly so transport us, that
we know not, care not what we say or do, our greatness we think shall
bear us out. <hi>We say in our hast</hi> too with <hi>David, we shall never be removed,</hi> so
care not what we say, how we behave our selves to God and Man, only
<hi>Bonum est esse hic,</hi> we set our selves to enjoy our pleasures, and build houses
for them that shall come after.</p>
            <p>Yet 'tis worth the noting, that whilst we are thus speaking, we speak
often against our selves when we do not intend it. We call all our great
buildings, all our great hopes but <hi>Tabernacles</hi> with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> so, as it were,
presaging their remove, that they are of no long continuance and abiding.
How many have we heard of in their times, who have by some sudden
word, some unexpected expression been the presages of their own ruine,
and by the slip of some unlucky syllable or two, doom'd the period, and
fore-told the shortness of this <hi>Mountain</hi> of Glory? Of so unhappy speech
are we, when we begin to talk of any glory or continuance upon the high
places of the earth, we pitch a word instead of a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> that takes
away all our <hi>bonum est esse hic</hi> on a sudden, even whilst we mean no such
matter, whilst we know not what we say. And as no holy company,
<hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Elias,</hi> nor <hi>Christs</hi> own can keep us from all indiscretion in our
speech no more then they did St. <hi>Peter,</hi> so neither do they keep us from
undoing our selves often with our own language. We in a passion say
we know not what, enough to throw down all our <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> remove
all our <hi>Bonum est, all our goods.</hi> The more need then with the <hi>Psalmist</hi> of <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:57113:261"/>
a watch before our lips,</hi> and <hi>a guard before our mouths, that we offend not
in our tongues;</hi> that we consider what we say before we say it, that we
learn to speak before we speak it; that we keep our mouths even from
good words, as the same holy <hi>Prophet</hi> has it; that we do not take up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word that seems good and godly, but weigh and ponder it in the
<hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> by <hi>Christs</hi> Rule and Precept, before we utter it.</p>
            <p>And so doing, and so speaking, we may in all conditions, high and
low, in glory and ignominy, in prosperity and adversity, in all companies,
in all places, say merrily and cheerfully, without danger, <hi>Master it is
good for us to be here</hi> and <hi>make Tabernacles here for Christ,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
to keep them with us, we may build in the <hi>Mountain,</hi> or in the <hi>Valley</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear of this censure, not knowing what we do. All will be good
unto us, all will work for good, if we temper our words and speak
them soberly, and place them rightly, and direct them every one to his
<hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> to his proper object and circumstances; and <hi>Christ</hi> will tarry
with us, and <hi>Moses</hi> not forsake us, and <hi>Elias</hi> not depart away out of the
<hi>Mountain</hi> from us, till we come to the <hi>everlasting Hills,</hi> to <hi>eternal Mansions,
houses not made with hands eternal in the Heavens,</hi> to dwell with <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets, see them face to face,</hi> be
transfigured and cloth'd in bright shining garments, and shine like
Stars for ever and ever.</p>

of all <hi>his Saints. Such honour</hi> has God allowed them,
<hi>such honour</hi> has the holy <hi>Church</hi> bestow'd upon them.
Because they are <hi>his,</hi> and as <hi>his</hi> here they are had in
honour, because <hi>his holy ones, Sancti ejus,</hi> as <hi>his Saints</hi>
or holy ones honour'd with a <hi>holy day,</hi> or, if you will,
God honoured in them on the <hi>day.</hi> For <hi>this honour</hi> also
<hi>have all the Saints,</hi> that all the honour done to them, all the honour done
by them, by the <hi>Saints</hi> in earth to the <hi>Saints</hi> in heaven, all the vertues
of the one, all the praises of the other are to the honour and praise
and glory of God in all the <hi>Congregations of the Saints,</hi> whether in heaven
or earth.</p>
            <p>'Tis not fit therefore any of <hi>them</hi> should be forgotten, from whose
memories God receives so much; not reasonable to deny <hi>them</hi> any honour
that so redounds to Gods. The <hi>Psalm</hi> gives them it, and the <hi>Day</hi> gives
them it; God says they shall have this <hi>honour,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> this <hi>day</hi>
pays it, and we must pay it, if we honour either him or her, <hi>God</hi> or the
<hi>Church,</hi> or Father, or mother; pay it to them all, to all to whom 'tis
due, all honour that is due. This is a <hi>day</hi> for us to meet all together to
pay it in, for them altogether to receive it in. We cannot do it to all
severally, they are too many, we may do it to all together. We profess
a great <hi>Article</hi> of our faith, <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> by doing it; are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely not too blame for doing it, having so good authority, so good
a ground, so good a profession for it.</p>
            <p>For say our new Saints what they will, unsaint they whom they please,
dishonour they all the <hi>old Saints</hi> how they list, (1.) God has <hi>his Saints,</hi> says
our <hi>Text,</hi> and <hi>ver. 5. Saints in glory, Saints in their beds,</hi> or in their graves;
<hi>his</hi> they are, and <hi>Saints</hi> they are though there. <hi>His Saints</hi> (2.) have and
shall have honour. A signal special honour (3.) it is they have; <hi>This
honour, such honour</hi> as the former <hi>verses</hi> spake of. All of them (4.) <hi>have</hi> it.
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57113:262"/>
All <hi>his Saints have</hi> it (5.) from him, are to have it from us, <hi>gloria sit,</hi> so
some read, <hi>Let this honour be given to all his Saints,</hi> that's the last, and all five
so many parts of the <hi>Text.</hi> I go on with them in their order.</p>
            <p>I. God has <hi>his Saints. Saints</hi> in heaven, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxvii. 52. <hi>Saints upon
earth,</hi> Psal. xvi. 3. <hi>Saints in glory,</hi> ver. 5. and <hi>Saints</hi> of grace. <hi>Saints at rest</hi>
in their beds of honour, and Saints in the bustle of noise and trouble.
The stranger men they, that engross the title to themselves, strike all
the <hi>Saints</hi> out of the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> and will not call them so whom God has
call'd so. Yet if to be <hi>Saints</hi> be to be holy, the title is their due that are
in heaven, they are the holiest: If to be <hi>Saints</hi> be to be called effectually,
they are called to purpose that are already there. If to be <hi>Saints</hi> be to be
separate to God from the drossie multitude, they are of the highest sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
If to be <hi>Saints</hi> be to be established, if <hi>Sancti</hi> be <hi>Sanciti,</hi> there are
none so sure, so established, as they who are in heavenly glory. And
dare men be so bold to rob them of <hi>this honour</hi> so proper and peculiar to
them, that 'tis but a kind of an impropriety to give it to any here below,
which yet both <hi>Scripture</hi> and their own tongues give to some below, yet
to none but such as are in <hi>Communion</hi> with those above, and as far only as
they are in it. God has a <hi>chosen Generation, a royal Priesthood, a holy Nation,
a</hi> separate or <hi>peculiar people,</hi> a people to <hi>shew forth his praise, called out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
into his marvelous light</hi> to do it, says St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 9. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the rest of the holy <hi>Epistlers,</hi> say as much, call Believers <hi>Saints</hi> ever and
anon, and these have <hi>fellow-Citizens,</hi> Eph. ii. 19. <hi>Saints</hi> in an inheritance
of glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 18. worth the knowledge, says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and now (2.) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
honour too.</p>
            <p>II. For <hi>his Saints have honour,</hi> are persons of honour. <hi>Kings and Priests,
Rev.</hi> i. 6. Heirs of a Kingdom, St. <hi>Iam.</hi> ii. 5. Sons of God, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 12.
Children of the most Highest, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxxii. 6. So that if the Sons of Kings,
or Kings themselves, if men in highest Office, or the nearest relation to
the highest Princes be men of honour, the <hi>Saints</hi> are they, who are so
honourably related to, and so highly employed by the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> Who
are first honoured by him with such titles, as his <hi>friends,</hi> St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> xv. 15. as
his anointed, <hi>Psal.</hi> cv. 15. as his Sons and Daughters. Who (2.) are so
<hi>his</hi> that he reckons what is done to them is done to him; receive them
and receive him, despise them and despise him, St. <hi>Luke</hi> x. 16. the very
least of them not excepted, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 40. Who, lastly, are so entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by him that he admits them into his secrets, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxv. 13. makes
them of his Privy Counsel, <hi>Prov.</hi> ii. 32. an honour without question, of
the first and highest rank.</p>
            <p>Enough however to teach us (1.) not to despise them whom God thus
honours though they here walk in rags, and are fed with crumbs, and
look desolate, and though they are covered with poverty, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with afflictions, and had in derision, and a <hi>Proverb of reproach</hi>
whilst they are here, and when they depart hence seem to die, and <hi>their
departure is taken for misery,</hi> they are honourable for all that, such as the
<hi>Great King delights to honour,</hi> and must not be despised.</p>
            <p>Sufficient (2.) it is to teach us not to dishonour our selves with
any unworthy action or behaviour. 'Tis not for persons of honour
to do things base and vile, indeed to live or act like men of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and mean condition. Nor is it for any of them that are <hi>called to be
Saints</hi> to employ themselves in the drudgeries and nastinesses of sins, in
the low poor businesses of the earth, to work in Mines and Metals, or
make that our business here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:57113:263"/>
For (3.) <hi>this honour</hi> is to teach us to do honourable things, higher
thoughts, and higher works, to live like <hi>Saints,</hi> like such as are to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 5. to reign and rule in it, not to serve it, like such
as are to inherit heaven too, and are therefore to have our conversation
there, to do all things worthy of it, nothing but what becomes the
Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> especially seeing it is not only meer honour, ordinary
honour but a signal special honour that is here given to the <hi>Saints. Gloria
haec est,</hi> or <hi>Gloria hic est omnibus sanctis ejus; This honour have all his Saints,</hi> or
<hi>He is the honour of all his Saints.</hi> What it is we shall best gather by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
out of the foregoing verses.</p>
            <p>III. (1.) <hi>The Lord taketh pleasure in his people,</hi> ver. 4. There's <hi>the honour of
a Favourite.</hi> (2.) <hi>He will beautifie them with salvation,</hi> in the same verse,
there's the <hi>honour of his salvation,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speaks in another place, there's
a second honour. (3.) <hi>Let the praises of God be in their mouth, and a two
edged sword in their hands to be avenged of the heathen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. there's
the <hi>honour of Conquerours,</hi> that's a third. (4.) <hi>To execute upon them the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
written,</hi> ver. 9. There's the <hi>honour of judges,</hi> that's a fourth. (5.) Look
back again, <hi>Let the Saints be joyful in glory,</hi> ver. 5. there's the <hi>honour of glory</hi>
of eternal glory, that's a fifth. (6.) <hi>Let them rejoyce in their beds,</hi> or sing
aloud upon their bed, there's the <hi>honour</hi> of eternal peace and <hi>security,</hi> or
the security of their honour. (7.) Lastly, <hi>Gloria hic est,</hi> for the <hi>Pronoune</hi> is
<hi>Masculine</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew. He is the honour of his Saints,</hi> God is their honour,
so the <hi>Text</hi> may well be rendred, there's the infinity of their honour,
<hi>Honor infinitatis,</hi> or <hi>honor infinitus, their infinite honour,</hi> that's the last. So
here's the Saints honour, like Wisdom with her seven Pillars, strongly
built, firmly seated, magnificently set forth upon them. They have the
honour of being favourites, the honour of being ever and anon honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
saved and delivered, the honour of being Victors, the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
judges, a glorious, secure, infinite honour the <hi>Saints</hi> have.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This honour</hi> that they have is the honour of grand Favourites. <hi>God
is well pleased in them, taketh pleasure in the prosperity of his servants;</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is placed in them, <hi>the Lords delight is in them that fear him,</hi> Psal.
cxlvii. 11. He deals with them as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> Gen. xli. 42.
Puts his Ring upon their hands, and espouses them to himself, makes
them the keepers of his Signet, and grants Petitions by them; He arrays
them (2.) in vestures of fine linnen, that is, <hi>the righteousness of the Saints,</hi>
says St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. xix. 8. cloths them with the best Robe too, the royal
apparel of his Son. (3.) He puts a gold chain about their necks, obliges
them with the richest blessings. (4.) he makes them to ride in his second
Chariot, carries them in the clouds, and sets them all at his right hand.
(5.) Cries before them bow the knee, <hi>such honour have all his Saints.</hi>
(6.) He makes them Rulers over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> makes them to
have dominion over the works of his hands, <hi>Psal.</hi> viii. 6. gives them all
the blessings of the Land, gives them their hearts desire, and fulfils all
their mind, all at their disposal. (7.) He does more than <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
them at his Table, feeds them with the bread of Heaven, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
them in his arms, receives them into his bosom, counts them as
the very apple of his eye, reckons them as his Jewels, compasses them
continually with his loving kindness, prevents them always with the
blessings of his goodness, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxi. 3. and crowns them with glory and
worship, <hi>Psal.</hi> viii. 5. Puts Crowns upon their heads as well as Robes upon
their backs; crowns them with this favour above the rest, as to unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
himself unto them, to grant them secret conferences and discourses
with him, as to his only favourites in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:57113:263"/>
That this may appear the better, <hi>their honour,</hi> secondly, <hi>is great in his
salvation;</hi> they do but cry to him and they are saved, they do but go to
him and they are delivered, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxiv. 16. <hi>He preserveth the souls of his
Saints,</hi> says holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. xcvii. 10. <hi>He preserveth the ways of his Saints,</hi>
says <hi>Davids</hi> Son, <hi>Prov.</hi> ii. 8. Nay, says the <hi>Father</hi> again, he gives his very
Angels charge over them, <hi>Psal.</hi> xci. 11. makes them tarry all about them,
<hi>Psal.</hi> xxxiv. 7. that they hurt not so much as their feet, <hi>Psal.</hi> xci. 12. that
they break not a bone, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxiv. 20. that they lack nothing, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. This
is an honour to some purpose, and a huge one for God to descend to do
it for us; not like the honours of the earth, that lay us open to wind and
weather, that cannot shelter us from danger and ruine, but raise us up
commonly to throw us down with the greater violence. No, <hi>he lifts up his
meek ones to salvation;</hi> lifts up his Son upon the <hi>Cross</hi> to save them, a high
honour this; we would count it so if a King should venture himself to
save us, an honour we knew not how to value, and such a one this is,
you will see it clearly by the next, honour and salvation both exalted,
which is the honour of Victors and Conquerours granted also to his
<hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For (3.) though the heathen rage, the <hi>Saints</hi> shall be avenged, though
the people imagine a vain thing against them, they shall rebuke them;
if the Kings of the earth stand up, and the Rulers and Nobles take
counsel together, the <hi>Saints</hi> shall bind them all in chains and links of
Iron, all together; the gates of hell shall not prevail against his <hi>Saints;</hi>
against his <hi>Church</hi> all the counsels and devices, all the strength and power,
all the subtilty and malice of earth or hell shall do no good. Come life,
come death, come Angels, come Principalities, come Powers, come
things present, come things to come, come height, come depth, come
any other creature; come tribulation, come distress, come persecution,
come famine, come nakedness, come peril, come sword, come all the
Kings and Princes of the earth, all the Heathen and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idels under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
all the violence and cunning of hell and all the Inhabitants of that
dismal dwelling, come what can come, come how they can, come all
that can, as good come nothing, nothing will come of it, of all their
fury, in all these, says St. <hi>Paul, we are more than conquerours,</hi> Rom. viii. 35,
36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>through him that loved us. Thanks be to God</hi> (says he) <hi>he always
causes us to triumph in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. ii. 14. We may erect our Trophies, we
may hang up our spoils, the spoils of these our enemies and dance about
them, <hi>praise his Name in the dance</hi> as we are called to do, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of our victory <hi>through Iesus Christ,</hi> for through him <hi>this honour have all
his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Yet not the honour only of the triumph, but of the judgment seat
besides, to pass sentence and execute judgment upon the conquered
enemies. <hi>Know you not,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, that the Saints shall judge the World,
1 Cor.</hi> vi. 2. Are you ignorant of the honour God has promis'd them?
<hi>Know you not that we shall judge Angels too?</hi> ver. 3. Much more then the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
of the earth, who have oppressed the <hi>Church,</hi> gain-said the
Truth, stood up against <hi>Christ,</hi> and for a while trampled down the <hi>Saints.</hi>
The time will be, the day will come when those great Princes, such as
<hi>Antiochus, Herod, Nero, Dioclesian,</hi> and the rest of those persecuting <hi>Furies</hi>
shall be brought before the great Tribunal, and receive <hi>their</hi> Sentence
<hi>from the mouths</hi> of those poor <hi>Saints</hi> whom they so tyrannically raged
against, to be bound hand and foot and cast into utter darkness. And
how great an honour, think you, must this needs be to fit judges over
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:57113:264"/>
those great men who made the earth tremble still before them, and even
hell at their coming thither to be moved at them as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks,
<hi>Isa.</hi> xiv. 9. How great an honour (I say) for such poor Scrubs as we, for
the very poorest <hi>Saints</hi> to be made judges of such men? yea, and judges
too not here, not in earth but below, but in heaven above; yet <hi>such</hi> also
<hi>is the honour of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And greater yet; for it is not <hi>honor,</hi> but <hi>gloria</hi> here; &amp; <hi>Sancti in gloria,
ver.</hi> 5. a glorious honour that the <hi>Saints</hi> are honoured with. All earthly
honour reaches not to this title; glory that we may be joyful in is more
than earth affords. The honours here are so full of fears, so farc'd with
troubles, so stuff'd with cares; so amongst thorns and briars, so blasted
with envies, so justled at by rivals, so assaulted by enemies, so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
by neighbours, so suspected by friends that there is little true
mirth or joy to be had in them, 'tis only the <hi>honour of the Saints in glory</hi>
that is troubled with none of these, but surrounded with uninterrupted
joys and songs of joy. And were the <hi>Saints</hi> lives here but so many days
and years of affliction and vexation, ignominy and dishonour, this crown
of honour at the last were a sufficient, abundant, superabundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for them all. And this is so properly the <hi>Saints,</hi> that none else
have the dream of a title to it; 'tis their inheritance, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 18.
'tis their reward, St. <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 23. the reward of their Inheritance both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The greater honour to be so honoured as to have glory it self
call'd their reward, strange honour to them, to have honour entitled to
them as their due.</p>
            <p>But honour, joy, and glory given to them <hi>in their beds,</hi> to have joy and
glory conferr'd upon them in <hi>their beds,</hi> to have it, as it were, with ease,
with lying still, and to enjoy it with security, without fear of rousing
from it, and in the very beds of dust, the dark Chambers of the grave, the
Mansions of death it self to have this light and glory shine upon them, to
have security and peace, ease and pleasure establisht on their glory, and
those melancholy rooms that are hang'd with worms and rottenness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
with the beams of perpetual joy and comfort is a vast addition
to their glory. Yet this they have, not only an immarcessible and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
crown of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 4. laid up for them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 8. but their
very bones flourish out of the grave, <hi>Eccl.</hi> xlvi. 12. and even the lodgings
of their very ashes seem to exult with a kind of joy to be made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
and cabinets of those Jewels of the Almighty, and their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
and Memorials are blessed for evermore, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> xlix. 10. The
very places where they come are joyful at their shadows as they pass by,
Miracles have been done by their shadows whilst they passed by, <hi>Acts</hi> v.
15. and when their bones have lain a while silent in the grave, the dead
have yet been raised by them to life again, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xiii. 21. Thus his
<hi>Saints</hi> have honour in life, and death, and after death, then when they
seem to have been some while, nay, a long while raked up in dust and
quite forgotten.</p>
            <p>Nay, lastly, <hi>Gloria hic est,</hi> their honour is infinite too, 'tis a mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
glory. All other glories and honours are but Feminine, weak, poor
things to it. God is their glory, honoured they are with his blessed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
honoured with his sight, with his embraces; they see him and
enjoy him. This is the very glory of their honour, the height and
pitch of all, for <hi>in thy presence is joy, and at thy right hand there is pleasure for
evermore;</hi> honour advanced into eternal glory; And <hi>this honour</hi> also <hi>have
all his Saints,</hi> some <hi>in spe,</hi> and some <hi>in re,</hi> some <hi>in hope,</hi> and some <hi>in deed;</hi>
               <pb n="521" facs="tcp:57113:264"/>
all either in promise or in possession. <hi>All his Saints,</hi> some way or other,
more or less are partakers of it; that's their honour at the full extent,
an honour wherewith this <hi>day</hi> is great, which is a great considerable
also in the <hi>Text,</hi> that <hi>this honour</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> as special a one as it is,
is yet also universal some way or other belonging to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Some way or other I say; for, this honour 'tis to be confest at
first is not equal to them <hi>all. One star differs from another star in glory,</hi>
1 Cor. xv. 41. One Saint differs from another in his honour. There is a
Sun, and Moon, greater and lesser stars in the firmament of <hi>Saints.</hi>
There are Coelestial and Terrestrial <hi>Saints, Saints</hi> wholly busied in the
work of heaven, and <hi>Saints</hi> who intermeddle also with the works of earth.
Contemplative <hi>Saints,</hi> and active <hi>Saints.</hi> There were <hi>Saints</hi> before the
Law, there were <hi>Saints</hi> under the Law, and <hi>Saints</hi> still after it. <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
and <hi>Prophets, Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> all were <hi>Saints; Iews,</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> too have <hi>Saints</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>And all have their honour. The <hi>Iews</hi> literally to the very words, the
<hi>Christians</hi> mystically to the higher sense and meaning; greater honour
these, because more abundant grace than they. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> Prosely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
they come in also for their share. Beloved and favoured by him all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by him some way or other all, Conquerours, at least over their
ghostly enemies, all of them; to be judges all at last, and prepared to
glory and honour, and Gods Presence after all. There are false Saints
many, as there are false Gods many; and false honour there is too, that
is by some men given to both the false and true ones; yet this no reason
to scrape the true ones out of the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> nor deny the true honour
that is due to them. If God say the <hi>Saints have honour, est &amp; erit,</hi> for
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Complutensian</hi> Bibles read it, as others, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>they have,</hi> and <hi>shall
have.</hi> I cannot but think that man too bold that dares contradict it, that
dares annul the <hi>Festival</hi> or memorial of <hi>All Saints,</hi> of any <hi>Saints</hi> together
or asunder, or rob them of the honour that God has given them. <hi>Holy</hi>
they are, <hi>Saints</hi> is nothing else; and the <hi>Scripture</hi> so often calls them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that 'tis Infidelity to doubt it, Impudence to question it, and <hi>Atheism</hi>
to deny it, and therefore <hi>Sacriledge</hi> it must needs be too to violate their
honours, or plunder them of that which God has given them; for <hi>this
honour,</hi> says he here himself, or his Spirit for him, <hi>have all his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. <hi>Have</hi> it from God first, are therefore (2.) to <hi>have</hi> it from us too.
<hi>Have</hi> it from God, for he has promised it. <hi>Those that honour me I will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
says he, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 30. and honour them he does; (1.) He speaks of
them with honour throughout the holy Page, and tells forth their
praise, builds there, as it were, a lasting Monument to their memories.
(2.) He gives them titles of honour, calls <hi>Abraham</hi> his Friend; <hi>Enoch,</hi> in
a manner, his Companion, one that continually walk'd with him; <hi>Iob</hi>
his Servant with an <hi>Emphasis,</hi> with a <hi>Quis similis in all the earth; David</hi> his
dear heart, as one would say, <hi>a man after his own heart;</hi> The true <hi>Israelites,
the precious Sons of Sion,</hi> Lam. iv. 2. and all his <hi>Saints</hi> his Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> iii. 17.
Jewels made up, and laid up in Cabinets, in the Cabinets of the highest
Heaven. (3.) He gives them high and honourable employment; to
<hi>Moses</hi> to be faithful in all his house, his High Steward there; to <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and <hi>Ieptha,</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> to be Generals of his Wars, and fight
his Battels; to <hi>Solomon</hi> to be his Master Builder, and the Overseer of his
Works; to all his <hi>Saints</hi> to be his Courtiers, and tread his Courts; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
all. Nay, (4.) he makes them all, as it were, Masters of his
Requests, grants Petitions often upon their score. Thus for <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="522" facs="tcp:57113:265"/>
my Servant, for the oath I sware unto <hi>Isaac,</hi> for my Servant <hi>Davids</hi> sake,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> xv. 4. at the Petition of my Servant <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> xlii. and the like, says
God, I will do this or that. Many, many things God did for <hi>Israel</hi> for their
sakes, many times withheld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his his Judgments, and bestow'd his Mercies for
their only sakes; and with us he deals so too, grants us many favours and
blessings for some of our holy fore-fathers sakes which he would not give
us for our own. (5.) He so honours them that he seldom discovers any of
their faults, or but easily glances at them, or but favourably speaks of
them, as in that remarkable expression, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xv. 5. where he calls
<hi>Davids</hi> Murther and Adultery the matter only of <hi>Vriah</hi> the <hi>Hittite;</hi> yet
recounting of their vertues he is alway full and large. Lastly, He some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
honours them with miracles even at their Sepulchres, as he did
<hi>Elisha, 2 Kings</hi> xiii. 21. makes Napkins and Handkerchiefs from their
bodies, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 12. Nay, their very shadows, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 15. cure diseases,
and (unless we will believe nothing but what we see done before us in
our own days) many great miracles have been done at the Sepulchres
of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> God so honouring the memory of their faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to the glory of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the glorious propagation of it
through the world; and there have been thousands of Witnesses to attest
it.</p>
            <p>And now if God so honour them, as if he delighted to honour them,
it cannot seem strange if I now go on to tell you, we are to honour them
too. It cannot be a sin in us to do that which God does before us, that we
may do it the better.</p>
            <p>I must confess there has been a fault, and still there is some in giving
more honour to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> than their due, not robbing <hi>Peter,</hi> as
we say, to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> but robbing God to give to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and other <hi>Saints.</hi> Yet there is a fault in others too, to rob the <hi>Saints</hi>
under pretence to give to God. But is there not a mean between them?
Sure, sure there is. We may give each their due, God his, and the <hi>Saints</hi>
theirs, and all will be well.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Praise God in his Saints</hi> (the beginning of the next <hi>Psalm,</hi> as we may
read it, and some understand it, and may so without offence, it coming
especially so close to this <hi>honour of the Saints</hi>) may seem to call upon us
to give this honour to them. And <hi>Psal.</hi> lxviii. 35. may be as well, <hi>God is
wonderful in his Saints,</hi> as God is wonderful in his holy Places, for ought
that I can guess by the Sense or Context, and a good reason to praise him
for them, and in them too, as well as in his Sanctuary; we may praise
him, I hope, for all the wonders that he does for the Children of men, be
they in heaven above, or in the earth beneath. And, indeed, there is an
honour due in both, <hi>to the Saints that dwell on earth,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> xvi. 3. and
<hi>to the Saints that dwell in heaven.</hi> Distinguish we but the honour as the
<hi>Scripture</hi> does, and find out the several senses of it there, and we may
know to give each their own. We shall begin below, see how we are to
honour <hi>the Saints that are in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To honour is (1.) to esteem and value one; Good men are to be valued,
be their condition never so mean or poor, that's one duty we owe the
<hi>Saints</hi> whilst they live here; and there is good reason, for they are
very Pillars of the earth, and bear it up, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxv. 3. Ten righteous
men, you know, would have saved even <hi>Sodom</hi> and its four neighbour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
'Tis good we should prize them high that are more worth one of them
than half a City.</p>
            <p>To honour one (2.) is to perform the offices of Charity unto him, thus
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:57113:265"/>
we are bid to <hi>honour all men,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 17. to go one before another in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
honour, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 10. especially then to do it to the houshold of faith,
men of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p>3. To honour is not only to value, or to love, but to delight to be with,
to seek their company; <hi>Honorare timentes Dei,</hi> Psal. xv. 4. to <hi>make much of
them that fear the Lord,</hi> never to think our selves so well as in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<hi>All my delight,</hi> says the same <hi>Psalmist, is upon the Saints that are in the
earth, and upon such as excell in vertue,</hi> Psal. xvi. 3. he was never pleased but
when he was with them. Nay, even <hi>Saul,</hi> as bad as he was, yet <hi>honour me,</hi>
says he, <hi>I pray thee,</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam xiv. 30. <hi>before the Elders of my People, and
turn again with me;</hi> his company he must needs have, and an honour he
acknowledges it to have the company of such a man, a holy <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
The world now is of another opinion, no company so contemptible;
men are never well till such a one is gone; never merry till these holy
men are out of doors, so far are men from thinking themselves honoured
with their Society, or willing to honour them with theirs; any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rather than such as they; they make us melancholy, say they, they
make us sad and dull; they trouble us with discourse we do not like,
with God, and Heaven, and Vertue, and Religion, such hard businesses,
and we know not what. But for all that 'tis a duty we owe both to our
selves and them, to give them this honour, be they never so poor or
despicable, and <hi>David,</hi> you hear, made it his delight, as well as <hi>Saul</hi>
his honour, to receive this honour from, or give this honour to such men
as they.</p>
            <p>4. To honour is to maintain them too when they have need. <hi>Honour Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi>
says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 3. that is, maintain them out of the <hi>Churches</hi>
Stock; and they that labour in the Ministry are to be honoured <hi>with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
honour,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 17. maintenance and respect out of the <hi>Churches</hi> Stock,
and out of ours. Honour is thus taken too in the fifth Commandment,
and we sin against the Commandment both of God and men, when we
deny this honour where it is due, or whensoever the poor <hi>Saints</hi> stand in
need of it. Thus you see what it is to honour, or how you are to honour
the <hi>Saints</hi> below, to set a high value and esteem upon them, to perform
all offices of Love and Charity unto them; to seek their company, and
take pleasure to be in it, and as occasion serves, to express the honour
and respect we bear them by some outward real Testimonies and Effects.
We will see now how we are to honour the <hi>Saints</hi> above.</p>
            <p>To Honour then, as it may relate to them, is to give them a respect
above other men, to look upon them as the Courtiers of Heaven, as
persons in highest place, as the Inhabitants of glory, as such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
praying for us, <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. 9. such as are following the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. 14, 15. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himself at the hearing
of the interpretation of his Dream, could not refrain himself but he
must even worship <hi>Daniel</hi> in whom he saw the wisdom of God so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<hi>Dan.</hi> ii. 46. We cannot hold our selves sometimes but that we
must needs express some especial respect or other to some who either
amaze us with their stupendous abilities of nature, or works of grace.
And is it only strange and irregular to give honour to those glorious
<hi>Saints</hi> whose excellencies are so great, whose vertues have been so full
of wonder? I cannot see why their memories may not live in honour, why
being departed hence they should be forgotten, when their vertues and
good works, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says of <hi>Abels</hi> faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 4. though they be dead,
yet speak unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:57113:266"/>
And if they yet speak, we may speak too, speak of them to their
praise, for to honour them is to commend them: so God is said to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<hi>Psal.</hi> xxii. 24. So Christ to receive honour from his Father,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 17. So men are said to be honoured, <hi>Prov.</hi> xiii. 18. and xxvii. 18.
that is, praised or commended. To this purpose it is that the holy <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
relates their Histories. To this intent St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up a whole
Catalogue of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. and would do more but that <hi>the day would
fail him.</hi> After the same sort he honours <hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice</hi> the Grandmother
and Mother of the blessed <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim.</hi> i. 5. And an ancient custom it
was among the <hi>Saints</hi> of God, it seems by the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Ecclus. xliv. 1.
to <hi>praise famous men, and the Fathers that begat us,</hi> to make a solemn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of them. The <hi>Primitive Church</hi> was not behind in this duty
neither, but in the Prayer for the holy <hi>Catholick Church</hi> recited the names
of the most famous <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and gave God thanks for their
good examples even at the <hi>Altar</hi> it self; nay, brought in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 1. for intercessions and giving thanks
for all men for the Preface of it, as a <hi>Text</hi> to authorize their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Evidences these sufficient to honour the <hi>Saints</hi> with all our
praises.</p>
            <p>With our Praises, I say, but not our Prayers; our Praises of them,
not our Prayers unto them; that's a piece of honour God has no where
in Scripture any way allowed them. Prayers I find not that they are to
have, Praises I find they may.</p>
            <p>And which yet makes more to their honour than such Prayers could
do, that they should be the Conduits of Gods honour to convey it to him;
God is now (3.) to be praised for them. He praised in his <hi>Saints;</hi> he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in their honour; <hi>honor servorum redundet ad Dominum,</hi> so St. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
God to have the honour of their honour; He who bestowed so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
graces upon them, so excellent examples in them unto us, he to be
blessed for them. Blessed too for the honour he has done to take them
hence, out of this vale of misery to himself to glory and honour; this is
to season the <hi>Saints</hi> honour right, to give it as we should when the Author
of it is thus honoured by it.</p>
            <p>But there is an honour still behind that makes up all. We are said to
honour those whom we follow with our attendance. He that is highest
in honour has the most followers, the greatest attendance. If we will
therefore honour the <hi>Saints</hi> indeed, we must honour them by following
their vertues and examples. This is that the <hi>Church</hi> principally intends
by all the <hi>Saints</hi> it sets before us, by all its <hi>Festivals</hi> and <hi>Holidays,</hi> to put us
in mind of the Patience of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> of the Repentance of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
of the Faith of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Purity of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of the holy Chastity
and Humility of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> of the ready following of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in
St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> of the leaving and forsaking all for <hi>Christ</hi> in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> of
a holy boldness to profess the truth in St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and so of the rest;
and of the love, and charity, and communion the <hi>Saints</hi> ought to hold
together in <hi>this days Feast;</hi> where they are all, as it were, joyn'd together,
that we might learn never to make a separation from this communion,
never to break off from the <hi>doctrine once delivered to the Saints,</hi> nor leave
one single vertue unpractised which we find in any of them. <hi>This</hi> is truly
honour to them to have a multitude of followers, the <hi>honour of all his
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it will be our honour too to follow them, and do like them; to
make our selves honourable by these vertues, patience, obedience, chastity,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57113:266"/>
holiness, great piety, which have rendred them so renowned through the
world; so famous in this, and so glorious in the other.</p>
            <p>And all these together are all the honour, lastly, the <hi>Saints</hi> expect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from us; besides that of our Prayers for their consummation, that
they with us, and we with them, may in due time obtain the fulness of
this honour, the completion of this glory at the <hi>Resurrection of the
Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>this honour,</hi> this reverent esteem of them, by this honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, by the devout praises of God for them, by our diligent
imitation of their vertues, and our Prayers for their perfection and
consummation, and our own (for they without us shall not be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
by thus giving honour where honour is due, as the Apostle speaks,
we shall give God his honour, the <hi>Church</hi> her honour, our selves ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and one day be made partakers of that honour and glory which <hi>all
his Saints</hi> that are departed hence in his faith and fear enjoy already, and
reign with him and them in honour and glory for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <q>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud

<hi>our Fathers were,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 1. yea, <hi>and were baptized in
the cloud.</hi> Christianity then in clouds, in shadows. But
when the Sun displays his mid-day glories the clouds
vanish out of sight, what then means this <hi>Nubem tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam?</hi>
How comes this cloud? Is it because <hi>that</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
is <hi>yet</hi> too glorious for our weak eyes to look upon
without a veil?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> Is it still <hi>videmus tanquam in speculo?</hi> See we nothing <hi>here</hi>

Sun in a cloud fittest for travellers. Thus distinguished from the Saints in
bliss, <hi>we</hi> for <hi>nubem, they</hi> for <hi>lumen,</hi> we compassed about with clouds, they
with light.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>nubem</hi> makes the difference between <hi>Viator</hi> and <hi>Comprehensor,</hi> so
<hi>circumpositam,</hi> (for <hi>so</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, about us, we in it, and so see the easier
through it. The <hi>Apostles</hi> by a <hi>figure</hi> first entring it at the <hi>transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> Law and Prophets were departed, not
before.</p>
            <p>Yet should we grant them <hi>circumpositam,</hi> to be <hi>in</hi> it too, 'twould prove
but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
a <hi>cloud of Martyrs</hi> whose flames out-shine the brightness of the
Sun.</p>
            <p>The truth is, our cloud and theirs are not alike. Ours but <hi>Analogical</hi>
at the most. The <hi>Apostle</hi> had to speak to <hi>Hebrews</hi> to perswade them to the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:57113:267"/>
Race of Christian faith, and to them he was to fit his speech. They
would not so soon from their <hi>beggarly rudiments.</hi> A cloud they always had
in all their journeys, and a cloud they would have <hi>now,</hi> or they would
not stir a foot. St. <hi>Paul</hi> raises up a cloud in the preceding <hi>Chapter,</hi> yet a
little to wean them from sense, though a cloud he calls it, it will prove
no such cloud as their dull eye gaz'd after, but a cloud of Saints.</p>
            <p>Indeed, need he had to tell them of a guide from heaven, that a few
<hi>verses</hi> before had told them of so ill entertainment upon earth; stoning,
sawing in sunder, desarts, dens, and caves, nothing but torment and
affliction. <hi>Ideoque</hi> had been a poor inference, could expect but cold welcome
without a <hi>nubem tantam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet what avails a guide, though sent from heaven, if this same
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some <hi>weight</hi> about us overwhelm us, or the way be so bespread
with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such snares that every step we stumble and fall
into inextricable dangers. Were it not for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he shews us how

<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and for all us</hi> too.</p>
            <p>For as they, so we pretend often we would run but that we have no
guide, here's a <hi>cloud</hi> to conduct us; then we have no company, here are
<hi>Saints</hi> to go with us. No body to encourage us, here are <hi>Witnesses</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
us. Then we are too pursie and unweildy for the course, why, off
with that superfluous weight; yea, but the way is full beset with briers
and thorns, down with them too; well, but the way is tedious, let's <hi>run
with patience,</hi> no more than so; but we have nothing to run for, yes, there's
something set before us that's worth the running for; we shall easily find
that too in <hi>Propositum.</hi> So then here's

                  <item>I. The Guide of our way, a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses.</hi>
                  </item>

way, <hi>The sin that doth so easily beset us.</hi>
                  </item>

                  </item>
                  <item>IX. The influence of the <hi>Cloud</hi> upon all, or the inference from it,
<hi>Ideoque curramus. Seeing a cloud we have,</hi> and such an one, <hi>a cloud of
Witnesses,</hi> that will not lead us about as that cloud did <hi>Israel</hi> in
the Wilderness, but <hi>breve per exempla,</hi> the shortest cut without
staying <hi>now</hi> by the way at <hi>lugens in infernum,</hi> or <hi>Sinus Abrahae,</hi> but
hence immediately into <hi>Canaan,</hi> seeing the <hi>Cloud</hi> so great, the
Guide so good, the Company so full, the Spectators of so high
account, the Hinderances so easily put by, the Course so facile, the
Race so short, the Prize so glorious, how can we but run like
lightning after them? You see the parts.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis fit the Guide should lead the way; the <hi>Cloud</hi> first.<note place="margin">1. The Cloud.</note>

<pb n="528" facs="tcp:57113:268"/>
transgressions, a winter cloud that sticks by us, a morning cloud that
rises with us, at the first dawning of our days, and God make it too as
a morning cloud to pass away. I would I could not say here <hi>habentes n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem,</hi>
that we had not <hi>this</hi> neither, but this I can, <hi>Ideoque habentes,</hi> it is
not no good conclusion thence, we have it not to follow, it sets in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>What cloud then? Why, <hi>Nubem testium,</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> new cloud, a <hi>cloud of
Witnesses,</hi> of holy Saints, who by the glory of example lead us more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
to heaven, than theirs did them to the <hi>Land of Promise.</hi> A cloud, for
their multitude; but that we let alone till we come to <hi>tantam.</hi> A cloud,
for the likeness of their Production, their Seat, their Nature, and
Effects.</p>
            <p>Their Production first. Clouds, though heavens near acquaintance
<hi>now,</hi> are but refined earth, or water divested of its grosser body; and
were not the departed Saints, a while since prisoners in these clay houses,
now bereft of their happy tenants? One of the best of them, in his own
esteem no better than dust and ashes.</p>
            <p>2. Why, then, how got they up so high? The clouds they get not up
themselves, 'tis the Sun that draws them upward. And <hi>trahe me &amp; curram
post te</hi> is the voice of the Spouse. Some celestial influence we must have,
the best of us, something without us, from above to lift us up to heaven,
nature cannot reach so high.</p>
            <p>II. Like they are in their Seat and situation: (1.) Clouds are above
the tops of the mountains; and the highest Pinacles of the earth are too
low for an habitation for these sublime Spirits. Nor earth, nor all the
mountains, the high places and preferments of the earth could content
them, nothing under heaven, nothing but heaven. You know the desire,
<hi>Bring me into thy holy hill, into thy dwelling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But if we look upon the Saints of <hi>Iudah,</hi> they were clouds indeed,
and Types of <hi>Christ,</hi> who in them appear'd as the Sun under a cloud, the
cloud between the eye and him. His birth in <hi>Issac,</hi> his name in <hi>Ioshuah,</hi>
his death in <hi>Samson,</hi> his reign in <hi>Solomon. Omnia haec illis contigerunt in nube,</hi>
still a cloud between.</p>
            <p>III. There is a third <hi>Analogie</hi> between their Natures and Effects:
1. Clouds they do not move themselves, 'Tis <hi>Spiritus spirat, the wind that
drives them:</hi> And the Saints they do not move themselves neither, 'tis
<hi>Spiritus spirat, the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But which is more to us. Clouds, they keep off the Sun from too
much sweltring, too much parching us. This we get, at least, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that however the heat of Persecutions and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
scorch us, we are refresh'd in this, that no temptation takes us,
but what is and has been incident to the most beloved Darlings of the
Almighty. As comfortable this to an oppressed Soul as a cloud of rain in
the time of drought, as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.</p>
            <p>3. And as they comfort, so they teach us too. <hi>The clouds drop down and
distill upon man abundantly,</hi> says <hi>Elihu, Iob</hi> xxxvi. 28. and the doctrines of
holy lives drop as the rain, their speeches even yet distill as the dew,
whose blessed Spirits now inhabite those everlasting hills.</p>
            <p>To put all together. <hi>Thither</hi> they ascended up like clouds by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and spiritual operation of divine grace; <hi>there</hi> they dwell like clouds,
their souls like the upper part of the cloud, light and glorious, though
their bodies, like the lower, darkned in the grave. <hi>There</hi> they move like
clouds in heavenly order. <hi>Thence</hi> they descend, like clouds, in the still
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:57113:268"/>
showers of their happy examples, that in them, as in a glass, we may see
the power of faith, the glory of their Lord, who has made earth ascend
beyond its nature, and <hi>dwell</hi> above it.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, is it but <hi>Nubem</hi> still, a <hi>Cloud,</hi> not a Star? The
Saints shall shine as stars, <hi>Dan.</hi> xii. 3. and methinks it being <hi>Nubem Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum,</hi>
the <hi>Martyrs</hi> flames should rise better into stars than clouds. Should
and shall in the Resurrection, till <hi>then Nubem</hi> still, some degree of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
at least a less degree of light. And whatsoever to themselves, for us
perhaps 'tis necessary it be a cloud.</p>
            <p>For had we not need of this <hi>dark</hi> word? When did not God on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
cloud their glories from our eyes, were it not for this <hi>nubem, this
cloud</hi> that covers them, man, as subject to superstition as prophaness,
would quickly find out some excellencies for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to fall
down and worship.</p>
            <p>Or if not necessary, yet more convenient far: For (1.) a Star<note place="margin">Why not a Star.</note> would
only guide us, a Cloud both guide and refresh us.</p>
            <p>And (2.) guide us better. For Stars only appear in the night. Clouds
night and day we can see them, so best follow them. The Sun-beams put
out star-light. Prosperity cannot see a Star, so small a glimmering ray. A
Cloud, come it night or day, in prosperity, or adversity, we perceive
that presently; so a cloud to teach us in all estates how to demean our
selves like devotion in its ancient innocence. <hi>Abrahams</hi> cloud, when the
days are calm and clear. <hi>Iobs,</hi> when the day is swallowed up in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
night. So never destitute of a cloud.</p>
            <p>3. Clouds, not Stars: They are none but the <hi>Magi,</hi> wise learned men
can follow the Stars and their courses, but every Peasant sees which
way the Clouds move. So if Stars, they had been for none but wise
learned men to follow, now the poor Country man has a cloud to run
by.</p>
            <p>And yet how easily soever we perceive the track of the Clouds,<note place="margin">Why <hi>Nubem</hi> in the Singular.</note> yet if
there be a scatter'd multitude, we are as easily distracted. 'Twere best
to have but <hi>Nubem</hi> in the singular, but <hi>one cloud,</hi> 'tis so. Many drops, but
one cloud, though the materials fetcht from several quarters. The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
all <hi>one Cloud</hi> to shew their unity, all and each confessing, witnessing
one and the same truth, for truth is but one. So not St. <hi>Iudes</hi> clouds,
they not only empty, no <hi>stillicidium Doctrinae</hi> in them, no good to be learnt
from them, but clouds too in the Plural, some moving this way, some
that way, no constant course; in division too, one coursing against the
other, at such enmity is evil with it self. 'Tis only <hi>good,</hi> and good men that
keep together <hi>in nubem,</hi> in peace and unity, and by <hi>that</hi> you shall know
them.</p>
            <p>Be it a <hi>Cloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nubem <hi>not</hi> Nubeculam.</note> and but <hi>one Cloud,</hi> the more probable still too small it may
be to command the eye, and then what are we the nearer? <hi>Nubem,</hi> not
<hi>Nubeculam,</hi> no diminutive; will that do it? If <hi>that</hi> will not, <hi>tantam</hi> will.
<hi>So great a cloud.</hi> Why, how great? So great that St. <hi>Paul, ver.</hi> 32. of the
former <hi>Chapter,</hi> tells them, the day would fail him to shew them it all,
as if so <hi>great a cloud</hi> could not but shut up the day in darkness.</p>
            <p>Our first <hi>Fathers</hi> of the World had no cloud to guide them,<note place="margin">Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And indeed, what is <hi>Nubem,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What is it then that some so often ask what have we to do with Saints?
'Tis well besides the <hi>Habentes</hi> that we have an <hi>Impositam</hi> from the Vulgar

               <note place="margin">Nubem imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</note> that it is imposed upon us, some necessity of it sure; and that

               </note> that not only we have

<hi>Habentes</hi> it might be, we might have it of our own chusing or fancying
(we know who have <hi>so,</hi> Clouds of their own making, Saints of their

<hi>this</hi> earth, but he that makes the Clouds his Chariot? Who can dispose

have for <hi>Habentes,</hi> God it is that compasses us with this <hi>Cloud of

<hi>that too,</hi> to rejoyce at our speed, to congratulate our success, to receive us

            <p>And yet methinks the <hi>Apostle</hi> mentions Saints that are gone before,
how come they now to be round about us? <hi>Angels</hi> indeed <hi>are ministring
Spirits</hi> perhaps some of them may pitcht about us. <hi>Angelus Domini in
circuitu timentium,</hi> Psal. xxxiv. 8. <hi>The Angel of the Lord tarrieth round about
them that fear him,</hi> but how can the Saints be said to compass us
about?</p>
            <p>May it not be a <hi>Metaphor</hi> to shew their multitude, because there are so
many, that we cannot turn our eyes any where about us but we see them?
The Phrase is <hi>Davids</hi> in another case, <hi>The sorrows of death compassed me,
Psal.</hi> xviii. 4. at every hand, on every side, at every turn. I cannot avoid
them.</p>
            <p>Or is it, that they guard us round with their <hi>Quousque Domine quousque?</hi>
their earnest prayers for their afflicted Brethren?</p>
            <p>Or is it that being <hi>there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth,</hi>
St. <hi>Luk.</hi> xv. and they with the <hi>Angels</hi> make up the Choir, and heaven it
self encompass us, they therefore are said to compass us?</p>
            <p>Or is it that their Graves and Sepulchres are round about us, and we
as it were still encompassed with their bodies, and they as it were did
still encompass us in their bodies? The word may seem on purpose as it
were. <gap reason="foreign">

Sepulchres of the Saints do so this day. As if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had meant, that
from the sight and nearness of the resting places of their sacred ashes we
should every day be put in mind with thankfulness to acknowledge
the riches of Gods goodness in our deceased brethren, and learn
those vertues whereby their bones now flourish out of their Graves,
and their memorials live for evermore. Least, as <hi>Abels</hi> bloud from the

this seems but a concusion.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Certamen fidei</hi> oft times proves so. Ver. 4. <hi>Nondum certastis,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

than to an agony. A Race, <hi>this,</hi> that crowns the Victor with a Diadem,
the brightest of all created glories, brighter than the Sun.</p>
            <p>And yet even <hi>this,</hi> if <hi>propositum</hi> be wanting,<note place="margin">Certamen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum.</note> will be thankless. If it be
taken up of our own heads, and not proposed. Nay, if it be proposed in

it not to <hi>us,</hi> as most convenient for the time, the cause, the persons.
<hi>Else</hi> when they persecute you in one City, flee to another; 'twas his
counsel whose the <hi>Martyrs</hi> are, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 23. But if be at any time <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm

terrible things.</p>

               <pb n="538" facs="tcp:57113:273"/>
But yet, if you would fain be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> you may be <hi>Martyrs</hi> without
dying. <hi>I die daily,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> a living <hi>Martyr.</hi> Would you know how
that is? There is a spiritual Martyrdom, that sometimes equals the
others torments with its own difficulties. (1.) Abstinence in the midst
of swelling plenty. (2.) Humility in the pride of rising glory. (3.) Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the confluence of domineering injury. (4.) Chastity in the flower
of blooming youth of sparkling bloud. (5.) Bounty in the depth of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
(6.) Joy in the abyss of misery. (7.) Charity to our enemies in
the height of their insulting cruelty. (8.) Obedience in the hardest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
that most cross our own opinions and desires. This the race, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which the other is but a naked title, an airy name. <hi>This</hi> is <hi>always
Propositum nobis,</hi> the race of them that seek thy face O <hi>Iacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I speak of Martyrdom, I should not forget <hi>Per Patientiam,</hi>

as patience; and <hi>Per Patientiam, per</hi> is through, so run through
not part of the way. Patience runs the Race, but perseverance keeps
the Goal.</p>
            <p>Neither is this enough. Patience has been long mistaken for a heady
daring and braving of deserved punishment. 'Twere well we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Patientia</hi> comes from <hi>Pati.</hi> Passive we must be only here; suffer
evil when it comes, not thrust our selves upon it.</p>

               <note place="margin">Per patientiam curramus.</note> and the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> upon some
secret inspirations (who knows) perchance to dant the fury of their
Persecutors, by their chearfulness have run to torments. <hi>Vos autem non sic,</hi>
we have not that warrant; and yet we may be active too. <hi>Curramus per

let them be companions, never without <hi>Per,</hi> or <hi>Cum</hi> between
them, never sever'd. Patience is a dull, heavy vertue without <hi>curramus,</hi>
without <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi>
without life.</p>
            <p>Active enough we may be, but not in seeking crosses. They'l come fast
enough themselves. There's time and place for <hi>curramus,</hi> when in the midst
of injuries we <hi>run</hi> to heaven for succour. Thus also <hi>Curramus per patienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>

            <p>Had we not a guide it might seem unreasonable to force us to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
journey; or were it not a guide from heaven, we might as easily
fear misguiding; or were it a star, our eyes might dazle into blindness,
and we lose our guide; could we fear the sad melancholy of a solitary
way, we might pretend it uncomfortable. Should we want the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
eyes of beholders, we might fear to faulter by the way for want of
encouragement; were we to run through the furies of flames we might
startle at the hardness of the employment, or should we be commanded
to disavow the pleasures of a convenient life, for all the austerities of a
poenitential rigour, we might stand confounded at the task; were the
way full of circling Labyrinths we might fear our erring inevitable, or
were the Race voluntary, not set before us, we might then use the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our choice; or were it of an uncertain length, not set out, to
run <hi>in infinitum,</hi> we might account it vain; or were there no Crown to
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:57113:274"/>
run for, despair might kill the life of our affections. But having a guide,
and that from heaven, a cloud to compass and defend us that nothing
harm us, not the Sun look too hot upon us and discolour us, so great
that the wandring eye cannot lose it, so near encircling us, that the
weary step may almost rest upon it; a cloud that cleaves it self into an
ample theater, where you find both company and spectators, where by
the examples of a world of Saints surrounded, where by the steps of
tender Virgins and little Children taught the easiness of the way,
where by the Crowns, and Robes, and Palms of Martyrs too transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
glorious assured of our reward, seeing we are to bid adieu to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but our misery and our sin, to leave only the courting of our own
damnation, when it is no more than an easie run to heaven, no studied
torments in the way, no tedious or eternal journey, a plain certain way,
directed by him who will as well help us forward as command us, what
colour of excuse for the least remissness?</p>
            <p>Say no more but that we had a guide; a guide is not given to go
alone, and a guide from heaven deserves not so to be disrespected; but
guide and company both thence to be neglected, what name shall I stile
it by? <hi>Run</hi> while you <hi>have</hi> the <hi>Cloud.</hi> The time may come, when we shall
have no <hi>Habentes,</hi> when we shall not dare to look upon this <hi>Cloud</hi> for
shame, when our sins shall stand so thick about us, that we cannot look
through them, nor up for them, when we shall strive to run and this
weight and snares so hinder us we cannot stir, when these <hi>Witnesses</hi> shall
turn to be Witnesses against us, when we shall desire this <hi>Cloud</hi> to cover
us and it will not be, when we shall not have so much as <hi>cum patientiâ</hi> left
to help us, but weary of our selves run from hill to dale to hide us, and
cannot run out of sight; and were it not better <hi>now</hi> to run for something,
than <hi>then</hi> to run in vain?</p>
            <p>Great certainly is the force of example, will that do it? 'Tis here to
the full. Did the <hi>Iewish Saints</hi> who had not so clear a light to run by, nor
so clear or full promises to run for, nor so skilful guides to run after, nor
so full a glory to run into, chearfully fulfil their course? And shall <hi>we,</hi>
whose knowledge as much excels theirs, as theirs did ignorance, who
do not so much see as enjoy the Promises, after so fair a Troop, into so
perfect glory, move on heavily? How oft have Royal Virgins met the
terrors of a long and subtile death with the same countenance they
would have met their Wedding joys, and Children run to torments as
to play? How oft have Kings and Princes (fifty of our own within the
space of two hundred years) chang'd their Kingdoms for the house and
bread of poverty? O blessed Spirits, how lamely do we halt after you!
How do we dishonour your aged glories by us so often boasted of, and
scatter, as it were, your sleeping ashes in the wind by our degenerate
Christianity! How do ye even hide your selves in clouds, and blush to see
us call <hi>that</hi> Religion, which ye would not have call'd by so honourable a
title as prophaneness!</p>
            <p>What if without example? Is it not enough that God propounds it?
Had it been some greater matter ought we not have done it? Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
But why stand I upon any when we have all? And may I not then
<hi>well</hi> add therefore run?</p>
            <p>We have set the <hi>Ideoque</hi> upon <hi>Nubem,</hi> upon <hi>Tantam,</hi> upon <hi>Habentes,</hi> upon
<hi>Martyrum,</hi> upon <hi>Circumpositam,</hi> upon <hi>Pondus,</hi> upon <hi>Peccatum,</hi> upon <hi>Circumstans,</hi>
upon <hi>Curramus,</hi> upon <hi>Certamen,</hi> upon all; and being now at the end, I shall
leave it upon the last, <hi>Propositum nobis,</hi> the reward of our pains.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And amongst the Saints St. <hi>Andrew</hi> is the first in order, for here the
Christian <hi>Church</hi> begins her <hi>Festivals</hi> (I know not what or whose Church
to call it that has none) and fitly too does she begin with him, who was
the first that followed Christ from <hi>Galilee,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn, Chap.</hi> i. 41. Fit
sure that he should lead the rank that there begun it; that brought the
great St. <hi>Peter</hi> as his second, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. though afterward for that excellent.
Confession of his, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 16. made the first. Yet just certainly it is
that St. <hi>Andrew</hi> too should have his <hi>Primacy,</hi> and so the Church has given
it him, to begin the Army of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in her <hi>Kalendar,</hi> that we
may see no man shall lose any thing by his speed to Christ; the more
haste to him, the more honour for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:57113:275"/>
I shall not yet this day, though it be the first of <hi>Advent,</hi> much med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with that, or primarily or very particularly set my self to speak of
Christs <hi>Advent</hi> or coming. I shall be content (because we are not like to
meet many such opportunities as this day in conjunction brings us) to
speak this day of the <hi>Disciple,</hi> and only glance at his <hi>Lord.</hi> We shall
have many occasions to speak of the <hi>Master,</hi> few now a days to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Disciples. Yet for all that cannot we well speak of the one
without the other. The honour of the Servant will redound always to
the glory of the Master. It is for that that we commemorate the Saints,
that we may so magnifie the King of Saints, both by acknowledging his
greatness and goodness in them, and by doing gloriously to the honour
of our Master by their examples.</p>
            <p>And indeed we cannot separate them; and as the Text falls out it
ends as all the praises and commendations of his Saints should end in
him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And it begins with a conjunctive Particle which will refer us
to him. And with an also, or an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which to make the Text to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
will make us look back to an <gap reason="foreign">

to Jesus walking, this <hi>And</hi> they left and followed, to <hi>And</hi> Jesus
walking and calling them to follow, in the two immediately foregoing
verses.</p>
            <p>We shall then, for the full sense of the Text, and the honour of the
day, not quite separate the Lord and his Saints, but joyn the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> together, speak somewhat of Christs co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>xpresly in the words, the
other but implicitely or implied, yet referring this wholly to the glory
of that, their following here to Christs coming before, St. <hi>Andrews exite</hi>
to <hi>Christs Advent,</hi> joyn them both as the day does for us.</p>
            <p>For in the words are both, though just as in the day; the one swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the other, the Holy-day in the Sunday; only with this
difference, St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Feast in the <hi>Advent,</hi> in the day, the <hi>Advent</hi> in
St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, in the Text. The day more evidently for the Lords day, the
Text for St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will forget neither, but must follow the Text, where we are to
consider two <hi>Particulars:</hi> The one exprest, the other implied. (1.) St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews
Festival;</hi> and (2.) the <hi>Feast of Advent,</hi> or the grounds of each;
the ground of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Festival expresly, his <hi>leaving his Nets and
following Christ.</hi> The ground of Christs Advent implicitely, that it was
straightway done, that is, presently upon Christs coming and calling to
him. You see Sundays and Holy-days are at no such variance but they
can stand together; their grounds too, both Scripture grounds; both
from the same Text too. Our new <hi>Reformers</hi> may as well deny the one as
the other, and no doubt if they stand but in their way a little, they will
too. Only some day must be kept up a while to preach the <hi>cause:</hi> when
that is done, <hi>Ye observe days, and months, and years,</hi> will be as good a Text
against the <hi>Lords day</hi> as his <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to trouble you with the Division of days, we will afford you
another Division of the Text.</p>

and implied. Jesus came first, and walked by the Sea,
and lookt upon them, and spake to them; <hi>And,</hi> and what then?
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:57113:276"/>
                  <hi>And</hi> they straightway followed. Followed? Whom? <hi>Him,</hi> says
the Text. <hi>Who's that?</hi> One that was worth all their nets, one
that would make them fishers indeed, Jesus, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. for <hi>him</hi> it is
they leave their nets, and <hi>him</hi> they follow.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In their obedience there are three particulars: (1.) The readiness;
(2.) The sincerity; (3.) The rightness of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It was straightway, there's the <hi>readiness.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. It was to the leaving of their nets, their very life and living, all the
poor living they had, there's their <hi>sincerity.</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>ground</hi> of it, we shall see their obedience was not groundless,
for that it was,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Not without a just and lawful call; Jesus call'd them first, <hi>and then</hi>
they followed, and not <hi>till</hi> then.</item>
               <item>2. Not without a powerful, effectual, and enabling call, which so soon
and suddenly could make and enable them to leave their whole
course and means of life, and very <hi>straightway</hi> follow him.</item>
               <item>3. That it was not any but <hi>Christ,</hi> not any thing, or hope, or interest,
but only <hi>Iesus,</hi> the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> him they followed, whom you
shall see anon they had good reason to conceive was worth all
they could leave or do. The ground of their obedience was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rash, nor light, nor sinister. It was discreet, and wise, upon
just call; it was powerful upon, a strange, sudden, powerful change
of their affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and it was right and due to him they paid it,

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the express parts of the Text, with St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and his
<hi>Brothers</hi> great and ready obedience to Christs Command and Call, which
is the Lesson you are to learn upon St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day, that which you are
to learn now particularly from him, as upon the days of other Saints,
their particular vertues and graces, which is or should be our <hi>Holy-day</hi>
business; and if it had been but so taught and learnt, we had never seen
prophane <hi>Kalendars</hi> for Christian, these unhallowed days, or our holy-days
unhallowed, God deprived of the glory, or we of the examples, as
much as lies in these mens power, of his Saints.</p>
            <p>Two there are in the Text, St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and St. <hi>Simon,</hi> though but one in
the day. Christ calls by couples, that the one might help the other, if
the one should fall the other might help him up; that St. <hi>Andrews</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
for that's the interpretation of his name, might strengthen St. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
obedience, which is the English of his, and a couragious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
the meaning of both together the proper Lesson for the Text and
day.</p>
            <p>Three Points we promised you to consider in their obedience, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sincerity, and rightness, we now prosecute them in order, and their
readiness first. And they <hi>straightway</hi> followed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verus obediens nescit moras.</hi> True obedience, says St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> knows no
delays. He that stands disputing with his Lord, or bargaining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioning
with his Master, or long consulting with flesh and bloud, will
scarce deserve the name of obedient, even when he after so <hi>long</hi> does
what he is bidden. The temper of the obedient soul is far other. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
tells us, when it pleased God to call him, and reveal his Son in him, that he
might preach him among the heathen, he did not immediately confer
with flesh and bloud, nor go up to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to the Apostles to be resolved,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:57113:276"/>
but into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and so again to <hi>Damascus,</hi> about the work that God did send
him, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 16, 17. When God sets us about his business, our own fleshly
interests, or carnal friends are not to be consulted with, lest they hang
upon us, and hold us back; nor are we to stay the calling of a council,
even of spiritual friends, before we set to our obedience in things so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as Gods Commands, but into <hi>Arabia</hi> the Desart rather, that is, to
throw off all delays, to desert those petty demurs that rise always upon a
change. After that indeed, after we have first broken the threds that
held us, and made worldly affairs and relations stand off a little, we
may return to <hi>Damascus,</hi> with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to that <hi>succus sanguinis,</hi> as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
to the juyce of our bloud, to consider and weigh our strength
to particular points of our obedience, but we must thence to <hi>Hierusalem</hi>
to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and such as have been before us, and such as are set over
us to confer about the ways and means to correct and purifie our bloud,
to refine our flesh, to get strength of counsel and direction how to break
through all lets and obstacles, and obtain strength against our weakness,
and so return again to <hi>Damascus</hi> after the other interpretation of the
words, <hi>incendii similitudo,</hi> to burn up, as it were, the stubble of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
to purifie and inflame them with the divine love, with holy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which with its active flame will enliven and quicken us, that we
shall straightway follow our Lord whithersoever he will, without delay,
demur, or disputation.</p>
            <p>The young man that proffer'd fair to follow Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st, but first desired to
go and bury his Father, was forbidden it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> viii. 22. Even an act
of charity, such as is the burial of the dead, must not be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obedience. Indeed, with <hi>Elisha</hi> peradventure, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 20. we
may have leave to go kiss our Father and Mother at our parting, to use
civilities to our friends, and with some little solemnity leave the
World and them: Gods work does not make us unnatural or uncivil, 'tis
none of his, whatsoever is pretended, that makes us unnatural, that
makes us disrespective of our friends, or uncivil to them, or utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the bonds of nature and relation. It only requires that they
should not hinder us, that they should not stay or let us from our Masters
business. Kiss them we may, but kiss and part, not stay long upon Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
when we are about our Masters business, much less defer our
following him till they are dead and buried, till they forsake us first.
We must first be of the parting hand, and let nothing keep us from him
any longer than necessities and just civilities do exact.</p>
            <p>Nay, for these too, we are to ask his leave. And if he answer us, as
<hi>Elijah</hi> did him, <hi>ver.</hi> xxi. Go back again, what have I done unto thee? Go,
but consider what I have done. Go, but consider, <hi>quod meum erat feci
tibi,</hi> I have done my do, thou must make hast if thou wilt find me, or
overtake me, thou must not look for a second call; then go back we
may, and slay our Oxen, and boil their flesh with their Instruments, and
give unto the people that they may eat, dispose of our affairs, but with
what hast we can, not stay the resting or fetching so much wood to boil
it, but with their own instruments at hand, boil them all in haste, take
the quickest course we can imagine to dispatch, to give away much of
our substance also to the poor and needy to make more haste, and then arise
and go after him, and administer to him of the rest.</p>
            <p>But if he answer us, as Christ did the young man, <hi>Follow me, and let the
dead bury their dead,</hi> there is no striving then. If (as sometimes he does)
he call us in a nick of time, where the opportunity of doing good is now
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57113:277"/>
in prime, and if we stay but a little it will be gone. Then let the dead
bury their dead, let even that natural charity be performed by some bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else, go we whether we are sent, do we what we are bidden, and think
we that Christ says to us what he said to St. <hi>Peter</hi> upon some such like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
quere, What is that to us? Follow we him.</p>
            <p>Let us always think when we hear him calling us to his service, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Call be inward or outward, within us by his Spirit, or without
us by his Minister, that we cannot make too much haste to follow him.
It may be he has called his last, and will call no more; or he will be gone
if we make not haste, and we shal then at least have much ado to find or
overtake him. 'Tis no easie overtaking him that <hi>rides upon the wings of
the wind,</hi> if he be once gone out before us. 'Tis not safe to loyter by the
way, for fear of temptations that may prevent our good purposes, and
quite overthrow all holy resolutions. 'Tis an unworthy usage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
to stand talking to any thing else when God is speaking to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
to come to him. 'Tis dangerous to play away our precious time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
and follies, in other business, nay, even in good business of our
own, even in an act of private charity or devotion when God calls us to
his publick service and obedience. Christ calls even <hi>Iudas</hi> to do his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
quickly, you may well think he would have St. <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi>
be as quick in theirs; Nay, they were, for in the midst of their work
he called them, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and in the midst they leave; away with Nets,
come Christ, fish who will for them, they'l follow Christ, not so much as
stay to draw up their Nets, be what will in them they care not; let all
go so they may catch him. Nay, more, and if the Spirit of Christ be in
us, we will, with him, be pain'd and streightned till his business be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
though it be such a Baptism as he was then to be baptized
with, even suffering and dying for his name. There can be no excuse
from our attendance upon him with the first, who will not at all
stay with us if he be not the first in all our thoughts, if we prefer any
thing before him, or any business before his. Nay, if we leave not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
our <hi>nets</hi> too, all our own business for his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regnum Dei tantum valet quantum habes,</hi> says St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> The kingdom
of heaven is worth all we have, must cost us so, be it what it will. And
alas! what have we the best, the richest of us, as highly as we think of
our selves, and ours, more than St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and his <hi>brother,</hi> a few old bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Nets?</p>
            <p>What are all our honours but old Nets, to catch the breath of the
world, where the oldest is the best, and that which has most knots, most
alliances and genealogies, the most honourable?</p>
            <p>What are our Estates but Nets to entangle us? 'Tis more evident
now than ever; to entangle us in strange knots and obligations, in vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and disquiets, in fears and dangers, to entangle silly souls beside in
vanities and follies?</p>
            <p>What are all our ways and devices of thriving, but so many several
nets to catch a little yellow sand and mud, and if you will have it in
somewhat a finer Phrase, a few silver scaled sishes, in which yet, God
knows, there are so many knots and difficulties, so many rents and holes
for the sish to slip out of, that we may justly say they are but broken nets,
and old ones too, the best of them, that will scarce hold a pull, all our
new projects being but old ones new rubb'd over, and no new thing under
the Sun.</p>
            <p>What are all those fine catching ways of eloquence, knowledge, good
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:57113:277"/>
parts of mind and body, but so many nets and snares to take men with?
It may be finely spun, neately woven, curiously knotted, but so full of
holes, vanity, and emptiness, that no net is fuller than these things we
take so much pride in, so much delight in. Nay, this very body it self is
but a net that entangles the soul, and the rational soul it self too we too
often make but a net to catch flies, petty buzzing knowledges only, few
solid sober thoughts; at the best but a net for fishes of that watry and
inconstant element, watry, washy, slimy notions of I know not what, of
flitting worldly things; so full of holes too, that all good things slip out
of them.</p>
            <p>Our very life, lastly, what is it but a few rotten threds knit together
into veins and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inews: The strings and powers of a thin and immaterial
soul knit to the threds of a feeble body, so slender and full of holes, and
the knots so loose, that the least stick or stone can unloose it, or break it all
to pieces.</p>
            <p>And are not these pretty pieces think you now to stand so much upon
the leaving? That we will rather leave our Masters service than these
broken nets that will bring us up nothing but slime &amp; mud, a few fins and
scales, a few sticks and weeds, a few stones and gravel, things only that
will dirty us, or delude us, or run into our hands and pierce them, or into
our feet, like gravel, and race them; or at the utmost but a few fish, slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
or watry comforts that will either quickly leave us, or but slenderly
comfort us whilst they stay. Are not these fine things to quit heaven for?
Oh <hi>blessed Saint</hi> of the day, that we could but leave these nets as thou
didst thine, that nothing might any longer entangle us, or keep us from
our Masters service!</p>
            <p>Not that we must presently quit all honours, estate, and ways of gain,
bodies, and souls, and life, and throw our selves into dishonour, poverty,
and death, in that instant we propose to follow Christ, but that we must
know we cannot follow him if we cast not off our inordinate affections
to all of these, use them as if we used them not, enjoy them as if we
had them not; so humbly bear our honour as if we sought none else but
Gods; so manage our estates as to give an account to him for every far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
so use our trades, as if our whole business were to trade for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
so feed our bodies, as if their chief food were the bread of heaven;
so employ our understandings as if they were to mind nothing but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, and so live as if we had nothing else to do but die; so cast
away our nets as if we had nothing now to do with them, now we had
caught Christ, or but to catch and hold him.</p>
            <p>Worldly honour may consist with Christs, our greatest estates with the
true riches, our lawful busiest Vocations with his service, our secular
learning with heavenly knowledge, the care of our bodies with the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our souls, our lives with his death; only they must not stand in
competition for time and place, but be all left to his disposing; and when
at any time they cannot either stand with his service, or will hinder it,
then leave them all we must to follow him, as occasions and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
shall require the forsaking any of them, be it life it self. Alas! he
loves not Christ at all, that loves any thing above him, any thing equal
with him, that prefers any thing to him, or will not readily leave it for
him.</p>
            <p>We have read of many who have left their Thrones, and cast away
their Scepters; many who have thrown away their riches, and deserted
their estates; many who have given over all their thriving ways; many
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:57113:278"/>
who have bid adieu to all secular studies; many who have in strange au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities
and mortifications neglected, nay, <hi>crucified</hi> their bodies, and
others that have run to death as to a wedding, that so they might the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
follow, or the more happily attain to their Masters steps; but these
are singular and particular <hi>heights;</hi> the ordinary course of Christianity
is by a lower way. Yet is the way good too. <hi>Et omnia deserit qui volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
habendi deserit,</hi> says St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> he also verily forsakes all, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
none, nothing but <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who has crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 24. the world with all
the desires thereof, who though he has all he can desire, yet desires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what God will have him.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it may fall out that we must leave our callings to go after
him, when they be either truly sinful, or evidently dangerous, and our
wealth, when it is unjustly gotten, or unrighteously held, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
and leave to the right owners of it. Sometimes again it may be
lawful for us to leave both Estates and Callings, though we be not
bound to it, as when we plainly see we can thereby serve our <hi>Master</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and he seems to point us to it; when we perceive we cannot else
perform the Task or Calling he has designed us to, or the business he
has already set us upon. Otherwise, let every man, says the <hi>Apostle, abide
in the Calling wherein he is called,</hi> and stir not from his station but when he
may lawfully and orderly be made free from it. 'Tis not presently from
the <hi>Counter</hi> to the <hi>Desk,</hi> from the <hi>Loom</hi> into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> from the <hi>Shop</hi> into
the <hi>Church,</hi> from our <hi>Nets</hi> to our <hi>Books,</hi> from secular Trades to the holy
Function that we are to run, there is something more than so when the
<hi>Apostle</hi> bids men stay and continue in their Callings. And to follow
Christ is not only to be <hi>Apostles</hi> and Teachers, for who then shall there be
to be taught? And to satisfie all from the example in the Text, this is
the third time of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> being call'd. To the knowledge of Christ
he was call'd, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 38. To his familiar acquaintance, St. <hi>Luke</hi> v. 10.
and here, thirdly, and St. <hi>Mark</hi> i. 17. to the <hi>Apostleship;</hi> so many steps
even these here made ere they came to be <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not till now threw
they quite away their nets to return no more unto them. 'Tis no such
hasty business to become <hi>Apostles,</hi> or succeed them in any point of their
office. Yet truly, when Christ shall give any of these hasty heads power
to do wonderfully, to shew miracles, to manifest their calling, and to
do extraordinarily, as he did to these, then we were much to blame if
we would not allow them that, God has extraordinarily call'd them to it,
and what were we that we should oppose against it? But in the mean
time lets see them leave their <hi>nets,</hi> their private interests and hopes of
gain, and repute, and fame, that we may have reason to think they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ, and not their own bellies, fancies, and humours.</p>
            <p>Yet we can tell them too of those who have done more than the most
they dare pretend, have left all, expresly all, and yet no followers of
Christ. Heathens have done it, <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Bias,</hi> and <hi>Thales,</hi> and <hi>Crates</hi>
the <hi>Theban,</hi> and <hi>Fabricius</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> yet Christ not followed by it. And
I know they will say as much of the Hermits of the Desart, and the
Brethren of the Cloyster, that (though they have done what they dare
not think for Christ) yet they have not followed him. And could these
great Confidents shew what they have done or suffered, or lost or left for
Christ, yet by the same Argument their own they cannot prove they
follow him the while. But alas, they have left nothing but what they
should not, their proper Callings wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have them
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:57113:278"/>
abide with God. And it is not Christ but the loaves they follow, not
Gods glory, but their own. For if we but examine what was their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the Text, and the grounds of their so doing, (as we shall anon)
it will appear quickly whom they seek, what they follow too, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
only, or rather only pretend so much now adays to follow Christ.
Let's next see whom St. <hi>Andrew</hi> followed when he left his nets, and how
he followed.</p>
            <p>Christ it was he follow'd, for this <hi>Him</hi> is <hi>He.</hi> (1.) Not his own profit
sure, he could hope for little from him who had not where to lay his own
head. (2.) Not his ease and pleasure in his company, who was always
hungring and thirsting; and yet had scarce bread to eat, or water to
drink, or time to do either, watching, and walking up and down about
his Fathers business till he was faint and weary, and yet nor place nor
time to rest in, not to sleep but he must be awak'd as soon almost as he is
laid down. (3.) Not his own honour certainly under a Master who was
the most rejected and despised of men, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> stiles him, called
<hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> and a friend of sinners, and deceiver of the people, and a
worker by the devil. Not his own humour or fancy, but Christs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Call that so straight transform'd his mind, and raised him to a faith
that could so suddenly part with all without murmuring, reasoning, or
taking care for a future living. In a word, not any thing but <hi>Him.</hi> But
him then how did he follow?</p>
            <p>1. He followed him with his body, gives himself to be one of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Servants and continual Attendants, content with such course fare
and cloathing, as his poverty would allow him, partaker of his fastings,
and watchings, and journeyings, and hard lodgings, and painfulness, and
weariness, and reproaches, to teach what our bodies must be content to
endure for his service, and in following him.</p>
            <p>2. He followed him with his mind, gave up his understanding to be
informed, his will to be directed, his affections to be ordered by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Precepts; for to follow Christ is to resign up our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the obedience of faith.</p>
            <p>3. He followed him in his life in patience, and meekness, in humility,
in poverty of spirit, in mercifulness, and doing good in the life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christian vertues, liv'd an admirable holy life; went up and
down from Country to Country, into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> into <hi>Scythia,</hi>
and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> preaching Christ, and following Christ whithersoever he
call'd him, and this is properly to follow Christ, to imitate him. And</p>
            <p>4. He followed him in his death too, was also crucified for him; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him so chearfully to that, that says St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and the Story of
him, He seeing the Cross afar off thus joyfully saluted it, <hi>Salve crux diu
desiderata &amp; jam concupiscenti animo praparata, ecce gaudens &amp; exultans ad te
venio.</hi> Welcome sweet Cross so long desired and wish'd and long'd for,
and now come at last, I come rejoycing, I come leaping to thee; I come,
I come.</p>
            <p>Thus I have shew'd you how St. <hi>Andrew</hi> followed Christ, how we also
are to follow him; to throw away our Nets, not only all unlawful ways
of gain and preferment; nor all things that stay and hinder us from the
service of our Master; but any thing, every thing that may entangle us,
or keep us from the readiness and exactness of our attendance; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so prepared our selves, to conform our selves presently, after his
example, to humility, to patience, to meekness, to doing good, to
obedience, to acts of mercy, to fastings, to watchings, to praying, to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:57113:279"/>
any hardship or affliction; no more now to seek our selves, but him; not
our own praise, but his glory; not our own profit, but the profit of our
Brethren; not our own private fancies, but Christs Precepts, and the
Saints examples, so to follow in their track, in the ways, and orders,
and obediences that they have traced us, and to be content to part with
any thing, with all our own magnified imaginations, all our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
our goods, and estates, and repute, and ease, and quiet, and life,
and all, whensoever he pleases to call for it. This is truly following
Christ. And whatsoever else we have in St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> following him as
an <hi>Apostle,</hi> is particular, and concerns not any at all but those, who by
some signal outward visible Call are commanded to a more immediate
attendance on their Master. To thrust our selves into that without that
ground is both impudence and presumption; to follow our own proud
hearts and giddy heads, and not him that they here followed, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not, either as Disciples, or Apostles without good ground. Let's
else examine it.</p>
            <p>He came himself and publickly and professedly called them to him. In
secret he tells <hi>Pilate</hi> he had said nothing, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xviii. 20. All the people
could bear witness to his doings, that his Followers might know for ever
he would have none to enter into such offices without a solemn and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
calling. To his Doctrine, to be his Scholars and Disciples, perhaps
he will admit us in private, or by night, as he did <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> or in the
croud and multitude together, but to be Apostles, and Preachers of that
Doctrine, not without a publick and particular ordination and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that shall equivalently say as he did to these Brothers in the verse
before the Text, <hi>Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.</hi> Nay, more,
St. <hi>Mark</hi> iii. 13, 14. he picks them out that he calls <hi>Apostles;</hi> does it with
great solemnity. Goes up into a mountain] that was then, as it were,
his Church; and calls unto him whom he would] not who would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
And they came unto him] they, and none else. And them he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained]
(the very word the Church uses still.) He ordained twelve,
that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to
preach.] Lo here, what a solemnity Christ makes of it, of making
<hi>Ministers,</hi> who certainly, had he intended any should make themselves,
or any Ministers but those Teachers and Preachers who from him and his
Apostles derive their power, the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of his Church, would
not with so much solemnity, so ceremoniously, so publickly, so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have thus ordained those whom he intended should be in nearer
attendance to him than others, to whom he would commit the
preaching of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the dispensation of his <hi>Ordinances</hi> to the
world.</p>
            <p>This is not all: They had another ground of their calling, a second
reason of their following. They were enabled to it by a strange and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change within them, whereby they found they could now already
do what he called them to. They were now become quite other men,
meerly spirituall, no longer Seculars; away with temporal business,
they minded worldly things no more, but straightway to <hi>him</hi> without
delay. This inward Call, though alone it be not sufficient, yet joyn'd
together with the outward is good ground indeed to follow Christ any
whither soever. And unless thus God either on a sudden, or by time, by
extraordinary or ordinary means shall enable any man for his service
and Ministry, and by the outward power also call him to it, he shall
bear his sin that undertakes it, whoever he be, that he did not send; he
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:57113:279"/>
is one of those that God complains of, that runs <hi>when he is not sent;</hi> and
though the pretence be to stay the <hi>falling Ark,</hi> the Church from perishing
for want of teaching, his sin is <hi>Uzzahs,</hi> that touches holy things without
this double Commission, <hi>Perez Vzzah</hi> is his place; a breach he makes
in the Church, and God will one day break out upon him that thus
breaks into the Church, not by the door, but some other way; that
neither being enabled within, nor from without, or within and not from
without, or without only and not from within, whom God has not given
both inward abilities and outward calling to the handling of his holy
mysteries and dispensations.</p>
            <p>They have a third ground yet why they leave their nets, and 'tis to
follow Christ. They know and are assured who it is they do it for, and
why they do it. It is the <hi>Messias,</hi> it is the <hi>Christ,</hi> says St. <hi>Andrew</hi> to his
Brother <hi>Simon,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> i. 41. And so stands the case, they can no longer
tend his business and their nets together. This is the third time they
were called we told you. To the meer knowledge of him they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
first in that place of St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> to a nearer familiarity, St. <hi>Luke</hi> v.
where though they leave their nets, yet 'tis only for a while; but here
being called to follow him to the Apostleship, they wholly leave them
altogether. They saw his power before in the miraculous <hi>draught of fishes,</hi>
which made them leave their work for a time to follow him, but now they
feel it warm within them they cannot stay, shall I say, to draw up their
nets, or to cast them in, though they were now casting and about it, but
<hi>straightway,</hi> the word no sooner out of his mouth, but they at his heels.
When we are sure it is Christ that calls, that him we follow, no hast too
much, no leaving too much, no following too much for him. For him
if it be, we may leave all without danger, but if we be not sure it is, it
would do well to have a net to take to. I speak this for that too many
leave their nets, their business, their work, and bestow themselves and
theirs upon things that are not <hi>him,</hi> nor <hi>his;</hi> upon false Christs, upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
upon such as, what ever shew they make, will be found upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
to seek their own, and not Jesus Christ. 'Tis fit we should
look it be Christ indeed, not our own ends, not leave catching fishes to
go lead silly women captive laden more with sins than ever St. <hi>Andrews</hi>
Net with Fishes. If it be for some new device of late, which our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
have not known, which Christs Church has not received, some new
sprung pattern in the <hi>Mount,</hi> it is some <hi>New Christs,</hi> not the old ones,
some false ones, not the only true ones, who being God blessed for ever is
always like himself. He that leaves any thing to follow those new calls
or callers, either to be a Teacher or a follower of them, had better keep
his nets though broken ones.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sum</hi> is, we are to have good ground for what we do, an <hi>And</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with, and a <hi>him</hi> to end in, good authority to go upon, and the right
end to go to; sufficient abilities, and lawful authority to send us if it be
as labourers into the Vineyard, and a true Christ to serve with them;
good reason too (2.) we must shew for all our actions in Christs Religion
and Worship, though we be but to follow only as Disciples, just power
to commend it, and the infallible glory of Christ and his Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it to. So our obedience to be ready, sincere, and upright when we
can perform and are required it by Christ and those that under him have
the commission to call us to it, or command it for his service, or his
Churches, and we not to undertake it till we find our selves truly enabled,
rightly called, and uprightly intending in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:57113:280"/>
To joyn now the two <hi>Points</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> together, to know our right
grounds, and settle our obedience right upon them, that we may know
what we undertake when we undertake to follow Christ, and do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
not pretend above our strength, but keep <hi>Advent,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi>
both. We are (1.) to provide by St. <hi>Andrews</hi> obedience for Christs
<hi>Advent,</hi> that he when he at any times comes to us either in his Spirit, or
in his Word, in humility or glory, in our lives, or at our deaths, may
find us ready straight to follow him. No so acceptable entertainment
for him, no so fit preparation for him as a ready, entire, well guided
obedience, none so fit to receive him as St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Soul so fitted and
resolved to all obedience. Thus we are to make our way for <hi>Advent</hi> by
St. <hi>Andrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to keep St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Feast, to give our selves up to this obedience,
we must remember Christs Advent to us, that we cannot follow till he
first come to us, acknowledge all our motion is from his. Look he first
upon us, and speak to us, and we straightway run; but if he come not,
there is no following to be expected, much less hast to do it. All is from
him, to him therefore be all the praise if at any time, or wherein at any
time we follow him, 'tis his grace that does it, that comes first before we
follow.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly to keep <hi>time,</hi> to joyn both Feasts together in our
hearts all the days of our life as well as in this day of the year; Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
we him in his Saints, follow we St. <hi>Andrew</hi> as he did Christ, follow
him to Christ, chearfully without delay, to day, whilst it is day, begin
our course; let us not think much to part with any thing for him. Lay
our honours, riches, souls and bodies at his feet, and with pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
intentions study we wholly his service, not our own.</p>
            <p>Let not any be discouraged, that perhaps he has nothing worth the
leaving, nothing but a few old broken nets. Be it never so little we have
left, if we have left our selves nothing, but given our selves and all to
Christ, we have given much; he that, with these Saints here, leaves
nothing but a few knotty threds, if he has no more to leave, has left as
much as he that leaves most, for he has left all, and he that leaves most
can do no more. It is the <hi>mind,</hi> not the <hi>much</hi> that God values. Remember
the poor <hi>Widows</hi> mites, accepted by Christ above far greater gifts, for
they were all she had, and who could give more? The poor mans all is
as much to him, and as much <hi>all</hi> to God as the rich mans all; his tatter'd
Nets as much all his living as the others Lands and Seas are <hi>his;</hi> and the
poor man can as hardly part with his rags and clouts, his leather bottle,
his mouldy bread, and clouted shoes, as the rich man with his silks, and
state and dainties; so much perhaps the hardlier in that they are more
necessary.</p>
            <p>Yet that I may not seem to leave you upon too hard a task to scare you
from following Christ, I shall now tell you, you may keep all, and yet
leave your nets. You may keep your honours, you may preserve your
estates, you may enjoy your worldly blessings, only so keep a hand upon
them, or upon your selves that they be not nets and snares unto you;
let them not take your hearts, or ensnare your affections, or entangle
your souls in vanities and sins; let them not hold you from following
Christ, and keep them while you will. Cast but off the Networks, the
catching desires of the flesh and world, and so you also may be said to
have left <hi>your nets.</hi> And having so weaned your souls from inordinate
affections to things below; Let Christ be your Business, his Life your
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:57113:280"/>
Pattern, his Commands your Law. Be ye followers of Christ, and let
St. <hi>Andrew</hi> this day lead you after him into all universal obedience, ready,
pure, and sincere, think not much to leave your Nets for him that left
heaven for you; you will gain more by following him than all the nets
and draughts of the world are worth. You may well throw away your
Nets, having caught him in whom you have caught glory, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and eternal life, and by following him shall undoubtedly come at
last out of this Sea of toil and misery, where there is nothing but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
nets, and fruitless labours, or but wearisom and slippery fruits of
them, into the Port and Haven of everlasting rest, and joys, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>And that it may be so, let us pray with the <hi>holy Church</hi> in the two <hi>Collects</hi>
for <hi>Advent</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Almighty God which didst give such grace to thy holy Apostle St. <hi>Andrew</hi> that
he readily obey'd the calling of thy Son Iesus Christ, and followed him without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
grant unto us all, that we being called by thy holy Word may forthwith give

the works of darkness, and put upon us the armour of light now in the time of this
mortal life (in the which thy Son Iesus Christ came to visit us with great humility)
that in the last day when he shall come again in his glorious Majesty to judge both the
quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal through him who liveth and
reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost now and ever.</p>

as much as we talk of peace, and write it in the

are not right to it, it rules not there. And as much as
we pretend our thankfulness to God for bringing us
again into one body, we see but slender expressions of it. And yet we
have the same Arguments both for thankfulness and peace, to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for our late recovered peace, and to be at peace if we would be
thought to be thankful, as the <hi>Colossians</hi> had or could be imagined to have
here: our being called again into one body who were not long since in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Gods <hi>Call,</hi> and our own <hi>Callings,</hi> Gods present mercies, and <hi>our</hi> late miseries

            <p>There wants indeed some St. <hi>Paul</hi> to mind us of it, to preach it home;
that we would be what we pretend, that men would be honest once, and
either say no more than they mean, or do what they say; be content at
least to be at peace, and not disturb it, but let it rule, (so the <hi>Apostle</hi> would
have it, and so it should) rule in our hearts, and rule in our lives; rule in
our hearts, and make them unanimous; rule in our tongues, and make
them thankful; rule in our hands, and keep them quiet; rule in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and make them peaceable; rule us all into one as we are called into
one, rule us all into one mind, and one heart, and one soul as we are in one
body, rule us as a rule sent from God to rule us; For 'tis the peace of God
we speak of, and we ought every way we can to be ruled by it, and be

the manifestation and expression of it in <gap reason="foreign">

it, and therefore let this peace of God be in your hearts that ye may shew
your selves to be thankful. Nay, (6.) and lastly, gracious ye cannot be,
but graceless and perverse creatures you will seem if ye stand out now,
and therefore whatever has been hitherto, let the peace of God now
really rule your hearts at last.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you the Text in Parts, which all together give you
this in the sum, that it lies as a duty upon us all to let peace rule among
us, to endeavour by all means that it may, to use all arguments for it that
we can both to our selves and others, and be thankful that it does so much
as it does, that it does in part, and let our thanfulness more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
as that encreases.</p>
            <p>But I pursue the Parts, and make my first <hi>Motion</hi> for peace it self.</p>
            <p>I. And truly 'tis worth the Motion, worth the moving for. <hi>Pacem to,</hi>
thee O peace, say the <hi>Poet</hi> with an <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> who would be without thee?
<hi>Te Poscimus omnes,</hi> Every body would have peace; all but the ungodly,
no peace to the wicked, indeed they have, they would have none. They
have none among themselves, would have none among us. They fish best
in troubled waters. All else are for peace and quiet. God is for it, he is
the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>peace, Rom.</hi> xv. 33. Christ is for it, he both commanded and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
it, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> xiv. 27. St. <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 50. The Apostles are for it one
after another, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Iames,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Iude,</hi> they all
commend it, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> v. 13. St. <hi>Iam.</hi> iii. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 11. 2 <hi>Iohn 3. Iude</hi> 4.
The Prophets before them were for it, they proclaimed it, <hi>Isa.</hi> ix. 7. <hi>Ier.</hi>
xiv. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvii. 26. <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 10. <hi>Mal.</hi> ii. 5. The Angels are
for it, they bring and sing it, St. <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 14. All good men are for it: <hi>Their</hi>
daily Prayer is, <hi>Give peace, O Lord, though it be but in our time only. So,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than not at all. Nay, though, with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in other things it go
hard with them, yet <hi>that's</hi> good for all that, <hi>Isa.</hi> xxxix. 8. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xx. 19.
Good and pleasant also, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxi. 1. Many good things are not <hi>so,</hi> fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and watching, mortification, repentance, and many other vertues,
good they are, but they are not pleasant; peace is <hi>both,</hi> to dwell together
in unity pleasant as well as good, very pleasant, and very good. <hi>O quam!</hi>
               <pb n="556" facs="tcp:57113:282"/>
so good and pleasant, that he is fain to leave it upon the question, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer it; or leave it with an exclamation, <hi>O quam!</hi> leaves us only
to admire it, at the goodness and sweetness of it. The messengers that
bring but the tidings of it too, how beautiful are their very feet? <hi>Rom.</hi>
x. 15. Yea, even afar off, upon the tops of the mountains, says the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Isa.</hi> lii. 7. afore they come near us. As far as we can see them we
adore them; they are the <hi>only Evangelists</hi> that preach peace, they bring
the Gospel, their words no less whose words are peace.</p>
            <p>And no wonder; for Peace is a word of that vast Latitude, that all
Gods blessings are folded up in the very name. It signifies all the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and all the spiritual, yea, and all the eternal goods we can expect;
Glory, and honour, grace, and mercy, and truth, life, and plenty, and joy
are in their several turns joyn'd with it, you may <hi>so</hi> read them ever and
anon, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 10. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 4. <hi>Ier.</hi> xxxiii. 6. <hi>Zach.</hi> viii. 16. To wish us peace, is
to wish us all; to pray for peace, is to pray for all; to give peace, is to
give all.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Notion</hi> being so large and general, we must distinguish it to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it the better here. There is an outward, and there is an inward
peace. There is a Spiritual, a Temporal, and an Eternal peace; or if
you will, there is peace the <hi>Blessing,</hi> and peace the <hi>Grace,</hi> and peace the
<hi>Reward.</hi> Our hearts, I hope, are for them all; but that which is here to
rule them is peace the grace or vertue, the study and pursuit of peace:
the other are our happiness, <hi>this</hi> our duty.</p>
            <p>And of this, two kinds we have in the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>Particular,</hi> and the
<hi>Publick</hi> Peace, both to be endeavoured. The particular, among our selves,
of one member with another: The General, of the members with the
body. The first is with our Brethren and Neighbours; the second is with
the <hi>Church</hi> it self. Peace among our selves, that must be had, says St. <hi>Paul,
1 Thes.</hi> v. 13. And Peace with the Church, as the whole body, there must
be too; for there should be no <hi>Schism</hi> there, says the same <hi>Apostle, 1 Cor.</hi> xii.
25. And, <hi>here,</hi> to speak of Peace, and make the being called into one
body the motive to it, must needs mean the union and agreement both
of the members with one another, and with the body it self.</p>
            <p>II. Yet, for all that, there may be a body with which there is no joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and men to whose Assemblies our honours may not be united; the
Motion therefore now, secondly, for Peace, is no farther for it than it is
the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or as some Copies read it, the Peace of Christ; that is,
such a one (1.) as God commands; Such a one (2.) as Christ wrought;
Such a one (3.) as Christ practised.</p>
            <p>1. Such a one as God commands. Now what's that? A Peace it is,
(1.) that is <hi>joyn'd</hi> with <hi>righteousness, Rom.</hi> xiv. 17. in which the <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
is <hi>sown, Isa.</hi> iii. 18. Not such a Peace, or Combination rather, as
that we read of, <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 11, 12, 14. where they all agree so far as even to
have but one Purse, and one Lot among them, but the business is to lay
wait for bloud, and lurk privily for the Innocent without cause, that
they may find their precious substance, and fill their houses with spoil;
we have had enough of that. The Peace of God is Peace that will do
righteousness, not that Peace that devours the <hi>righteous</hi> and all.</p>
            <p>A Peace (2.) it is that is joyn'd with <hi>holiness,</hi> if it be Gods. So we find
them together, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 14. No Sacrilegious Peace, then, where the
Churches Patrimony must be shared among them, or they will not be
quiet: <hi>that</hi> were to sell God to buy Peace; or indeed to sell them both;
to sell God out of doors, and Peace out of doors, and all out of doors,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:57113:282"/>
our selves at last, we know it well enough; but I know not how to call
it, whether worldly peace, peace only upon worldly interests; or the
Devils peace, that is only for, thou Christ, or thou Anointed of the Lord,
why didst thou come to disease us, to disquiet us, to turn us out? We
were well enough at peace before thou camest; let's alone in our usurpt
Possessions, and then perhaps we will be content with peace; but for this
peace of God and Christ, this holy peace, it is not for our turn, we skill
not of it; our Spirits are not made for it.</p>
            <p>Nor are they for the third sort of Gods peace neither, that which is in
the unity of the Spirit; and yet 'tis not the peace of God that is not so,
<hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 3. When we Pray, and Preach, and Prophesie, and say <hi>Amen</hi> with
one heart, and mouth, and spirit, when we do all things with decency and
order, after one fashion, with uniformity, unite and agree <hi>so,</hi> then our
peace looks like the peace of God, who is not the Author of Confusion,
but of Peace, even such a peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 33. the peace of God is the
peace of Order and Uniformity.</p>
            <p>And his Peace (4.) is peace in believing too, <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 13. where we all
agree in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
<hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 13. Diversities of Faiths and of Opinions, however they may
seem to knit sometimes in an outward Community, cannot yet challenge
to that external agreement the title of the peace of God. There must be
among us an unity of Faith as well as an uniformity of Order to make
up this peace. Men are not left to believe as they list, nor take up what
Opinions they please; as there is but one Lord, so there is but one Faith,
says our <hi>Apostle, Eph.</hi> iv. 5. where there is more, the unity of the Spirit will
not be kept, the bond of peace (whatever is pretended for the Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liberty) will not hold them together, when opportunity is presented
to break it with advantage.</p>
            <p>But I remember I told you some <hi>Copies</hi> read Christ here instead of God.
The matter is not much, the business but the same. The peace of God
is the peace of Christ. For between God and us Christ wrought that
peace, which is the ground of all the rest; and such a one also now (2.) as
he wrought between God and us, would he have us see what we can do to
work one with another. <hi>That</hi> was between persons at the greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the greatest enemies, so must ours be too, if it be Christs peace.
Peace between friends, if <hi>they</hi> jar a little, is soon made up; no greater
a business than the Religion of a Publican will reach to; the Christians
peace takes in enemies too; sends us from the very Altar even to seek a
reconcilement with them; then also when, for ought we know, we have
given them no offence, though they have taken it, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 24. Sends
us the world throughout to make peace, even with all men, says St. <hi>Paul,
Heb.</hi> xii. 14. this is Christs peace; such a one he wrought, and such a one
it is that we must follow.</p>
            <p>One Point yet higher, from his practice: Such a one it must be (3.) as
he practised, not only to love our enemies, and be at peace with them, if
possible, but to hold our peace if they reject it, and revile us for it.
There are Spirits in the World (and they would fain set up for Christs
more than any) that pretend they are for peace as much as any, but they
cannot hold but they must open their mouths, and extend their lungs, and
let loose their Pens to enlarge the breaches. <hi>Micah</hi>'s <hi>Prophets,</hi> such as God
complains of, <hi>Micah</hi> iii. 5. that make the people err, that bite with their
teeth, and cry peace; that bite, and backbite both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and
all that truly endeavour peace; that, with him in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> throw
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:57113:283"/>
abroad their fire brands, where ere they come, among the people, and yet
cry, <hi>Is it not for peace?</hi> But let these men remember there was <hi>one</hi> both
the Author and Example of our peace, that being reviled, reviled not
again, that could hold his peace before the <hi>Sheerers,</hi> and <hi>Murtherers,</hi>
though they fly daily in the faces of them that seek <hi>their prosperity</hi> and
peace, and by the bowels of Christ beseech them now at last to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to Christ and the Church, to unite with us in the bonds of peace.
'Tis but a righteous, a holy peace, a unity of faith and order, a general
reconcilement, and peaceable language and deportment that we desire of
them. The peace of God you have heard is such, and our request is but
the Apostles, that this peace now may rule among us. That's our third
Motion, the third Particular of the Text for the Rule of peace.</p>
            <p>3. The word that is here translated Rule has much more in it, several
senses. And peace it self being of so large a notion, and so general a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
I may, I hope, take the liberty to use as many of them as will
serve my turn.</p>
            <p>Let's take our own Translation first: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>moderetur,</hi> let it <hi>Rule.</hi>
Wars and dissensions have ruled long enough, let peace rule now. Many
passions there are that bustle in us for supremacy when there rises any
contest between us and our Superiours, or between us and our Equals.
Envy would carry it, Anger would over-bear it, Discontent would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, Pride would decide it, Honour would dispose it, Interest would
drive the trade, Lust would sway it, Covetousness would have all,
Peevishness would have more; but let peace for all that, and none of
them rule the business, says the <hi>Apostle.</hi> What we do let it not be to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
our envies, nor to satisfie our spleens, nor to humour our discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
nor to court our prides, nor to exalt our repute, nor to drive on our
interests, nor to fill our purses, nor to fulfill our lusts, nor to sooth our
peevishnesses, but to promote Peace and Unity among all we have to do
with. The unruliness of these passions are the things that hinder it;
whilst we give way to <hi>them,</hi> to any of <hi>them,</hi> we are nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.
These are to be laid down at the foot of peace, nothing done
by us upon their accompt, and then we shall be quiet.</p>
            <p>Nay, not only over the passions let peace bear rule, but even among
the vertues, There <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the second sense, <hi>palmam ferat,</hi> let her wear
the Crown, bear away the Prize. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ver.</hi> 14. this above
them all. Bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long-suffering, put them on all; but <hi>this</hi> above them as a robe of honour.
Excellent graces all; but the bond of all that <hi>ties</hi> them all together;
the bond of perfectness, which perfects all; why! 'tis <hi>this;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

is but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>here;</hi> Love in that verse is the peace of God in this. [For
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to knit together, and so fits <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the bond there as
well as does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here fits <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as well as love does there
also: God being all perfection, and his peace a knitting or binding God
to man, and man to man, and man to God, so perfecting all.] Where
this is wanting we are but imperfect; nor is our vertue nor our felicity
complete. He is the perfectest Christian that is most for peace, and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquers (what side soever at any time prevails) who makes peace, or
does most for it.</p>
            <p>But as peace must rule our passions, and crown our vertues, so it would
do well to decide our controversies, the third sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>dijudicet,</hi>
or <hi>determinet.</hi> If controversies or differences arise among us (as rise they
will) let us first consider calmly on them, weigh them without passion,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:57113:283"/>
discuss them without noise, treat of them without heat; and if they
chance to be so troublesome that they cannot easily be decided either
by reason of the eagerness of the Disputers, or the interests of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or the abstruseness of the question, the Spirit of peace will quickly
do it. Keep thy Faith and Opinion to thy self, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 22. trouble nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy weak nor thy strong Brother with them, disturb not the peace of
the <hi>Church</hi> about them, but sit down, and rest thy self in the decision of
the <hi>Church;</hi> be content with general terms of agreement, and draw not
out Controversies into nice expressions; <hi>the peace of the Church is commonly</hi>
(I may say always) <hi>more considerable than the question,</hi> and he determines
best, that either determines, or is determined for peace.</p>
            <p>To do this the better I shall give a fourth signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Hesych. Medius sit vel arbiter,</hi> let there be a Moderator or Mediator
made to moderate the contention. This does well we find in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Contests, cannot but do so surely in the <hi>Churches.</hi> We must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be our own Judges. Best refer it, and then either our <hi>Superiours</hi> or
our <hi>Laws</hi> will be the fittest for it. But what ever may be perhaps objected
against Superiours in particular, the Law and Canon they stand always
impartial judges; they cannot be accused to lean either to the one or the
other, they are akin to neither, and not capable of flattery or a bribe;
let them then be Umpires between us, and decide the matter.</p>
            <p>Yet to be sure to keep the peace, let there be order kept: So <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(5.) signifies, <hi>ordinet,</hi> let peace set some order now among us. The <hi>Apostle</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> was very careful of it when he spent two several Chapters to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> the xii. and xiv. of his first Epistle to prescribe it. Indeed,
peace cannot consist without it, where there is no order there can be no
peace; where there is confusion there can be no quiet; that body must
needs be torn in pieces where the members draw several ways; that
<hi>Church</hi> into more, where the members of it do what they list, go which
way they please. No keeping rule for peace without keeping order.</p>
            <p>After all these readings the <hi>Vulgar</hi> comes in with an <hi>Exultet.</hi> And
though I can scarce guess how it came to be the interpretntion of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
yet it comes not amiss to tell us that Gods peace does not make dull and
heavy hearts. It makes us merry, it makes us glad, stills all the grudges
that rise within us, all the quarrels that rise without us, every thing that
would disturb our quiet. Nothing so glad, so merry as the soul that dwels
in peace, where peace keeps Court, which is reconciled to God, at odds
with no man, in amity with all: Thus all the Triumphs of the world are
much below the Garlands of Peace; and the Apostle may not only well
say <hi>Moderetur,</hi> let it rule; but <hi>Exultet,</hi> let it triumph, and let us triumph
when it does.</p>
            <p>And now to sum up the severals, that you may know at once what it is
to have peace rule. If the peace of God rule truly in us, it must over-rule
our passions, it must advance our vertues, it must decide our differences, it
must compose our quarrels, it must work us into order, and it must make
us chearful under its commands, in our obedience under it. So it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
if it once be seated where it should be, in our hearts. That's the
place the Apostle would have it exercise its rule and dominion in, the
<hi>fourth</hi> Motion he makes here to us in the behalf of peace. Let <hi>the peace of
God rule in your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And were it once but sincerely there, it would rule our words into a
milder key, our actions into a smoother dress; we should hear no whispers
against the Government of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> no feigned jealousies of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:57113:284"/>
coming in, no talk of, I know not what, <hi>Persecution</hi> coming on, no
canting of sad times at hand, no suggesting of vain fears, no fomenting all
distates, no reviving those wretched Principles and pretences that first
ruin'd all our peace and quiet, no scattering <hi>Libels</hi> and wonders up and
down to amuse the people, so to hinder them from reunion with the
<hi>Church,</hi> and keep them in perpetual discontent for they know not what.
These are not the words of such as seek the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> or heartily
pray for the peace of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> They are not the words of peace (my
Brethren) not the ways of it, nor do they become the Messengers or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the God of peace. To raise needless scruples, to canvase every
word and tittle, to make a noise and puther about every trifle, to flutter
and keep a stir as if we had much to say, to make it out in number where
it wants in weight, to write and scrible over old objections answered
over and over a thousand times, to talk of peace, and thus make ready
for the battle if it must pass for peace, 'tis a peace that passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in another sense than the <hi>Apostle</hi> meant; we cannot conceive it,
we cannot understand it.</p>
            <p>Would we but lay down our interests, our envies, our animosities, our
prejudices, our pride, our humours, the justifying our selves and doings,
the glory we take in a false constancy, that Magisterial conceit we have
of our own judgment, and that <hi>Popularity</hi> that undoes all, were these out
of the heart, peace would be quickly in. But if we stand upon puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's,
and will not pray but in our own words, will not worship God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we may do it in what Form we list our selves, will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quit the <hi>Church</hi> rather than an <hi>humour;</hi> if the Church musick and harmony
must drive all concord and agreement out of doors, if the garments &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of peace and purity affright us, if order scare us, if Uniformity drive
us out of the Church, if kneeling at the Altar and Feast of Peace must go
for a reason to keep us from it, if the very sign of the Cross of Christ, by
which we were reconciled, for by his Cross it was, says the Apostle, must
needs be made an Argument against all reconcilement, 'tis a sign we have
no hearts for peace, our hearts are not at all for it, who may have it at so
easie a rate, upon so handsom terms, and yet thus rudely thrust it from us,
as if we had <hi>sworn</hi> &amp; <hi>covenanted</hi> against it, and all the ways that can lead to
it. Fain would we see some better expressions of it, if it be otherwise. Let's

               </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 4. and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Prov.</hi> xi. 16.
Both senses the word may bear, and the Connexion will bear them too.
And to do both right we will balk neither, we will take both, <hi>Gratiosi</hi> first.
Be we mild and gracious, kind and amiable.</p>
            <p>The Apostle says it fuller in <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. beseeches us to be <hi>tender</hi> and
<hi>compassionate, meek</hi> and <hi>humble, patient</hi> and <hi>long-suffering, forbearing</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi>
These are the best symptomes and expressions of peaces ruling.
The words of peace are smooth and sweet, they are no swords; the looks
of peace are mild and chearful, they are not sower or dogged; the hands
of peace are soft and open, they are not rugged or close, they are easie
and stretched out to all that come in to them. These are the ways of
peace, and the best means to draw it on. To look always austere and
muddy, to carry scorn and superciliousness in the countenance, to be
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:57113:284"/>
unsociable and untractable, to run as far contrary as is possible, to receive
or joyn with none but upon our own conditions, and reject all that look,
and speak, and understand not just as we do our selves, is so far from the
paths of peace, that I shall not stick to call it an open defiance of all the
World. Yet such men there are; &amp; some that add to all, a renunciation of
all the forms, and words, and signs of civility, and make it Religion to be
unmannerly, and sullen. I know not what sense these men can have of
peace, who come not so near as the salutation of it, addresses to it.</p>
            <p>And truly, I have but little to say for them neither, who after so many
condescensions from their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> so great compliances, so long forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
so much forgiveness, so fair a time given them to consider and
come in, and resolve all petty scruples (for there are no other) are not
yet composed for peace; who the more is yielded, the less they are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the more graciously they are dealt with, the more averse and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they are to a reconcilement; the nearer <hi>we</hi> come, the further <hi>they</hi>
fly from us. Only I know I am bound by St. <hi>Paul</hi> here to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to
think and speak as mildly and gently of them as the thing will bear. I
would <hi>they</hi> would do so too.</p>
            <p>Yet methinks if they like not <hi>Gratiosi,</hi> they might do <hi>Grati,</hi> if they like
not to be gracious, they might however to be thankful, thank God, and
thank the <hi>King,</hi> and thank the Church for their graciousness and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the second sense, in that of thankfulness. 'Tis the
last Motion I have to make out of the Apostles, that ye would be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>6. 'Tis a duty Ill assure you that lies upon us. For <hi>it becometh well the just
to be thankful, Psal.</hi> xxxiii. 1. I cannot tell you any thing more becoming.
No not more becoming us in regard of the mercies mentioned in the
<hi>Text,</hi> the Peace of God, and the calling us to it in one body. Each of
them so ample subjects for our thankfulness, that we cannot shew thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
enough for either.</p>
            <p>Peace so great a blessing, that <hi>Nil dulcius audiri, nil delectabilius concupisci,
nil utilius possideri,</hi> as one under St. <hi>Augustines</hi> name expresses it; a blessing
than which there is none more pleasant to be heard, none more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be desired, none more profitable to be possessed.</p>
            <p>And Gods calling us to it in one day, calling us into one Church, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us then, when we were almost out of call, some of us in very remote
parts of the earth, some of us in dark corners at home, some of us in dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
some in dust almost, ready to go down into it, and be covered with
it, calling us all together out of our several graves, as it were, into a new
life, restoring us our <hi>head,</hi> and uniting it to the <hi>members,</hi> is so transcendent
a mercy to us, that we can never be sufficiently thankful.</p>
            <p>Yet that we may be somewhat thankful though, what is it to be
thankful? I shall give you it in brief, (for I cannot be long) and leave
you to enlarge it.</p>
            <p>To be thankful then, is (1.) Humbly and heartily to acknowledge Gods
infinite goodness to us, and our own infinite unworthiness of it. He that
thinks light of peace and unity, that undervalues Gods calling us into
one body, or thinks he did any thing towards it to deserve it, either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not Gods goodness, or is not thankful for it.</p>
            <p>2. To be thankful, is openly and publickly to confess Gods mercies, and
our own engagements; to be telling of them all the day long, to make
Hymns, and Praises, and <hi>Panegyricks</hi> daily for them. I need not be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to tell you 'twas <hi>Davids</hi> business commonly to do so for mercies
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:57113:285"/>
that were <hi>not like</hi> these, or quote the <hi>Psalms</hi> wherein he does. But words
are not all.</p>
            <p>3. To be thankful indeed, is by our deeds to shew it, to present our
selves, and all that is ours henceforward daily to his service; to offer up
our souls and bodies, and what else is ours, as peace offerings, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of thanksgivings; never to fear we can do too much, never to hope
we can do enough for what God has done for us in thus reinstating us in our
Church and our Religion; thus bringing home our <hi>Prince</hi> and our <hi>Peace,</hi> and
that not with thunder and lightning to punish or upbraid us for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sins, not in a storm and tempest to fright us with a mercy, not with
fire and sword to embitter the blessing, but in a calm, with a still voice,
with joy and melody, with no other noise than that of <hi>Hosannahs</hi> and <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiahs.</hi>
Be we therefore thankful unto him, and bless his name for ever
and ever; for ever I say again, for we have no time here limited to do it
in; only be thankful, still be thankful. <hi>For a good thing it is to give thanks
unto the Lord,</hi> Psal. xcii. 1. Yea, <hi>a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful,</hi>
Psal. cxlvii. 1.</p>
            <p>II. Methinks I should need no arguments to you to perswade you to it,
either to thankfulness, or to peace. Yet so many being in the <hi>Text</hi> I must
not be so injurious to you or it to pass them by. Six I find in it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
to peace. Ye are (1.) called, called (2.) to it, ye (3.) are one body,
called (4) into that too, can neither be (5.) <hi>Grati,</hi> nor (6.) <hi>Gratiosi,</hi> can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be thankful, nor appear gracious if ye be not for it, for the Rule of
peace. And to be thankful and gracious you have good reason too; for
your being called, for your peace, for the body you are of, and your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into <hi>that,</hi> to be members of it, are all motives to perswade it.</p>
            <p>The first Argument is your being <hi>called,</hi> and 'tis a good one. To be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
is to be <hi>Christians</hi> in effect. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Adjective from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is so taken,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 6. and the Verb it self in several places may bear it too,
<hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 1. and 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 6. Now to be Christians is to be the Sons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the God of peace, a very good reason, <hi>that,</hi> that the Son
should be like the Father, the Servant be as his Master is. It was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
argument to <hi>Lot</hi> to end all differences. Let there be no strife I pray
thee between me and thee, or between my heardsmen and thy heardsmen,
<hi>for we be brethren, Gen.</hi> xiii 8. It is the same for us but with some advantage.
Let there be no strife between thee and me, for we be Brethren, for we
be Christians. For if the Servants should not disagree when their Masters
are brethren, because they are so, much less should they when they all
have but one Master, and themselves are brethren. The meanest <hi>heards<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
should not by this reason; none of the <hi>People;</hi> but the <hi>chief Shepherds,</hi>
the great Pastors (however) they should think upon their Callings better
than to fall out one with another. <hi>As the Elect of God, dearly beloved,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul, ver.</hi> 12. you must not, you must forbear, you must forgive, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.
'Tis the best way to make your Calling and Election sure, to assure your
selves and the world (after all this) that ye are Christians. All are <hi>not</hi>
that pretend to it. The Servant that fell a beating his fellow-servants
was but an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> I am sure he had his portion given him among them,
St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 49. was cut asunder because he would joyn no better. For
peace and true holiness go together, no holy men (however so called) who
are not peaceable; false and hypocritical only is that holiness that is not
joyn'd with peace, and those Christians no better; call'd so perhaps, but
not in the <hi>Apostles</hi> sense, true Christians indeed. The truly called ones are
all for peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:57113:285"/>
But (2.) they are particularly called to <hi>that.</hi> So the <hi>Apostle, Ye are
called unto peace,</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 15. Why? <hi>Then let every man wherein he is
called therein abide,</hi> ver. 20. even in this sense too, every man stick to his
Calling, for 'tis a <hi>holy one,</hi> 1 Tim. i. 9. we told you so just now, 'tis a
<hi>heavenly one,</hi> Heb. iii. 1. peace dwells for ever there, no jars, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
among the Saints or Angels. And seeing God has thought us
worthy to call us to it, I hope we will bethink our selves and walk
worthy of it. Called I know we are to liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 13. but not to
use it for an occasion to the flesh, but by love to serve one another.
Mark the end of it, else, says the <hi>Apostle,</hi> for if ye bite and devour one
another, take heed ye be not consumed one of another, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Indeed,
ye will; a strong Argument to perswade to peace.</p>
            <p>Yet (3.) we have not only our general Calling, the being Christians,
and our particular designment to it after that, but our Interests pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and private, both to perswade us to it, <hi>We are in one body.</hi> Now
'tis neither for the interest of the body, nor of the members to be at
difference one with another. <hi>If one member suffer, all the members suffer
with it,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 26. And the body cannot be torn or rent but every
Member is concern'd; the least scratch with a nail, or the prick of a
pin, or the touch of a thorn may by the ignorance or cunning, neglect
or ill managing of a heady Chirurgeon be improved into a <hi>Gangrene,</hi>
or a wound that may make the heart ake, and all the members rue
it. We lose our health ere we are aware, and the very neglect of a
little air at a Cranny, or the slighting the pettiest stirring of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
sometimes endangers life and all. There is nothing to keep us
safe but order and peace, to keep the humours quiet, and the several
members in due order. How has the body of Christ, the Church of
God (of which we all are members) by the ill managing of a petty
Controversie, through the negligence or ignorance sometimes of the
Managers, or the slie cunning of an undiscerned or unminded Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or the peevishness of a Party been often thrown into a confusion,
and almost brought to desolation? If we love the Church (and we
pretend it) nay, if we love our selves (and that we commonly do too
much) we must agree together. We cannot hope our houses shall
escape if the City be all on fire at every corner. Or 'tis but a poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when we see <hi>Polyphemus</hi> devour our fellows to think only we shall be
the last. And a vain confidence it is to suppose when a mutiny is once
begun, that we can stop it when we please. Diseases and ill humours
once let loose run insensibly through all the parts, we cannot retrive
them as we list, or fix them when we will. Our very hopes of a
recovery are lost in a moment, we have betrayed our selves by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way to confusion by our own contests, and the whole body
drops into a carkass, and all is gone. If we would but consider our
own bodies, and learn thence from our own senses (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> would
have us in the fore-cited Chapter) we could not be so stupid, so sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to draw on our own ruines by our Divisions. Methinks I cannot
speak more sensibly to all the purposes of Peace, nor you understand
them more feelingly, than by this <hi>Metaphor</hi> of the body and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
Yet the Argument is much advanced by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by our being
called into it, by the favour that God has done us in bringing us into it.</p>
            <p>4. That God has brought us into the Church, made us to be a body
of Christians is a blessing we too seldom think of, yet 'tis a great one,
and a great motive too to be at peace with our own happines, and not
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:57113:286"/>
disturb it. No man would divide his happiness who may enjoy it whole,
much less divide it when he must lose it whole, divide from it and divide
it from himself, least as for the divisions of <hi>Reuben,</hi> Judg. v. 15. so for this
there should come nothing of it but grief of heart.</p>
            <p>Again, (2.) we are called into <hi>one body,</hi> says the <hi>Text,</hi> certainly not to
make it <hi>two,</hi> or tear it asunder into <hi>more;</hi> we are call'd into one, to keep in
one, to love, and live, and die together; this <hi>one</hi> is an argument to hold
unity.</p>
            <p>I may raise a third Argument if I read the words exactly as they are,
without the indulgence of construing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> into <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, read it as we do, <hi>in</hi> one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ye are called, called all at a lump, all in a body at once. However it
was with the <hi>Colossians,</hi> whether called altogether, or by parcels, I am sure
with us it was lately <hi>in uno corpore,</hi> the whole body of the Nation were
called into <hi>one</hi> at <hi>once;</hi> Our happiness came all at a clap, and shot from <hi>East</hi>
to <hi>West,</hi> from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> like lightning in a moment. The Land came
not in by pieces, was not won in, as Lands are, by Conquest, one Town
or Country after another. And will we then now tear off our selves by
pieces into our late Confusions? Who has bewitched us that we should
think to do it?</p>
            <p>If we add for a fourth, as we may do well in a reflexion upon our selves,
that <hi>we</hi> were called, who a little before seem'd cast away, call'd into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
who durst not for many years before appear in any, called into <hi>one,</hi> who
were then scatter'd into many, call'd into one Church, into one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
under one head; <hi>then,</hi> too, when we scarce had any name but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
to be called by, and had made our selves unworthy of any by our
sins; to be then called, and so called as we were, was even a calling us out
of worms and dust, out of nothing to an anticipated Resurrection: And
can we so far forget our selves as to undo our happiness, and divide again?
Have the miseries of our late Dissensions so clearly slipt out of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or are the squadrons and divisions of armed troops so blessed a sight
within our Quarters? If so, God has done us an injury to call us into one,
to cease our wars, and bring home peace and safety to our doors, and we
do as good as tell him so whilst we either run our selves into divisions,
raise them, or continue them. For unthankful, (5.) miserably unthankful,
too, as well as foolish and inconsiderate we must needs be thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn,
to throw away our peace.</p>
            <p>5. And shall we add <hi>unthankfulness</hi> to the bulk of our transgressions? I
trow not. And yet we shall if we oppose the rule of Peace. To be thankful
is to return somewhat answerable to the favour that is received. Now
what more answerable to peace than peace it self, to the peace of God
than peace with our brethren. And he that returns not this, returns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
He can no more have peace with God than love to him whom he
has not seen, if he have not peace with his brother whom he has seen. To
be sure he cannot be thankful that kicks Gods favours back again into
his face, and unmannerly bids him take them again, he cares no for them.
And yet we do no less when we despise and cast away the peace to which
he has call'd us; we say plainly enough it is not worth the having whilst
we do not think it worth the keeping. Nay, and all the blessings of peace,
all Gods calling, and recalling us first and last out of sin, out of misery,
out of confusions and destructions; the very name of Christians, and the
uniting us again under one <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> are certainly no blessings in
our judgments and opinions if we thus wilfully and contemptuously tear
all in pieces rather than peaceably submit to their determinations for
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:57113:286"/>
unity and order, where we have nothing to object, but that they are in
in things indifferent, which is in all mens reason else the greatest reason
we should comply with them. And no man that truly thanks God for
them can do otherwise.</p>
            <p>I am loth to say what I must needs say now in the last place too, that
they must needs be churlish and sullen as well as unthankful, no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Arguments for peace and union will not be perswaded
unto it: For when God, that here calls us unto peace, shall one day call us
to an accompt how gracious and thankful we have been for his calling us
to it, what we have done or not done towards it; consider, I beseech you,
whether you think seriously in your hearts that it will there pass for true
endeavours for peace to answer thus: Lord, we have been all for peace,
and we <hi>petitioned</hi> for it, but we could not have it upon our own conditions;
We would have agreed for a Publick Service, but we could not have it of
our own making; We could well enough have condescended to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
but they would not let <hi>us, that</hi> were the inferiours, set the Rule;
We yet agree in the Articles of the faith, only for indifferencies we kept
still off; We are all saved too, we confess, by the Cross of Christ, but the
very sign of it we thought enough to keep us still asunder; We were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for thy Worship, but we would not be confined to it by any imposed
rule of reverence and order. We could indeed have yet submitted to it our
selves, but we, some of us, had taught the people otherwise, and were
ashamed to unteach them; We might perhaps have easily come in at first,
but now we have so long stood out, that 'tis not for our honour to retreat,
they will call us <hi>Turn-coats</hi> and <hi>Apostates,</hi> and we shall lose the people quite.
Gracious and kind notwithstanding we have been in our deportments, but
'twas only to our own Party; Thankful besides to God, though we kept
not indeed any solemn days of thanksgivings, or as perfunctorily as we
could, we would go no further. In the sum, we have done all we could to
have peace upon our own terms, but we could not obtain it, unless we
would submit to Decency and Order; and so it stands.</p>
            <p>And when our Governours and Superiours, call'd to the same accompt,
shall be content to stand to our own confessions, that they imposed nothing
but things Indifferent for Unity and Order. Think soberly, I beseech you,
on which hand lies the true plea for the endeavour of Peace, where lies
the perverseness, where the compliance. And if this be the business, as I
fear it is too near it, I shall leave the whole World to judge whether peace
truly rule in the hearts of those, who upon their own terms only seek it;
whether they answer their callings, or are thankful.</p>
            <p>I say no more, I have said too much perhaps, yet I wish I had said
enough to make up the peace: I shall only rally up the Apostles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and dismiss you hence however in peace.</p>
            <p>You have heard the Apostles and our motions and motives to peace. And
now if we have any respect to our Christianity, any thoughts of our Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
any love to Unity, any consideration of Gods goodness, any kind of
gratitude for his mercies, or would be gracious in his eyes; let the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christians, the remembrance of our Vocation, the Obligations to
Unity, the endearments of Gods kindness, the reasonableness of gratitude,
the hope of Gods favour, and our endeavour for the common happiness of
the World engage us to peace, to Gods peace, to the Churches. To this we
are call'd. And God that calls us to it, work us to it, work it in our hearts,
and in our practices, by the same power by which we are called into one
body make us of one mind, thorow him who, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="567" facs="tcp:57113:287"/>
               <hi>above</hi> that dares commend it. <hi>Non dicit homo;</hi> No body <hi>beneath</hi> had best to
do it. Or, if he do, this too will be Popery and Innovation, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Popish Clergy: Words as common in the peoples mouths
for all they dislike, as ever <hi>Dicit Dominus</hi> was in the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Well; be it what they will; say man what he please, <hi>Thus saith the
Lord,</hi> and so by Gods blessing will we. Say it, and say it as he says it,
by way of Commendation. <hi>Eò quòd.</hi> Make Obedience the cause of our
speech, of a set Commendation.</p>
            <p>Yet we had best take heed what we do. <hi>Sic dicit Dominus.</hi> His for the
<hi>Rechabites,</hi> that shall guide us: And what is't he commends them
for?</p>
            <p>Because they <hi>Obeyed;</hi> for their <hi>Obedience.</hi> But to whom that? Obeyed
<hi>your Father;</hi> Obedience <hi>to man.</hi> What was he? Your <hi>Father Ionadab,</hi> saith
the Text. What power had he? All. Natural, Civil, Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>siastical. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi>
was the Father of their Family; had (1.) <hi>Ius Patrium,</hi> the power of a
Father over them. He disposed of their kind of living, their Estates, and
Civil affairs; had (2.) <hi>Ius Regium,</hi> the Civil Power over them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
all to a religious course of life, to the freer service of heaven, had
(3.) <hi>Ius Ecclesiasticum,</hi> the spiritual power over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He</hi> hath not more of <hi>Authority</hi> than <hi>They</hi> of <hi>Obedience.</hi> Obedience <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi>
to his command. <hi>Vniversal,</hi> to all. <hi>Punctual,</hi> according to all that
he commanded them. This then is the Obedience that God here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends;
a <hi>Formal,</hi> an <hi>universal,</hi> a <hi>Punctual</hi> obedience to <hi>Natural, Civil,</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Parents.</p>
            <p>Commends them <hi>for,</hi> commends <hi>to</hi> us. Rewards to <hi>them,</hi> will reward to
<hi>us.</hi> Likes them so well upon it, that he loves to look upon them for it;
will not therefore endure them out of his sight; promises to keep them
there for ever; Will do as much for us upon the same performances;
passes his word upon it, <hi>Thus saith the Lord:</hi> Engages his <hi>honour,</hi> as he is
<hi>Lord;</hi> his <hi>power,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord of Hosts;</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> as the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> to
make it good.</p>
            <p>You see the Text in its full dimensions. It will now fall easily into
Parts. Evidently into two:
<list>
                  <item>I. Gods approbation of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> Obedience.</item>
                  <item>II. And his Reward upon it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. In the Approbation you have, (1.) the Form and stile of it, <hi>Thus
saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel.</hi> (2.) The Grounds of it, <hi>Because
you have obeyed,</hi> &amp;c. Obedience commended upon some grounds: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
(1.) from their <hi>Persons, Ye, Rechabites, ye,</hi> your wives and your
children. Because ye have obeyed. (2.) From the <hi>expression of it,</hi> by a
<hi>Threefold Act, Obedistis, Custodistis, Fecistis.</hi> You have <hi>obeyed, kept,</hi> and <hi>done.</hi>
(3.) From a <hi>Threefold Object:</hi> The <hi>Commandment</hi> of their Father, <hi>all</hi> his
<hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>according to</hi> them all. (4.) From the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> whom
they obeyed; <hi>Ionadab their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. In the Reward, First, for their <hi>Triple Obedience</hi> we shall find <hi>a triple
blessing:</hi> (1.) The blessing of a <hi>Posterity</hi> still to succeed them. <hi>Ionadab the
son of Rechab shall not want a man. Non deficiet vir de stirpe Ionadab.</hi> (2.) Of
an <hi>honourable and pious</hi> Posterity. Not want a man <hi>to stand before me:</hi> such
upon whom God will always cast an eye of favour and honour. (3.) Of a
<hi>lasting, everlasting</hi> Posterity. Not want a man <hi>for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, secondly, the Certainty and Assurance of it. <hi>Thus saith the Lord
of Hosts, the God of Israel,</hi> and you may take his word, He will perform
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="568" facs="tcp:57113:288"/>
And because we come not hither only to commend others, but to learn
our selves; and God therefore sets the <hi>Rechabites</hi> obedience upon record,
that we may know what he likes, have a president to follow and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
we will, in the close of every several point of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
examine our own; see how neer or short we come; where if I
chance to say, you have not done so much, pardon me that person all
the way; 'Tis the person in the Text, and I therefore use it. I mean
not you, nor you, none of you, unless your actions apply it. I know
not; If they do, you must forgive me if I strike home. I come not so far
to flatter you: and the times require a sharper Physick.</p>
            <p>Yet if I may perswade you by the Approbation, Example, or Reward
of Obedience in the Text; or the Punishment of disobedience, by the
rule of contraries, implied there, I shall so conclude in full desires, that,
what God here says of the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> he may hereafter say of you, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have obeyed the Commandment of your Father, and kept his Precepts,
and done according to all that he commands; Therefore thus saith the Lord of
Hosts, the God of Israel, you shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You see my Method. I begin with the Approbation. The stile of
it. <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> And that's a good beginning.</p>
            <p>And is it God indeed that speaks for Obedience, who is it then that
speaks against it? What Spirit are they of? They pretend St. <hi>Pauls,
Be ye not the servants of men,</hi> [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 13.] 'Tis true, that: not so <hi>theirs,</hi>
as to forget to be <hi>Christs.</hi> But to remember withal, you are the children
of men; some of whom you must obey as Fathers, if you mean to be
Christs servants. He tells you so, [St. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxii. 21.] <hi>Render to Caesar
the things which are Caesars,</hi> as well as <hi>to God the things which are Gods.</hi> He
puts <hi>Caesar</hi> first too; to shew they talk vainly, who say they serve God,
when they leave out the King. First, thy Father <hi>whom thou hast seen,</hi> then
<hi>God whom thou hast not seen,</hi> is the Apostles rule for us to judge by; and his
is Gods.</p>
            <p>Well then we have God on our side, whoever be against us: Him
speaking for it, and speaking of it: and they are words of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
while he so well likes obedience, that he cannot forbear to speak
of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis no small matter, that, that can command the eye or tongue of the
Princes of the earth: It must be more that even forces a Panegyrick
from the Lord Almighty; something sure worth Commendation.</p>
            <p>Man indeed makes great matters of little or nothing. <hi>God sees not as
man sees.</hi> Man may be deceived, God cannot. He says the <hi>Rechabites</hi> have
obeyed; commends them for it, say who dare against it. And I am afraid
we shall find too many in the upshot, that neither like their obedience,
nor Gods commending them; say all they can against it.</p>
            <p>'Tis no matter what they say: God doth more than say it; says it
with delight; goes with it over and over again; <hi>Obedistis, Custodistis, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistis;</hi>
thrice in a breath; takes notice of every tittle, fills the whole
Chapter, almost every verse with it; loves to speak of it, it so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
him.</p>
            <p>Says it incircled with his glories; talks of it amidst his Hosts; tells
<hi>them,</hi> as it were, of it. For he had told <hi>his Prophet</hi> and <hi>his People</hi> of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Now he even tells it <hi>his Angels;</hi> would have them take notice of it.</p>
            <p>He goes further; almost forsakes his <hi>Israel</hi> to look on them: is now
become the God of the <hi>Rechabites:</hi> They are they that shall now stand
before him for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="569" facs="tcp:57113:288"/>
He goes on still: is so well pleased, that he tells it to themselves;
commends them to their faces: a thing not usual with God, but to the
very chiefest of his Saints and Children. At least then only when he is
most highly pleased with any. <hi>Ye have obeyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Says it not in the form his other speeches go: not <hi>dixit,</hi> but
<hi>dicit,</hi> in the present. Is still saying it; said it then, and says it still: said
it to them, says it to us, that we also might say it after him: Say it in
our actions; that he might have some ground to say of us what he does
of them, <hi>Ye have obeyed.</hi> Which brings me the Parties into sight, whose
Obedience is the ground of all this Approbation. And the first is from
their <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye Rechabites.</hi> Every verse almost tells you it. <hi>They, Kenites,</hi> some say,
descended from <hi>Iethro: Midianites</hi> by original, strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
yet even they obedient to their father, taught to be so by the Law
of nature; commended for that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abulensis</hi> is loth to derive them from so poor beginnings. He makes
them of the Family of <hi>Caleb,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the <hi>royal Tribe;</hi> That
even <hi>Princes</hi> too, as well as people, might know obedience to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sometimes in those commands that seem to divest them of that
honour; But that Obedience is the greatest honour; greatest in such
persons.</p>
            <p>Whether they were such or no, they were the Sons of <hi>Ionadab:</hi> He was
a devout man. <hi>Spontaneus Domini,</hi> says St. <hi>Augustine:</hi> One that would serve
God, though it were for nothing. Some of our age would have told
them, they might have excused them being the seed of the Godly. 'Tis
a part of their Commendation that they thought not so.</p>
            <p>'Tis another, that they excused neither Age, nor Sex. <hi>You:</hi> Who?
We, our Wives, our Sons and our Daughters, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Oh happy Family,
where Obedience is thus taught by Authority, learned from Example,
suck'd from the breasts; where the Wife learns it from the Husband;
hers to him, from him to the Magistrate; the Children from both.</p>
            <p>Time, yet, lifts their virtue higher: Three hundred years had <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
been gathered to his Fathers, while yet his Sons persist in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
with as much constancy as integrity, that we might prescribe no
time against Obedience.</p>
            <p>This then is the sum of that part of Gods commendation from their
<hi>Persons,</hi> that <hi>Rechabites, Princes</hi> by their Tribe; <hi>Holy</hi> by descent; <hi>women
and children, after so many ages past over Ionadab,</hi> neither pleaded their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi>
nor their <hi>honour,</hi> nor their <hi>claim to the Covenant,</hi> nor <hi>their Age,</hi> nor
<hi>their Sex,</hi> nor <hi>the Abrogation of Laws for Antiquity,</hi> but without any contrary
Plea whatsoever generally submitted to all Obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus says God for them.</p>
            <p>What say we for our selves?</p>
            <p>In Civil Affairs, Laws, they say, are Cobwebs. Great men great flies
that easily break through them; mean men little enough to slip out at
any hole; women do what they please; children are not old enough for
any thing, but sin and disobedience.</p>
            <p>In Ecclesiasticals it is worse. Though it be a matter of Reverence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to God himself, Great ones are too good, Others too perverse, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
too tender, Children not of age, All too weakly to bend the knee,
or bare the head in Gods service: so that what was said of <hi>Moses,</hi> that
<hi>God talked with him as man doth with his friend,</hi> I may invert, and say, Man
now talks with God, as man doth with his friend; so fellow-like, that,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:57113:289"/>
though our Fathers had not commanded the contrary, all the world
would say, There is nothing like Reverence or Obedience in this.</p>
            <p>Let me ask now, Had the <hi>Rechabites</hi> the Law of Nature to guide
them, and have not we? Were not they a righteous off-spring as well as
we? Had not they the tenderness of Wives and Children to plead for
weakness of constitution and complexion (greater hinderances to their
strict kind of life) as well as we? Could not they have pleaded antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Laws, as truly we? Yet says God, <hi>You have done all that was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you::</hi> done it, when others have not; not mine own people; he may
add now, not my Christian people. Thus our negligence commends their
Obedience. We that have no more to excuse our selves than they; not
so much, our task being easier, our helps greater, yet we have not, They
have. Let that be an addition to their first Commendation, raised a little
by comparison with us. <hi>You Rechabites;</hi> I may almost say now, <hi>You only</hi> have
obeyed.</p>
            <p>I pass now to the second ground of the Approbation: The Expression
of their Obedience.</p>
            <p>Three Acts there are of it: (1.) <hi>Obedistis.</hi> (2.) <hi>Custodistis.</hi> (3.) <hi>Fecistis.</hi>
you have obeyed, kept, and done what was commanded you. The first
belongs to the <hi>Inward,</hi> the two other to the <hi>outward</hi> man.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>Inward.</hi> For without that, <hi>Outward</hi> Obedience is of
short service, no continuance. Four Acts flow from it. To (1.) Hear;
to (2.) Hearken; to (3.) Submit to; to (4.) Acquiesce in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of our Superiours. All point blank against those Four grounds of
Disobedience, (1.) <hi>Vntractableness,</hi> (2.) <hi>Impatience,</hi> (3.) <hi>Pride,</hi> and (4.) <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</hi>
To <hi>hear,</hi> that against Untractableness, that will not so much as
endure the hearing. To <hi>hearken,</hi> that against Impatience, that will not
take pains to hear it out. To <hi>subm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> that against Pride, that will veil to
none. To <hi>acquiesce</hi> or rest in, that against murmuring, that is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with any thing imposed upon it.</p>
            <p>Let me but ponder the word as I go, I shall find all those, and not go
from the word.</p>
            <p>In all three Languages, the word, whence comes Obedience, comes
from Hearing. <hi>In auditu auris obedivit</hi> is King <hi>Davids, Psal.</hi> xviii. 43. The
first duty God ever requires, <hi>Hear O my people.</hi> The <hi>Rechabites</hi> stumble not
here. They hear their Father speaking even out of his dust. They are
far enough from Untractableness, that hear so easily. <hi>Promptitudo Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi>
that's the first commendation of their Obedience, the Readiness of
it.</p>
            <p>Yet he will give you little that will not give you the hearing. The Son
in the Gospel that did not mean to go, and the Son that meant not to go,
both went thus far, heard their Father: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies more, to attend
and listen with a desire to it. How this is, you may understand out of
<hi>Psal.</hi> xlv. 11. <hi>Hearken, O daughter, and consider:</hi> Hearken first, then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
weigh and ponder the words; then <hi>forget thine own people and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house,</hi> thy kindred and companions, that alliance that uses by a
kind of faction to draw too often from obedience; those private and
mutual interests, that, under a pretence of obedience, beguile us of it.
To hearken then is to assent to, in Gods own phrase, [1 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii. 9.]
to leave all private relations and intentions, out of the meer desire of
Obedience. Thus the <hi>Rechabites</hi> hearkned neither to the tenderness of
their Wives, nor the cries of their Children, nor their own commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and conveniences, to hearken to their Father. This is <hi>Obedientiae
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:57113:289"/>
Patientia,</hi> the Approbation of their Obedience by their Patience.</p>
            <p>This is a ready passage to the next, <hi>To submit</hi> their judgments, affections,
persons, and estates to the will of their Father. 'Tis a hard Theme; and I
had best prove it to be Obedience, before I venture to approve them for it.</p>
            <p>The Latine and Greek words [<hi>to obey</hi>] sound nothing more than <hi>sub,</hi>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all <hi>under; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, subditi estote, subjicimini;</hi> the
soul it self <hi>under;</hi> that submitted. <hi>Let every soul be subject, Rom.</hi> xiii. 1. As
if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had foreseen the distinction, the Body, not the Soul. The Soul,
says he, not the Body alone, and therefore put them in mind of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 1.
As if every body knew it well enough; no, no body were, no body could
be ignorant of it, only want one to remember them. <hi>Put them in mind</hi>
therefore. Wherefore? We may gather something from the Reason he
adds; <hi>For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
divers lusts,</hi> Tit. iii. 3. First, foolish, then disobedient; none else are so,
how wise soever they think themselves. Yea, and deceived; for just it
is that he that will not trust his Superiours judgment (especially, where
his own is as well inferiour as himself) should be deceived by himself, or
those who have no power over him, but to deceive him. And he that
will not obey their will, just it is he should be given up to serve his own
lusts. And so they are, mark it when you will, <hi>nataral brute beasts,</hi> says
St. <hi>Peter.</hi> None more <hi>sensual, proud, devillish,</hi> so St. <hi>Iames</hi> finds them,
[<hi>Iam.</hi> iii. 15.] than those that thus proudly cast off the yoke of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and obedience. Their bodies then and passions scorn to obey
them, who by their own disobedience have taught their inferiour powers
to rebell. 'Tis no wonder then if that follow in the verse, <hi>Living in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
envy, hateful, and hating one another.</hi> I need call nothing else but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
experience of these last tumultuous, rebellious times to witness it,
wherein Tongues, and Pens, and Actions too have so horribly exprest it.</p>
            <p>And give me leave a little to reason with you. Authority us'd to be a
Logical Argument to guide our reason: and have we lost our <hi>Logick</hi> too,
as well as our <hi>Obedience?</hi> The consent of wise, grave, learned Fathers
(till you know where to find better) with any man not too high in his
own conceit, is certainly of a value somewhat above his private imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For, who tells you they are deceived? Your private Minister?
And are you sure he is not; and are they deceived? And is it not as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that you and he should be? Were they not as wise as you? As just as
you? As devout as you? Have you reason, and had not they? Do you
use Scripture, and did not they? Had they interests, and have not you?
That all should be deceived, till you, and your new Ministers came into
the World, is morally impossible. That they should purposely deceive
you, you have nor ground, nor charity to imagine. To think then that
you may not as easily be deceived, does it not look like pride? And is not
Pride enough to blind you from seeing truth? 'Tis true, your Governours
are not infallible, no more are you. Yet certainly there is more certainty
in their united judgments, than your simple fancies. And I am sure many
might with less hazard have erred with them (suppose they erred) than
sometimes gone right. <hi>That</hi> they might at any time in simplicity of heart;
<hi>This</hi> seldom without Faction, Schism, or Pride.</p>
            <p>You mistake me all this while, if you suppose I require a <hi>blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
No, I know God would not be served with a blind sacrifice. His
service is a reasonable service. Clear sighted as you will, but no curious,
inquisitive observance. Know you must, if possibly you can, that it is
not ill you go about, and the Power just that commands it; But to
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:57113:290"/>
enquire into every circumstance, as it is beyond the power of most, so it
is more than the duty of any. 'Tis this creates you so many difficulties,
suspicions, controversies, till you have lost your reward, your Church and
Country the profit of your virtue.</p>
            <p>Were the <hi>judgment</hi> thus once submitted, our <hi>affections</hi> would the sooner
follow: though they indeed are the cause commonly that we submit not
our judgments. Our affections set so strongly upon honours, profits, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
pleasure, make us take up opinions to keep them. Yet Nature will
tell you thus much, <hi>Partem Patria, partem Parentes.</hi> Your King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Church too claim a portion in your affections, persons, and
estates.</p>
            <p>I leave now <hi>de Iure</hi> for <hi>de Facto,</hi> the Justice for the Practise of it: to
shew you all this done by the <hi>Rechabites.</hi> How easily else might they have
vied reason with their Father? What, drink no Wine? <hi>All Creatures are
good; nothing to be refused with thanksgiving?</hi> No Houses neither? Must we
thus be made the talk of the world? Turn heirs to <hi>Cain</hi>'s malediction?
<hi>Vagabonds upon the face of the earth?</hi> Must our Wives and Children too suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all the hardships of a kind of perpetual banishment? No mercy
to be had of our selves, none of them? What, no Lands neither? No
earing, nor harvest? Must we leave our Children beggars, our Wives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
for, purchase nothing for them? Thus, and more they might
have argued; but all these notwithstanding, how harsh soever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, they rather trusted their Fathers judgment than their own.</p>
            <p>But is their <hi>Reason</hi> only submitted, are not their <hi>Affections</hi> too? They
neither contend for honour, nor stickle for riches, nor grudge at any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience;
but submit their desires to their Fathers; tread under their
own natural propensions to obey him. Would he have them drink no
Wine? They will not drink, though the Prophet bid them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Would
he have them poor? They have no Lands. Would he forbid them houses?
They will have no abiding place; be everlasting Pilgrims. What would
he have them do, that they will not do?</p>
            <p>They submit judgments, affections, estates, persons, their own and their
Posterities, as much as in them lies, that they may satisfie their Fathers.
This, if any thing, is <hi>Obedientis summa humilitas,</hi> the exceeding Humility
of their Obedience, with so much approbation so oft reiterated through
the Chapter.</p>
            <p>They go one step higher. Not only <hi>submit to</hi> his Authority, but <hi>resolve
into it.</hi> Make no further Queres upon it, nor murmur at it, but, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
root sometimes signifies, <hi>Acquievistis,</hi> rest fully contented with it.
You may call this <hi>Obedientiae hilaritas;</hi> Their chearful delight in their
Obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus far the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> now again to our selves.</p>
            <p>And, first, have we heard the King, our Father? Have we not rather,
with the deaf Adder, stopped our ears? One with the earth, that's our
profit; the other with our tail, that's our pleasures: That we might not
hear him, charm'd he never so wisely.</p>
            <p>The Fathers of the Church have had less at our hands.</p>
            <p>Next, how have you hearkned? Much that way given. Hearkened to
find fault, to cavil at, to plot against, to undermine. This hath been the
peoples course of late, so to destroy those by whom God would save them.
The Civil Magistrate hath not been in much better case.</p>
            <p>Your Judgments, they have been submitted too. But to whom? To
the factious and discontented decisions (shall I call them, or ravenings
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:57113:290"/>
rather) of ignorant and malicious Teachers; who have exercised more
tyranny upon your consciences, than the most clamorous can prove ever
Bishop did; durst ever accuse him to do: while they thus both belie God,
and abuse you, by exacting an infallible assent to their unreasonable, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
unchristian frenzies, under the name of the Word of God. Thus
while you refuse to submit your judgments, where you are bound, you
captivate your reason to them who have lost their own; and are therefore
angry that others should have any.</p>
            <p>How in the interim you have believed the sincere Declarations of your
Sovereign; how submitted to what he thought best or fittest for you:
How to the intire intentions of your right Spiritual Fathers, let the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
slighting and undervaluing their judgment we hear in every Shop,
as we pass along, testifie for both.</p>
            <p>In a word, how you delight in the Laws and Statutes of State and
Church, and rest contented with them, I would the general practice and
countenance of Disobedience and Prophaneness did not even <hi>tell it in
Gath, and publish it in the streets of Askalon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we serve again to exalt the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> while our sins condemn our
selves. For while <hi>our</hi> untractableness, Impatience, Pride, and Murmurs
banish Obedience, <hi>they</hi> have heard their Father <hi>readily,</hi> hearkened to him
<hi>carefully,</hi> submitted <hi>humbly,</hi> and rested <hi>contentedly</hi> in his sole Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least reluctancy or contradiction.</p>
            <p>And by the way I may point out the reason: They lived temperate,
mean, and humble lives; had no thoughts of raising houses, but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Now, the riots, riches, pride, and a desire of raising Families have
made many of you forget <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to keep <hi>under.</hi> Yet let these men
take heed, lest, while, with <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, they cry out to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron, You take too much upon you,</hi> keep us under, keep us down too
much, they go down with that cursed Crue into the Pit. He that will not
bear this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, keep <hi>under here,</hi> must go <hi>under there;</hi> and better <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> here, <hi>down
here,</hi> than <hi>down for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have now done with the <hi>Inward</hi> virtue of <hi>Obedience.</hi> Now for the
Exercise of it <hi>Outward.</hi> You have obeyed. How shall we know it? As
St. <hi>Iames</hi> of Faith, so we of Obedience. Shew me <hi>that</hi> by thy works. You
have obeyed. Have you kept Statutes then? God is the <hi>Rechabites</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> is their witness, and the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that they have.</p>
            <p>1. Kept them diligently; obeyed them carefully; even watch'd to
keep them: it is the very word that God gives them.</p>
            <p>2. Kept them without intermission, kept them all their days, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. Kept them from violence and misconstruction; added no new senses
of their own: Kept them, that is, broke them not by subtle distinctions,
but <hi>Observantes fecistis,</hi> says <hi>Tremellius;</hi> did it with all observance, and due
honour to them; never seem'd to entrench the least upon them by any
seeming breach, till fleeing from the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> they entred <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> staid
a little till the storm was over, and likely rather pitch'd their Tents there,
any where in the streets, or upon the house tops, as the Israelites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did at the Feast of Tabernacles, then dwelt in houses.</p>
            <p>This kind of keeping Statutes was a doing of them. <hi>Custodistis, Fecistis.</hi>
Not that keeping Statutes which some talk of, when they tell us they
keep Laws, while they are willing to undergo the penalty it demandeth
of them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> certainly was of another mind; <hi>Not only for wrath,</hi> says
he, <hi>but Conscience sake,</hi> Rom. xiii. 4. Makes Obedience a matter of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:57113:291"/>
not of Punishment. Not the Punishment, but Conscience makes up
<hi>that.</hi> And, I believe, these men themselves would think it greater Tyranny
to exact the Penalties, than the Law. <hi>That</hi> the true Obedience then that
doth not keep Laws with the Tongue, but with the Hand. The <hi>doing,</hi> not
the <hi>Talking</hi> of Obedience is the <hi>Rechabites</hi> commendation.</p>
            <p>Yet, had they liv'd by our later distinctions (for now we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with our times) they would have told us they obey'd their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and kept no Precepts; been obedient Sons of the Church, and kept
no Canons; Loyal Subjects, and denied <hi>Caesar</hi>'s due when they list. All
might have been done in spirit; the body and estate saved quite; done
enough, to say they were humble and obedient Subjects. Laws too inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
how we would, to our own ends and purposes. Now this meaning
affixed, now that; turn'd and wrung which way we please. This, you
know, the ordinary practice of the people of the Age.</p>
            <p>But, if this be keeping and doing the commands of our Fathers, it is
beyond the wisdom of man to make such Laws which some senseless di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
cannot elude; and then what becomes of all Obedience? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we see among our own people, we see no such matter among the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites.</hi>
Here again God reproves us, while he approves them, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
simplicity of their obedience.</p>
            <p>We are now next door to see it fully by what they <hi>did;</hi> what they <hi>kept;</hi>
what they <hi>obeyed.</hi> Obeyed <hi>the commandment</hi> of <hi>Ionadab</hi> their Father; kept
his <hi>Precepts;</hi> did according to <hi>all</hi> that he commanded them.</p>
            <p>The first object of their Obedience is <hi>the Commandment of their Father.
His commandment, not their own wills.</hi> It is a usual thing now adays to direct
their Governours, what to do, what to teach, what to command; then,
forsooth, they will obey them. This is not to obey the Fathers command,
but their own wills. And you know how the world went when every one
did his own will, <hi>what seem'd good in his own eyes,</hi> Judg. xvii, xviii, and xix.
Chapt. Parents then could not keep their goods from the fingers of
their own children. <hi>Micah</hi> will steal his mothers money. Men could not
keep themselves from violence, nor their Wives from ravishment, nor
the Levite his. Men could not keep their own Priest; He is taken away
by force. The Priest could not tend his cure; He's fain to wander about,
to seek a place to live in, to play the Idols Chaplain in stead of Gods.
Pray God it prove not so with us. The King cannot keep the Prerogative
of his Crown; <hi>there was no King in Israel.</hi> God cannot keep his own; they
liv'd as if there were no God in <hi>Israel.</hi> This the case where every one
neglects commands, <hi>to do what is good in his own eyes;</hi> either hath or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
no Father to obey but his own arbitrary power. Happy <hi>Rechabites</hi>
that obey command, prescribe not; petition not for commands to their
Father, but obey theirs, for 'tis <hi>Mandato</hi> in the Singular; as if that sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were the rule of their Obedience, the command of their Father.</p>
            <p>Thence 'tis an easie passage to all his precepts. Resign once themselves
to his command, they stick at nothing of his Precepts. Interests prevail no
longer. <hi>Omnia</hi> is good doctrine then: <hi>Obedience universal. Active</hi> in all just
commands; <hi>Passive,</hi> where they are not such. These were just; God would
not else reward them for doing them. Will you see what they were?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>You shall drink no Wine, neither you, nor your Sons for ever,</hi> ver. 6. And it is
not likely their fare was dainty. A hard task, you'l say. Measure it by
what our days would think of it, wherein we so much study our Palats.
How does a little restraint in diet afflict us? What a burthen is it now to
be denied excess?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="575" facs="tcp:57113:291"/>
Were it to be denied us for ever, how would we rather die than admit
it? A few fish-days trouble us above measure: and it shall go for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
rather than not be cried down. How far are we from the sweet
temper of their Obedience?</p>
            <p>2. Their keeping this first command shews that, the next will shew their
courage. <hi>Neither shall ye build houses. The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the
air have nests; but</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ionadab have not where to lay their heads,</hi> but
in a tatter'd Tent. Many conveniences they must needs want there; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
many inconveniences, both in their abode, and in their removal. This
especially be exceeding troublesom to their Wives and Children; subject
in the interim ever and anon to storms and tempests; to be burnt by the
heat of the day, and the frost of the night; full every way of trouble,
uncertainty, and hazard: yet this they are content with too, to shew the
courage of their obedience.</p>
            <p>3. Yet to have neither field, nor vineyard, nor seed, nor harvest, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to delight in; a kind of common want; nothing to leave their
Children, but an hereditary poverty: Thus to give back at no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences;
so cheerfully to cast off any superfluities, so continually to trench
upon necessities, to renounce all the glories which we place in earthly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
only to obey their Father; I now call you to witness who
want nothing of wordly things, whose greatest care it is to digest your
pleasures into order, to enjoy your honours and estates, and to dispose
them; to keep your selves from being oppressed with too many enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether these valiant <hi>Rechabites</hi> may not yet deserve a third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
for <hi>the Constancy of their Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Omnia,</hi> these <hi>all</hi> you see expresly kept. If there were more, some
lighter Precepts, as certainly there were, <hi>All of them</hi> too; 'tis not <hi>Omnia
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c,</hi> but <hi>Omnia</hi> indefinitely; <hi>All whatsoever were commanded them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Obedience is yet compleater; not only <hi>All</hi> the Precepts, but
<hi>Omnino prout,</hi> just according to them. Not all for <hi>Substance</hi> only, but all
for <hi>Circumstance</hi> too. Omitted not a Ceremony. God, as he loves not
blind, so, loves not lame Sacrifices, nor blemished. And if it once be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
for any one to neglect a Ceremony, to dispute an inconvenience,
<hi>perit obedientia;</hi> farewell Obedience. <hi>According to all</hi> was the <hi>Rechabites;</hi>
was good doctrine then; hath been ever since, till these unhappy days.
And they gain'd by the hand Gods Approbation of the <hi>Punctuality</hi> of their
Obedience. They fail'd not in a tittle; no more must we, if we look
either to <hi>Dicit Dominus,</hi> what he <hi>says,</hi> or what he <hi>commends,</hi> And he truly is
commended, not whom men, but whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
            <p>But though God said it, and commended them for it, now we draw it
home, we had best prove it good.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis that, then, which God requires of your <hi>Children</hi> to you: <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
obey your Parents in all things,</hi> Col. iii. 20. Of your <hi>Servants: Servants
obey your Masters in all things,</hi> ver. 22. Of all <hi>Subjects: to every ordinance of man,</hi>
1 Pet. ii. 13.</p>
            <p>Indeed, so it may be, that the Ordinances are not just. If so, then, if the
power be, you have a <hi>Passive</hi> obedience to supply you. Submit willingly
to the <hi>Punishment,</hi> but <hi>do you must not.</hi> All other must be done.</p>
            <p>Yet, I must confess, while we dispute how far our Governours are to be
obey'd, in what, whether God or man, it oft comes to pass we obey neither.
That God must be obeyed, not man when he commands an evil, is too
plain to make a question.</p>
            <p>But this is a true Rule too: Unless you are certain 'tis truly evil you are
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:57113:292"/>
commanded, you ought to obey. If you be only doubtful, I should think
in reason, as you would answer God for doing your uttermost, you should
more rely upon his wisdom, under whose command you are, than on your
own, or any private engaged judgment. Especially, if it seem to carry
any thing that contradicts your private liberty or interests; in which case
we are seldom competent judges.</p>
            <p>If indeed you are fully certain of his ignorance, or general indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all honesty and goodness whom you are to obey, you are not debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from better counsel: but the surest (and that you ought to look to)
is men of the like authority and condition, (at least of no known contrary
resolve, no private, discontented, engaged affections of whose wisdom, and
honesty, and care too of your souls you are as justly confident, as of the
others malice and indiscretion.</p>
            <p>Else I cannot tell you but any other may as well misguide your private
respects, as much mislead both them and you, and you be left with less
excuse. Whereas the condition that God hath set you in, the authority
under which [and in that the gift of Government (for certainly such a
thing there is) which may be excellent sometimes in the worst men] may
plead something for you at your last Accompt.</p>
            <p>You may pretend liberty, but they that <hi>promise you it</hi> by Disobedience
are <hi>themselves the servants of corruption,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 19. You may pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but it will prove Pride. And does it not appear so? For while you
determine that in something you must, in other you may chuse, is it not
as if you thought you only knew what were best? Your Fathers, they,
old doting fools. You pretend wisdom; but every Ordinance, says S <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
is, for no other cause, for that he gives, <hi>ver. 11. to put to silence the
ignorance of foolish men:</hi> They only are against it. And there are, too, that
pretend the Spirit; These are they that go so far upon their own heads,
that at last <hi>they separate themselves:</hi> and what are they for it? <hi>Sensual, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not the Spirit,</hi> says St. <hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 19. Where's now the Spirit you so
much boast of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All</hi> Precepts therefore must be our Rule to walk by. <hi>All,</hi> though harsh
and hard ones. <hi>All;</hi> and more than All sometimes, more than Law will
give them. <hi>Ne offendamus,</hi> is Christs Rule; <hi>lest we should offend them.</hi> Them
and others, too, by teaching them by our example at other times to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> stretcheth it further, <hi>Dicto obedire, Tit.</hi> iii. 1. To obey at a word
speaking: a command by word of mouth, when it is not express Law.
For, when all is done, something will still be left to the interpretation of
the Lawgiver, in the breast of the Judge, to which we must submit.</p>
            <p>We are not yet at the uttermost: <hi>All</hi> is not enough, unless our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be according to all; <hi>Omnino prout,</hi> says <hi>Tremellius:</hi> just as they would
have it to a tittle; in every circumstance.</p>
            <p>You find this requisite in your several Corporations: where the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a punctilio draws after it intolerable defaults. The hedge is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passed through, where but one bush is wound aside; and the breach of
one Circumstance is but the disposition to another. Things that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
seem of no considerable moment within a while appear considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the neglect: As the error that appears not at the first declining
Line of the workman a while after manifests an irrecoverable deformity.
<hi>According to all,</hi> that's the surest Rule to go by. You know it your selves
in your own Corporations: You know it in your own Families, if you
know any thing. <hi>Give an inch, they'l take an ell,</hi> is your own Proverb. And
cannot you judge as equally for the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="577" facs="tcp:57113:292"/>
I am sure not there; where had this Rule been kept, we had never met
these distracted times. But so long have some omitted <hi>this,</hi> some <hi>that,</hi>
that all at last is thought Innovation. One likes not this, another not
that, another not something else; so 'tis come at last they like nothing.
Rubricks and Canons have been so long plaid with to please the people,
or I know not who, that nothing but the ruine of the whole will now
content them. I would we saw it not by the misery of these (however
some call them) truly sad, distressed times.</p>
            <p>Yet take this Caution with you; <hi>Quae praecepit:</hi> Not according to every
humour, what this or that man fancies decent, but according to all that
is <hi>commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Two things there are which have the force of Precepts; Laws
and Customes.</p>
            <p>1. Laws; and they according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> not the equity; that's
for no private power to go by. A Priviledge indeed sometimes for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Law-giver and the Judge.</p>
            <p>2. Customs; that they bind like Laws and Precepts, you all tell us in
your Tenures, in your Lands, in your Corporations. How comes it about
they do not in the Church? I am sure you plead them on all sides strong
enough against it.</p>
            <p>And has the Church none; Or hath it none to plead? Yes, both. It
was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Plea; no meaner mans: <hi>We have no such Custom, nor the
Churches of God,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 16. Many indecencies were then crept into the
Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> about <hi>Prayers,</hi> about <hi>Preaching,</hi> about <hi>Sacraments,</hi> about
<hi>Gestures</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> The Rule that he confutes them by is, They had
<hi>no such,</hi> nor the Churches of God; The contrary then they had: and that
he thought conviction enough for Christians; yea, for the contentious
too. <hi>If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any man be contentious,</hi> will hear no reason, this the way to answer
him.</p>
            <p>'Twas so then; 'tis so still: They, the Apostles, and the Churches of
God, Customs they had, and made this use of them; so may we; Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
we have, and we may plead them.</p>
            <p>Some deriv'd from them; so high: others later, yet of age enough to
speak for themselves. Such as, only directing all into order and beauty,
stood still unquestioned, till of late a subtle prophaneness creeping in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of Law, though obeying none, would fain accuse for ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Tyrannies.</p>
            <p>But let me argue it with this kind of man. May not I as lawfully serve
my God in a reverent posture, as thou in a sawcy and irreverent garb? Is
it Superstition in me to stand, because thou sittest or leanest on thy elbow?
Is it Idolatry in me to kneel, because thou wilt not foul thy clothes, or
vex thy knees? Strange must it needs be, that sitting, leaning, lolling
must be Law and Canon, where no set behaviour is expressed, and my
reverence only be against it; made Innovation which Law never forbad,
Custom has retain'd. When you can bring me Law against my stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bowing, kneeling, which your selves know Custom hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
where uniform order has been kept, I shall either submit, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
Else I must ask by what Law I am bound to sit or lean, and not to
stand, or kneel, or bow? though I urge thee only to Charity and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>This for some reverent Customs, which hadst thou any equal to, for
age or reason in thy Civil Affairs, thou wouldst plead against the Law.
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:57113:293"/>
I here only wish it, where there is nought against them, that they may
stand still, if not under the notion of obedience, yet far enough from
Innovation or Disobedience. And, I believe, in cold bloud it would be
found so,</p>
            <p>Well now: <hi>All,</hi> for the <hi>matter,</hi> though never so hard. <hi>According to</hi> all,
for the <hi>manner,</hi> though never so troublesom and inconvenient; if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by good <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Custom</hi> must be the compass of your Obedience.
<hi>If any man teach otherwise,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Otherwise? Than what? Than
<hi>all honour,</hi> that is, obedience in all things: What then? <hi>He is proud, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing,</hi> how much soever he seems to know, <hi>doting about questions and
strife of words, whence cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmises, perverse dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of men of corrupt minds, destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
You see the times, and you may see the place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>How these rules have been kept amongst you towards the command of
your King and Church, I leave to the scrutiny of your own bosoms: If
you find it otherwise, as surely you will, let it be mended, or get St. <hi>Paul</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter</hi> made <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> and scrape out <hi>Dicit Dominus</hi> here, Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> for observing <hi>all,</hi> for doing <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been so long about our selves, I had almost forgotten them. But
I return, and now enquire upon their last Commendation; <hi>Whom they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Ionadab their Father.</hi> Their <hi>Father</hi> by <hi>nature;</hi> He from whose loyns they
descended. Their <hi>Civil Father</hi> and Prince; He that had power over their
estates; so it appears by his ordering their temporal affairs, their new
kind of Common-wealth. Their <hi>Spiritual Father</hi> by his Decrees dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all for the freer exercise of their Piety and Religion. By command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abstinence from wine, and the delights of sense, to refine their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
for heavenly thoughts; by forbidding them houses, putting
them in mind of better dwellings; by the oft removal of their Tents to
keep them in continual thoughts they had here no abiding City; by a
voluntary resignment of all earthly accommodations to teach them the
contempt of worldly things; a total vacancy to their Religion and
Order.</p>
            <p>So you have them here, lastly, commended for three kinds of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to three kinds of Fathers; their <hi>Natural, Civil, Ecclesiastical</hi> Father,
which is the right directing their Obedience.</p>
            <p>Yet I meet here Three other Commendations from the words, <hi>Your
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That they obeyed their <hi>right</hi> Father; <hi>Your Father.</hi> Sought them out
no new ones, neither in Church nor State. Kept, as you would say, to
their own King, to their own Bishop, their own Priest; wandred not out
of their Diocess, gadded not out of their own Parish, to find one of their
own choosing.</p>
            <p>2. That they acknowledged him for a <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>so used him, with all
honour and respect;</hi> not a word against him for all the difficulties of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</p>
            <p>3. That they obeyed him, <hi>under that name,</hi> because a <hi>Father,</hi> upon no
other ground, though he was but one man. This indeed is that which
formally constitutes Obedience, when we do any thing for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but <hi>because commanded by our Father.</hi> To do it for other ends, for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
equity, or goodness of it may bring it under the title of some other
virtue; This only, because commanded by our Father, makes it Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="579" facs="tcp:57113:293"/>
You have seen the last part of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> Obedience. Shall we see
whether you have any better luck in this than in the rest? Whether you
can here say any thing for your selves, that you have obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of your Father?</p>
            <p>Yet we must see, first, what Fathers we acknowledge: take heed
we are right, lest God answer us as he answered those by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Ye have set up Kings, but not by me. Ye have made Princes, but I knew it not,</hi>
Hos. viii. 4.</p>
            <p>To begin then righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Kings, they are our Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nursing
Fathers.</hi> God hath set them over us, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 15. <hi>Per me Reges.</hi> Made them
Supreme too; 'tis St. <hi>Peters,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. <hi>To the King, as Supreme.</hi> Mark that:
No earthly Power above him; nor Pope, nor People. Be not we fallen
into strange times, in the interim, that God must be driven to recant, and
we learn a new Supermacy? The Kings Preeminence is expresly a part
of your Oath of Allegiance. And <hi>for the Oath of God,</hi> says <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles.
viii. 2. so think of him, so obey him.</p>
            <p>Next to him those <hi>that are sent by him,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter:</hi> of no bodies send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
else, of whose soevers choosing: not so properly Fathers, as hands and
fingers of that great Father, <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi> Those to govern under him, not
above him, so we pray in our <hi>Common Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Magistrate, that is, every Governour of a Country; every
Maior of a City; every Master of a Company; every Father of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
Some of these have their Statutes to be kept; all of them their
commands to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>These are Secular Powers, you have besides Spiritual; such as take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for your Souls, as the other for your Bodies, and Estates, your Bishops
and Clergy.</p>
            <p>Bishops are Fathers by their Title, the Fathers of the Church; so the
first Christians, so all since, till this new unchristian Christianity started
up. Fathers in God, 'tis their stile; however some of late, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi>
would make them Fathers in the Devil, Antichrists: perhaps, that they
might make them like themselves. Strange Antichrists to whom Christ
hath left the Governing of his Church these 1500 years!</p>
            <p>1. If you value them by their <hi>Antiquity,</hi> they are Fathers for that; <hi>their
enemies being judges;</hi> who would fain distinguish between their Offices and
their Names, that they might have some pretence to disobey them;
though more commonly they fill their mouth with scoffs and calumnies,
the language of the Devil, than their books with the language of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
truly understood.</p>
            <p>2. Fathers, secondly, for their <hi>Authority.</hi> Time was when their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
their Councils, and Canons were Laws to Christians; none of the
least neither, when their breach inferred the greatest punishment, <hi>spiritual
malediction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Fathers, lastly, for their tenderest <hi>Care</hi> over the tenderest part, your
Consciences. Such who would quickly set all in order, would you not
listen too engagedly to by-respects. Such whose commands you cannot
complain of, when you have examined them. A hat, a knee, a reverent
posture of the body, are no such tyrannies, as some please to fancy them.
You would do more in a great mans presence, more for a small tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
encouragement. A habit, a Hood, a Cap, a Surplice, a
Name, are wonderful things to trouble a devout Conscience. You
have more Ceremonies in your Companies and Corporations, and
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:57113:294"/>
you observe them strictly. You will find it, if you compare them.</p>
            <p>If thus Fathers now, their Precepts then certainly are to be obeyed.
Yet with this Rule ever both for them and all other inferiour Magistrates
beside; So far as they contradict not the Supreme Authority. 'Tis a rule
in natural reason, <hi>In two contrary commands the Superiours is to be obeyed.</hi> Now,
<hi>to the King as Supreme,</hi> we told you out of St. <hi>Peter, to Rulers as sent by him;</hi>
that is, as far as they are sent by him; no further; no further than their
Commission from him. Else Obedience can find no bounds; nor Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
no rest, if the Supreme be not enough to terminate and guide all
obedience into <hi>Your Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an argument in that word may make you obey him above all
the world besides. The tenderness of a Father. Never could any challenge
this name with greater justice; never any so far condescended to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
to part with his own priviledges, maintenance, conveniences, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
attendance: He hath done as much for his Sons, as the <hi>Rechabites</hi>
for their Father; left all, even his houses for them, lest, by the insolence
of some tumultuous spirits, he should be forced to punish them. What
natural Father like this Father?</p>
            <p>But whether he hath been used like a Father (indeed you used him
lately in your entertainment like a Conqueror, and are justly honoured
for it, but whether by others like a Father) let the affronts at his own
Palace gate, the sawcy Language in every rascal mouth, the rebellious
Sermons, the seditious Libels cast abroad, his own words, where he is fain
to proclaim to the world He is driven from you, let these speak; I say
nothing.</p>
            <p>Your Inferiour Magistrates have almost every where found disrespect.
And whether your Bishops and Clergy have been used like Fathers, if the
usage they have had of late, the tumults about their houses, the riots
upon their Persons, the daily insolencies the whole Clergy have met with
in your streets, never seen till now in a Civil Common-wealth, in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
City upon the most contemptible men, if the injuries done their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the Churches, at the very Altars, once Sanctuaries against vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
now thought the fittest places for it, in the very administration of
the Sacraments, in their Pulpits, both among you and abroad the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
in a word, so many slanderous, malicious accusations without
ground, entertain'd with pleasure, besides the blasphemies upon the whole
Order, if these cannot tell you, after-ages will determine, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
let the world judge.</p>
            <p>Our Fathers imperfections are not to be divulg'd, though true; much
less false ones to be imposed upon them. This is a reverence but due to
Fathers. 'Twas cursedly done of <hi>Cham,</hi> and he paid for it, he and his with
an everlasting curse, to uncover his Fathers nakedness. 'Twas wretchedly
done of <hi>Absalom</hi> to tell the people there was no man deputed of the
King to hear them, no justice in the Land; and he thrived according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And <hi>let all the enemies of my Lord the King be as that young man is,</hi> says
<hi>Cushi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet say we, 'twere well it were no worse. How is all this made
Religion too? Oaths and Protestations (intended certainly to better
purposes) abused to maintain rebellion and prophaneness. Construed so
in Pulpits, and professed by their Scholars in the face of God and
man; pray God it go no higher: and dare you after all this look for a
blessing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:57113:294"/>
Alas! you must lay by those thoughts till you have learned the <hi>Recha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi>
Lesson. They used their <hi>Ionadab</hi> like a Father; so reverenced his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
so preserved his name, so obeyed him in all his several authorities,
so punctually, so constantly, so couragiously, so sweetly, so universally, so
sincerely, so really, so carefully, with that contentedness without grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
that humility without disputing, that patience, that readiness, that
full content of every Age, Sex, and Condition, no weakness, tenderness,
or priviledges pretended against it, that God himself presently upon it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
a full reward. <hi>Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of
Israel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am now at the Reward; and 'tis a full one; full of (1.) honour, full
of (2.) proportions, full of (3.) blessings.</p>
            <p>Full of (1.) honour at the first; <hi>Therefore, thus</hi>—as if their Obedience
deserved it, or God at least would seem so far to honour it. He had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
length of life, in the Commandment, for it: and God is not unjust.
It deserves therefore by the Covenant of his Promise, yet by the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his mercy.</p>
            <p>And (2.) full of proportions it is. Proportionable to the <hi>three</hi> Acts and
Objects of Obedience. You have obeyed your Father; therefore you
shall want no Sons; there's one. You have kept his commandments;
therefore shall your Sons stand in them, and by standing in them, stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; there's a second. You have kept all, and done according to all,
that hath been commanded you, fail'd in nothing; therefore shall you
have a reward, all of you; not a man of you fail for ever. This last, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
is beyond proportion; eternity for time; all blessings for a few Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
the wine of Angels, for abstinence from the bloud of the Vine; for
want of houses upon earth, eternal dwellings in the heavens.</p>
            <p>You see the Reward is full of blessings. I shall observe their triple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in running over them.</p>
            <p>1. Such then, first, is the Reward of their Obedience, that it lengthens
days. The world thinks it shortens them, if by it you take away any thing
from your flesh, bate any thing of your diet, either in quantity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
when the King or Church commands to do so. 'Twas not so here; and
without doubt it is not. Obedience hath the promise of length of days,
in the Commandment. 'Twas the reason that <hi>Ionadab</hi> gave his Sons to
obey him, <hi>ver. 7. That you may live many days.</hi> It was a blessing of long days
upon themselves. That's the First.</p>
            <p>But it ends not so. Upon their children too; reaches to them, is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of succession. This is to live beyond our selves, to sprout afresh out of
the dust, to have posterity.</p>
            <p>And a Posterity that shall not fail, wither, or crumble away, that's more.</p>
            <p>If it be a male succession, 'tis more still. <hi>Non deficiet vir;</hi> not a man fail
you. Female generations lose the name; and so the succession fails even
while it lasts.</p>
            <p>It does almost so, when it passeth into a collateral line. This fails not
that way neither. Not <hi>vir de stirpe;</hi> it continues in a direct line from the
root.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tremellius</hi>'s Translation sets it higher. <hi>Non exscindetur vir.</hi> Of all this
Progeny there shall not so much as a man be cut off. Die they must by the
necessity of nature: but not a man cut off by violence: that, however it
far'd with the captive Jews in <hi>Babylon,</hi> not any of these should fail there,
but return to their Tents in peace; that a fair and even succession it
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:57113:295"/>
should be, that after many days pass on calmly and quietly to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tombs; in peace gathered to their Fathers.</p>
            <p>'Tis well this; such a blessing upon Posterity. But when not only suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
generations participate the blessing, but <hi>Ionadab</hi> and his Father
<hi>Rechab</hi> too, passed Ancestors receive a new accession of glory by it, this is
a blessing not upon the Sons only, but upon deceased Fathers too. And all
this you may look for upon the like obedience. A long life, a lasting, a
continued, a male, a lineal, an unblemish'd Posterity; all redounding back
again to your own glory. This the first proportion; that which is given
for your Obedience to your Father.</p>
            <p>2. The second is greater, <hi>stans in conspectu;</hi> a Posterity high enough to be
seen, placed in the eye of the world: men famous and renowned in their
Generations. This is but to stand on high before the Kings and Princes of
the earth. <hi>In conspectu meo</hi> is higher: that stands before God; a Posterity as
virtuous as honourable.</p>
            <p>Stand before him; and in place near him: near his Sanctuary, the place
of his presence; plac'd there, so it seems, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> ii. 5.</p>
            <p>Placed on high, and near him; as near as the title of Gods can make
them: made Judges of the earth; so <hi>stare in conspectu</hi> is sometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.
This is a second proportion answering to their obedience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
They shall be Commanders. Under command they kept, now
they are above it; above the people, equal with the Princes of the
earth. A famous, a pious, an honourable Posterity, the second reward of
Obedience.</p>
            <p>3. All this is much, exceeding much. Yet honour and virtue are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
things; and therefore mutable, may fail at last: Theirs shall not.
<hi>Stans in conspectu.</hi> In honour they shall be, and in honour they shall stand.
In virtue they shall be, and in virtue they shall stand; standing is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of continuance.</p>
            <p>Stand; and stand in his sight, dear as the apple of his eye. That must
not be touched; no more must they: and then nothing can change them
to be sure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cunctis diebus</hi> puts all out of question. They shall stand so all their days,
says the Text. What speak I of days? Stand so for ever; continue ever;
Christians succeed into their order and obedience; they survive into
Christians; live in them for ever.</p>
            <p>When succession shall have done, successive motions have their peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods,
and all days shall have an end, yet then <hi>Ionadab</hi> shall not want a man
to stand then before him, and see his face for ever. This is indeed the last
Reward, a firm, a perpetual, an eternal succession.</p>
            <p>And now we are come up to the tops of the Mountains, the
everlasting hills. Eternity is a Circle; and there we wind about in
everlasting rounds. There we turn about to the beginning of the
verse, the Lord speaking and confirming all; that so the certainty may
embrace with the eternity. That you may see I tell you no more
than God himself will make good, <hi>Thus saith the Lords of Hosts, the God of
Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath promised it, and shall he not bring it to pass? He has said
it, and shall it not be done? Said it by his Prophet: and Prophesie,
though it sometime wants light, yet never certainty. He engageth
his <hi>honour,</hi> Thus saith <hi>the Lord:</hi> Kings will not fail upon the word of their
honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="583" facs="tcp:57113:295"/>
He engageth his <hi>power, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts;</hi> he that doth what
he will in heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>He engageth his goodness, his tried, experienced goodness. <hi>Thus saith
the God of Israel;</hi> their God, who can witness he never broke his promise,
nor fail'd his word.</p>
            <p>But doth God take care only for the <hi>Rechabites?</hi> Or says he it for
your sake too? For yours also, doubtless; 'tis the Reward of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
where ere it is found, as it is in the Text. Will you give me leave
to enquire?</p>
            <p>Has the King at any time commanded some of your superfluities, and
has he obtain'd them? have you been content to part with any of your
delights, in diet, apparel, in your houses, to endure some abridgments to
obey him, to supply him?</p>
            <p>Have the Inferiour Magistrates demanded the execution of the Laws,
and have you assisted them?</p>
            <p>Has the Church required your presence, your order and assistance (for
I speak not now of your private Fathers) and can you say with these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites,
we have obeyed and kept all their Precepts, and done according to all that
hath been commanded us?</hi> Then, and not till then, dare I warrant you, <hi>You
and your seed shall stand before him for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is not a Reward only to private and personal obedience, but the
obedience of Cities, of Nations, too. Obedient Cities and Kingdoms as
well as Families shall not want men to stand before him for ever; but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
and rebellious shall.</p>
            <p>For Kingdoms, Cities, and Countries have their fates; and, when they
have rent this bond of union, that kept them to their head, they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
their Funerals. You then to look to it. Remember that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>How is the faithful City become a harlot?</hi> Isa. i. 21. <hi>Et quàm facta est desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta?</hi>
How is she become desolate? Remember that; What becomes of her
for it?</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Rechabites</hi> obedience, and Gods <hi>dicit</hi> to it. I come
nearer home! and I cannot tell you but I must change my phrase into
<hi>dicit homo;</hi> Men talk abroad there's no such matter here.</p>
            <p>If it be otherwise, you have the better on't. And I shall say no more than
what <hi>Iotham, Iudg.</hi> ix. 19, 20. to the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> when they had made
<hi>Abimelech</hi> King. <hi>If you have then dealt truly and sincerly with</hi> Jerubbaal, <hi>and
with his house this day; then rejoyce you in</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and let him rejoyce in you:
But if not, let fire come out from</hi> Abimelech, <hi>and devour the men of</hi> Shechem,
<hi>and the house of</hi> Millo; <hi>and let fire come out from the men of</hi> Shechem, <hi>and the
house of</hi> Millo, <hi>and devour</hi> Abimelech. I will not say so much with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation;
but thus, If you have now dealt truly and sincerely with King
and Church, in setting up your own profits, priviledges, and humours to
reign over you, by preferring them before their Precepts, then rejoyce
you in them, and may they prosper with you. But, if not, fire will come
out of them, those very Priviledges and profits, and devour you; and fire
will come out from you to devour and ruine them, as sure as you thought
once to be happy by them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, and I think I may justly quit some of you before God and
man; say for you, <hi>You have obeyed:</hi> but as it is enough for the whole man to
be thought guilty, when only one part sins, so it is enough for a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon a Kingdom, that there be among us those, though hands and
feet, that disobey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="584" facs="tcp:57113:296"/>
Though make no doubt of it you who have obeyed, but however the
world look on you (as certainly it looks but scurvily upon such) God
from above will one day see it and reward it, give you the blessing of the
Text. His word is past; go on and believe <hi>there shall not want a man of your
seed to stand before him for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are not all then of the same practices. I shall but mind you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of my Text in a double sense; as it implies the punishment of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
as it expresses the reward of obedience; and I have done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rechabites</hi> that obeyed shall want no length of days, no posterity,
nor they no heavenly grace or honour: You will thence infer, They that
do not shall want all.</p>
            <p>And have they not so in all generations? What got <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
by withstanding <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>non precedent ultra;</hi> they should proceed no
further, neither in their Projects, nor in their Posterity? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 8.
What got <hi>Korah</hi> and his company by rising up against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but
a death that amazes us to read of? <hi>They, and their wives, and their children
went down quick into hell.</hi> The grave was not low enough, nor could they
die soon enough to receive their punishment. What got <hi>Absalom</hi> by his
rebellion, but an ignominious cruel death in the heat and fervor of his
sin, and no Posterity to survive him? What got <hi>the Ten Tribes</hi> by their
discession in matter of Taxes, but the loss of their Religion and their
God; a perpetual successive Idolatry, and a thousand calamities? No
<hi>in conspectu meo</hi> left them, <hi>that,</hi> Gods presence taken from them for ever.
Lastly, What got <hi>Iudas</hi> that rose in the days of the Tribute (all upon fair
pretences, you see, with the people) but <hi>Ipse periit, &amp; omnes dispersi;</hi> he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
the rest made rogues and runnagates upon the face of the earth?</p>
            <p>And can we after all this look for better success either in Church or
State, when we rise up against them both? Any thing but an utter deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?
Lay it home: <hi>Non deficiet</hi> in the Text will prove <hi>deficiet</hi> here; nor
Posterity, nor Honour, nor Government, nor Religion continue with you.</p>
            <p>The very setting light by our Superiours has brought a doom somewhat
like it. <hi>Michol</hi> scoffing at King <hi>David</hi> had no child for ever, lost <hi>vir de
stirpe.</hi> The little Children, that did but taunt the Prophet as he passed
by, were at <hi>deficiet</hi> streight in their childhood, could go no farther. The
very savage Bears out of the wilderness rebuked the incivility of the
children. If children found so sharp a punishment, what may men expect?
In a word, God, the God of mercies, who holds out beyond our hopes or
thoughts, could hold out no longer, when they came once to <hi>despise his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
2 Chron. xxxvi. 16.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you too: You shall find it home in your own bosoms, be
paid in kind, in your children and servants. For with what face can you
expect obedience from your children, who disobey by your example? How
can you but expect rebellion from them, who see you in all your actions
resolute to disobey? Where should they learn it? From your example?
Alas! they cannot: You obey nor spiritual nor temporal Fathers. From
your words? They will not; because your actions contradict them. From
Gods commandments? Why do not you? Thus while you study by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
practices to stand, you and yours fall down for ever.</p>
            <p>But I dwell too long upon so harsh a Theme. I shall lead you to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by sweeter thoughts, by <hi>Example,</hi> by <hi>Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Example:</hi> shall these <hi>Rechabites,</hi> their wives and children give aside
at no inconvenience, and must we <hi>Christians</hi> startle at every thing, that is
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:57113:296"/>
not just as we would have it? Shall they hear, and hearken, and submit,
and rest upon their Fathers will, and must we alway prefer our own, scarce
read or mind a command which we first prescribe not? Shall they fail in
nothing, not a circumstance, do according unto all? And are not we
ashamed to question all so long till we do nothing? I appeal to your selves.
Would you be so used in your own houses? Have your commands dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
questioned, denied, done by parts and pieces, by your children and
servants? With what conscience then can you deal so with your Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours?
<hi>Do as you would be done by,</hi> is the Law of <hi>Nature.</hi> Out of this only
Principle 'tis probable the <hi>Rechabites</hi> at first obeyed, in one man, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Spiritual, Temporal Authority: and does our <hi>Christianity</hi> serve us to
no better use than to contemn them?</p>
            <p>If <hi>Example</hi> will not, will <hi>Reward</hi> prevail? 'Tis a Reward to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by God. But he rewards us not with words. What would you
have?</p>
            <p>Your City, your Companies, your own Families cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obedience; and can you desire it of others, when you will not pay it
your selves? This the way to keep your City from destruction. You la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for succession; this is Gods way to obtain it. You travel for Lands
and riches; this is his means to gain and keep them. You desire honours;
thus you may have for you and your Posterities. You strive for Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;
they are surest obtain'd and held by Obedience. You endeavour
all for perpetuities; here you may find all for ever. You study to make all
as sure as you can; Gods Promise is the best assurance: and here it is:
Do what he here commands, and you shall not fear what man can do unto
you: <hi>The Lord of Hosts is on your side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Else I cannot but tell you, All may fail you. The wine and delicates
you eat and drink; the houses and stately Palaces you Lord it in; the
Lands and Possessions, the Riches, State and Pomp you have to this day
triumphed in; your Wives and Children; all, you think so everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to enjoy by rising up so much to defend them, may in a moment va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and your high flown thoughts die before you. You have no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from heaven so to settle your estates and fortunes; no <hi>Dicit
Dominus</hi> for that. This is only Gods way for thriving, by Obedience.</p>
            <p>Nay, and the Religion, you so much seem to contend for, against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
by the greatest Innovations in Church and State, tumults,
riots, and prophanest usages, that also will for ever fail you. You want
men to stand before God for ever; and instead of them find men to
stand before you; <hi>Micah's</hi> Levites; do what seems good in your sight
not in Gods; so stand before you, as to hinder you from standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; stand in your sight, and blind you from seeing the right way
to heaven. Thus you will want your old honours profits, liberties, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
all.</p>
            <p>But, if you will return, and hear, and hearken, and submit to your
ancient Fathers, your King and Church, your Magistrates, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
observe, and keep, and do your ancient Laws and Customs, I dare
warrant you, what God promises to the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> he shall perform to
you.</p>
            <p>Your City shall flourish, your places be renowned, your Liberties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
your persons rise up in honour, your estates prosper, your affairs
succeed, your children be famous, your Posterity happy, your Religion
display the glories of her first primitive purity, and all go on successfully
for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:57113:297"/>
And when <hi>this Ever</hi> shall have swallowed up the days of time, you
shall <hi>stand</hi> still, immovable, immortal, glorious before him, in whose sight
is the fulness of joy, where you shall one day meet your Children, and
stand all together: Kings and Subjects, Priests and People, Fathers and
Children, before your heavenly Father; see him face to face in the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
vision for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>To which He bring us through his eternal Son, who was obedient
unto death to teach us obedience of life unto life, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to which
Two Persons, with the Holy Ghost, be all Praise, and Glory, Obedience,
and Worship for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
