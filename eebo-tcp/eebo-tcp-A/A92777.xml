         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed the Right Honorable the <hi>Lord Major</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London, once and again</hi> to write unto the <hi>Miniſters</hi> thereof reſpectively, in a very pious and pathetical manner. Not only to bewail the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the <hi>Lords day, the Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> and to ſignifie what he hath done by way of <hi>Precept;</hi> but alſo <hi>to promiſe what ever the power of his place may do for the ſtrengthening of their hands;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to deſire <hi>all and every particular Miniſter in the City, as they tender the honour of Chriſt, and the good of peoples ſouls, and welfare of the City,</hi> yea and <hi>earneſtly in the name of God to intreat</hi> (as in the ſaid Letters appeareth more fully,) that they the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> preſs the duty of Sanctifying <hi>that holy day,</hi> ſhew the danger of prophaning of it, and perſwade not only to <hi>publike worſhip,</hi> but alſo to retire in private families to ſuch holy duties as the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth.</p>
            <p>We who are ſome of thoſe to whom the foreſaid Letters were directed, have therefore accordingly indeavoured ſomething heretofore in order to the deſired end, but of late more ſeriouſly in our <hi>Provincial Aſſembly</hi> (where through <hi>Gods mercy</hi> we have opportunity to confer about matters of <hi>Religion)</hi> we have weighed thoſe foreſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and laboured mutually to have our hearts affected (as in the ſight of <hi>God)</hi> with the contents thereof. And as we bleſs <hi>God</hi> unfainedly for ſtirring up the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to minde the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and quicken us in our duty about it, (the rather becauſe in theſe times many are of <hi>Gallio's</hi> temper <hi>careleſs of ſuch matters.)</hi> So we the <hi>Miniſters</hi> there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Elders,</hi> have conſulted among our ſelves, wherein, and how we might be moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great Shepherd of the ſheep,</hi> in decrying <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> and in furthering the true Sanctification of that <hi>holy reſt,</hi> both in <hi>publike and private,</hi> throughout all the <hi>Congregations</hi> and <hi>families</hi> within the ſaid <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Liberties</hi> thereof, and the bounds of the <hi>Province.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe the <hi>Delegates</hi> there aſſembling are but few of many <hi>Miniſters</hi> within the <hi>City,</hi> we judged it neceſſary by writing to ſtir up our ſelves and the reſt of our <hi>Brethren and fellow-labourers in the work of the Lord,</hi> that <hi>as one man with one ſhoulder</hi> we may apply our ſelves to procure <hi>in the firſt place</hi> the ſanctifying of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as the fountaine and foundation of a more perfect <hi>Reformation</hi> in all other things appertaining to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that end we make it our requeſt unto all our <hi>dear Brethren</hi> &amp; to <hi>your ſelf</hi> in particular, that upon and after as you ſee occaſion, you chooſe ſome pertinent <hi>Scripture</hi> to open and apply for inſtruction of your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers about the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that all duties belonging to it may be inforced, and all Errors in judgment, and ſinful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whereby it is polluted, may be diſcovered, confuted and reproved.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there are divers <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in force for the better ſanctification of <hi>that day,</hi> we deſire alſo that every <hi>Officer</hi> may be ſtirred up to act conſcientiouſly and vigorouſly according to the duty of his place, as is in them preſcribed.</p>
            <p>And what, <hi>though we be poor and deſpiſed, yet we may not forget Gods Law.</hi> We fear a great part of our <hi>trouble</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from hence, that we are not ſufficiently <hi>zealous</hi> for that <hi>reſt.</hi> If we can vindicate the <hi>Lords day, His holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> will ſoon regain their credit. The Calling of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> will not die, if conſcience of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> do revive. But if that <hi>fall,</hi> which of us, or what <hi>Ordinance of God</hi> ſhall be able to ſtand?</p>
            <p>It ſhould be no ſmall incouragement unto us that <hi>God</hi> hath prepared the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> heart to accompany us in our deſires and indeavours this way. And that we have <hi>ſo ſolemn an Ingagement</hi> as his promiſe in writing to every one of us particularly, that he will uſe <hi>all the power of his place</hi> to preſſe and carry on this work, untill it come unto <hi>perfection.</hi> We want not many other, yea ſtronger and more ſacred grounds and reaſons, to inforce theſe duties upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, yet His incouragements, zeale and forwardneſs ſhould provoke us, as the like in <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Nehemia</hi> did among the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites. God</hi> threatens Sabbaths of deſolation, <hi>the Land</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall enjoy her reſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe it reſted not in the dayes and yeers which He had ſet apart; This in ſome proportion hath been verified in moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> which bear the name of <hi>Reformed.</hi> To <hi>England</hi> we may ſay, conſidering the ſtate of other places, <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear. Repent and do thy firſt works. Yea let thy laſt be better then thy firſt, leſt God remove thy Can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dleſtick.</hi> We ſpeak not this as if we needed to put words into our <hi>Brethrens</hi> mouths, but <hi>to ſtir up their pure minds</hi> and to teſtifie how ſincerely we deſire to ſympathize with all thoſe who minde <hi>the things of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Which we deſire ſo much the more to love, and look after, as they are hated or neglected by others We forbear to preſs <hi>arguments</hi> from the duty of <hi>your calling,</hi> becauſe of your ſelfe, we hope you are ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thereof. The <hi>good Lord</hi> proſper all your labour <hi>in the Lord,</hi> to whoſe bleſſing we commend you.</p>
