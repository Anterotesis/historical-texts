            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In thoſe following Lines I am more Tart to none then to my ſelf: And therefore I may be excuſed if I tell in Rhime how
<pb facs="tcp:62918:3"/>
ſome uſed me in Proſe; I ſpeak truth which is expedient to be known, and therefore no Lawyer will aver I tranſgreſs the Law.</p>
                  <p>With all the world beſide, I am like a blind man, dealing blows, not knowing whom I hit; If any ſhall challenge me that I touch them, I will anſwer, that I knew not ſo much before they informed me, as anſwered that famous Satyriſt to a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who expoſtulated with him for ſmiting him in a Poem.</p>
                  <p>I am many wayes wronged: And firſt, by Tranſcribers, who ſtealing Copies of my Lines, have tranſmitted them every where, like Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures on the wrong ſide of <hi>Arras</hi> Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſpoiled with Thrumbs and Threeds, or like Faces disfigured by the Pox, great or ſmall, as ye pleaſe: Or like Sermons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by Children and Serving Laſſes in a Presbyterian Family-Exerciſe, Or like-one of Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> Sermons re-preached the other day by an Expectant, in his Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Trial for the Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62918:3"/>
I am, Secondly, wronged by falſe Copies, and that by men either malicious to bring me to trouble, or ignorant, not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my ſcope, who in ſtead of mending my Lines, have marred then all. And who ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to pull me out of the Mire, hath thrown me into the Well, not to waſh me, but to drown me: Or into the Fire, not to dry me, but to burn me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I am moſt of all prejudged by the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War, which occaſioned the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of ſuch ſuperfluity of Brandie, which entering the brain of ſome of the worſhippers of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> hath there hatched Gloſſes of my Lines, like that of <hi>Orleance,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Brandy-Interpreters may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Children eſpying ſhapes and figures in the fire; Or to thoſe who are giddie with drink, imagining apparitions in the Clouds; or to old Wives Commenting on <hi>Merlins</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:62918:4"/>
                     <hi>Rymers</hi> Propheſies; Or to bad Divine expounding the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who obtrud groundleſs fancies upon the ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude, for Evangelical truths.</p>
                  <p>If thoſe Gentlemen hit my meaning, any cenſure is too little for me; If not, no puniſhment is too great for them: And that for two reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they apply Paſſages of my Lines to men of honour, of whom (God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs) I did not dream. Secondly, becauſe they make the World believe I am biting thoſe whoſe wounds I am licking, given by the biting of other Dogs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, it is eaſie to an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer all which is objected againſt me. And firſt, ſome of the Society of <hi>Gotham</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had an intention to burn my Lines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I bring in Whiggs ſpeaking too boldly in the Supplication, and elſe where. But I anſwer, If thoſe Gentlemen ſpeak as they
<pb facs="tcp:62918:4"/>
think, I commend their zeal, but not their wiſdome; And who ever ſhall take the pains to burn them for Witches, will loſe both Coals and labour. I demand of them, if one ſhould pen a Play of the Powder-plot, and bring in the Conſpirators, exhorting each other to blow up the Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, who will tax the Author of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? or who will tax the Pſalmiſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſm, for averring, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his Heart, There is not a God?</hi> All not meer ignorants know it is permitted to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, good or bad, to perſonate a diſcourſe, that is, to bring in Rebels ſpeaking Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Athieſts Blaſphemy; And why may not I, a Poetaſter, or Poets Ape, bring in fools ſpeaking fooliſhly, and wiſe men wiſely, and yet be neither a wiſe man nor a fool my ſelf? And if I be neither, I muſt either be a mix'd man, or elſe nothing. And in effect ſome call me a mix'd man, others
<pb facs="tcp:62918:5"/>
nothing: But ſince thoſe who call me no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing are highly offended at me, they muſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of neceſſity confeſs they are offended at no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing: I am more charitable to them, I think they are ſomething. What ſort of thing it is, all the world knoweth, what ever it be it is worſe then nothing.</p>
                  <p>They object, Sccondly, that without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority I have impoſed a grievous Taxation upon the Liedges, in exacting five Dollors for every Copy, which may be called treaſon.</p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, ſince I charge them not with Horning to make payment, the worſt they can call it is but begging, which it is not, but a nameleſs Contract, <hi>Do ut des.</hi> And at firſt I did not dream of taking Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for thoſe Lines, until ſome known bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies to the Presbyterians enforced each of them five Dollors on me for a Copy: they told me, I might as well take Money for Rhime, as Miniſters and Lawyers for
<pb facs="tcp:62918:5"/>
Proſe, and Phyſicians for nothing, and worſe then nothing; Some Pleading, Preaching, and Curing (it is true) deſerves Money a great deal better then my Lines: But it is as true, that ſome of all three deſerves it worſe; If my Lines do no good, they do no hurt to the Souls, Bodies, or Eſtates of any.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I demand Money of no Man, yea, I refuſe it when it is offered, not in jeſt, until they make it appear they offer it in earneſt, which they do many wayes; ſome throw Money on the ground, ſome on the Table; Some tell they'l have none of my Lines, except I take their Money; Some ſay I undervalue them, when I refuſe their Money; Some ſay, they are abler to give me Money, then I am to want it; ſome bid Devil break their neck if I take not their Money: Some bid God damn them if I take not their Money: yea, I can inſtruct, that a Sea-Captain offered to ſtrike off my
<pb facs="tcp:62918:6"/>
head with a Shable, If I reſus'd his Money: but the more moderat put Money unaworſe in the Pocket of my Coat, which many think I keep unbuttoned of purpoſe. Miſtake me not, <hi>Reader,</hi> I am not inſtructing how Money ſhould be offered, but how it ſhould not be offered, leſt I take it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that I am not avaricious, appears by my vowing to take no Money from <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Ladies,</hi> but they ſay I take Gold. But I anſwer, they cluded my vow by equivocation, putting Gold unaworſe in the neck of my Doublet, and then run away, and I following to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, ſtumbled. They inſtance I ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of purpoſe that I might not reach them: But they are ſtill miſtaken, for a Lady having uſed me ſo, I followed her to her Chamber, and when I endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her Gold to her pocket, her Maid (miſtaking my meaning) thinking perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:62918:6"/>
I was ſearching for the wrong Pocket, tax'd me of incivility; So I was neceſſitate either to keep her Gold, or elſe be thought uncivil to a Lady: let any indifferent man judge which was the leaſt of the two evils. However, <hi>Reader,</hi> tempt me not with Gold, except thou be in earneſt. It dazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the eyes of the wiſe, and therefore no marvel it blind thoſe of a fool.</p>
                  <p>The third Objection againſt me is, that ſome affirm I am a bad Poet. But I anſwer, that nothing can more offend a Poet and a Fidler, then telling them they want skill: If in effect they be unskilful, as I am; And therefore no marvel if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in a fury that it is moſt true that I am a bad Poet, and yet they are notorious liars in avering it, becauſe they do ſo out of malice, not knowing whether they ſpeak true or falſe. All the world knoweth they never made a greater progreſs in Poeſie
<pb facs="tcp:62918:7"/>
then the making of an Aie-houſe Roundelay, and that a bad one. It were baſe in me to upbraid them with want of skill in their own profeſſions, in which they brag they have ſuch inſight; As to one of them, a Phyſician, that he took the piſs of a Ston'd-horſe for that of a Woman with Child: To another, a Mineraliſt, who laid a wager of ten Dollors, a piece of Brimſtone was a piece of Silver; To a third, a Palmeſter, to whom, when a Boy in Girles apparel was brought in to him to have his hand viewed, ſuperciliouſly pronounced, the Girle would have three Husbands, bring forth nine Children, and die of the tenth. It were moſt baſe in me to tell them they are fit for nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome will take them on to be Taſters of Drink: Neither are they fit for that but in the Morning, for in the Afternoon many times they are in the Category of
<pb facs="tcp:62918:7"/>
Plants that is without ſenſe and reaſon, having the uſe of no ſoul but the Vegitative. I could inſtance other things of that nature, But I forbear, leſt the perſons be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to be a bad Poet may well be a ſhame, it is no ſin; Neither is it a ſhame for me in this firſt eſſay, withal my intention is to make men laugh, and not to vex them: But bad Lines many times cauſeth more mirth then good ones. Where one laughs at the Poems of <hi>Virgil, Homer, Arioſto, Du Bartas, &amp;c.</hi> twenty will laugh at thoſe of <hi>John Cockburn,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Zacharie Boyd.</hi> What Hypocondria<expan>

                     <l>So much cry'd out on by our Wives,</l>
                     <l>All the account that I can give on't</l>
                     <l>Is, that my Minnie hath the lave on't.</l>
                     <l>I wiſh them keep a ſober diet,</l>
                     <l>Or, if they drink, Sir, keep it quiet:</l>
                     <l>If openly they haunt the Brewers,</l>
                     <l>We'll not ſecure them from ſtone-throwers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </l>
                     <l>We cannot help it for our life,</l>
                     <l>Sir, who can rule a Lawleſs Wife?</l>
                     <l>To make a willful Wife her fits mend,</l>
                     <l>Would put your ſelf, Sir, to your wits end.</l>
                     <l>Though they cauſe whip them through the Town,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62918:93"/>
Though they them hang, though they them drown,</l>
                     <l>Seing Prieſts drunk at third Bell ringing,</l>
                     <l>They'l up with ſtones, and fall a ſlinging.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>And thus, Sir, I have ſhew'd you how</l>
                     <l>The fault is only of a few,</l>
                     <l>And not of all, and their defence</l>
                     <l>Is, that they follow Conſcience:</l>
                     <l>If it be ſo, by Biſhops leaves,</l>
                     <l>They cannot well be called knaves:</l>
                     <l>What e're they be, it may be ſaid,</l>
                     <l>Knaves never yet a Conſcience had.</l>
                     <l>And that a greater ſlander refels,</l>
                     <l>If they be no knayes, they'r no rebels:</l>
                     <l>I doubt any Logician can</l>
                     <l>A rebel prove an honeſt man.</l>
                     <l>What are they then? wee need n'adviſe,</l>
                     <l>They'r poor folks, large as daft as wiſe.</l>
                     <l>If they be ſuch, and wiſh you well,</l>
                     <l>As others of their actions tell,</l>
                     <l>When in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troupers faces</l>
                     <l>They you remembred in their Graces.</l>
                     <l>That there may be a ſolid peace,</l>

                     <l>Which in effect are heterodox.</l>
                     <l>If once thoſe Preachers mend their lives,</l>
                     <l>There will be no Stone-throwing Wives.</l>
                     <l>Forbid them ſcandalize the Leidges,</l>
