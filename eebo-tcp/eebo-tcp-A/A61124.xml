            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE are few of our Nation that have heard of the Name of <hi>Spencer,</hi> but have granted him the repute of a famous Poet.</p>
            <p>But I must take leave to affirm, that the esteem which is generally allow'd to his Poetical Abilities, has rather been from an implicite or receiv'd Concession, than a knowing Discernment paid to the Value of this Author: Whose Design, in his Books of the <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi> howsoever admirable, is so far from being familiarly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible in the Language he deliver'd it in, that his Stile seems no less unintelligible at this Day, than the obsoletest of our <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>On which ground I believe it ought to have been long ago wish'd, as well as readily embrac'd, by all politely judicious, that something of this

Eminent Poet had been genuinely and succinctl<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

            <p>An Endeavour undertaken by me, supposing i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> could not be less acceptable to others than my self By which I have not only discharg'd his antiquate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Verse and tedious Stanza, but have likewise deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver'd his Sense in Heroick Numbers: much mor<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

entirely preserv'd his Matter and Design, except where both are abreviated, and, as I conceive, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by my Thoughts.</p>
            <p>Nor do I doubt but every impartial Reader will find, that in the way I have undertaken to delineate and express him by, he is render'd what he ought to have been instead of what is to be found in himself.</p>
            <p>Not that I believe, his Language being wav'd, any <hi>Poetical Genius,</hi> since the incomparable <hi>Virgil,</hi> has exceeded the wonderful Variety, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Strength of Conception that is to be found in our famous <hi>Spencer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we consider him as an extraordinary <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or <hi>Tale-teller,</hi> the main Engine and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Poesie, we shall find him more fruitfully new and delicate than any that have preceded him to the Age in which <hi>Virgil</hi> liv'd.</p>
            <p>The most esteem'd of whose Successors, in the Heroick way, <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Tasso,</hi> have borrow'd so much from their great Poetical Predecessor, that it may be said of them, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> does of <hi>Statius,</hi> that they had very probably been greater in themselves, had they not endeavour'd to be like <hi>Virgil,</hi> whose Excellency was above all subsequent Imitation.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Compositions of our wonderful <hi>Spencer</hi> are not only purely created throughout his
<pb facs="tcp:49875:4"/>
Works by his unally'd Invention, but vary'd in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Canto</hi> with such a singular Method, that he is granted, at this day, abating his Expressions and manner of Verse, to compleat a distinct Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Heroick Poesie.</p>
            <p>The late ingenious Sir <hi>William Dav'nant</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occasion in his Preface before his <hi>Gondibert</hi> to commend this Author, compares his Poem of the <hi>Fairy Queen</hi> to an admir'd Course of Poetica<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dreams and Extasies, or an Allegory of Things and Persons deliver'd from extraordinary Result of Imagination. And I conceive him so far in the right in his judicious esteem of this Poet, that, in his kind, perhaps he may remain perpetually unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus far explain'd the Value and Form of this Author's Work, I will take leave to presen<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my Reader with a Taste of what I judge the Es<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sential Parts of Heroick Poesie.</p>
            <p>And this must consist either in Action or in Alle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gory, or rather in a mixture of both. As fo<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Action as it relates to an Heroick Poem, or is ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>emplary from thence; its greatness chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Military Deeds, Stratagems, and Counsels or in Political or Moral Reflections occasional<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> intervening. And these particulars, tho grea<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

numerously various as can alone form so vast a Composition.</p>
            <p>Besides all which, they cannot by any Art or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Poet be render'd much above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary level of human Discussion and Imitation; by reason that the Prudence or Morality of any Actions, howsoever great they tend to Instruction, will concenter, in some degree, with common Thought and Observance. But in that part of such a Poem that includes an Allegory of Things and Persons, the Notions are more sublimely fitted to that purpose, as they have Reference to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Productions and Conduct of the Mind.</p>
            <p>Thus in Magical Transformations, Visions, Apparitions, Extasies, Dreams, extraordinary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and the like; there is an unconfin'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Representation, or such as will not be found to accompany our passions and Affections in any ordinary Act or Contemplation: wherefore, of such, the most spiritual and wonderful part of an Epike Composition must consist, that it may be deliver'd thereby more remote and surprizing.</p>
            <p>To which effect <hi>Ulysses</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Hero of the <hi>Aeneads</hi> are not so much Objects of Admiration and extraordinary note, as they were great in Fortitude or prudence, Things, as I have already express'd, that most men presume in some
<pb facs="tcp:49875:5"/>
measure to understand and imitate: but as they had encounter'd Monsters, convers'd with Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ghosts in their Infernal Visits, whereby Admiration is rais'd, and their Characters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd more superlative and perfect, because ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above usual Thought or Example.</p>
            <p>And who does not more erect his Imagination in reading of the Descent of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into the <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> and the extraordinary Notions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions arising from thence, than in taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his more familiar Actions of Magnanimity and Conduct.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgot a very pertinent passage in reference to what I now assert in behalf of this kind of Poesy.</p>
            <p>And that shall be taken from the appearing of <hi>Hector</hi> after Death unto <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and his speech represented by way of Dream or Vision.</p>
            <p>By which, whosoever considers the superlative Impression of passion that was character'd by this Hero, reviv'd by the poetical Summons of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> shall find, if the Circumstances of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance are duely consider'd, that all the glorious Atchievements of <hi>Hector</hi> joyn'd to his Heroick Fall by the Sword of <hi>Achilles,</hi> could not so Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically consummate the Story of his past Life, as in being thus briefly describ'd by the Poet, tho but in an imaginary Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49875:5"/>I could instance likewise as much in the Case of <hi>Polydorus,</hi> where <hi>Virgil,</hi> to express the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Guilt of a King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who had murder'd that young Prince for his Treasure, has in the Miracle of his speaking from under Ground, divinely fix'd a due Detestation of so horrid a Crime, as also excited the most pathetick Sorrow that can be imagin'd for the cruelty of his end.</p>
            <p>All which, if according to ordinary Fact they had been describ'd, would have fallen far short of their Efficacy, on all accounts, as wanting their preternatural force and esteem, or the Reputation of Wonder reveal'd by permission from above.</p>
            <p>And thus it appears, that things marvellous, and of highest admiration, or such as cannot be personated by Deeds and Words of the living, must be the supream Ornaments of an <hi>Epike Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas in the Dramatick way it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, because similitude to genuine Converse and action is chiefly there to be resembled; tho not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unaccompanyd with things preternatural and prodigious, as may be gather'd from the use of Magical Enchantments, and the Apparitions of Ghosts and Spirits in divers of our old and best Playes.</p>
            <p>Some there are that would so far unsoul Poesy,

as to allow nothing represented by it other than what familiarly resembles the ordinary Results of our Actions and Converse, and this they term likening of Truth; not considering that there is a similitude allowable for Contemplation and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion receiv'd by Men.</p>
            <p>As the Doctrine of separated Forms and Spirits, the total practices of Conjurations and Magick. By which means incorporeal Apparitions have been conceded to appear: and he that denies their Credibility, must likewise disallow the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of holy Writ, which gives authority, more than enough, to Poesy to take that for Truth which is there affirmed to be such.</p>
            <p>On which ground I do not conceive why a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Poem, which some undertake to deny, should not be as extraordinarily written in consonance to Christian Belief, as any was perform'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in their fictitious introducing of Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, imaginary Deities and Visions: since we may have poetical Recourse to spiritual Existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Apparitions, if properly apply'd, as aptly to our purpose as they could invent to assist their Designs. In like manner, instead of their <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs, Harpy's, Cyclops's,</hi> and the like, we have our Prodigies, and Monsters of Men and Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that I do not see why our Fictions
<pb facs="tcp:49875:6"/>
may not be as duely supplied and grounded on any such account, as the ancient Poets could pretend to. Besides all which, there is no useful Poetical Nominal, or Ornament relating to things above or below, but may be as pertinently appropriated by us, as by whatsoever former Writer.</p>
            <p>As who can doubt but Concupiscence may be signify'd by <hi>Venus,</hi> the Winds by <hi>Aeolus,</hi> the Sea by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and so of other fictitious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes usefully common to us and them.</p>
            <p>And we ought rather to blame the narrowness of our Invention, than to conceive that there is not Furniture enough in Poetry to embellish the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of an Epick Contrivance.</p>
            <p>True it is, that according to holy Religion, we must not presume to transform our Hero's into Demi-gods, which I confess was some advantage to the Ancients in magnifying their Heroicks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary Exaltation and Endowments of Men: However I believe that the sublime Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Fortitude incident to a Christian Hero due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey'd by the Poet in reference to Exploits of highest Admiration and Glory, may well compare with what could be feign'd of the best of theirs.</p>
            <p>And this I suppose is sufficient for their Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who affirm that an <hi>Epike Poem</hi> is not to be produc'd within the bounds of Christianity.
<pb facs="tcp:49875:7"/>
Not but I grant that it is a Work of highest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and no less to be admir'd, if perfect, than some wondrous Architecture hardly to be equall'd in point of Design, Magnitude, and Beauty.</p>
            <p>But not impossible to be effected since there needs not be urged a surer Refutation of all Opposers, than the marvellous esteem of this Author, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Obsoleteness of his <hi>English</hi> and Verse, who liv'd within a hundred years of our time. But how to excuse the choice of the Language he writ in, that he could not but know, was of too antiquate a Date, if not generally exploded by all Writers in the time he liv'd; or why he should not conceive himself oblig'd to impart the Tongue of that season as currant as he found it, I cannot apprehend.</p>
            <p>Unless he was resolv'd, as is reported of him, to imitate his ancient Predecessor <hi>Chaucer,</hi> or affected it out of design to restore our <hi>Saxon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</hi> However it was, the Reader may peruse him here, as far as I have gone, in more fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>English</hi> and Verse; and I hope without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to his Fame in any regard.</p>

                  <l>The King when he this daring Letter read,</l>

                  <l>Nor would excuse it in the <hi>Red-Cross</hi> Knight.</l>
                  <l>And musing thus a while no word he spake,</l>
                  <l>Until he solemn silence thus did break:</l>

                  <l>Lest these Lines might unhandsome Deeds declare,</l>
                  <l>Requires at length that truth might be confess'd,</l>

                  <l>What, above Woman's Mischief, me befel:</l>

                  <l>I suffer'd, as strange ways I pass'd of late:</l>
                  <l>Where, her I met, or rather, she found me,</l>
                  <l>As with her rid a Knight my Enemy:</l>

                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49875:122"/>Whom I before her face in Battel kill'd,</l>
                  <l>And wish that there her Blood I'ad also spill'd:</l>
                  <l>When she with an illustrious seeming Grace,</l>
                  <l>Deriv'd her Lineage from Imperial Race:</l>
                  <l>Vowing that she by force was thither brought</l>
                  <l>By the slain Foe, who her Dishonour sought:</l>
                  <l>And how oblig'd her Vertue was to me,</l>
                  <l>By killing him her lustful Enemy.</l>
                  <l>In Dress she richer was than <hi>Persian</hi> Queen,</l>
                  <l>And fresh as Spring her outward Beauty seen:</l>
                  <l>Her Speech was smoother than best Courtier's Tongue,</l>
                  <l>And sweeter was her Voice than <hi>Syren</hi>'s Song.</l>
                  <l>By these Attractions, and her wily Art,</l>
                  <l>Too strong to be oppos'd by human Heart:</l>
                  <l>She me distrustless won unto her Will,</l>
                  <l>Whilst Foes she laid in wait my Blood to spill.</l>
                  <l>Then stepped forth the famous lovely Maid,</l>
                  <l>And kneeling to her Royal Father said,</l>
                  <l>To me, alas! the Ills are known too well,</l>
                  <l>Which from her wicked means my Knight befell.</l>
                  <l>By Combats, Gyants, grievous Wounds distress'd,</l>
                  <l>And Hardships by no words can be express'd.</l>
                  <l>O false <hi>Fidessa,</hi> falser than the Sea,</l>
                  <l>Or breath of Winds that there casts Ships away.</l>

                  <l>Next, Sir, this crafty Messenger behold,</l>
                  <l>Nor doubt to prove him <hi>Archimago</hi> old:</l>
                  <l>Who by his subtlest Diabolick Art,</l>
                  <l>Strove to divide me from my Hero's Heart.</l>
                  <l>That grievous deed all former Sorrows sums,</l>
                  <l>And with Affright to my Remembrance comes.</l>
                  <l>The King was greatly mov'd by what she said,</l>
                  <l>And bids, on this false Man, that Chains be laid:</l>
                  <l>Which being done, he like some Beast at stake,</l>
                  <l>Attempts the Links that him constrain'd to break:</l>
                  <l>Till they convey'd him to a Dungeon deep,</l>
                  <l>And to secure him there strict watch did keep.</l>
                  <l>Not any judging but his wicked end</l>
                  <l>Would soon ensue, howe're Hell stood his Friend.</l>
                  <l>This just Affliction the King's Wrath appeas'd,</l>
                  <l>And looking on the Lovers fully pleas'd:</l>
                  <l>His Daughter to the Hero he unites,</l>
                  <l>By vow'd Contract, and publick sacred Rites.</l>
                  <l>When first his Royal Hand the Taper lays</l>
                  <l>Unto the Pile, must burn for joy some days.</l>
                  <l>And next does sprinkle on the flaming Wood</l>
                  <l>The hallowed Water of the purest flood.</l>

                  <l>And here the sacred Lamp with care they light,</l>
                  <l>In secret was to burn both day and night:</l>
                  <l>The constant Emblem of the 'spoused Breast,</l>
                  <l>Where Love's first kindled flame should ever rest.</l>
                  <l>Then all the Posts with the most sparkling Wine</l>
                  <l>They duely sprinkled, using words divine.</l>
                  <l>And next held solemn Feasts within this Court,</l>
                  <l>Perfum'd with Odors of the choicest sort:</l>
                  <l>Which fill'd each Room with such a fragrant smell,</l>

                  <l>And when the warbling Musick ceas'd to play,</l>
                  <l>The Songsters jolly Notes sung Cares away.</l>
                  <l>And what their Admirations rais'd more high,</l>

                  <l>Nor more conceiv'd from whence these Voices came,</l>
                  <l>Than by what means the Sun expands his Flame.</l>
                  <l>Howe're their Souls transcendently were mov'd,</l>
                  <l>As Heaven's peculiar Act their Joys approv'd.</l>
