            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHAT the design of this plain Discourse is, I need not tell any one that reads and understands the Title of it; for by that he may see, that my business therein, is to make it plain to every one that can understand Reason, <hi>That it is a very foolish thing for one to persuade himself, that there is no GOD.</hi> Whether I have done this or no, is a question which I am not concerned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any otherwise, than by desiring him that asks it, seriously to read and consider the whole Discourse; and when he hath done so,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:65384:3"/>
laying aside all Prejudice and Partiality, to answer it to himself. If he will not be at this pains, I cannot help it; but as I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Bless Almighty <hi>GOD,</hi> who hath enabled me to do it to my own full satisfaction, so I most humbly beseech his <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> that all who are not satisfied with what is here done, may not fail to find all that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction elsewhere, which they do not meet with here.</p>
            <p>If any one shall slight this Discourse, as a thing wholly <hi>needless;</hi> although he grant it to be convincing, and to prove the thing which I have undertaken to prove: I say in the <hi>First</hi> place, That I could heartily wish, that it were indeed as needless, as he thinks it to be. Nothing should make me more glad, than to be well assured, that I have lost my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, upon no other account but this, That no man is in danger of losing his <hi>GOD</hi> through <hi>Unbelief.</hi> But in the <hi>Next</hi> place, I must say also, That I fear he is mistaken.
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:65384:3"/>
For if this Discourse be <hi>Needless,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing withal that it be <hi>Convincing,</hi> it must be for one of these Two Reasons: Either <hi>First,</hi> because all men do already Believe that there is a <hi>GOD;</hi> and therefore <hi>all</hi> Discourses on this Subject are needless. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because there is enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written by others to persuade men into this Belief, and therefore <hi>this</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is needless.</p>
            <p>He that for the <hi>former</hi> of these Two Reasons, thinks not only <hi>this,</hi> but <hi>all </hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses tending to persuade men to believe there is a <hi>GOD,</hi> to be needless; seems to me too little to consider how most men Live in the World. It is a very sad and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing to be thought on; but alas! a thing every where too visible, That very many persons both high and low, behave themselves in all their ways so irreligiously and regardlesly of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Laws, that one can hardly imagine how
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:65384:4"/>
they could, did they on purpose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>t themselves to do it, give the World any clearer proof that they have not any sense of <hi>GOD,</hi> than now they do. The abounding of all sorts of <hi>Wickedness</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness;</hi> and the great indulgence people give every where to themselves in all manner of <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>vanity;</hi> their <hi>deriding</hi> of serious Piety, <hi>mocking</hi> at a conscienciousstrictness and regularity of life, and even <hi>glorying</hi> in their own sins, which they know to be against the plainest laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> and threatned by <hi>him,</hi> with no less than <hi>Eternal Damnation;</hi> seem to me a most evident sign, That men do not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is a <hi>GOD. The trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the wicked</hi> (saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, (Psal. 36. 1.) saith within my heart, that there is no fear of GOD before his eyes.</hi> And whence should it proceed that men fear not GOD, but hence; That either they are not throughly convinced, that there is a GOD to be feared: Or they understand so little of
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:65384:4"/>
GOD, or <hi>what </hi>GOD is, that they know not for what he is to be feared; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as 'tis said, <hi>Psal. 10. 13.) they contemn GOD?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that there are not many among us who do openly deny that there is a GOD; or who will not say, that they believe there is one. But 'tis as true also, that of many of these who make this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, we may use the words of St. <hi>Paul, Tit. 1. 16. They profess that they know GOD, but in works they deny him; being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> In rehearsing the <hi>Articles of the Christian Faith,</hi> every one of us saith for himselfâ<hi>I believe in GOD.</hi> But how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us unsay it again in our unchristian and ungodly Conversation? Our <hi>Works</hi> do much trulier speak the sense of our hearts, than our <hi>Words</hi> are wont to do. <hi>Shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:65384:5"/>
will shew thee my Faith by my Works.</hi> So St. <hi>James</hi> challengeth him, that would needs be thought to have a Christian Faith, whilst he observed not the Laws of GOD. We may well say the same to every one that professeth to believe there is a GOD, and yet leads an ungodly Life. If our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>tongues</hi> do well agree, when we say we believe there is a GOD, it seems one of the hardest things in the World to conceive, how our <hi>Lives</hi> should so much disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them both. If we did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we say we believe, one would think, we should be more <hi>afraid,</hi> than we are, of living so unanswerably to our <hi>Belief;</hi> and more <hi>ashamed,</hi> than we are of living so unagreeably to our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man would demonstrate to the world, That he doth but <hi>Dissemble</hi> and <hi>Lye,</hi> when he saith he believes, That there is a <hi>GOD;</hi> by what other way could he do this, than by
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:65384:5"/>
living a Wicked Life? And why then should we not be convinced of it, that this <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his is indeed a <hi>Lye,</hi> when he proves it to us, as well as such a thing can be proved? He lives and acts in all things, as pleaseth his own Humour and Lust; he behaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as one that owns no Superior Power to restrain him from doing wickedly; be breaks all the Laws of <hi>GOD</hi> and Man as far as he hath a Mind and Strength enough to do it; he seems impatient of living any longer than he may be his own Master, or have the liberty to serve the Flesh; He takes all liberty that he can get, and doth as wickedly as he dare, for fear of men; he regards nothing (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his temporal safety) but his own Will and Pleasure: And after all this, what clearer Demonstration can he give us, That he doth not believe there is a <hi>GOD,</hi> whom he is bound to serve?</p>
            <p>And now if this be true, I am sure there is much need of Discourses against <hi>Atheism.
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:65384:6"/>
Wickedness</hi> of all sorts did never more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound nor Triumph in the World, than now it doth: And therefore there never was more need of a <hi>Reformation</hi> of mens Lives and Manners, than now there is: But in vain are all Endeavours to that purpose, so long as men do not believe that there is a <hi>GOD</hi> over them, to whom they owe a Duty, and are accountable for their whole behaviour. Till men be convinced of this, tho they may possibly by force be kept from doing some sorts of Evil, they can never be Reformed, or persuaded to be good. But if they may once be throughly convinced of this, it may also be hoped, That they may be persuaded to account it both their Duty and their Interest to live a godly life; and (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, Col. <hi>I. 10.) To walk worthy of GOD unto all pleasing, being fruitful in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing such Discourses needful, yee (will some say) what need was there
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:65384:6"/>
of <date>this,</date> sceing there are already so many both <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>learneder</hi> on the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? In answer to this, I have no more to say, but these things. <hi>First,</hi> I do very readily, and with all due thankfulness, both to <hi>GOD,</hi> and the learned <hi>Authors,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, That there be many both <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>learneder</hi> Discourses on this subiect than this is. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> even for this very Reason, that they are so <hi>large</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> they are the less serviceable to that sort of People, for whose use <hi>this</hi> is principally design'd. As men of strong Reason and good Learning, can make good use of long and learned Discourses; and receive much benefit by them; So men of weak Understandings, and of little or no Learning, stand in need of <hi>short</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> Discourses, such as they can from their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Business get time to read; and such, as reading, they are able to Understand: For <hi>their</hi> sake it is, that I publish this; and therefore have I used as great <hi>plainness</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65384:7"/>
of Expression in it as possibly I could; and yet I am very sure of it, no more than is needful to make them understand it. No man can deny but such people ought to live <hi>Religiously,</hi> as well as others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be well grounded in the <hi>first Principles</hi> of Religion. And they must be taught in such a way as they are able to learn, is we design to teach them any thing; and therefore in teaching them, we must use both such <hi>Arguments,</hi> and such <hi>Language,</hi> as are not too hard for them; or we lose our labour, and they all the benefit they should reap by it.</p>
            <p>If this be not enough to <hi>excuse</hi> me, at least, for Publishing this Discourse, and for Writing it too, with so much plainness, as, if I be not deceiv'd, I have done: I will only add this, That I had rather be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for being impertinent by them, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need it not themselves, or see not the need that others have of it; than bear the
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:65384:7"/>
rebuke of my own Conscience, for not doing, what I am verily persuaded to be very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in the best manner I could do it; tho not half so well as another might have done it.</p>

            <p>To make this plain to the meanest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is my present business; and to this end, in the first place, I desire that these three things may be consider'd in the words of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which, I say, contain so clear a Truth:</p>
            <list>

            <p n="1">1. That which is said is this; <hi>There is no GOD.</hi> Doth he who saith this, understand what he saith? If he do not, he is a <hi>fool</hi> for saying he knows not what. Doth he know what the word [GOD] signifies? If he do not, he saith he knows not what. GOD, is <hi>He that made the World and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the LORD of Heaven and Earth; who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65384:9"/>
in whom we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Acts 17. 24, 25, 28. This is that which all the World hath ever meant by this word [GOD]: The <hi>First</hi> of all <hi>Beings,</hi> who is of himself from all Eternity, without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which gave being to all things that ever were, and in which, as in the first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is all <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness: Of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things, to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> Rom. 11. 36.</p>
            <p>This then is it which is said: <hi rend="margQuotes">Tho there be a World, yet it had no Maker. As much as to say, Tho' there be a stately, a useful, a richly furnished, and wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived House, yet it had no Builder. Tho' there be many things, yet was there no first Cause of their Being; Tho' all things are disposed in a very wonderful wise order, yet was there no wise Orderer of them. We Men, who were not always, came into this World, no body knows how; We are provided for here, no body knows by whom; We are dayly going hence, no body knows whither; We have no Maker to whom we owe our being; no Owner whose we are; no Preserver whom we are to thank for any thing; no LORD, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, whom we are to obey; to whom we must be accountable; whose favour or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65384:10"/>
displeasure we need to regard: We may do what we will with our selves, and all we can to any other, whether it be good or hurt. We may get whatever we can, by any means, for our selves, and from others; we may do what we will with it, when we have got it. All Religion is a vain thing; and Civil Government is but a crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of Men. We are under no Laws, but such as we please to make to our selves. Who is Lord over us?</hi> Psal. 12. 4. This is it that is said, in saying, <hi>There is no</hi> GOD. And surely there does not appear any wisdom in all this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that saith this, saith it <hi>in his heart.</hi> He is not so ignorant of GOD, as one who never heard of any such thing. If any one be so ignorant, 'tis certain he's a <hi>fool,</hi> and greatly to be pitied for his folly: But in what part of the World he should be found, I know not. He that saith in his heart, <hi>there is no GOD,</hi> talks of him within himself, and therfore hath heard of him. Yet some who have heard of GOD, are wholly careless and regardless of him, and very indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be or no; their <hi>hearts</hi> are at rest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and seem unconcern'd about this matter: This is great folly, and 'tis well if there be not many such Fools, of whom it may be said, <hi>GOD is not in all their thoughts,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65384:10"/>
Psal. 10. 4. Some there may be also, who wish with all their <hi>hearts,</hi> and could <hi>heartily</hi> desire that there were no GOD, that so, without all fear of him, they might live as they list. All these are Fools; but he that <hi>saith in his heart there is no GOD,</hi> seems to outgo all these: He is come to a conclusion about it, and makes himself confident of it. 'Tis true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he seems not yet so fool-hardy, as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say it with his Tongue: Tho' some Men are grown so impudent, as to boast of their folly, and to call it Wit to talk prophanely; and some parts of the World are so over-run with bruitishness as to suffer this: Yet most men, if they be not more modest, are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, more cunning than to speak out all that they think. Tho' therefore they think <hi>there is no</hi> GOD, yet are they sensible how much it concerns them, that others should not be taught to think so too, or so much as know that they think so. If they should bring others to think as they do, they might soon be made to pay dearly for teaching them this lesson; for then would all those others take to themselves the same liberty of doing what they list, as they desire to have, and the World would become a very unsafe place for them to live in. He therefore that saith <hi>there is no GOD,</hi> is content to say it <hi>in his heart</hi> only; and can be very well content too, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65384:11"/>
all but himself should think otherwise for his own safety; yea, lest all they who think there is a GOD, should begin to stand upon their guard against him, as an Enemy to Mankind (as they have good reason to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him): Tho' he be so foolish, as to say <hi>in his heart, there is no GOD;</hi> yet is he so cunning, as to say with his mouth among others, <hi>I believe in GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He that <hi>saith in his heart there is no God,</hi> is <hi>the fool:</hi> No wise Man ever said it. <hi>The fear of the LORD, that is wisdom,</hi> Job 28. 28. <hi>The knowledg of the HOLY is understanding,</hi> Prov. 9. 10. <hi>The fear of the LORD, is the beginning of knowledg,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. <hi>and of wisdom; And a good understanding have they that keep his commandments,</hi> Ps. 111. 10. <hi>But fools despise wisdom and instruction,</hi> Prov. 1. 7. <hi>And the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness,</hi> Prov. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>. 23. But what <hi>fool</hi> is he that saith this? In the language of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>fool</hi> is he that goes on in a course of sinning. Of him and his Fellows, <hi>David</hi> gives us this account in those two <hi>Psalms,</hi> the 14th, and 51st, <hi>They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doth good. The LORD looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek GOD: They are all gone aside, they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65384:11"/>
become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> The <hi>fool</hi> then, is the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sinner, who being deeply in love with his sin, cannot indure to think of parting with it. If there be a GOD, he knows he must very dearly pay for sinning against him; and therefore so long as he believes there is a GOD, he cannot enjoy his sins in quietness. He has therefore no way left him but one to sin without a continual disturbance of mind from the checks of his own Conscience, and that is, As much as he can, to banish the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and even all thoughts of GOD far from him. This then for the love of his sins he is resolved upon; and tho' it be very hard for him who hath his eye-sight, to open his eyes, and not see the Light; yet he makes a shift so long to wink against the light, till at last he quite loseth his sight: So long he strives aagainst the belief of a GOD, that at length no Arguments can persuade him to believe. Resisting the Truth, GOD justly punisheth him with his own desire, and hides the Truth from him for ever: <hi>Because they received not the love of the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>GOD</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) shall send them strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that they should believe a lye: That they might be damn'd who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>As they did not like to retain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65384:12"/>
GOD in their knowledg, GOD gives them over to a reprobate mind,</hi> Rom. 1. 28. And 'tis most just with GOD thus to deal with such obstinate Fools; I mean, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for ever from them, who have a long time done all that ever they could, not to see him. Hence the Sinner grows more and more a Fool, and at last arrives at the Fool's confidence, to believe whatever he has a mind to; <hi>He saith in his heart there is no GOD:</hi> And <hi>he that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool,</hi> Prov. 28. 26.</p>
            <p>Now, having seen these Three things, <hi>What is said, How 'tis said,</hi> and <hi>Who hath said it;</hi> We are to consider how well he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the name of <hi>Fool</hi> for saying it: <hi>That is,</hi> for persuading himself to believe, or for making himself confident, That <hi>there is no GOD.</hi> And this his Folly will undeniably appear very great, to every one that takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice but of Three things, which are all very visible:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He is Confident, where he cannot have any, even the least ground of Assurance.</item>
               <item>2. He is Confident, where his Confidence can do no good, but will do much hurt.</item>
               <item>3. He is Confident, where all the reason in the world is against his Confidence.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65384:12"/>
If then there be such a thing in the world as a <hi>fool,</hi> he that <hi>saith in his heart,</hi> or is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that <hi>there is no</hi> GOD, must needs be a <hi>Fool.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that is confident <hi>there is no GOD,</hi> is confident where he cannot have any the least ground of assurance; <hi>that is,</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of that which he cannot pretend to know. And is not he a <hi>fool</hi> that pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with such a groundless confidence as this, and ventures his soul on that whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that he is in any measure sure? No man was ever yet so vain as to undertake to prove <hi>that there is no GOD.</hi> Some have been either so dull that they could not, or so stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born that they would not see or confess they saw reason enough to convince them <hi>that there is a</hi> GOD. And some have been so da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as to do their utmost endeavour to prove, that it is not altogether necessary that there <hi>must</hi> be one, or that 'tis possible there <hi>may</hi> be none. But either that 'tis impossible that there should be a GOD, or that of a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is no such thing, none hath ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to prove, with what confidence so ever he talks of this matter. Sum up all that all the <hi>Atheists</hi> in the world have at any time been able to say against the being of a GOD, it amounts to no more but this, <hi>It may be there is a</hi> GOD, <hi>and it may be there is not.</hi> Which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65384:13"/>
is all one as to say, They know not whether there be a GOD or no. So that even whilst the <hi>Atheist</hi> most confidently denies that there is a GOD, he is forced to confess, that for any thing he knows to the contrary, there is one. Only he imagines there may be no GOD; and as he imagines it to be, so he would fain have it to be, and therefore he is confident it is just as he imagins it may be, and would gladly have it be. And would not any of us laugh at that man, who talks with all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence imaginable of a thing, as if he were sure of it; and yet when he is askt, how he came to know it, can give no wiser an answer than this, I fain would have it so, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may possibly be so, and I am not yet satisfied it is not as I think it may be, and therefore I am very confident 'tis just as I say? Would we not, I say, laugh at this as the answer of a <hi>Fool?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. It is folly enough for one to be Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent without a reason or ground of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; yet is it a much greater folly on no good ground to be confident, where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dangerous to be confident, and where the confidence doth certainly much hurt, and can do no good. And yet such is his confidence, who is confident <hi>there is no</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65384:13"/>
Where there are two Opinions, whereof one knows not which is truest; and there is danger in following the one, and none in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the other; it must needs be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be a great folly, to chuse to follow that opinion wherein there is danger, rather than that wherein there is none. If then there be no <hi>danger</hi> at all in believing there is a GOD, and a great deal of danger in thinking there is none: He must needs be a <hi>fool</hi> that thinks <hi>there is no</hi> GOD. Now these two things will quickly appear to be true.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To believe there is a GOD, (even tho there were none) doth much good, and no hurt.</item>
               <item>2. To think there is no GOD (tho it were true) doth much hurt and no good.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To believe there is a GOD, (even tho there were none) doth much good and no hurt. It will easily be granted by the <hi>Atheist</hi> himself, that if there be a GOD (as we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believe there is) to believe it, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our duty, but our highest concern. If we have a <hi>Maker, Preserver,</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> it is very fit and necessary, and can no way be hurtful, but exceeding good and profitable for us to own him, and by all means to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to please him, and to keep in his favour; seeing that both we and all things are in his hand and power, and so totally depend upon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65384:14"/>
him, that we can neither be happy, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>be</hi> at all, but by his Blessing, Protection, and Providence: <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. <hi>We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture,</hi> Psal. 100. 3. But I say, that tho there were no GOD (which yet cannot be) to believe that there is one, would do much good and no hurt at all.</p>
            <p>It would do much good, because 'tis plain, that this belief (which nothing else cou'd do) keeps the world in good order, and makes <hi>men sociable, governable,</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to one another. This belief of a <hi>God,</hi> is that which keeps us from destroying our selves by <hi>Lasciviousness, Intemperance, and Luxury;</hi> and from devouring and ruining one another by <hi>malice, envy, pride, covetousness,</hi> and <hi>oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So that the world owes its happiness to this belief. In short then, this belief helps us to live <hi>soberly,</hi> and <hi>righteously,</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> in this present world, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. and to die com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in hope of better things than this world affords, when we go out of it. And this certainly is all very good.</p>
            <p>But now this <hi>belief</hi> of a GOD can do no hurt at all. For seeing it naturally inclines men to do good, and restrains men from doing hurt, it self can no way be hurtful. If it can, let the <hi>Atheist</hi> himself shew us what the hurt of it is, even supposing there were no GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65384:14"/>
Is this the hurt it doth us, That it keeps us from using that liberty which were there no GOD, and we believ'd it, we might freelyuse? Indeed, as I know not, if there were no GOD, what should make it unlawful for any one to use all the liberty he could get; so I doubt as little, but if men thought there were none, they would use a great deal more liberty than they do; but then 'tis only because they are fools, and consider not their own good. A wise man, who is govern'd, not by passion, but by reason, as every man should be, would use no more liberty of that kind which wicked men most covet, than GOD now allows us, were he sure that there were no GOD. For GOD allows us all things that are for the <hi>good</hi> of our selves and mankind, and he forbids us nothing but what visibly tends to the hurt of our selves or others. It can be therefore no other liberty but that of doing hurt, which the belief of a GOD restrains us from; and to restrain us from doing hurt, cannot be hurtful. A wise man, I say, would not use this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tho he might. For he wisely considers, that all men would have the same right as he to use that liberty; and if they should do so, as there could be no reason why they should not as well as he, there could be no Society, no Government, no safe living by one another in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65384:15"/>
Or in the next place, is this the hurt which the belief of a GOD would do, supposing there were none, that in some cases we must suffer evils, which we should not need to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, were there no GOD? We are poor, it may be, and yet for fear of GOD we dare not steal nor rob, nor cheat, to relieve our selves. We suffer wrong, and for fear of GOD we dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> not revenge our selves, and such like. 'Tis true indeed, the belief of a GOD obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to suffer rather than to do evil; But it will be found to do us no hurt but good in this. Which that we may discern, we are to think upon these following things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember, that some of the evils we suffer, are unavoidable by us, whether there be a GOD or no. <hi>That is,</hi> they are such as if there be a GOD, none but he can prevent or remove; and if there be no GOD, it is not in our power to do either. Now in such cases it is a man's wisdom to suffer them with as little trouble to himself as he can, seeing he must bear them, do what he can: Impatience, fretting and rage, do not lessen, but double the suffering, whatever it be. And then the belief of a GOD binds us in such cases to no more, but to suffer patiently, and in humble submission to his will, and in hope that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, <hi>All things work together for good to us,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>And that the light affliction, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65384:15"/>
is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. Seeing then such evils must be born, all the hurt the belief of GOD doth us, is to enable us to bear them more easily, even as much as he that suffers in hope, may suffer more cheerfully than he that has no hope.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Observe, that some of these evils are such, as we suffer through the wickedness of men. And here we should remember, <hi>first,</hi> That were there no belief or fear of GOD among men, where we now suffer one such evil, we should suffer a thousand. I hope then the belief of a GOD doth us no hurt in this, that it makes our sufferings fewer than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would be. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Remember, 'tis for want of this belief, that men are so forward to hurt one another; for GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it: and if men believed to the purpose that there is a GOD, forbidding all Injuries on pain of damnation, they would not dare to do wrong. Who then will say, that the belief of a GOD can be hurtful, when 'tis only the want of it whence all such hurts arise?</p>
            <p>Well, But it will be yet said, That were it not for fear of GOD, we might some way or other prevent, or remove such Evils as these. For a fuller answer to this,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65384:16"/>
3. Take notice, That of this kind of Evils, some are very slight, small, and easily tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; others are very grievous, and not easily supportable. If the Evils we suffer one from another be very small, and easie to be born; will not a wise man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a GOD, or no, rather be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bear them patiently, even for the sake of his own ease and quiet, much more for the peace and quiet of the Neighbourhood; than disturb both himself and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by beginning, and continuing a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel about little things; and that when the issue is doubtful, and he cannot be sure he shall be a gainer in the end? If one have a mind to end quarrels speedily, and to live in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>ce and quietness, which certainly is a thing very desireable; to put up in patience and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence light and trivial wrongs, is both the shortest, and easiest; the cheapest, and most obliging way. And this is it that in such cases the belief of a GOD doth bind us to. If the Evils we suffer from others be very grievous, and not easily supportable; the Laws of GOD do not forbid us fairly and legally to right and relieve our selves; much less do they command us to lay our selves open to such Evils, or not to guard our selves as well as we can against them; or to suffer Evil-doers to pass unpunished. All that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65384:16"/>
GOD forbids in such cases, is spiteful, and unnecessary private revenge. Now a wise man again, whether there were a GOD or no, would take this very course that GOD now commands, and not that which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids. If he be in want or poverty, he would use no illegal means of relief; if he be wrong'd, he would use no illegal ways of righting himself. Why? because he considers he thus makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self his own Judge, and his own Carver, and so might every one do as well as he, and at this rate there could be no Civil Society or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but all men would be let loose, like so many wild beasts, to prey upon, and devour one another. What hurt then doth the belief of a GOD do us, when it binds us to suffer no otherwise than any wise man would of himself do, were he sure there is no GOD?</p>
            <p>Is this the hurt it doth, that it binds us to die, rather than any way to dishonour GOD; which we need not do, were there no GOD? It is true again, that it binds us to this; and if there were no GOD, we should not be bound to it. Well then, (saith the <hi>Atheist)</hi> can any one pretend, that this is no hurt, for a man to lose his life, and all that's dear to him, at once irrecoverably, for the sake of GOD, if yet there be no GOD? To this I say, If there be any hurt at all in this, yet is it much less than that which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65384:17"/>
follow the denying of a GOD, yea tho he were not. And this must be granted when these few things have been duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We must all die, whether there be a GOD or no. I cannot think that any one of those who doubt whether there be a GOD, doubts too whether or no he shall die; he is, he thinks, too sure of that. And further yet, we none of us know either <hi>when</hi> or <hi>how</hi> we shall die. It may be, tomorrow, or before; and it may be too in the most painful Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Torment.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> the worst that can be in our dying for GOD, is this, That we may so be made to die, a little, and we know not how little a while, for ought we know, not one hour or minute before the time when otherwise we should have died. Or we may be made to die in torment; and yet, for ought we know, in far less torment than otherwise we should have died, and it may be, at the same time.</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It cannot be any great hurt to lose a few days of an uncertain and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lifo; and such days, as for ought we know, would have brought so many evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, as would have made us wish a thousand times over, that we had died sooner, and had never seen so much as one of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65384:17"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If all men were persuaded that there is no GOD, the wickedness of men would soon make the world so uneasie a place to us, that he would think himself the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest man, that could soonest find his way out of it.</p>
            <p>All this considered, 'tis evident, That even the faintest hope that any one could conceive, of enjoying a Blessed Eternity with GOD, must be enough to make him set light by the loss of a few days more of life in this world. He that cannot be sure that there is no God, (as no man can be) and much more he that but thinks there is a GOD, must needs be a Fool, if he had rather live a while to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour GOD, and fall under his Wrath, than dye a little before his time, if he thinks it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to GOD, and rewardable by him. For supposing it uncertain to him, whether there be a GOD or no, this were plainly to chuse a worse uncertain thing before a better. It were to chuse a few short days of life, which he knows not whether he shall have or no, or whether they will be worth having or no, yea, whether or no they will give him cause to repent that even he had one of them; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a life of Eternal Blessedness with GOD, which, if there be a GOD, he is sure to have; or rather than to secure himself from an endless state of intolerable Torments,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65384:18"/>
which, if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be a GOD, he is sure to fall into, who lives to GOD's Dishonour. And now where's the hurt of dying for GOD, even tho there were none?</p>
            <p>Is it this, in the last place, That such an one shall be disappointed in his Hope? Is it not (saith the <hi>Atheist)</hi> a very miserable thing, to suffer and dye in hope of good things, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has paid so dear for his hope, find it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in a moment? Well; but let me tell the <hi>Atheist,</hi> he will find it a much more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable thing, to have been confident all his life long that there is no GOD, and then in a moment to find there is one, to his everlasting sorrow. However, in answer to what he here objects; <hi>First,</hi> It is certain, That if there be a GOD, his hope who died for GOD, is not defeated; and if there be no GOD, then the defeating of his hope can be no misery or hurt to him. He that denies a GOD, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a future state after death, and so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, the whole Man, Soul and Body, dies at once, as beasts do; and has no more sense of any thing after death, than they have. Now that can be no misery or hurt, which cannot be felt: And the frustration of his hope, cannot be felt by him who has no sense of any thing. If the man that's once dead, feels nothing, whatever he has lost, his loss is nothing at all to him. Whilst such an one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65384:18"/>
his hope made his Life pleasant, and his Sufferings tolerable; it heightned his Joys, and it mitigated his Sorrows; it was his comfort both in life and death; and now he is dead, if there be a GOD, he enjoys all he hoped for, and is glad he took the rough way to Heaven, and thinks himself well paid for his pains and sufferings; and if there be no GOD, he is in as good a condition as all others are, neither better nor worse; and as they are not sensible of their past Pleasures, no more is he of his past Sorrows. His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief whilst he lived, did both himself and others much good, and could never hurt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself or others, living or dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To think there is no GOD, (even if there be none) doth much hurt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>nd no good at all.</p>
            <p>If there be a GOD, (as we cannot doubt but there is) the <hi>Atheist</hi> will not deny, That his opinion is the most pernicious and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing in the world. To deprive ones self for ever of <hi>his</hi> Favour, and to expose ones self to <hi>his</hi> unsupportable Wrath, who alone can save or destroy as he pleaseth; To lose Eternal Joys, and run into Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and merely for the enjoyment of a few days of fruitless sin and vanity, and for the humouring of a lump of flesh, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65384:19"/>
must within a few days corrupt, and rot in dirt; can a man possibly do himself greater hurt than this?</p>
            <p>And suppose the <hi>Atheist</hi> were in the right, what good could his opinion do him? Nay, what hurt would it not do both him and all the world, were it generally received? Whilst he is of this opinion, he enjoys a few beastly Pleasures, and is delighted to live as beasts do, and to think that he shall dye as they do too. O excellent Priviledge! What is it else, that he can make much of this opinion for, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he thinks himself at liberty to do as he lists? Well; but whilst he is so fond of a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and licentious life, that he cannot endure to hear of GOD, because of his love to it; I would desire to know of him, <hi>First,</hi> If this be no troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>lastly,</hi> If it do not trouble him, when ever he thinks of it, that he cannot be sure that his Opinion is true, and that, for ought he knows to the contrary, there may be a God, and he may the next moment cast him into Hell for the life he now leads? I cannot but think, but when the <hi>Atheist</hi> is at any time awakened to the exercise of his reason, and thinks of these things, he cannot much boast of the good his Opinion doth himself; nay, that he cannot deny, but 'tis hurtful to him.</p>
            <p>And should it be once embraced generally by others, what would become of him and all the world? There would be nothing in a short time visible, but disorder and confusion, and all manner of mischief and misery, were men once persuaded, That there is no GOD, no rewarder of the good, no punisher of the wicked; and that there is nothing either to be hoped for, or feared, but in this life only. Had men none over them to keep them in awe, but weak men like themselves, what could be expected, but that they should fall a tearing and eating up one another? Would not every one think it his concern, and his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65384:20"/>
right too, to make the best he could of this present life to himself, as well as he, if he thought there were nothing either better or worse to be expected, than what this life<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords? Would not every one who is persuaded that this world is all that ever he must enjoy, use his utmost cunning and endeavour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to any other person, or any regard to Right or Wrong, to pick and chuse, and carve out for himself as great a share of it as he possibly could; yea, tho he must dig through the very bowels of all other men, to come at the things he desired to have? Might not any one challenge as much Right to every thing that lay within his reach, as any other whatsoever? And would not every one catch that could, yea and kill too, or do any thing else he could, that he might catch? If it be true, that there is no GOD, to whom all are bound to submit, what Law can any one think himself bound to obey, but his own Will? And would not every one be as free as he could make himself, and strive to have his own will, rather than to be subject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's? Would not every one endeavour to make himself Master of as much, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he could? And would not this striving for the Mastery, and scrambling who should get most, bring all things to confusion? Could any thing but mere force and violence bring
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65384:20"/>
or keep men under Government? And would men any longer bear so uneasie a yoke, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could find out any way to break or shake it off? All the world thus would be turn'd into a Field of War and Blood, and no man could think himself safe from his Neighbour. He that is strongest, or could make his Party the strongest for a time, could not promise himself that he should long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so, and not be undermined by the wiles of the weaker, or by the treacheries or revolts of his own men. And they who are weakest, must be sure, whilst they are so, to endure the insolencies, and lye at the mercy of the stronger. No man could call either his goods or his life his own, seeing there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder any one that had strength and malice enough, from invading them, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to advance himself upon the ruins of any one whom he found standing in his way to what he covets.</p>
            <p>All men may plainly see, That Religion, were it generally practised throughout the world, would soon make it happy; and that the good order that is in the world, is wholly owing to the sense men have of a GOD; and that therefore there is so little good order in the world at this day, because there is so little sincere Religion, or true sense of GOD in it. And if there were no sense of GOD in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65384:21"/>
it, there would be no good order at all. Tho it were true then, That there is no GOD, I dare say, the whole world would soon begin to wish it false; yea, and rather than all men should think there is none, the <hi>Atheist</hi> himself would wish it false too. All men would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find reason enough to curse the man that first discovered so mischievous a Truth. But now seeing no man can possibly be assured, That it is true; what a Fool is he that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suades himself it is, to no other end, but that he may be more free to do mischief, and by doing so, teach others to do the like; thus put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself, and the rest of mankind into a posture of War, and into the most deplorable condition imaginable? I mean, into that of enjoying no quiet or safety in this world, no comfort or satisfaction in going out of it, and the danger of suffering more intolerable evils, than any one can now conceive, whenever death shall call him hence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third Argument to prove him a <hi>fool,</hi> who is confident <hi>there is no GOD,</hi> is this: He is Confident, where all the Reason in the World is against his Confidence. And to make this good, I lay this down as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principle: <hi>It is a sufficient reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a thing is, when it's being is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto us, all those ways, whereby we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65384:21"/>
that such a thing can be discovered unto us, if indeed it be, and may be known.</hi> If then GOD hath made himself known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us all those ways, whereby we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he can be made known, if he be; we have all the Reason in the World to believe him to be, and so all the Reason in the World is against his Confidence that denies GOD to be. He is a <hi>fool</hi> that desires or calls for more than this; for that is all one as if he should say, I will not believe that there is a GOD, 'till he be made known to me more ways than h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> can be made known to me, though there be one.</p>
            <p>Now let any one say, what Evidence he would have to convince him that there is a GOD, and I will shew him that he hath it; unless he would have such Evidence as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given, tho' there be a GOD. All things cannot be discover'd by every kind of Evidence, tho' they really are, and may be known. A Voice or Sound cannot be known by Seeing; yet we are sure it is, because we hear it. A Colour cannot be known by Hearing; but we are sure it is, because we see it. Sweet and Bitter cannot be known by seeing or hearing; yet we know them by Tasting. He's a Fool then that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any of these to be, unless he have such an evidence of it as cannot be given, whilst
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65384:22"/>
he hath that which can; or, Who will not believe there is a Colour, because he cannot hear or smell it, whilst he Sees it? or thinks there is no Voice, because he cannot see, touch, or tast it, tho' he Hears it? And so of the rest.</p>
            <p>What evidence then would a Man have to assure him that there is a GOD? GOD is by Nature a <hi>Spirit,</hi> Joh. 4. 24. and so <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 17. <hi>whom no man hath seen, nor can see,</hi> vid. 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 16. Ioh. 1. 18. 1 Ioh.</hi> 4. 12. He's a <hi>fool</hi> then that will not believe that there is a GOD unless he see him: And as much a Fool is he, that will not believe him to be, unless he can hear him speak, or feel him: For GOD being a pure <hi>Spirit,</hi> without a <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>bodily qualities,</hi> hath neither a Voice, such as bodily things have, whereby he may be heard with our Ears; nor other quality whereby he may be felt with our Hands, any more than he hath Colour or Shape to be seen with our Eyes.</p>
            <p>We must, if we will be reasonable, be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with such Evidences of an <hi>Invisible Spirit,</hi> as an <hi>Invisible Spirit</hi> can give us of its self: And such evidences of himself GOD hath given unto us; and by all such ways, as we can think on, has revealed himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as one of infinite <hi>Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> our <hi>Maker, Preserver,</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65384:22"/>
And how can we conceive, that He, who is in himself Invisible, should make this manifest unto us, but by some or all of these ways?</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. By some such audible and visible sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications and tokens of his Being and Will, as we are capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</item>
               <item>II. By imprinting a sense of himself in our minds, making us not only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of perceiving, but inclined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him.</item>
               <item>III. By doing such works as are the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible effects of such a Being, Power, Wisdom and Goodness.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If there be a GOD, some of these ways he may, and otherwise we cannot conceive how he should be known unto men. And therefore if he have all these ways manifested himself unto us, he is a <hi>Fool</hi> that doth not own him.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It must be granted very reasonable to expect, That if there be a GOD who is our LORD and GOVERNOR, he should give us such significations and tokens of his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> as we may know him, and how to behave our selves towards him. And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65384:23"/>
if it be such an evidence of him, that the <hi>Atheist</hi> would have for his satisfaction, I say he hath it in that which we call GOD's WORD in the Holy SCRIPTURE.</p>
            <p>If he say, He would believe there is a GOD, because of his WORD, if he were sure that it is GOD's Word; I ask, What he means by saying so? Is it this, That he would believe there is a GOD, because of his Word, were he first sure that there is a GOD whose Word it may be? This is all one, as to say, That what he calls for as an evidence of a GOD, can be no evidence; for he cannot be persuaded 'tis his Word, till he be first sure that He is: This is to play the <hi>Fool</hi> downright; He will not believe there is a GOD, till GOD hath revealed himself by his Word; GOD reveals himself by his Word, and he will not believe it to be his Word, because he is not sure there is a GOD. If he say, he means no more but this, That what you shew him for the Word of GOD, is not such as may be thought worthy of GOD, or has not enough in it to convince one, that it is not a Forgery of man? If this be his meaning, then I ask him, What is wanting to it to make it appear worthy of GOD, and not to be a Forgery of man? If he cannot shew this, and yet excepts against it, he's a <hi>Fool;</hi> for either that evidence wherein
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65384:23"/>
no defect can be discover'd, must be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence; or there can be no such thing as a sufficient evidence in the world.</p>
            <p>Well then; We say, GOD hath revealed Himself and his Will by clear significations of both, in his Word. And this Word we have now written in a Book, which we call the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Scripture.</hi> If this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or Writing be true, then is it the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> for so much it affirmeth of it self. The Truth of it therefore is the only thing we are to inquire into. And to make this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry as short as may be, let it be considered, That this Book is made up of divers smaller Books, whereof some are called, The Books of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> others of them, The Books of the <hi>New</hi> one: And we need do no more but inquire into the Truth of the latter of these at present; for if what is written in these, be true; then is that so too, which is written in the former: For these bear witness to the Truth of those. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>New Testament</hi> approves of the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> and of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> which make up the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> Luke 24. 44. And of the same, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>All Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by inspiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. And <hi>St. Peter,</hi> That <hi>the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy

If then the Writings of the <hi>New Testament</hi> be true, the Books of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> contain the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi> And to satisfie our selves that they are true, we need but to understand Three Things:</p>

               <item>1. That there were such men as are said to have written these Books; and that these are their Writings.</item>

               <item>3. That what they have written, hath all the Characters of Divine Truth.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. There were once such men as are said to have written these Books; and these Books were written by them. If any one doubts whether there were once such men as St <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke, Iohn, Paul, Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iude;</hi> or that the Books which bear their Names, were written by them; how would he have it proved? These men died about Sixteen hundred Years ago, and therefore he will not surely be so unreasonable as to say, Shew me the Men, or I will not believe that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65384:24"/>
ever they were. But look what reason he hath to believe any thing that was before he was was born, and now he seeth not; the same he hath to believe that these men once were, and that they wrote these Books. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories make express mention of them, one Generation to another, from their time to this, hath preserved their Memory; and the Books we have, are their lasting Monuments. We have the Testimony of all Christians, of all Ages since their time, who have own'd these Books as theirs, who have commented on them, and written in defence of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in them; recorded their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and the Churches which they planted: And these Witnesses are no inconsiderable Persons, but the most learned of their times, and such as made the most diligent search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth; and were so well satisfied, as to shed their blood in vindication of it, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their Salvation upon it. Neither is this all, but we have the testimony of their Enemies, of those who persecuted them unto death, and wrote against the Truth which they deliver'd. Now what can any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire more than this to satisfy him, That there were such men, and that they wrote these Books? We have the Books in our hands, and all sorts of Historians, Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, making mention of them; and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65384:25"/>
Churches, being the best, most learned, and most civilized part of the World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, receiving, and even unto death maintaining them. Have we not the faith to believe, that there were once such men as <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Iulius Caesar?</hi> Do not we believe that <hi>Cicero, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes, Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> once were, and that we have their Books? Believe we not that we have had Kings of this Realm in former days, and that we have now Laws which they enacted? Nor yet that we had Grandfathers, and Great-Grandfathers, and Inheritances derived from them? And what better Reasons can we have to believe any of these things, than such as we have to believe that these men were, and wrote these Books? Truly he that will not believe that once a thing was, when all the evidence of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been is given him, which can be given of any thing past; must needs be a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Fool, and not to be discours'd withal, but laugh'd at. For at this rate, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ever was, and is not now, can be believed, without better evidence of it, than can be given if it was, which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. These men were sufficiently qualified for writing these Books. For all that can be thought necessary to qualify them for writing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65384:25"/>
these Books, is, <hi>First,</hi> Sufficient knowledg of the things whereof they wrote; and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Honesty, to write no other things than what they certainly knew.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We cannot in any reason suspect them to have wanted sufficient knowledg, because they had all opportunities of well informing themselves. They write either of the Life and Deeds of JESUS CHRIST, whereof they were Eye-witnesses; or of his Doctrine and Preaching, which they were Ear-witnesses of: Or else of the Deeds and Sufferings of themselves, and their Fellows, whereof they were either Actors and Sufferers, or Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>That which they had seen and heard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they unto us;</hi> and that in <hi>writing,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Ioh. I. 1, 2, 3. They have delivered these things to us, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and Ministers of the word. And it seem'd good unto them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had perfect understanding of all things from the beginning, to write unto others, that they also might know the certainty of these things,</hi> as we gather from St. <hi>Luke,</hi> chap. I. v. 2, 3, 4. Now that there was such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as JESUS CHRIST, that he was born in the Reign of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and was Crucified in the Regn of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sentenced to death by <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65384:26"/>
and that he had such <hi>Disciples</hi> and <hi>Followers,</hi> not only the Testimony of <hi>Christians,</hi> but that of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> bitter Enemies to Christianity, assures us. And what should hinder these men to have sufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of what they write?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have no less reason to believe they were honest men, who had no design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World. For</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> It is to be seen in their Writings by all who read them, that they professed and taught <hi>Sincerity, Truth, Simplicity, plain</hi> and <hi>upright Dealing;</hi> condemning all <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, Lying</hi> and <hi>Guile,</hi> as odious to GOD, and damnable in men; denouncing the heavy wrath and indignation of GOD against the Practicers of these Vices. And as they taught, so they lived; and for this they durst appeal to all who knew them. <hi>Ye are witnesses</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblameably we behaved our selves among you,</hi> 1 Thess. II. 10. <hi>We have renounced</hi> (saith he again) <hi>the hidden things of dishonestry, not walking in craftiness, not handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending our selves to every man's conscience in the sight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. IV. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65384:26"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the truth of the chief mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, which they relate; they were bold to appeal to the knowledg of great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes then living, who might easily have disproved them, had they told any falshood. They told them of the wonderful <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of JESUS, mentioning the very <hi>time</hi> of his Birth, the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>manner;</hi> his manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Shepherds,</hi> to the <hi>Wise-men</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi> his Persecution by <hi>Herod,</hi> with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Circumstances thereto belonging: His <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> some whereof thousands at once tasted of; his <hi>Death</hi> without <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> notorious to all; his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> witnessed by his appearing to hundreds; his visible <hi>Ascension</hi> into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: his sending the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> on the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> to the astonishment of many who heard the <hi>Apostles</hi> by him enabled to speak to every one in his own Language; and many more things of this kind, concerning some of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not afraid to tell <hi>Festus</hi> the Governour, in the presence of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa, The king knoweth of these things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom also I speak freely; for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner,</hi> Acts XXVI. 26. How easie now had it been for the <hi>Iews</hi> to have proved these men Lyars, had they been so? And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65384:27"/>
would they not have done it, if they could?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They were men but of a very mean Education, most of them, and of no le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>ning; and cannot reasonably be thought able to contrive, and invent what they write, of their own heads; and when they had done, to defend it so bravely as they did, for real truth. It must needs be supposed, they were instructed well in their business; and had a Teacher wiser, and more powerful too, than themselves; or indeed (as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) than all the World besides. And this was well known to be JESUS CHRIST the <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> of GOD; and his Holy <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> which He, according to his Promise, sent upon them <hi>(Acts</hi> II.) <hi>to guide them into all truth,</hi> Joh. XVI. 13. 'Twas He alone who could, as he had promised, <hi>give them a mouth and wisdom, which all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries were not able to gainsay, or resist, Luke</hi> XXI. 15. Indeed it appears, whatever their Education had been, they were, when they preached to the World, and wrote, men of good sense and understanding; who could teach a <hi>Religion,</hi> which now for above Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years hath prevail'd over the most learned part of Mankind: who could dispute with the Learned <hi>Grecians,</hi> Acts IX. 29. And though the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65384:27"/>
the most Learned <hi>Iews;</hi> Though they of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the <hi>Libertines,</hi> and <hi>Cyreni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> of <hi>Cicilia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> disputed with them; <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 9. Tho the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> encounter'd them, <hi>Acts</hi> XVII. 18. yet were none of these able to resist the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby they spake, <hi>Acts</hi> VI. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Supposing them men of Wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for such a Contrivance, yet can they not at the same time be thought such Fools too, as to contrive such things without any rational motive or inducement to it; surely, they must have some great things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto themselves, as the end for which they did this. They well foresaw, that what they did, would expose them to all the Evils of this World. And therefore when they first undertook it, they voluntarily left all they had in this World, to follow CHRIST. They were taught by him to <hi>deny themselves, and to take up the cross,</hi> Matth. XVI. 24. And told, that they must be sent as <hi>Sheep</hi> in the midst of <hi>Wolves;</hi> be deliver'd up to <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> and scourg'd in the <hi>Synagogues, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men for his name's sake,</hi> Matth. X. 16, 17, 22. <hi>That in this world they should have tribulation,</hi> John XVI. 33. and <hi>be persecuted,</hi> Joh. XV. 20. <hi>Put out of the Synagogues, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65384:28"/>
killed,</hi> Joh. XVI. 2. All this they knew, and expected. They went forth to preach a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which by the <hi>Wise-men</hi> of the World would be accounted <hi>foolishness,</hi> 1 Cor. I. 23. And look'd on themselves, as men <hi>set forth of God, as it were, appointed to death, and made a spectacle to the world,</hi> 1 Cor. IV. 9. <hi>They hungred and thirsted, were naked, and had no certain dwelling-place. Being reviled, they blessed; being persecuted, they suffer'd it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defamed, they intreated; they were made the filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things,</hi> 1 Cor. IV. 11. 2 Cor. IV. 8. They constantly and stoutly indured all that befell them; <hi>rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of IESUS,</hi> Acts V. 41. Certain then it is, that (as they prosessed) <hi>Their exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile; neither did they at any time use flattering words, nor a cloak of covetousness (as they</hi> call'd <hi>God to witness) neither of men sought they glory, 1 Thess.</hi> II. 3, 5. No, 'tis plain, they could not propound to themselves any worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Well then, either they did believe what they preach'd, and wrote, to be true, or they did not. If not, then did they, for the sake of a known and unprofitable <hi>Lye,</hi> forsake all that seems good in this World, even whilst they hoped for nothing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65384:28"/>
and then they must be no longer thought cunning and crafty men, but the sillest fools that ever were, and very mad-men. If they did believe themselves, and chearfully endured all these things for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading others to believe, what more can we desire to shew us, that they were honest and plain-dealing men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If it be said, That tho they were men of good sense and competent understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet as honest well-meaning men are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily deceiv'd, so might they be by his cunning whom they follow'd; and being seduced by him, might in simplicity of mind endeavour to deceive others. This will appear a vain Conceit, when 'tis consider'd, that he whom they follow'd, was JESUS, a Person well known, whilst on Earth, for his Life and Conversation among men. He taught open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and what he taught, notwithstanding his Divine Authority to command belief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bare word, he did not bid them simply believe, but try and examine. The <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom he preach'd, had all along received the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> as the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and for what he taught of himself, he appeals to those Scriptures. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (saith he) <hi>for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify of me,</hi> John V. 39. And this is not all,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65384:29"/>
but he appeals for the truth of his Doctrine, to the Works which he wrought before their eyes. <hi>The works</hi> (saith he) <hi>which my Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me,</hi> John V. 36. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him,</hi> John X. 37, 38. <hi>He was</hi> then <hi>a man approved of God among them, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him in the midst of them, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also knew,</hi> Acts II. 22. And after all, he himself suffered death for the confirmation of his Doctrine, and therefore could have no worldly end in deceiving his Disciples. But what greater evidence could they, or the World desire, that he did not deceive them, than this, That as he taught them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his Doctrine; so he gave them power to do the same kind of works, as he had done, for the confirmation of it: according to his promise, <hi>Iohn</hi> XIV. 12. <hi>He that believeth in me, the works that I do, shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father.</hi> They saw then what he did, and they felt in themselves what he had ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to do in his Name. Yea, many others saw, and felt in themselves the power
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65384:29"/>
and vertue of those works which they did. These works were done in the Streets and Market-places; in the Temple, and in the Synagogues; at their solemn Feasts, and in their most full Assemblies. So that <hi>the people hearing Christ, were astonish'd, saying, Whence hath this man these things? And what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</hi> Mark VI. 2. And the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they heard <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn, and perceived that they were unlearned, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, they marvelled, and they took know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, that they had been with IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS.</hi> And seeing a Miracle done by them, they confessed it, saying, <hi>That indeed a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miracle hath been done by them, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all them that dwell in Ierusalem, and we cannot deny it,</hi> Acts IV. 13, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Seeing 'tis said, these men might be deceived by JESUS, and so deceive others; let it be farther consider'd, What hopes either <hi>He</hi> or <hi>They</hi> could have, that such a Delusion should prevail. Had they such hope, or had they not? If not, would they suffer as they did, and as before-hand they knew they must, merely to promote, and carry on a Delusion which they had no hope would ever succeed? Will any one lose all he has, endure all pains and miseries, and a cruel death too, only to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65384:30"/>
have the satisfaction of attempting, what he thinks it in vain to attempt? Had they such hope? And whence had they it? Could they hope that the mighty Princes, and the great Scholars and Wise-men of the World could be deluded by them? Could they hope that all, or many, would give so much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a few mean and unlearned Men, as for their sakes to change their Opinions which they had suck'd in with their Mother's milk, wherein their Ancestors had lived and died; yea, and cast away their <hi>Gods</hi> too, whom they had so long worship'd, and by whom they thought themselves protected and made prosperous? They could never dream of such a thing, and 'tis plain that they built not their hope on their own Credit or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If they had done so, they would have set themselves out to the eye of the World in their best colours; they would have careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceal'd and hid their own Infirmities, and every thing which might lessen their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among men. But they were very free in laying open to publick view their own Blemishes and Failings, their Ignorances and their Sins. And certainly, this is not the custome of Deceivers, or of men that would be believed on the stock of their own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It is therefore plain, That the hope they had of having their Doctrine received,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65384:30"/>
was wholly founded on the Excellence of the Doctrine it self, and on the Power of him from whom they had it. They doubted not therefore to leave it to shift for it self, and to be tried by its own apparent goodness. They fear'd not, but he who sent them to preach it, would own it, and give it acceptance where it pleased him it should be embraced; and finally recompence them abundantly for all their Sufferings.</p>
            <p>These things all consider'd, no man can have reason to doubt of their honesty. And they being found both <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> they wanted nothing to qualify them for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these things. And therefore we can have no cause to distrust them, telling us that they wrote the <hi>word of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And now if after all this, we find that these mens writings are such, as have all the Characters of Divine Truth, what more can we desire?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Matters revealed in them, are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy of GOD to reveal, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Man to know.</item>
               <item>2. The Manner of their Revelation is such, that the hand of GOD doth visibly appear in it.</item>

3. The Success which the Doctrine of these Writings hath had, is such, as none but GOD could give it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In sum, They are such things, as if there be a GOD, we would judge it most fit for him to make known; and such as are made known in such a manner, as we would think it most proper for him to reveal them in; and such as have had such success, as we would think it well becoming him to give them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Matters contained in the Holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are such things as are truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of GOD, if there be one, to reveal; and necessary for us men to know.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The History of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, and of all things in it, and of Man especially; of God's <hi>Universal Providence,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and of his <hi>Special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> over those that serve him; Of his <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> executed on the Wicked, and his special <hi>Mercies</hi> to, and <hi>Deliverances</hi> wrought for the Righteous; this is certainly apt to beget in us the most high thoughts and esteem of GOD; the greatest Reverence, and most humble Adoration of the <hi>Divine Majesty;</hi> the most free submission, and chearful Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him, and an entire Dependance on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65384:31"/>
him, as our <hi>Maker, Owner, Preserver</hi> and <hi>Governor;</hi> on whose <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> depends our Life and Happiness, and whose <hi>Displeasure</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> must needs be our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. And can we think it unbecoming GOD to acquaint us with this? or needless for us to know it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. To have a true Information of the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Goodness</hi> of GOD to us <hi>Men,</hi> even from first to last: Of his Making Man at first in his own <hi>Image,</hi> with an <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> and a <hi>Beautiful Body,</hi> and his providing all things needful for the good and welfare of both; and his giving him the <hi>Dominion</hi> over, and the free <hi>use</hi> of most other Creatures. How Man fell from this good and honourable State, into all manner of Misery, by disobeying GOD. How the World, the good Work of GOD, became both so wicked, and so full of Troubles and Sorrows. What wise and gracious Methods GOD has used to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in all Ages, and in the midst of a world of wickedness, an holy Generation of People for himself; and what wonderful means he hath of his Infinite Goodness through JESUS CHRIST provided for us; whereby, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our natural <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Guilt,</hi> we may yet again be restored to his <hi>Favour,</hi> and our <hi>Blessedness.</hi>

3. To afford us such a sight of GOD's <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> as we are capable of in this life; his <hi>Majesty, Immensity, Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be understood of him, in order to our <hi>Duty</hi> towards him, and <hi>Happiness</hi> in him. To open unto us those unfathomable <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> of the Incomprehensible TRINITY in UNITY, One undivided GOD in the Three distinct <hi>Persons</hi> of FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST; of the wonderful INCARNATION of the Eternal SON of GOD for the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Sinners; of his <hi>Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and coming again to <hi>Iudgment.</hi> Of the Miraculous sending of the HOLY GHOST, his Inspiring of the <hi>Apostles</hi> with <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> befitting their Office.

To give us <hi>Laws</hi> whereby we are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our selves, and such Laws as our own <hi>Reason</hi> being made judge, are most <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Iust,</hi> and <hi>Good;</hi> all visibly tending to advance among us the Honour and Glory of GOD who gave them, and promote the Happiness of Men to whom they are given; binding us to nothing but to pay unto GOD such a <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as we must confess we <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65384:32"/>
owe him, and are by our Nature fitted to pay him; to do our selves and others all the good we can, and no hurt at all; and to do every one of us what lies in our-power to make this world, whilst we live in it, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, peaceable, and comfortable place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation to us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To certifie us, What shall become of us, when by <hi>Death</hi> we shall go out of this world; what <hi>Rewards</hi> there are for the Good, and what <hi>Punishments</hi> for the Wicked: To shew us the twofold Eternal Future State of <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Misery;</hi> and that our present Life is our Time of <hi>Trial</hi> and of <hi>Discipline;</hi> and as we behave our selves, doth certainly bring us to one of these two. To assure us, That our <hi>Souls</hi> do never dye, and that our <hi>Bodies</hi> after <hi>Corruption,</hi> shall be rais'd again <hi>Incorruptible:</hi> And that we must in <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> be brought to <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and by the Laws under which we have lived, be either finally <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> or <hi>acquitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let any one say, what things he can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if there be a GOD, more worthy of <hi>Him</hi> to reveal, or more needful for <hi>us</hi> to know, than such as these. Could we be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed in the Knowledge of either GOD or <hi>our selves?</hi> Could we be better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected how to Honour GOD, or to do good to our selves? Could we have had any greater

               <hi>Encouragements</hi> to Goodness, or any greater <hi>Discouragements</hi> to live wickedly? Could we desire a fairer or more satisfactory account of things not otherwise knowable, and yet fit to be known by us? Had we not been at an utter loss, and in a lamentable confusion about these things, had they not been thus revealed to us? Have any of the wisest men in the world been able to give us any rational ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or but indifferent satisfaction about the <hi>Original</hi> of the World, or of us Men, or of what shall be after <hi>Death;</hi> what we may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear or hope for? In what a confounded state had we been, and what very <hi>Beasts</hi> must we have lived and died, without some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these things? And who could ever have made us know these things, but GOD? And can we then any longer think, that these things are not most worthy of GOD to make known unto men?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner of <hi>Revelation</hi> is such, that the Hand of GOD doth visibly appear in it.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Atheist</hi> would, for his satisfaction, <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> GOD speak. If it will satisfie him, That GOD hath been <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> speaking, he hath been <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> both, so as any one can conceive that he could be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>heard;</hi> that is, in <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>audible</hi> significations and tokens of his Divine <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> Thus did GOD call upon, and talk with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> both before and after they had sinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> II. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> III. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he appeared and spake unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> XV. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> XVII. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> XVIII. 1, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus did he appear and speak unto <hi>Moses,</hi> in a Flame of Fire in a Bush, <hi>Exod.</hi> III. 2. And so he did to the <hi>Israelites</hi> from the Mount, <hi>in fire and smoke, the noise of a trumpet, with thundrings and lightnings,</hi> Exod. XIX. 18, 19, 20. I need not say how often, and how many ways
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65384:34"/>
GOD hath so manifested himself speaking unto men.</p>
            <p>But it may be the <hi>Atheist</hi> will say, If he himself could see or hear GOD speaking, he would believe it to be <hi>His</hi> Word which he heard. And truly if he be of this mind, that he will believe nothing but what he himself sees and hears, he is too great a fool to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned into any thing, and therefore not to be discours'd with at all. It has been already shew'd, what reason we have to believe that these men speak <hi>Truth,</hi> who tell us all this of GOD. And if he will not believe upon the best evidence that can be given of a thing, tho it was, he cannot believe at all. However, suppose he should <hi>himself</hi> see or hear what <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> heard and saw: Or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he should see the <hi>Church</hi> fill'd, as the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> of old, with a <hi>Cloud</hi> or Smoke; or hear a <hi>Voice</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> as that from between the <hi>Cherubims</hi> over the <hi>Mercy-Seat;</hi> or suppose he should hear and see such a <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> as those at the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of CHRIST, <hi>Luke</hi> III. 22. Or at the <hi>Conversion of St.</hi> Paul, Acts IX. 3, 4. Or at the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> on the <hi>Mount<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi> Matt. 17. 5. Or suppose he should hear GOD calling upon him, as he did upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> by his name, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3, 4. Would he not (as that Child did before <hi>Eli</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65384:34"/>
better instructed him), think it the voice of some other, or account of it but as a <hi>Dream</hi> or a <hi>Fancy?</hi> If he say again, He would be satisfied thus, and otherwise he cannot; then I answer, That it is not in the power of man to say any thing that may satisfie him; and it is much to be fear'd, that GOD will not give him any other satisfaction. For is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect that GOD should, merely to humour every obstinate Fool, shew himself every day, or as often as a wicked man plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and just in such a manner as he would have him; and for no other cause, but because he is sullen and unreasonable, and will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing that GOD hath formerly said or done, to satisfie him? Why should GOD have such hard measure from him, above all others? Will he not believe he hath his Father's <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> unless his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself, whenever he requires it, come from the dead to tell him so? And why must GOD, who hath given him his <hi>Will</hi> in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, sufficiently attested, appear as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, to confirm it anew unto him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much of the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD has been given unto us by way of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> foretelling things to come, which are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of <hi>His</hi> Knowledge only: And the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> have been notoriously and undeniably fulfilled; I mean, so many of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65384:35"/>
them as were to be fulfilled before the days wherein we now live; and if these have been so fulfilled, we can have no cause to doubt, but all the rest will be so too, when the time shall come. Now things to come, are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd not to be within the compass of man's knowledge, especially such as depend not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily on Natural Causes, or are not wont to follow one another in the ordinary course and order of Nature. We are all of us very sure, That <hi>we know not what shall be on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> James IV. 14. <hi>We cannot tell what a day,</hi> (no, not what the next hour or minute) <hi>may bring forth,</hi> Prov. XXVII. 1. Nay, we know not certainly, whether or no there shall be another day, or who shall live to see it, or in what condition it will find us. We are not only ignorant of such future things as are of least concernment to us, which we have little desire to know, or see no reason to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but of the things which we most long to know, and would account it a very great satisfaction to be assured of. We know not whether we shall be at ease or in pain, sick or in health, alive or dead, the very next day or hour: We know not whether we shall be rich or poor, or have any meat to eat, or be able to eat it, if we have it; so uncertain are all future things to us. Yet we are sure, there have been <hi>Prophecies</hi> of things to come, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65384:35"/>
very true ones too: Men have foretold things many hundreds of years before-hand, which came to pass in all Circumstances of <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> as they had been foretold. Some indeed have been bold enough to foretel things by human <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Skill,</hi> but have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befool'd thereby both themselves, and all that trusted to them. If any of them have sometimes guess'd right, 'twas either, <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>Chance;</hi> as he that guesseth a Thousand times, has ill luck if he guess not right once or twice; tho he knows no more when he doth so, than when he guesseth wrong. Or he saves his credit by <hi>Craft</hi> and <hi>Cunning,</hi> as most of the old <hi>Oracles,</hi> and our <hi>Astrologers,</hi> who utter their <hi>Predictions</hi> in ambiguous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are capable of a double Sense and Construction: If things happen as you understood their words, they have got Credit without any reason for it; and if things fall out otherwise than you understood them, they can tell you, You were mistaken in their meaning, and they meant as it hath hapned. 'Tis true also, That when men will not hearken to the Truth of GOD, he may give them up to <hi>Delusion,</hi> and may suffer a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to hit on a Truth, to make way for the belief of a Lye, as a very just Punishment of an unreasonable Infidelity. But <hi>they</hi> only, whose Knowledg of Things Future, they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65384:36"/>
themselves confess'd to be of GOD, and not acquired by Human <hi>Art,</hi> and whose design it was, to draw men off from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and every evil thing, to the Worship and Service of the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Living God;</hi> have constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without failing, foretold things tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the <hi>Event</hi> hath always verified their <hi>Predictions.</hi> And who but GOD alone, who governs and disposeth of all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Eternal Decree and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, could make them so knowing? In the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> we have many such <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi> As concerning the Carrying of the <hi>Iews</hi> Captive into <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> their Restoration to their own Countrey by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> The Succession of the Four Famous <hi>Monarchies</hi> in <hi>Daniel:</hi> The Coming of our <hi>Lord</hi> JESUS, and his Sufferings: The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Destruction of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: And these things, with many more there foretold, have been unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably fulfilled. And is not this a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that these mens <hi>Prophecies</hi> were GOD's own <hi>Word? Let them bring forth their strong reasons</hi> (saith GOD by his Prophet) <hi>and shew us what shall happen: Let them shew the former things what they be, that we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; or declare us things for to come. Shew us the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods,</hi> Isa. XLI. 22, 23.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65384:36"/>
               <hi>Tell ye, and bring them near, let them take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel together. Who hath told it from that time? Have not I the LORD? And there is no GOD else besides me,</hi> Isa. XLV. 21. <hi>I am GOD, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My Counsel shall stand, and I will do all my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> Isa. XLVI. 10, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Word hath been deliver'd with <hi>Miracles</hi> to confirm it, which are the Works of <hi>Divine Power</hi> only. We know that it is not in the Power of Man, or of any thing else, but of the Great GOD of <hi>Nature,</hi> and LORD of the World, to <hi>alter</hi> any thing in the Course of <hi>Nature;</hi> to do things which <hi>exceed</hi> the Power of <hi>Natural</hi> Causes, or to make things act quite <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> When therefore we see such things done, we must acknowledg a Power above all Natural Power whereby they are done. Yet is it as certain as <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Observation</hi> can make it, that such things have been done, and by those very men from whom we have what we call the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD.</p>
            <p>Indeed, all things in the World, from the greatest to the least, are truly wonderful to us; as being far above, not only our <hi>Skill</hi> to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> but also our <hi>Reason</hi> throughly to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;</hi> yet we call not all things <hi>Miracles,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65384:37"/>
Only such things as <hi>rarely</hi> happen, and not according to the <hi>ordinary</hi> course of Nature, are accounted Miracles. As when the <hi>Fire</hi> refuseth to burn those that are cast into it; when the <hi>Water</hi> divides it self, and stands up like two walls on each hand, to let men pass through it on dry ground; when the <hi>Sun</hi> stands still in Heaven, and doubles the length of the day; When men without any <hi>Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Art or help, by a <hi>touch</hi> or a <hi>word</hi> only, either take away, or restore <hi>sight, hearing, health</hi> and <hi>strength;</hi> dispossess <hi>Devils,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Seas,</hi> take <hi>life</hi> from the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> and give <hi>life</hi> to the <hi>dead.</hi> These things <hi>above</hi> the power, and <hi>contrary</hi> to the course of Nature, are <hi>Miracles.</hi> And these, with others many, have been done. Not indeed <hi>every day,</hi> and <hi>ordinarily;</hi> for then would they have been disregarded as <hi>common</hi> things, and cease to be <hi>Wonders.</hi> Not <hi>secretly</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor in some close <hi>corners</hi> only; for then few could have <hi>witnessed,</hi> and fewer would have <hi>believed</hi> them. Neither yet were they done upon any <hi>slight</hi> or <hi>trivial</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; for then would they have been look'd on only as <hi>Casualties</hi> and odd <hi>Chances.</hi> But they were done <hi>rarely,</hi> to encrease the <hi>wonder;</hi> yet <hi>openly,</hi> to gain <hi>belief;</hi> and upon <hi>special</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> Occasions, that the <hi>Cause</hi> might be more noted. <hi>They</hi> who did them, own'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65384:37"/>
that it was GOD who <hi>extraordinarily</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, and that not for <hi>their</hi> sakes; but for his <hi>own Glory,</hi> and in confirmation of the <hi>truth</hi> of what he had sent them to teach. In a word, all was to make GOD known unto men, and to persuade men to seek their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in him. By such Works did GOD bear witness to his own <hi>Word.</hi> And every one but a Fool will say, <hi>Blessed be the LORD GOD of Israel, who only doth wondrous things,</hi> Psal. LXXII. 18. <hi>Thou art great, and dost wondrous things; thou art GOD alone,</hi> Psal. LXXXVI. 10. <hi>Understand ye brutish among the people, and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</hi> Psal. XCIV. 8. <hi>Whoso is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD,</hi> Psal. CVII. 43.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Success</hi> which the <hi>Doctrine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the holy SCRIPTURE hath had, has been such, as none but GOD alone could give it. If the Men, who wrote these Books we speak of, had not given great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the World, that they spake from GOD; how came the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they taught, to gain <hi>belief?</hi> How came it so to take root, and grow, and spread, as it hath unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably done? Why have not its Enemies, the <hi>Wise-men</hi> of this World, after so much strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Wits, and using all their <hi>Art</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65384:38"/>
               <hi>Policy</hi> to that end, been yet able to convince men of its <hi>solly, vanity</hi> or <hi>falshood?</hi> Why have not all the Mighty <hi>Powers</hi> on Earth, bending their whole force against it, been able to suppress and stifle it? Whatever Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems the <hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> could invent, have been made use of to this purpose. <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> conspired together to crush it in the Egg. <hi>The Heathen raged, and the people ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a vain thing. The Kings of the earth set themselves, and the Rulers took counsel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, against the LORD, and against his Anointed; saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> prophesied of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> II. 1, 2, 3. The <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth have persecuted this <hi>Religion</hi> with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword.</hi> The <hi>Lusts</hi> of mens hearts rise up in open war against it continually. Yet hath it taken root and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd; it has conquer'd, and made the most wonderful change imaginable in mens hearts and lives. This success it has had, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a few <hi>simple</hi> ones, easily deceived; but among the most <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> and <hi>judicious.</hi> And what can this be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, but to the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Divine Truth? Indeed by its own light men may easily see all things in it, which can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to commend it to all who think fit to be govern'd by Reason, as all but <hi>Fools</hi> do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65384:38"/>
If it be said, That <hi>Idolatry</hi> is yet reigning over the greatest part of the World; and the foolish Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath had very wonderful Success, and hath triumph'd over, and quite extinguished <hi>Christianity</hi> in many places; so that the least part of the World is at this day <hi>Christian;</hi> And therefore the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine</hi> gains little credit by its <hi>success</hi> in the World. In answer to this, we say these things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whichsoever of these Religions, <hi>Heathenism, Mahometism,</hi> or <hi>Christianity,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail most, or be thought truest; yet is it true still, That all the World is of some <hi>Religion,</hi> and owns a GOD. And therefore this is noOb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against what we at first undertook to prove, <hi>That there is a GOD;</hi> Only it may seem to weaken one of our <hi>Arguments,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we would prove this. But indeed it doth not weaken it at all.</p>
            <p>For <hi>secondly,</hi> We are now only proving, that our <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD; and this is but one of the many <hi>Arguments</hi> we use to that end; and the rest are convincive enough without it. So that should this Argument fail us, yet our whole Argument, whereby we would, from our having the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, prove that there is a GOD, stands good. But nether doth our argument fail
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65384:39"/>
us, but proves what we would prove by it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>thirdly,</hi> We say not, that the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Doctrine is receiv'd by <hi>all</hi> men, or by <hi>most</hi> men, or by <hi>more</hi> than they who are of other Religions. All we say is this, It was in a very <hi>short</hi> time received in <hi>most</hi> parts of the then <hi>known</hi> World; though for the sins of them who profess'd it, GOD hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd it in many places to be rooted out again. Nor doth this lessen its <hi>Credit,</hi> but rather confirms its <hi>truth.</hi> For this is the same which it self foretold, and shews the care that GOD takes of it; who as he will not suffer it to be quite lost, so neither will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways afford it them who abuse it. Thus was it foretold to the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Rev. II. 5. <hi>I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy Candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.</hi> And thus it happen'd to that and other Churches. Accordingly as our Blessed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS had told the <hi>Iews,</hi> Matth. XXI. 43. <hi>The Kingdom of GOD shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.</hi> Though therefore <hi>Heathenism</hi> or <hi>Mahometism</hi> fill more of the World than <hi>Christianity,</hi> yet hath the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine had the <hi>success</hi> which we speak of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though at this day it prevails not over <hi>most</hi> of the World, yet it flourisheth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65384:39"/>
in the most <hi>Civilized</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> parts of it. Whereas <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Mahometism</hi> prevail on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the more <hi>rude, illiterate, barbarous</hi> and <hi>brutish</hi> sort of People.</p>
            <p>Beside this, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it hath had the <hi>success</hi> we speak of, by <hi>fair, rational</hi> and <hi>indearing</hi> Methods, by gentle <hi>Persuasions,</hi> and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Reasons;</hi> by its own visible <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>goodness;</hi> by the power of <hi>Miracles;</hi> without any use of <hi>force</hi> or <hi>violence:</hi> But other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions prevail only upon the account of <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Custom,</hi> and an <hi>Affectation</hi> of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the steps of <hi>Forefathers;</hi> or else by <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>Compulsion, Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Other Religions are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, by keeping men in <hi>ignorance,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of the means of <hi>knowledge.</hi> And it is no wonder that the greatest part of the World is still in <hi>error,</hi> when the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> is shut out from it. They can <hi>chuse</hi> no better, who are suffer'd to <hi>know</hi> no better. But the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion seeks not for the advantage of mens <hi>blindness,</hi> and being in the dark. 'Twas sent <hi>To open mens eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD,</hi> Acts XXVI. 18. It chargeth all it meets with, to <hi>Prove all things, and hold fast that which is good,</hi> 1 Thess. V. 21. If it prevail among men, 'tis by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>knowledge.</hi> Men chuse
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65384:40"/>
other Religions as blind-men do beauties, by <hi>chance.</hi> And so the most deformed is all one with the most handsome. But <hi>Christians</hi> chuse by <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Other Religions do favour and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men's <hi>Corruptions,</hi> and humor <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood.</hi> But the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion proclaims open war against these; crosseth mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations, contradicts their natural Humors, commands them to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their own Wills, mortifies their darling Lusts, crucifies the Flesh, destroys Selfishness, commen is patience, lays the Cross in their way and injoins them to bear it in hope of things not yet seen, and far off. That other Religions prevail, what wonder is it? Neither can it be any argument that they are of GOD. Men can easily invent, and are ready to embrace, and will be very fond of, and not easily change a Religion that indulgeth their <hi>Lusts.</hi> But that <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> commanding men to offer violence to themselves, and to part freely with what they love best, should be receiv'd by any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of men, is very wonderful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and shews it to be of GOD. The power of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> is enough to make men embrace other Religions; but the Power of GOD only, and of <hi>supernatural</hi> Grace, could prevail with men to accept of <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65384:40"/>
I have now done with the <hi>first</hi> Argument, to prove it reasonable to believe, that <hi>there is a GOD;</hi> and have shewn, that if the <hi>Atheist</hi> would have GOD shew himself to be, by some such <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>audible</hi> significations and tokens of his being, as we are capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him by, he has all the reason that can be to believe that he hath done so. And I have insisted the longer upon this Point, that in shewing the <hi>folly</hi> of the <hi>Atheist,</hi> I might at once shew the <hi>folly</hi> of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturist;</hi> and that he is as well a <hi>Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> who denies the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, as he that says, <hi>There is no GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If this kind of <hi>manifestation</hi> of himself, which GOD hath given us in his <hi>Word,</hi> will not suffice; how else would the <hi>Atheist</hi> have him to manifest himself for his satisfaction? Will he be satisfied, if it be shew'd him, That GOD hath imprinted such a sense of his being in mens minds, that they are not only capable of perceiving, but generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to acknowledge this truth? I am now to shew him, that GOD hath done this, and that Mankind hath generally been very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there is a GOD.</p>
            <p>Indeed we have the Testimony of <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>els</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>ure us of this; and one would think this should be enough; for when every
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65384:41"/>
thing that hath reason, bears witness of a thing, he that yet disbelieves it, must confess that he doth so against all the Reason in the World; and he that contradicts all Reason, must needs be a <hi>Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Testimony of <hi>Angels,</hi> 'tis in vain to trouble the <hi>Atheist</hi> with it; for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are <hi>invisible Spirits;</hi> and for the same reason that he denies there is a GOD, he will also deny that there are any invisible <hi>Spirits;</hi> seeing these can no otherwise appear, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest themselves unto men, than we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shew'd that GOD hath done. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>

men, whom we could hear of, in the World.</p>
            <p>Must it not be a very foolish thing in any man, to make himself confident of a thing, whereof <hi>first</hi> he can have no degree of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and <hi>secondly,</hi> whereof the generality of men think themselves very sure? There can hardly be a clearer evidence of one's being a <hi>Fool,</hi> than this, That he takes himself to be <hi>wiser</hi> than all the World besides; and that too in holding an Opinion, wherein he cannot pretend to any <hi>evidence</hi> at all to ground it upon. Let us therefore here consider these things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There has not been, at any <hi>time,</hi> in any <hi>place,</hi> any <hi>People,</hi> discover'd upon the face of the whole Earth, that hath not own'd a GOD. The most <hi>barbarous, wild,</hi> and even <hi>brutish</hi> People, without any kind of <hi>Learning,</hi> or common <hi>Civility,</hi> in their Manners hardly distinguishable from the Beasts of the Field by any thing else but this, have been found to have some sort of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> among them. Though many of them have had no knowledge of the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>living</hi> GOD, for want of instruction; yet would they rather fall down, and worship any thing, either in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or upon <hi>Earth,</hi> yea the very <hi>Devils</hi> themselvs, than nothing at all. So deeply is this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65384:42"/>
truth, that <hi>there is a GOD,</hi> ingraven, as it were in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ever yet eraze, or wear it quite out. Even that gross <hi>Idolatry</hi> which reigns over so great a part of the World, is enough to shame the <hi>Atheist;</hi> for thereby is it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that the World hath never counted any thing more absurd and foolish, than to think that <hi>there is no GOD.</hi> Men not knowing who is the <hi>true</hi> GOD, were yet so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there must be <hi>some</hi> GOD; that they would worship any thing, that they thought could do them either good or hurt, rather than nothing at all.</p>
            <p>And as this was the belief of <hi>all</hi> in general; so look by how much any Nation was more <hi>civilized</hi> and cultivated by good <hi>Literature;</hi> o much the more care there was taken about <hi>Religion,</hi> as among the <hi>Egyptians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> And such <hi>Persons</hi> as had the best opportunities, and greatest abilities, for the search and discovery of Truth, were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied themselves, and took pains to satisfy others in the reasonableness of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And <hi>lastly,</hi> they above others, who with good reason were esteem d the <hi>best</hi> of men; I mean such as endeavour'd to do the World most good; who lived virtuously, and justly, and did what they could to make men the better, and the happier for them; were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65384:42"/>
the most zealous and earnest Promoters and Maintainers of this belief. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis apparent, that Mankind <hi>generally,</hi> and more <hi>especiall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If any shall object, That it is upon Record, that there have been some <hi>Atheists</hi> in the World, and therefore 'tis not true, that we have the <hi>Universal</hi> Consent of Mankind. The Answer to this Objection is very easie.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many of them who were call'd <hi>Atheists,</hi> were not so indeed; but the most <hi>Religious</hi> Persons of their time. It was not because they denied that there is a GOD, but because they denied those <hi>Idols,</hi> which the Heathens worshipped, to be Gods indeed, that those blinded <hi>Idolaters</hi> called them <hi>Atheists.</hi> And upon this account it was, that the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> of old were by those <hi>Idolaters</hi> charg'd with <hi>Atheism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose some <hi>few</hi> have denied that there is a GOD; yet were they so few, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, in comparison of the rest who own'd a GOD, that they ought not to be once named in opposition to a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65384:43"/>
If, I say, The generality of Mankind have Eyes and Sight, is it reasonable to say, it is not true, because an odd man here or there is born blind? If, I say, Men are Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures; will any think it a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent confutation of this, that he can shew me now and then a natural Fool? With as little reason, when I say, Men generally own a GOD, can any one object, it is not true; because he can name one or two odd men, in so many Millions, that have been so blind and foolish, as not to see and know, what all others see and know.</p>
            <p n="3">3. These few that have denied a GOD, had not been taken so much notice of, had they not been <hi>very few</hi> indeed; and for their <hi>rarity</hi> it is, that they were then <hi>wonder'd</hi> at, and since are <hi>recorded</hi> in History. But as they were noted for the <hi>singularity</hi> of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so were they <hi>hated</hi> for their <hi>wickedness,</hi> branded as <hi>infamous,</hi> and as <hi>Enemies</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The World was weary of them; and as soon as any one began to be suspected to be of this Opinion, his <hi>Citizens</hi> banish'd him out of their Society, as one unfit to live among Mankind. Which is an Argument, that it is so natural to men to own a GOD, that he who do h not so, has ever been look'd on as a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65384:43"/>
4. These very few, how confident soever, could never produce any considerable <hi>reasons</hi> for their opinion; and to talk confidently without reason, is but to rave like one in a high Feaver, and not worthy to be heeded. Now the <hi>Athiest</hi> hath so little to say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he has not been able to make many believe, That ever he believed himself in this point; insomuch that it is at this day a great <hi>Question</hi> disputed among Learned Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there can be such a thing as an <hi>Atheist in Iudgment.</hi> It can hardly be said in propriety of speech, that a man believes what he can shew no reason for believing: And therefore whilst the <hi>Atheist</hi> can give no reason for what he saith, saying, There is no GOD; we may say, <hi>He doth not believe there is a GOD;</hi> but it seems we cannot say, <hi>He believes there is none.</hi> And the main Reason of his <hi>Unbelief,</hi> (for it is no more) when well search'd into, will be found no other, but that very same upon which there are too many <hi>Unbelievers</hi> now. The love of Wickedness makes the thoughts of a GOD very uneasie to men, and they are very unwilling to entertain a Belief that will not suffer them to fulfil their Lusts with Peace of Mind.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Remember, That as we have read and heard of some <hi>Atheists;</hi> so also have we read or heard this also of them; That for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65384:44"/>
all the shifts they could make, they could not so fully satisfie themselves, as to quiet their own <hi>Consciences.</hi> Bluster indeed they would, and make a noise in the day-time, as if they fear'd nothing: Business and Company di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them from talking much with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or entring upon serious thoughts: But when night came, and silence was made; when they were alone and at leisure, and had nothing to do but to think; whenever their thoughts were fixt on this subject, their fears also came along with them, and they could not so easily as they desired, get quit of that GOD, whom they used so confidently to defie. Indeed there are too many who take a too effectual course to prevent this trouble; they are very careful to keep their heads day and night so full of the world, and of their Lusts and Vanities, that the thoughts of GOD can find no room: And thus they constantly busie their minds, till sleep arrests them. But take any thinking man, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himself at all about GOD, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, who is willing sometimes to think what he is, whence he came, and whither he shall go when he dies; and he shall never be able to satisfie himself so fully, that there is no GOD, but he will find himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afraid that there is; and more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he thinks himself near dying, or in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65384:44"/>
any great danger. The Bloody Emperor, that would own no GOD but himself, would, when it Thundred, run under his bed to hide himself. And one that denied a GOD all his life long, grew very sad upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and being ask'd by them who heard his sighs, If he believed there is a GOD, and if it was that which made him sigh? No, (saith he) I do not believe it, only I am thinking in what a sad condition I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be, if there be one, as I know not but there is. And possibly we may have heard of one, too well known of many, of whom 'tis said, that notwithstanding his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boasts and great confidence, he durst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be alone in the dark, or go to sleep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a candle lighted up by him.</p>
            <p>Lay this together, and then say, if he be not a <hi>Fool,</hi> who contrary to the general Sense and Reason of Mankind, will needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that there is no GOD? Is not he a Fool, who dares conclude, That (except him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and it may be two or three more just like himself whom the world, of all others, could best spare, and whom it could heartily wish to be rid of), all men in the world have been either <hi>Knaves</hi> in making, or <hi>Fools</hi> in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Lye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But this Argument from the general sense of Mankind; is yet capable of a farther
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65384:45"/>
improvement. For it is to be consider'd <hi>How,</hi> and upon what account, the whole World should in this one point come to be of the same belief.</p>
            <p>It is not an ordinary thing, to find great multitudes of people, all of <hi>One</hi> mind, about matters of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>near</hi> concernment, if they be not very obvious and plain either to <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Reason.</hi> Men stand divided into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions about many things, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways of <hi>Religious Worship;</hi> and are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one another, as Light and Darkness, even in their choice of the <hi>gods</hi> whom they worship. How is it then, that they all so unanimously consent in this <hi>First Principle</hi> of Religion, That there is a GOD to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped? This is not a thing obvious to <hi>Sense.</hi> It is not strange, that all should agree, That there is a <hi>Sun</hi> in the Heavens, giving light to the world, because they <hi>see</hi> it. But they see not GOD. How then are they all agreed in this too, That there is a GOD, unless this be as obvious to <hi>Reason,</hi> as the other is to Sense? And if it be so, he that denies it, must be a <hi>Fool,</hi> for denying what is obvious to the <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can think of no more but two ways, whereby men should be brought universally to consent in a thing of so weighty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65384:45"/>
which is not obvious to their senses: Either, <hi>First,</hi> The Being of a GOD is a thing so imprinted in <hi>Nature,</hi> that the <hi>Reason</hi> of man cannot be awake, and consider things, but it must needs perceive it. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men have been taught it at first, and have successively taught it to one another, from the beginning. And take which we will of these, and it will be found a most <hi>reasonable</hi> thing to believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If this be a Truth imprinted in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> so that it cannot be worn out by time, and become invisible, but so soon as men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the use of Reason, and make use of it as they ought, they cannot but see it; Then whosoever saith, That there is no GOD, must needs be a <hi>Fool.</hi> For he must needs be a <hi>Fool,</hi> who persuades, or endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade himself, a thing is not, which it is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to him to discern, and which he can no sooner open, and use as he ought, the Eye of his <hi>Soul</hi> to look after, but he must needs see it. If then it be <hi>Natural</hi> to men, by the use of <hi>Reason</hi> to discern the Being of a GOD; and if this be the reason why men generally (notwithstanding all their other disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) are agreed in this Belief; then is it both <hi>Reasonable</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; and if any one believes it not, it is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65384:46"/>
because he is not a <hi>Perfect Man,</hi> but is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in some Faculty <hi>essential</hi> to Mankind: It must be either because he wants the use of Reason, or because he will not use it; and whichsoever it be, no man can deny him to be a <hi>Fool:</hi> For what is it else to be a <hi>Fool,</hi> but either to <hi>want</hi> the common use of Reason, or to make no good use of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If men have been at first taught this, and so have taught it one another suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively throughout all generations, to this day; and thus it hath been universally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a Truth by <hi>Instruction,</hi> and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Tradition,</hi> throughout all Ages and Parts of the World; This must also be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a very good reason to believe it true, and that it could come <hi>originally</hi> from no other but GOD himself.</p>
            <p>Yet here the <hi>Atheist</hi> will needs imagine, that he has gain'd a considerable advantage. Some cunning men, (saith he) for ends of their own which they would serve by it, set abroach this Opinion; and most men, seeing how useful it proved for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Order and good Government, easily entertained it; and <hi>Rulers,</hi> finding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it to themselves, have done all they could to countenance it, and have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished all that question'd it: And thus, tho
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65384:46"/>
but a <hi>Politick Invention</hi> at first, it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd at length, as a <hi>certain Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we had no other Reasons but mere <hi>Tradition</hi> for the Belief of a GOD, I confess what is here said, might seem more <hi>plausible;</hi> and yet, when well consider'd, not very <hi>credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> However, it is no more, but one of the Fools <hi>May-be's,</hi> on which he is content to venture his <hi>Soul,</hi> and all his <hi>Happiness,</hi> and I think him no less a <hi>Fool</hi> for that: He ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, it may be thus; but dare he say, He knows it is thus indeed? No; but he is so afraid of all thoughts of a GOD, that he is willing to have any thing thought true, rather than that it should be thought that there is a GOD, to whom he must give an account of himself. It is certain, that the world generally has believed, there is a GOD, the <hi>Atheist</hi> cannot deny that: And we all know by experience, That all men are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt, in matters of so weighty concernment, to be of one opinion, where the thing is not very obvious to Sense or Reason. The <hi>Atheist</hi> knows this too: And yet rather than it shall be thought, that it is so agreeable to <hi>Reason,</hi> that men cannot but generally consent in it, without seeming enemies to Reason; the <hi>Atheist</hi> will again set his <hi>Fancy</hi> a-work, to imagine what else <hi>may be.</hi> And what has he now hit upon? Why, It may be the whole
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65384:47"/>
World has been always <hi>deceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, he knows not by whom, into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a GOD. It is an endless thing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>Dreams,</hi> a Sick-man's <hi>Ravings,</hi> or a Fool's <hi>Fancies.</hi> However, let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is already said, That the <hi>Atheist</hi> cannot pretend to know what he saith, to be true; but saith only, It may be so for ought he knows. And then for us to say, It may not be so, for ought he knows, is answer enough to all he has said, and to prove him a <hi>Fool</hi> too for saying it: For if it either may be, or may not be so for ought he knows, he's a Fool for venturing his Soul upon its being so. The World is now some Hundreds above Five Thousand Years old, and no man in this long tract of time could ever yet discover this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery here imagined: No man could ever find out who it was that first set abroach this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; or in what Age or Part of the World it first began; or indeed where at any time it was not, or that ever there was a time when it was not the Universal Opinion of Mankind. It is as old, as is the memory of Man upon the Earth; for the very first Man that has been heard of in the World, was of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And whatever <hi>History</hi> gives us any account of <hi>Men,</hi> since the appearance of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65384:47"/>
               <hi>First</hi> man, assures us withal, That those men did own a GOD. Yea, we find not only that it was ever the opinion of the anciently-known Parts of the World, but also of those very lately-discover'd parts of it, which have had for many Thousands of Years, (as far as we can understand) no manner of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the rest of Mankind. So that if this Opinion was propagated both to them and us by <hi>Tradition,</hi> then This <hi>Tradition</hi> can hardly have any later date, than that of the <hi>Universal Flood</hi> in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four thousand Years ago.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think therefore, if it be not much more likely, That this Belief was at first taught the World by GOD himself, than by any such Cunning man as the <hi>Atheist</hi> dreams of. It began in the very first man that we have had any notice of; it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever since, through all Generations of men that we have heard of in all parts of the world: And is it not then most likely, that it was taught the First man by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? There is no difficulty in conceiving this, and we have as good evidence as we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that it was so indeed. But we have no manner of Evidence at all, that it was an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> of some later man, nor is it easily conceivable how it should be so. For,</p>

He, or a few more with him, could not be of Power enough to compel all men by force into this belief. <hi>Force</hi> indeed may compel men to make a <hi>shew</hi> of believing what they believe not; but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve indeed, what men can see no reason for believing, no <hi>Force</hi> in the world can compel men: But that men should universally be compelled, so much as to make a <hi>shew</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what they believed not, by the power of some <hi>one,</hi> or a <hi>few</hi> men, is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible. If then (as the <hi>Atheist</hi> would have it) any <hi>one,</hi> or some <hi>few</hi> men, did at first persua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the world into this belief, which it had not before, and which, considering the corruption of men, we may be sure it had no mind to entertain; he must needs do it by making the thing propounded to their belief; appear to them very reasonable. For,</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> Tho some <hi>silly</hi> and <hi>unconsidering</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might easily be deceived by men of <hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65384:48"/>
and therefore it must be <hi>Reason</hi> that could persuade them to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho the men of some <hi>one Age</hi> had been so simple, as to be imposed upon by a <hi>Fallacy</hi> or Deceit, yet had no age after it the Wit to find it out? Why could no Witty <hi>Atheist,</hi> with all his stock of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> which he is wont to brag on, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Fallacy,</hi> and undeceive the world again? Certainly there have been in some Ages of the world, since this Opinion first came in, men of good <hi>Sense,</hi> and a competent <hi>Understanding</hi> to know <hi>Reason</hi> when they hear it: Why then has no <hi>Atheist</hi> all this while, by his better Reasons, convinced at least the more <hi>Understanding</hi> part of mankind, of this Error which he supposeth them to have been led into?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Men are generally so much in love with wickedness, that, <hi>First,</hi> They must have been very <hi>Weighty Reasons</hi> that could persuade any considerable number to believe a GOD: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Very <hi>Weak Reasons,</hi> could they but find any at all, may seem enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them, There is no GOD.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the world more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to a wicked man, than any talk of a GOD. To be bid to believe that there is one by whose holy and strict Laws he is to be ruled in all his thoughts, words, and deeds;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65384:49"/>
one who is every where present with him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his whole behaviour, and keeping an exact Register of all his sins; one who will call him to an account, and will punish him for all his wickedness; this goes exceedingly against the hair: 'Tis this that fills his Soul with fears; and troubles his mind with sad thoughts; and marrs his frothy mirth, and spoils his sinful pleasures, and afrights him from his wicked designs, and will not let him quierly have his own will, nor allow him to humour himself, and make much of his flesh. This bridles his appetite, restrains his lusts, crosses his natural inclinations, lays a bar in the way of his worldly interests, cuts him short in his desired liberties: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of all this, he would be glad in his heart that any one could assure him, That there is no GOD. Hence it appears, That the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist</hi> hath all the advantages on his side, that he can desire, to enable him to convince men of this Error, if it be one. By reason of their corruption, men are very ready to hearken to him, and desire nothing more, than to hear him prove what he says; yea, they would reward him at any rate for his pains. It's a very easie thing to persuade men unto what they love; and a weak argument is strong enough to make men believe what they would fain believe: Why then is the wicked man's
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65384:49"/>
good friend the <hi>Atheist</hi> so sparing of his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> when he may so fairly hope to convince men by them? The truth is, by all this it plainly appears, both that they are very <hi>strong Reasons,</hi> that prevail with men against their own corrupt inclinations, to believe a GOD; and that the <hi>Atheist</hi> has <hi>no Reason</hi> at all on his side, seeing he is not able to convince men, who fain would have it so, That there is no GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What end had this <hi>Imaginary</hi> man, which the <hi>Atheist</hi> talks of, in putting this Opinion of a GOD, into mens heads? It was (saith he) to make men more tame, and to bring them under <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> And 'tis very true, that men may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be made sensible, that without <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> we should all be like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wild beasts of prey, tearing and devouring one another; and that nothing can make men more governable, than the belief of a GOD. But after all this, what does that which the <hi>Atheist</hi> saith, amount to? This we will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant him,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That considering the general wickedness of mankind, Government and severe Laws are very necessary things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the belief of a GOD, is that which, above all other things, will soonest bring men to submit to Government.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65384:50"/>
3. That if the belief of a GOD, were an invention of man, it were a very proper invention for the making men more gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>But now the thing which we would hear proved, is, That the belief of a GOD is but an invention of man for that end. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, indeed, will never be upheld in the world, without this belief, and therefore this belief is necessary to uphold Government: But will it now follow from hence, That this belief is only a device of man, to uphold Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? No certainly; but this follows (which the <hi>Atheist</hi> has no mind to hear of), That he who thinks there is no GOD, is an Enemy to Government, and ought not to have the Protection of Government, nor to enjoy the Privileges of a Subject; but ought to be banish'd from all Societies of men, as the greatest enemy to them in the world.</p>
            <p>And now, seeing it is granted by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,</hi> That this belief is so necessary for the maintaining of <hi>Civil Government</hi> in the world; I will be bold hence to infer a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion quite contrary to his, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the more likely for that to be true, and to come from GOD, and not to be an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man. And the reasonableness of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference will thus appear:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65384:50"/>
1. <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> are on purpose to tie men up to live by <hi>Rule,</hi> to restrain them within the bounds of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety;</hi> to keep them from taking the liberty they would otherwise take, and from having their own wills in every thing that they may have a longing mind unto. Now that which could persuade men to be thus <hi>tied up</hi> and <hi>restrain'd,</hi> must needs appear to them very <hi>reasonable</hi> in it self, otherwise they would never be brought to thrust their Necks into a <hi>Yoke</hi> for the sake of something, which they saw not before-hand good <hi>reason</hi> to believe. If the <hi>Atheist</hi> say, That though they saw no reason before-hand to believe that there is a GOD, yet the benefit of good <hi>Government,</hi> and the desire of <hi>safety,</hi> which they could not have without <hi>Government,</hi> was enough to make them content, whether they believed it or no, that it should pass for a truth. In saying this, he confutes himself; for if the desire of <hi>safety,</hi> not to be had without <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> was it that persuaded them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this opinion of a GOD, true or false; and merely for the sake of <hi>Government,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without it they could not be <hi>safe:</hi> Then did their own <hi>safety</hi> sufficiently convince them of the necessity of <hi>Government,</hi> and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to persuade them to admit of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the belief of a GOD. And so the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist's
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65384:51"/>
Politician</hi> was only a <hi>Politick Would-be,</hi> and would seem wise in inventing a thing there was no need of; for 'tis plain, that the belief of a GOD was not necessary in order to <hi>Government,</hi> if the desire of <hi>safety</hi> was enough to persuade men to it. But this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretence of the <hi>Atheist,</hi> That the Opinion of a GOD was set on foot to uphold <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> is a confession, that all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to subjection without this belief, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient; and seeing this belief is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal motive to admit of <hi>Government,</hi> men must needs before-hand see good <hi>reason</hi> for it, for otherwise it could be no <hi>motive</hi> at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the belief of a GOD be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing that holds men in subjection to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government,</hi> and within the bounds of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> then if it be not a <hi>true</hi> belief, it must be granted, That a <hi>Lie</hi> is the very foundation of all <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodness, Peace</hi> and <hi>Order, Iustice</hi> and <hi>Honesty, Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> among men; and it is for the great good of the whole World, and so the duty of all men to <hi>believe a Lie;</hi> And that there is nothing so <hi>wicked,</hi> because nothing can be so <hi>dangerous, mischievous</hi> and <hi>pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to Mankind, as <hi>to believe the Truth.</hi> It is a <hi>truth</hi> (saith the <hi>Atheist)</hi> that there is no GOD. Then is <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>belief</hi> of it,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65384:51"/>
the fountain of all <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>mischief, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>confusion.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Lie</hi> (saith he again) to say, there is a GOD. Then a <hi>Lie,</hi> and the <hi>belief</hi> of it, is the fountain of all <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and of all the <hi>happiness</hi> too in the World. Can any one but a <hi>Fool</hi> believe this? And yet he must believe it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the <hi>Atheist</hi> saying, That the belief of a GOD is only an <hi>invention</hi> of man to keep the World in good order.</p>
            <p>This is enough to be said of our <hi>Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> to demonstrate the <hi>Atheist</hi>'s folly, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>general Consent</hi> of Mankind. And surely, he can hardly be thought a <hi>Wise-man</hi> himself, who ventures to call that man <hi>wise,</hi> whom the whole World, as we have seen, calls a <hi>Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I come to the <hi>Third Argument</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD: And this I may call the <hi>Testimony of the whole Creation,</hi> of all things animate and inanimate. If there are such <hi>Works,</hi> as are the visible <hi>Effects</hi> of an <hi>Eternal Being,</hi> of <hi>Infinite Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> there must needs be a GOD; and he must be a <hi>Fool</hi> that saith, there is none. And here again we have a far more <hi>likely</hi> cause of the Universal Consent of Mankind in this belief, than that which the <hi>Atheist</hi> imagined as <hi>possible</hi> only. By the <hi>Effect</hi> the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65384:52"/>
               <hi>Cause</hi> is known. If we see things <hi>made,</hi> we know they had a <hi>Maker.</hi> Men generally have seen such things in the World, as they could not conceive to be the Effects of any less Power than GODs, and therefore they very rationally concluded, that there is a GOD. And this is the Argument which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us, <hi>Rom.</hi> I. 19, 20. <hi>That which may be known of GOD is manifest in them, for GOD hath shew'd it unto them. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead: so that they are without excuse.</hi> That is, so much of GOD, as may be known by the Light of Nature (for <hi>with GOD is terrible Majesty; touching the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, we cannot find him out,</hi> Job XXXVII. 22, 23. <hi>How little a portion is heard of him?</hi> Job XXVI. 14.) But so much as may be known of GOD without Divine and Supernatural Revelation, was manifest in, or among, the very <hi>Heathen</hi> People, for of them St. <hi>Paul</hi> there speaks. And how was it manifest in them? Thus, GOD himself had shew'd it to them. And which way had he done so, but by his <hi>Works?</hi> For though GOD is a <hi>Being</hi> in his own nature <hi>invisible,</hi> and his <hi>essential Power</hi> and <hi>Godhead</hi> cannot be seen in themselves; yet are they, and ever have been from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65384:52"/>
Creation of the World clearly seen in his <hi>Works.</hi> How are they seen in his <hi>Works?</hi> By the Eye of the Soul, or the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are <hi>understood.</hi> And by what, but by the things that are made? All the visible Creatures, from the highest to the lowest, are as so many <hi>Books,</hi> wherein all men have been able to read the <hi>Eternal Being</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of GOD. In short, GOD hath left such legible Characters of his Infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Godhead</hi> imprinted on the World, and all things therein; and hath indued man with such a Faculty of discerning them, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so makes not this good use of his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>learn</hi> this from the Creatures, is without <hi>excuse,</hi> and a wilfully blind <hi>Fool.</hi> And this is it (whatever the <hi>Atheist</hi> is pleas'd to fancy to himself, as <hi>Fools</hi> are wont to be very <hi>Fanciful)</hi> that hath in all Ages brought men universally to agree in this belief; even as all men who see the clear day light, are agreed that the Sun is up, although they see it not. And this will always be a sufficient proof of a GOD to every one that useth his <hi>Reason</hi> to consider things; and to him that doth not so, there can be no <hi>rational</hi> proof of any thing.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Works</hi> of GOD are either the <hi>common</hi> Works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Universal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> or the <hi>rarer</hi> Works of <hi>Special</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65384:53"/>
               <hi>Extraordinary Providence;</hi> and Wise-men have ever been wont by both these to reason themselves into the belief of a GOD. We will at present consider but some few of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Observe the whole and entire <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>visible World.</hi> What less can we gather from it, but that there is some <hi>Infinite Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that contrived this vast Building, and set all things thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in that <hi>beautiful, curious,</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein we behold them? If one see but a <hi>House</hi> strongly and magnificently built, wisely and usefully contrived, gloriously and sumptuously adorn'd and furnish'd, though he as yet see no man appear in it, or about it, will he be such a <hi>Fool</hi> as to say, it had no <hi>Builder? For every House is builded by some man; but he that built all things is GOD, Heb.</hi> III. 4. If one see a <hi>Watch</hi> or a <hi>Clock,</hi> and observe how artificially all the several parts of it are fashion'd, and put together; and farther, how all the little <hi>Wheels,</hi> though divers of them have several motions of their own, do all concur to one constant and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion of the <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Index;</hi> though he neither saw it made, nor know who made it, will he be so foolish as to say it had no <hi>maker?</hi> How much more a <hi>Fool</hi> must he be, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65384:53"/>
daily beholds the admirable frame of <hi>Heaven, Earth, Sea</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and all things therein; and observes the glorious <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>splendor,</hi> the unexpressible <hi>variety,</hi> the wonderful <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,</hi> the vast <hi>compass</hi> and <hi>capacity,</hi> the regular and constant <hi>courses, motion</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of them all; the ample <hi>provision</hi> made for every thing agreeable to its nature, the mutual <hi>service</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> of one thing to another, and innumerable other tokens of <hi>Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> every-where visible; and yet after all, talks at this rate, <hi>Though I know not which way these things should come to be as they are, yet surely there needed neither</hi> Power, <hi>nor</hi> Wisdom, <hi>nor</hi> Goodness, <hi>to make, contrive, and order them thus. And though I have a very fair and rational account given me in that which we call the</hi> Scripture, <hi>how they come to be thus, yet I will not believe it. It may be they were always thus of themselves, or they happen'd to be thus by chance, but surely they had no</hi> powerful Maker, <hi>or</hi> wise Contriver. He that talk'd thus of a <hi>House,</hi> or a <hi>Watch,</hi> you would think he were <hi>mad;</hi> and shall not he that talks thus of the <hi>World,</hi> and all things therein, be a <hi>Fool?</hi> Yet this is <hi>it,</hi> and this is <hi>all</hi> that the <hi>Atheist</hi> hath to say.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us come to some particulars, and take but a slight view of some of those several sorts of things which we see, and daily reap the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65384:54"/>
benefit of; and see if we can find any one thing whereof any reasonable account can be given, without the belief of a GOD.</p>
            <p>Let us <hi>first</hi> lift up our eyes to the <hi>Heavens</hi> above, and observe <hi>How the heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament sheweth his handy work,</hi> Psal XIX. 1. <hi>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number,</hi> Isa. XL. 26. <hi>I, even my hand have stretched out the Heavens, and all their host have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> Isa. XLV. 12. What a vast <hi>Round</hi> do we there see encompassing this world of Creatures? Of what a wonderful <hi>greatness</hi> are those bright <hi>Globes of Light</hi> which move within it, The <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> some whereof are certainly known to be many and many times bigger than this whole Globe of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> whereon we live. How fitly are all those glorious and sparkling Lights plac'd in the <hi>Firmament</hi> for our advantage, to afford us both <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>warmth,</hi> and <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here below? How <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>constantly</hi> do they move to shed abroad their Influences the more equally upon all the Earth, and for the right proportioning of our <hi>Seasons?</hi> Were they nearer us, they would <hi>dazle</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> us, instead of <hi>enlightning</hi> us; <hi>scorch</hi> and <hi>burn up,</hi> instead of <hi>warming</hi> and <hi>cherishing</hi> the Earth. Were they farther off, the Earth would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65384:54"/>
               <hi>frozen</hi> and <hi>barren,</hi> and we should die with <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> Did they not move round the lower World, their influences could not in any equal proportion be distributed to the several parts of the Earth; there would be no certain <hi>vicissitudes,</hi> and orderly returns of <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Day, Spring</hi> and <hi>Summer, Autumn</hi> and <hi>Winter.</hi> Much of the World would be useless through too much <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> or excess of <hi>heat.</hi> How <hi>regular, even</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> are their motions, always finish'd exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the same space of time, and returning to the same points? They have never in the least varied them for so many Ages, whether it be their <hi>yearly, monthly,</hi> or <hi>daily</hi> courses. Nor is one <hi>year,</hi> or one <hi>day</hi> in any year, ever one <hi>minute</hi> either <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>shorter,</hi> than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>year,</hi> or another <hi>day</hi> at the same time of another year. From such Observations as these, even the wise Heathens, such us <hi>Cicero, Plutarch,</hi> and the rest, rationally concluded, that there must needs be a GOD. Yea, says <hi>Cicero, Who would call him a Man, who when he sees the Motions of Heaven so certain, the Orders of the Stars so setled, and all things so connected among themselves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should yet deny that there is reason in them, or say, this were done by chance, when by no understanding we are able to conceive, with how great wisdom these things are govern'd.</hi> Yea, <hi>What can be so plain and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65384:55"/>
clear</hi> (saith he) <hi>when we look up to Heaven, and view the Celestial Bodies, as that there is some GOD of most excellent understanding, whereby these things are ordered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now look down upon this great body of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> below, and observe how it hangs like a little round Ball in the midst of the thin <hi>Air</hi> incompassing it round about, notwithstanding its prodigious bulk and weight, and all that huge load of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon it. Yet, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> LXXVIII. 69 <hi>GOD hath established it for ever.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> CIV. 5. <hi>He hath laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever.</hi> See it incircled about with <hi>Water</hi> as with a <hi>Girdle,</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> as it were, continually roaring against it, and threatning to overflow, and swallow it up. And who but GOD, can we think, <hi>hath set a bound that they may not pass over, that they turn not again to cover the earth?</hi> Psal. CIV. 9. <hi>He ruleth the raging of the Sea; when the waves thereof arise, he stilleth them,</hi> Psal. LXXXIX. 9. <hi>He hath said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and here shall thy proud waves be stay'd, Iob</hi> XXXVIII. 11. Observe, how both <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are stock'd, and plentifully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all sorts of things which are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the service of men. With <hi>Stones, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> of all sorts, for building,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65384:55"/>
fire, and many other necessary uses; with <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Fruits, Fishes, Fowls</hi> and <hi>Cattel;</hi> and all things needful for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and service of man, for his Food and Rayment, for his Physick, and Delight, and Recreation; and all in the greatest <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>variety.</hi> How many thousand sorts of <hi>Herbs, Shrubs, Trees</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> find we on the Earth? How many learned Volumes are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the vertues of them? How admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is every one of these form'd and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with <hi>Roots</hi> whereby they are fasten'd in the Earth, and suck in proper nourishment from it; with <hi>Veins</hi> to convey that nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into all the many <hi>Branches, Leaves</hi> and <hi>Fruit;</hi> with <hi>Bark</hi> and <hi>Rind</hi> to guard from the violence of both heat and cold; with <hi>Husks</hi> and <hi>Shells</hi> to cherish the Fruit and Seed, and <hi>Leaves</hi> to defend the same unto perfect ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and with <hi>Seed</hi> for a new propagation? How doth the same kind of <hi>Seed</hi> always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the very same kind of <hi>Plant,</hi> and often with a most wonderful increase of its <hi>Fruit;</hi> especially in such of them, as are most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as in <hi>Corn</hi> for <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> for food of all sorts? How do the same kind of <hi>Plants</hi> come up in the same <hi>Season</hi> of the year, of the same <hi>vertue,</hi> of the same <hi>form</hi> and <hi>figure,</hi> both in the <hi>Branches, Leaves, Fruits</hi> and <hi>Flowers?</hi> What abundance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65384:56"/>
               <hi>Living Creatures</hi> breed daily, and feed in the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> and fly in the open <hi>Air?</hi> And how are they all fitted for their several <hi>Elements; Fishes</hi> with <hi>fins</hi> to swim, <hi>Birds</hi> with <hi>wings</hi> to fly, and other things with <hi>feet</hi> to <hi>walk?</hi> How aptly are all things fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Instruments of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>motion, nourishment, generation</hi> and <hi>defence?</hi> What one part about them, or within them, is <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous</hi> or <hi>useless,</hi> or could be well spared? And how conveniently are they all <hi>set,</hi> and <hi>placed,</hi> and <hi>united</hi> together for their several uses? The curious and wise contrivance of the meanest Creature<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the fine contexture of the little body of any small <hi>Insect;</hi> as of a <hi>Fly,</hi> or a <hi>Spider,</hi> hath been enough to exercise the greatest Wits, and to fill whole Books with the wonders of them, and yet one half of them is not discover'd. Each <hi>Animal,</hi> great and small, is indued with such <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> as are necessary for its own <hi>suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> and <hi>preservation</hi> whilst it lives, and for the <hi>propagation</hi> of its kind after it; hath a care of its <hi>Young-ones,</hi> and provides for them; teaches them to shift for themselves, and then leaves them to do so. Every thing carefully shuns what's <hi>hurtful</hi> to it, and picks and chuses what's <hi>proper</hi> for it. Whence now comes all this? From blind <hi>chance?</hi> It may be some blind <hi>Fool</hi> may think so, but 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

he is a <hi>Fool</hi> for thinking so.

            <p>Observe we next, how all things in the world do visibly serve and work together for some wise <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpose;</hi> and then consider what should <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them all in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that end? 'Tis easie for any one to see, That most of the Creatures are such, as are exceeding useful and necessary; and the world would be an inconvenient place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and a very confused and dangerous place too, if things in it did not act as they do. And tho, it may be, some few things we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65384:57"/>
may be able to name, the necessity, use, and goodness whereof, we cannot yet discern; yet have we reason to impute this to our <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or it may be, more to our <hi>Negligence,</hi> and <hi>Sloth,</hi> and <hi>Inadvertency.</hi> It is certain there be many things which people are apt to think <hi>vain,</hi> yea, <hi>hurtful,</hi> which yet Industrious and Learned men, who study Nature, have found to be of special <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> Not a <hi>Toad</hi> or a <hi>Spider,</hi> or any <hi>poisonous</hi> and <hi>veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> thing, but the Skilful know how to make good use of it, and find that it could not well be wanting: And we may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume as much of other things, the use where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are not yet acquainted with. They may serve to suck out and carry away some of those <hi>malignant</hi> humours and qualities, which might infect the <hi>Food</hi> we feed on, or <hi>Air</hi> we breathe in; or to set off the Worth, the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Usefulness of other things, with the greater advantage; that we may take the more notice of them, and be more thankful for them: Or they may be, if not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly useful to us, yet very needful to some or other of those many creatures which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately serviceable to us: However, they serve to exercise our <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> and to let us see GOD's <hi>Providence</hi> over us, in keeping us from the hurt they might do us. But that which we should more especially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65384:57"/>
is, That a very great many things which are without <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> or so much as <hi>Sense</hi> in themselves, do yet work together for the good and preservation of one another, and of the whole World, in as good <hi>Order,</hi> as tho they had a <hi>Rule</hi> to go by, and <hi>Understanding</hi> to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it, and sate in <hi>Consultation</hi> how to do the best for the common good. So that what <hi>Man</hi> doth in this kind by the help of <hi>Reason, They</hi> all do much more <hi>constantly</hi> and <hi>unerring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> without it. The <hi>Heavens</hi> very orderly and duly shed abroad their influence of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> to make the <hi>Earth</hi> both fruitful and pleasant; to direct, sustain, and cherish both man and beast upon it. <hi>In them hath GOD set a tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race: His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof,</hi> Psal. XIX. 4, 5, 6. The <hi>earth</hi> yields its fruits of every sort, in their due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and brings forth a proper sort of <hi>food</hi> for every thing that live upon it. <hi>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthneth man's heart,</hi> Psal.

14, 15. The <hi>Waters</hi> contentedly keep their Channels and Bounds, both that there may be a sufficient quantity of them together, to make a fit <hi>habitation</hi> for all the living things which can live no where else; and to leave dry land enough for other creatures to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And because the creatures of the earth cannot subsist without a sufficiency of <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> therefore <hi>the waters go up by the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they go down by the valleys, unto the place which GOD hath founded for them; he sends the springs into the valleys which run among the hills; they give drink to every beast of the field, the wild asses quench their thirst,</hi> Psal. CIV. 8, 10, 11. And that all the earth may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd, and have <hi>moisture</hi> enough to give juice to <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> these Waters, not only send forth <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> but abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Vapours;</hi> which in the <hi>Air</hi> thicken into <hi>Clouds,</hi> and are dissolved again into sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <hi>showers</hi> scattered over the face of the earth. <hi>He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them,</hi> Job XXVI. 8. <hi>He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth,</hi> Psalm CXXXV. 7. <hi>He maketh small the drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they pour down rain according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour thereof, which the clouds do drop and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil upon man abundantly,</hi> Job XXXVI. 27, 28. <hi>He makes the earth soft with showers, his paths
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65384:58"/>
drop fatness; they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness,</hi> Psal. LXV. 10, 11, 12. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe several sorts of <hi>Earth</hi> fitted for several sorts of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Grain;</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sorts of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Grain</hi> suited to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Palates</hi> of several sorts of <hi>Living Creatures,</hi> and several sorts of <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Palates</hi> in living creatures, whereby it comes to pass, that one sort <hi>delights</hi> in, and is <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished</hi> with that which another sort takes no <hi>delight</hi> in, and cannot be <hi>nourished</hi> with, but perfectly <hi>hates</hi> and <hi>shuns</hi> as <hi>poisonous</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> to it. And hence it is, that nothing is <hi>lost,</hi> or is in <hi>vain;</hi> but what one <hi>refuseth,</hi> another <hi>chuseth;</hi> and hence there is <hi>enough</hi> for <hi>all;</hi> and there needs be no <hi>strife</hi> or <hi>contention</hi> about any thing; for as there is enough for all, so is there <hi>Variety</hi> for <hi>each one.</hi> We see yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what <hi>provision</hi> is made in Nature for the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> of everything: And how every thing naturally, without <hi>teaching,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>preserve</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it self: One has <hi>Horns,</hi> another <hi>Hoofs,</hi> another has <hi>Fangs</hi> or long <hi>Teeth;</hi> and none of these needs be taught how to use his natural <hi>Weapons:</hi> And such as have no such <hi>Natural</hi> weapons, have either <hi>Reason</hi> to invent <hi>artificial</hi> ones, as <hi>men;</hi> or some other way of saving themselves, as <hi>Birds</hi> have <hi>Wings</hi> to flye for it; other things have <hi>swiftness</hi> of foot to run for it; even

               <hi>Moles</hi> and <hi>Worms</hi> have a wonderful faculty of speeding into the earth to hide themselves: <hi>In the cedars the birds make their nests; the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees are a house for the stork. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies,</hi> Psal. CIV. 17, 18. Young things no sooner fall from their dams, but they seek for milk, and find it without a guide. The little <hi>Lamb</hi> runs to the pap immediately, which the little <hi>Infant</hi> cannot do. Why? The <hi>Ewe</hi> wants wit to direct the <hi>Lamb,</hi> but the <hi>Mother</hi> knows how to direct her <hi>Child. Birds</hi> chuse out the most <hi>secret</hi> places for their <hi>nests,</hi> and make them with so much curiosity, as man's art cannot imitate. The curious works of the little <hi>Bee</hi> or <hi>Silk-worm,</hi> is a very amazing thing to consider: The industry and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Ant,</hi> and the wonders that the <hi>Spider</hi> works, are matters of admiration to us. 'Twould be endless to mention, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed impossible for man to discover one half of the wonderful things in nature. And he that can yet imagine that all these things are by <hi>Chance,</hi> and that there is no Superior <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> that governs all things, and directs them in their several Operations, must needs be more foolish than any beast.</p>
            <p>Once again, Let us consider of what kind of <hi>Ingredients</hi> this World, and the things therein do consist, or are compounded: The
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65384:59"/>
               <hi>Elements</hi> of it, <hi>Fire, Air, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> are of <hi>contrary</hi> and mutually <hi>destructive</hi> Natures: Their chief Qualities are <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold, Moisture</hi> and <hi>Dryness,</hi> and what things can be more <hi>opposite</hi> to one another? All things consist of these things, and how come they to be be so evenly <hi>temper'd,</hi> and <hi>blended</hi> in such a just proportion, as to agree <hi>peaceably</hi> together in the same body? Again, most things that we know in the world, last but for a while; <hi>Plants, Trees, Beasts, Birds, Fishes,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> after a short time <hi>dye,</hi> and are no more; but others of the same kind spring up, and are brought forth to supply their room. And thus the world is in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual <hi>Change</hi> and is continued by a constant course of <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Corruption;</hi> and one thing always ariseth from the corruption of another. The <hi>Seed</hi> is sown, and corrupts in the earth, and loseth its form, and thence springs up a manifold increase. Now for any one to think with himself, how this is brought to pass, will be but for ever to bafflle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found himself, unless he have recourse to an <hi>Infinite Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that orders all things. <hi>That which thou sowest, is not quickned except it dye; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body which shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain.</hi> Now what can follow hence, but, That
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65384:60"/>
               <hi>GOD giveth it a body, as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body?</hi> 1 Cor. XV. 36, 37, 38. Who but GOD, could so even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>temper, blend,</hi> and <hi>balance, contrary</hi> and <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-destroying</hi> Natures, into one; so as the <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Health, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Vigor</hi> of the body so compounded, consists in the right <hi>Temperament</hi> of these <hi>Enemies?</hi> Who but GOD can <hi>raise</hi> one thing from the <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of another; make <hi>Life</hi> spring out of <hi>Death,</hi> and constantly provide for a new <hi>Generation</hi> of things, from the <hi>Ruines</hi> and <hi>Rottenness</hi> of those that were before?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly;</hi> It is now time that we look a little <hi>upon,</hi> and <hi>into</hi> our selves; and see what cause we can find every one of himself, to say unto GOD with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. CXXXIX. 14. <hi>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Should we only look upon our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which are no more but the corruptible <hi>Cottages</hi> wherein our immortal <hi>Souls</hi> are for a while to lodge; tho we find they are made of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Bones,</hi> covered with <hi>Skin,</hi> as the bodies of some other Creatures are; yet very wonderful is the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture</hi> of these materials in them. How fitly is every <hi>Part</hi> and <hi>Member</hi> fashioned and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65384:60"/>
and connected to the rest, to make it a proper <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Sense, Strength</hi> or <hi>Motion?</hi> What one of those Instruments of <hi>Nourishment,</hi> whereby our Food is <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, chew'd, swallow'd,</hi> and <hi>digested;</hi> the finest parts of it <hi>convey'd</hi> through the whole body, for its necessary growth or repair, and the grosser parts and dregs <hi>cast forth</hi> as useless: What instrument of <hi>Breathing,</hi> what <hi>Vein</hi> or <hi>Artery</hi> for the carrying about of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits;</hi> what <hi>Bone, Nerve, Sinew, Muscle, Ioint, Ligament,</hi> or <hi>Gristle,</hi> for <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> could we either well spare, or wish better form'd or set for its use? What one <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling,</hi> and <hi>Touching,</hi> could we be content to want? Or how can we imagine, that the <hi>Instruments</hi> of any of these <hi>Senses,</hi> could have been wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier framed and placed? Nay, there is not a <hi>Hair</hi> or <hi>Nail</hi> about us, but when considered, is found to be of use for <hi>Fence</hi> or <hi>Beauty.</hi> Whoso considers those two little seats and springs of <hi>Life, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Brain;</hi> how wonderfully <hi>formd,</hi> how strongly <hi>guarded,</hi> how well <hi>supplied</hi> with a variety of instruments, conveying to them, and carrying from them, as it is necessary for keeping themselves in right <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> and for the <hi>Life, Health, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> of the whole body: Whoso but well observes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65384:61"/>
the curious workmanship of the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Ear,</hi> the two <hi>Intelligencers</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> or thinks on the wonderful ways of <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Or he that considers the Instruments of <hi>Speech,</hi> and the <hi>Use,</hi> as well as <hi>Propriety</hi> of that excellent Faculty to <hi>Mankind;</hi> cannot chuse but fall into the highest admiration of that <hi>Infinite Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to which he owes all these things!</p>
            <p>And yet what are all these to the <hi>Wonders</hi> of our <hi>Souls?</hi> Could we think it worth our while to come acquainted a little better with our selves, and to this end sometimes to enter in as far as we can into the several Mysteries within us, and enquire after that <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> which is served and waited on by all these <hi>Bodily Instruments,</hi> and makes what use of them it thinks good; we should be sure the more we know of our own <hi>Souls</hi> the more also to know of God, whose <hi>Image</hi> they bear. Some such thing every one of us feels within himself; which is the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> and doth all by it, whatsoever it doth. When the <hi>Body</hi> lies dead, it hath for a short time all its <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> intire; but they are altogether useless. It's <hi>Life, sense, motion, grace</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> all is gone, and nothing left but a Cold heavy lump, like to a Frozen clod of Clay. And why is it thus, but that the <hi>Soul</hi> is fled? O then! What, and how
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65384:61"/>
admirable are the powers of that <hi>Spirit</hi> in Man, which actuates his <hi>body,</hi> directs and commands it, and every <hi>member</hi> of it as it self pleaseth; at whose will it moves or rests, and by whose presence it liveth? Yea, what is <hi>that,</hi> without which we are no longer <hi>men?</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Soul</hi> which <hi>sees</hi> and <hi>hears</hi> by these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily instruments; 'tis the <hi>Soul</hi> that <hi>discerns</hi> and <hi>judges</hi> of all the numerous <hi>figures</hi> and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, magnitudes</hi> and <hi>proportions, measures</hi> and <hi>distances, motions, sounds</hi> and <hi>voices, harmonies</hi> and <hi>discords;</hi> that <hi>distinguisheth</hi> between <hi>one</hi> thing and <hi>another, chuseth</hi> and <hi>refuseth,</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> all our doings. Think well of it, What is it within us, that <hi>thinks,</hi> and <hi>considers,</hi> and <hi>reasons,</hi> and <hi>discourseth</hi> about all things without <hi>words</hi> or <hi>noise?</hi> What is it in us, which whilst with these <hi>bodies</hi> we neither <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>hear,</hi> nor <hi>taste,</hi> nor <hi>smell,</hi> nor <hi>feel,</hi> can yet represent the several objects of all these <hi>senses</hi> to it self, whenever it has a mind to it, and hath as fresh and lively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of them all in it self, as if all these bodily <hi>senses</hi> were actually exercised by them? What is the strange power of <hi>that</hi> within us, which can make <hi>present</hi> to it self things long since <hi>past,</hi> and things which are yet to <hi>come,</hi> as well as those that <hi>now are;</hi> yea, and things which neither <hi>are,</hi> nor ever <hi>have been,</hi> as though they <hi>were?</hi> What's that in us,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65384:62"/>
which whilst we sit still, is <hi>travelling</hi> over the World, and taking a view of all <hi>Times,</hi> and can <hi>imagine</hi> thousands of Worlds like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to This, and frame new <hi>Notions,</hi> and lay <hi>Plots</hi> within it self; Model <hi>Governments,</hi> Martial <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and <hi>consider, dispute,</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> about such Things as tho they were real? What is <hi>that</hi> in us, which is <hi>awake,</hi> whilst our <hi>Bodies</hi> are laid to <hi>sleep;</hi> and sometimes runs over in our <hi>sleep,</hi> all things that passed the day before; <hi>discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of them, and <hi>contrives,</hi> and <hi>designs</hi> for the future too? Alas! we <hi>understand</hi> but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little of <hi>our selves,</hi> and far less than we might do, if we would a little more <hi>study</hi> our selves; we know not how we are <hi>nourished,</hi> nor how we <hi>grow,</hi> nor how we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> how we <hi>think</hi> or <hi>dream;</hi> nor the strange ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Fancy.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we <hi>feel</hi> that there is <hi>something</hi> in us that doth such things; we find that <hi>something</hi> in us doth <hi>remember,</hi> and <hi>understand,</hi> and <hi>dispute,</hi> and <hi>consult,</hi> and <hi>deliberate,</hi> and <hi>resolve,</hi> and <hi>forecast,</hi> and <hi>chuse,</hi> and <hi>refuse:</hi> Yea, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>reflects</hi> upon <hi>our selves;</hi> and <hi>accuses</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, condemns</hi> or <hi>acquits</hi> us, <hi>applauds</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves</hi> us, is <hi>vexed</hi> and <hi>grieved,</hi> or <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> with our behaviour. We find that we are able in a numberless variety of <hi>VVords,</hi> to make our <hi>Thoughts</hi> known to others, and by the same means to understand the <hi>thoughts</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65384:62"/>
of others. We can mutually give and take <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>counsel, teach, comfort and reprove</hi> one another. We find <hi>something</hi> in us, that can discern the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> the <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of things about us, and provide <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> them. And now when such things as these, which every one may feel in himself, are well thought on; can we really remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what <hi>we our selves</hi> are, and yet be such <hi>fools</hi> as to say or think there is no <hi>GOD?</hi> If any man be <hi>doubtful,</hi> whether there be a GOD or no, he must needs be <hi>ignorant</hi> of <hi>himself.</hi> For certainly he that ever considers, either his own nature, or the many things which he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day sees, must needs even naturally, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at least, ask himself this Question, <hi>Whence</hi> can I imagine all these things to come? what great <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>VVisdom</hi> is it that doth in all things display it self? Let me consider it well.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Where all things visibly are in a most <hi>wise</hi> order, there must needs be <hi>VVisdom;</hi> and where all things do <hi>constantly</hi> continue in the same wise order of <hi>VVorking,</hi> there must be <hi>Power.</hi> And where such ample and excellent <hi>provision</hi> is made for the preservation of all things, and for our welfare especially; there must needs be <hi>Goodness: VVhere</hi> then is all this <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>VVisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> lodg'd? Things <hi>are,</hi> things <hi>act,</hi> things are exceeding <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> things have for some Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65384:63"/>
of Years <hi>continued,</hi> or <hi>succeeded</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a <hi>constant order</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> one to another. Have they then all this originally in and of themselves? Or is there some <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> most <hi>VVise,</hi> and <hi>good Being</hi> over them; which at first <hi>made,</hi> and put them into this order, and still <hi>upholds</hi> them in it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where there appears nothing at all of <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, what either <hi>Power, VVisdom</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> there can be, to <hi>make, order,</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> things, and <hi>uphold</hi> them all, in that regular and useful way of working wherein we see them. And 'tis undeniable that there are abundance of things, which thus work very regularly and constantly, wherein there doth not appear any thing at all of <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> Only <hi>Mankind,</hi> of all the things that we are acquainted with, hath <hi>Reason.</hi> He therefore only can be thought capable of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>VVisdom</hi> is absolutely necessary for the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> of such a World of things. Yet, alas, how far doth such a Work as that exceed the <hi>wisdom</hi> of <hi>Men?</hi> And if it exceeds the <hi>wisdom</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> how much more doth it exceed the <hi>Power</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which want <hi>VVisdom?</hi> For such a work, there must be some <hi>VVisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> Infinitely exceeding those of Man, or of any other thing that we are here acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

But this is that which none but a <hi>fool</hi> can think reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> have ever accounted it most <hi>absurd</hi> to talk of an <hi>infinite succession</hi> of things one after another, without beginning; of a <hi>number</hi> of things, wherein there is no <hi>first</hi> thing; or which had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. At this rate, an <hi>infinite number</hi> of Generations are long ago <hi>past,</hi> and an <hi>infinite number</hi> is the <hi>greatest number;</hi> if there can be such a thing.

What use can we think the <hi>World</hi> serves for, but for the use of those <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65384:66"/>
Creatures</hi> which are in it, and more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of <hi>Man?</hi> For what use is a <hi>House,</hi> but for that of the <hi>Inhabitants?</hi> And it were no less absurd to think that the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> made <hi>Men,</hi> and other <hi>living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> than it is to think, that the <hi>House</hi> made the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> that dwell in it. And then if the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> know and confess that they made not the <hi>House,</hi> as no body but a Fool will think that the <hi>House</hi> made <hi>them:</hi> so any but a Fool will say, some <hi>other</hi> made the <hi>House.</hi> As then <hi>every House is built by some man,</hi> so <hi>he that built all things, is GOD,</hi> Heb.

            <p>Thus all things, both <hi>without</hi> us, and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> us, do naturally lead us to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a GOD, if we will but make use of our Reason; and if we will not, that's it which makes us <hi>fools. GOD hath not left himself without witness, in that he doth good, and giveth us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Acts XIV. 17. And we may easily perceive, if we will think of any thing, that <hi>He is not far from every one of us, for in him we live, and move, and have our being: for we are his off-spring,</hi> as the <hi>Heathen Poets could tell us,</hi> Acts XVII. 27, 28.

            <p>'Tis certain, that things do ordinarily keep one natural constant course and order, and vary not from it. <hi>As GOD commanded, and they were created; so he hath established them for ever and ever; he hath made a decree which shall not pass,</hi> Psal.

            <p>It is easie to observe, that when <hi>Wickedness</hi> is grown up to a very extraordinary heighth in a Nation or Kingdom; though that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> abounds in <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and in all things that seem to promise <hi>success,</hi> and persuade to <hi>security;</hi> yet all on a sudden, when there seems least cause of fear, by some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> unlook'd for Judgment, it is brought to utter ruine and destruction.

            <p>And now after all this, I hope, it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifest, that the <hi>Atheist,</hi> being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>there is no GOD,</hi> makes himself confident in a matter wherein all the <hi>reason</hi> in the world is against him, and against all the Evidences that can be given of what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, how true soever it be.</p>
            <p>It cannot therefore be thought needful any otherwise than thus, to shew that he hath <hi>no reason</hi> at all for his confidence. For when <hi>all reason</hi> appears against one's Opinion, 'tis most certain there can be <hi>no reason</hi> for it. All that he can say for himself is but this, That there appear to him some <hi>Difficulties</hi> in the Belief of a GOD, which he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. And doth he not meet with as <hi>many,</hi> and as <hi>unconquerable difficulties</hi> in the denying of a GOD? If he do not, 'tis only because he hath no mind to see them; for I am sure all the wisest men have met with such. But if it be (as the <hi>Atheist</hi> pretends) more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to believe that there is a GOD, than to believe there is none, or than barely <hi>not to believe</hi> there is; how comes it to pass, that the generality of mankind hath always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it? How is it, that nothing seems more <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to most men, than to believe

it; and nothing more <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>against Nature,</hi> than to conceive how it should be otherwise? Why hath no <hi>Atheist,</hi> by propounding and demonstrating these <hi>Difficulties,</hi> been able hitherto to dissuade any considerable number of men from believing this? Can the <hi>Atheist</hi> give any rational account how this world could be as it is, or how he himself came to be what he is, if there be no GOD? If he can, why hath he not, in so many Ages of the world, let men see that he can? Why have so few receiv'd any satisfaction from what he hath said to that purpose? Surely it must be, because men find many more <hi>Difficulties</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that he speaks reason, or in perceiving that he gives any reasonable account of things without a GOD, than they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes the World may have been <hi>Eternally,</hi> without any <hi>Beginning;</hi> and sometimes there may have been <hi>Eternal Matter,</hi> which form'd it self he knows not how, into that variety of things, which we now see. Sometimes there may have been eternally an infinite multitude of small <hi>Atomes</hi> or <hi>Motes,</hi> dancing to and fro, till at last they hit and jumble by <hi>chance,</hi> into so many Bodies as the World now contains. And with such like <hi>Imaginations,</hi> as these, he

labours to <hi>confound</hi> men's Thoughts, and to <hi>divert</hi> them from listning to that <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>satisfactory</hi> account, which the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> hath given us, of the <hi>Original</hi> of all things. But as these <hi>Atheistical</hi> Wits, have never been able to satisfie one another, so as that they could come to agree in the same Principles; but have been at an irreconcileable difference, and an endless dispute amongst themselves; not so much about what <hi>certainly</hi> was, as about what <hi>possibly might have been:</hi> So neither have any of them been able to convince any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable numbers of men, no not of those who know nothing of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to think that the World could have been any of those ways they dream of, without a GOD. And why so? But because men have ever thought it more <hi>difficult,</hi> to be of any of their opinions, than to believe that there is a GOD.

how should a man <hi>believe</hi> what he cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> by his Understanding? And indeed most true it is, that what is <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>infinite,</hi> no <hi>humane</hi> Understanding can <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> comprehend. To <hi>understand</hi> a thing <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> in all things belonging to it, is to suppose it to have certain <hi>Bounds</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> of <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> which if it had, it were not <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Infinite.</hi> And true it is, That GOD is a <hi>Being</hi> of an <hi>unlimited</hi> and <hi>boundless</hi> Nature and Excellency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be <hi>fully,</hi> or in <hi>all things,</hi> understood by man. But this is so far from making it <hi>uneasy</hi> to believe that there is a GOD, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, when we consider things well, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. We therefore believe that there is a GOD, because, when we consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things there be in the World, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and even unsearchable by us, are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections of every thing in its kind, we cannot fee how these things could be without a <hi>Being incomprehensible</hi> and <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely excellent</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> whence all <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> must be derived. Tho' there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>man,</hi> who is of a <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>limited</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, cannot <hi>fully comprehend</hi> the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Infiniteness</hi> of GOD, or throughly understand the <hi>infinite Nature</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of GOD; yet may he understand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is a <hi>Being</hi> which is <hi>eternal</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:65384:71"/>
and <hi>infinite;</hi> that is to say, a GOD. And it is so <hi>easy</hi> to conceive that there is such a <hi>Being,</hi> that it is not <hi>possible</hi> to conceive how there should be none such. We are very sure, that we our selves, and other things, have a <hi>being;</hi> and yet we cannot <hi>fully</hi> comprehend, or <hi>throughly</hi> understand the <hi>excellencies</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of our own Nature, or of the nature of any thing else, how <hi>small</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> soever it be. It cannot therefore be <hi>hard</hi> for us to believe that there is something <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible</hi> by us, or which we cannot throughly in all things understand. And so <hi>easie</hi> is it for us to apprehend that there is some <hi>eternal</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we cannot conceive how there could be any thing at all without it. We cannot with any satisfaction to our selves, suppose, that once there was <hi>nothing</hi> at all. For were it so, that once there had been nothing at all; it must needs follow, That there never could have been <hi>any thing</hi> at all: If there once was <hi>nothing,</hi> whence should <hi>any thing</hi> have come? There was in <hi>nothing</hi> no <hi>power,</hi> nor <hi>disposition</hi> to any thing: <hi>Nothing</hi> of which any thing should spring, Nothing to <hi>make,</hi> or <hi>give a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to any thing: <hi>Nothing</hi> is nothing, and <hi>nothing</hi> can do nothing: But now there are many things. Had they a beginning, or had they none? If they had no beginning, we have found <hi>many Eternal</hi> Beings, whilst
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65384:71"/>
we think it <hi>hard</hi> to believe there should be <hi>one.</hi> If they had a beginning, then (as hath been said), they had it of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> or from some <hi>other.</hi> They had it not of themselves, for before they <hi>began</hi> to be, they were <hi>not;</hi> and what <hi>is not,</hi> can <hi>do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> They must have it therefore from some <hi>other,</hi> and that <hi>other</hi> must be before them; and must be <hi>Eternal</hi> without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all that hath been said, is this: The <hi>Atheist</hi> being confident that there is no GOD, is <hi>confident</hi> in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he can have no <hi>reason</hi> to be confident, and whereof he cannot pretend to have the least measure of <hi>Assurance.</hi> He is confident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason or degree of Assurance, where his confidence is the most <hi>dangerous</hi> thing that can be to himself, and the most <hi>mischievous</hi> thing that can be to the whole <hi>World.</hi> He chooseth to follow a <hi>groundless Opinion</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no <hi>safety</hi> to himself, and whence there can arise no <hi>good,</hi> but very much <hi>hurt</hi> to the World, rather than a <hi>probable Opinion</hi> at least, which it is certainly <hi>safe</hi> for him to follow; and which can do no <hi>hurt,</hi> but much <hi>good</hi> to all Mankind. In denying that there is a GOD, he must grant that all the <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the World depends upon a <hi>Lie,</hi> and that the World would be <hi>undone</hi> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65384:72"/>
of the <hi>Truth.</hi> He is confident, where all the <hi>reason</hi> of the World is <hi>against</hi> his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He is confident there is no GOD, tho he have all the <hi>evidences</hi> of a GOD that can be given of him, if there be one.

               </gap> be; GOD hath <hi>appear'd</hi> and <hi>shew'd</hi> himself to men, so, as if there be a GOD, any one can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he should <hi>shew</hi> himself. The <hi>Atheist</hi> finds the whole World of Mankind <hi>consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that there is a GOD; and he finds the <hi>tokens</hi> of <hi>Infinite Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> in all the works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> both <hi>common</hi> and <hi>extraordinary:</hi> He cannot give any <hi>rational account</hi> at all of any of these things, without the belief of a GOD; and finally, he finds no such <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in believing there is a GOD, but he finds many <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>greater,</hi> in conceiving how things should be, as they are, without a GOD. Seeing, as hath been shewn, this is plainly the case; let all men of <hi>common sense</hi> now judge, whether he who makes himself confident that there is no GOD, be not past all dispute, a very <hi>Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in vain, have we all this while been considering the <hi>Atheists Folly,</hi> if we our selves resolve to be as much or greater <hi>Fools</hi> than he. And certainly, if it be (as it hath
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65384:72"/>
been proved) a very <hi>foolish</hi> thing to think that there is no GOD; it cannot be less <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> to live without any <hi>regard</hi> of GOD, as too many amongst us seem to do; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves so in the World, as if GOD had nothing to do with <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>they</hi> with <hi>him;</hi> or as tho it were all one to them, whether there be a GOD or no. If there be a GOD, and if none but <hi>Fools</hi> deny this, then are we to consider that these things do neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every one that is <hi>wise,</hi> doth take all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible care to <hi>confirm</hi> himself in so <hi>stedfast</hi> a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of GOD, that nothing may be able to make him <hi>doubt</hi> of it. <hi>Take heed,</hi> therefore, <hi>Brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living GOD,</hi> Heb. III. 12. <hi>The fear of the LORD that is Wisdom,</hi> Job XXVIII. 28. If there be a GOD, it must needs be the greatest piece of <hi>Wisdom</hi> that man is capable of, to behave himself <hi>Religiously</hi> towards GOD; but this he can never do without firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>believing</hi> that there is a GOD; this belief being the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> point in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He that cometh to GOD, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. XI. 6. Therefore</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, let no one think himself <hi>excusable</hi> if he be not throughly <hi>convinced</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65384:73"/>
that there is a GOD. For no man living that hath the right use of <hi>Reason,</hi> can be <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> of this, and be held <hi>Guiltless.</hi> GOD hath so many ways <hi>manifested</hi> himself unto us, that the <hi>blindest Heathen</hi> cannot say, that he hath not had <hi>means</hi> enough of knowing that <hi>He is.</hi> And if a <hi>Heathen</hi> can have no <hi>excuse</hi> for his being <hi>ignorant</hi> of this, who hath but at most one half of the <hi>means</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which every the most unlearned <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> hath, how should any <hi>ignorant Christian</hi> be excused! Tho it be therefore too common a thing to hear both Men and Women among us, who both are of considerable <hi>Age,</hi> and also <hi>Understanding,</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> enough for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their worldly Callings, excusing their <hi>ignorance</hi> of GOD, by their want of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> yet in truth they can have no <hi>excuse</hi> at all for this <hi>ignorance.</hi> It is their <hi>negligence,</hi> and <hi>sloth,</hi> and <hi>unwillingness</hi> to learn, that keeps them <hi>ignorant;</hi> and for these, there can be no <hi>excuse.</hi> Can any one live in a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and not have <hi>heard</hi> enough, if he would have minded it, (tho he cannot <hi>read)</hi> to <hi>convince</hi> him That there is a GOD whom he is bound to serve? Nay, can any one live in the <hi>World,</hi> and not <hi>see</hi> enough every where to teach him this <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fundamental Truth?</hi> He that cannot <hi>read</hi> GOD's <hi>word,</hi> may yet (if he live in a <hi>Christian Church), hear</hi> it, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65384:73"/>
GOD himself <hi>speaking</hi> to him in it. And he that lives abroad in the <hi>World,</hi> tho he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>see</hi> GOD himself, yet he may every where <hi>see</hi> his <hi>Works;</hi> and in them, all the <hi>Being,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>Goodness</hi> of GOD. Nay, if he can but <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> he may know there is a GOD that <hi>feeds</hi> him; for he knows very well, that it is not in his <hi>own</hi> power, nor of any other creature, to provide his <hi>food</hi> for him, or to enable him to receive good by his food. Yet more; No man, how <hi>unlearned</hi> so ever he be, can think seriously of <hi>himself,</hi> and consider <hi>what</hi> he is, or <hi>how</hi> he lives, but he may easily discover a GOD that made him to be <hi>what</hi> he is, and preserves him in <hi>being</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> How <hi>inexcusable</hi> then must every one be, for not <hi>learning</hi> that which every thing <hi>teacheth</hi> him; and which he cannot but <hi>learn,</hi> when he doth but consider, that he <hi>himself</hi> is <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>next</hi> place, Let none of us think it a needless thing, very often, and seriously to <hi>consider</hi> that there is a GOD. If we do not much <hi>consider</hi> it, it will be but a vain thing for us to <hi>know</hi> it. We should so lose the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of GOD's <hi>manifesting</hi> himself so fully and so variously to us. <hi>Consideration</hi> must make our <hi>knowledg</hi> useful to us. If there be a GOD, it is certain that we <hi>depend</hi> wholly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65384:74"/>
upon him, and must needs owe a <hi>duty</hi> to him. Yet tho we may <hi>know</hi> there is a GOD, if we keep it not <hi>in mind,</hi> and <hi>think</hi> but little of it, our <hi>Knowledg</hi> can have little influence on our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>behaviour;</hi> but we shall demean our selves as <hi>carelesly,</hi> and be every whit as <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>unconcern'd</hi> how we live, as tho we had never <hi>heard,</hi> or <hi>thought</hi> of any such thing as a GOD. Yea, not to <hi>consider,</hi> and have this much in our <hi>thoughts,</hi> seems to be more <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable</hi> in us, than not to know it at all. As he who knows his LORD's Will, and doth it not, deserves to be beaten with more stripes, than he that doth not his Will, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because he knows it not, <hi>Luke XII.</hi> 47. So he that <hi>considereth</hi> not much, that there is a GOD, when he <hi>knows</hi> it; seems more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, than he who doth not <hi>know</hi> it, and therefore cannot <hi>consider</hi> it. Both are <hi>faulty,</hi> and can have nothing at all to plead <hi>for</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but he that <hi>knows,</hi> and <hi>considers</hi> not, seems to be more faulty; and a great deal more may be pleaded <hi>against</hi> him. The one is <hi>ignorant</hi> of GOD, when he might <hi>know</hi> him; the other <hi>sets light</hi> by GOD, when he knows him. The one not <hi>knowing</hi> GOD, knows not how much he <hi>deserves</hi> his Thoughts; the other tho he <hi>knows</hi> him, yet carries himself so towards him, as if he thought him not <hi>worthy</hi> to be thought upon.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65384:74"/>
               <hi>He likes not to retain GOD in his knowledg,</hi> as 'tis said of some, Rom. I. 28.</p>
            <p>As then, if there be a GOD, 'tis altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary that we should <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> it; that so we understand how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us not to live as we list, having one over us to whom we must be accountable, even for every <hi>idle word,</hi> Mat. XII. 36. So when we know this, 'tis altogether as necessary we should much <hi>consider</hi> and <hi>think</hi> of it, that we may <hi>walk worthy of GOD unto all pleasing,</hi> Col. I. 10. and not wilfully or giddily run upon our own destruction, by <hi>disregarding</hi> him. It will be a very terrible thing to the <hi>ignorant</hi> person at the last day, to meet with a GOD of whom he never <hi>knew;</hi> and then to reflect thus upon himself, <hi>Had I been any thing but a</hi> Fool, <hi>I might have known this</hi> GOD <hi>to my eternal Comfort, whom now I find to my everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Confusion!</hi> And it will be more terrible at that day, for the <hi>unconsidering</hi> person to find a GOD armed with <hi>vengeance</hi> against all that <hi>contemn'd,</hi> him: And then to reflect on his own <hi>folly,</hi> saying, <hi>What</hi> a Mad-man <hi>was I, who knew there was a</hi> GOD, <hi>and did not think him worth a few serious Thoughts, when by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle serious consideration, I might have prevented this confounding sight, and my own eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction now come upon me through my heedles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!</hi> As we therefore desire that we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65384:75"/>
feel the <hi>wrath</hi> of GOD, let us now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain often and serious <hi>thoughts</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, <hi>lastly,</hi> Let us be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in the use of all the <hi>means</hi> which GOD hath given us, to confirm and establish us in this <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>lively sense</hi> of GOD; and take heed (as we love our Souls) how we give ear to any thing which may weaken this belief, or make us <hi>doubt</hi> of the being of a GOD. We have all the reason in the World to be very careful of this, Because (as we have seen, If it be a <hi>truth</hi> that there is a GOD, nothing can be more necessary, either to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> our <hi>Misery,</hi> or to <hi>promote</hi> our <hi>Happiness,</hi> than a firm <hi>belief</hi> of it; and tho it were <hi>false</hi> (as it cannot be) yet would it do a great deal of <hi>good,</hi> and no <hi>hurt</hi> at all. Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then to be well grounded and setled in this belief; and to this end, let us well weigh, and consider all those many <hi>reasons,</hi> which we have above taken notice of, to perswade us to it. Especially, let us diligently attend to GOD's <hi>word,</hi> and observe his <hi>works.</hi> The reason why many men, either so <hi>weakly</hi> believe that there is a GOD, or so little and <hi>slightly</hi> think of it; is, because either their <hi>Lusts,</hi> or their worldly <hi>Business,</hi> or else <hi>Vanities,</hi> hold their thoughts so continually imploy'd about them, that they will not allow themselves time, nor be at the pains to consider those notable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65384:75"/>
               <hi>evidences</hi> which GOD hath given of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He that shuts his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and stops his <hi>Ears;</hi> when he should <hi>read</hi> or <hi>hear</hi> GOD speaking to him; or when he should observe the wonderful <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> it is not strange if he never come to have a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>firm</hi> belief of GOD. Therefore if we would (as it highly concerns us) be unmovably rooted in this Belief, we must observe these Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be sure to keep our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> which GOD has given us, as we are Men, constantly <hi>awake.</hi> Let the <hi>Eye</hi> of the Soul be kept <hi>open,</hi> that it may be ready to <hi>see</hi> GOD, whensoever, and howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he shews himself. What's the most <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Discourse</hi> to a <hi>sleeping</hi> man! He neither <hi>hears</hi> it, nor <hi>considers</hi> it, and therefore is he no <hi>wiser</hi> for it. What's <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> to a man that always <hi>winks?</hi> He <hi>sees</hi> them not, and so <hi>knows</hi> no more of them, than it they were not to be seen. This Truth, That there is a GOD, is as visible to the <hi>Understanding,</hi> as Colours are to the <hi>Eye,</hi> but <hi>neither</hi> are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to one that is not <hi>awake.</hi> Let us consider, that the <hi>best</hi> things must certainly be the <hi>best worth</hi> our <hi>seeing</hi> and <hi>knowing;</hi> and nothing can be <hi>better</hi> than GOD, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all <hi>Goodness.</hi> Nothing is so carefully
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65384:76"/>
to be regarded as <hi>that,</hi> without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg whereof, we eternally perish, and such is GOD. Hath man <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> for no use? Or is he to use them about eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing of <hi>least</hi> concernment; and not about that which above all things in the World, he is mostly <hi>concern'd</hi> to Understand? If there be a GOD, we must all of us be either <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> or <hi>Miserable</hi> for ever, accordingly as we <hi>Regard</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> him, or <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> him: And can there be any thing, the Knowledg whereof doth more concern us? And yet is it thus with too many of us, that whilst our <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> are very intent upon other things, and never grow <hi>weary</hi> of considering them, and inquiring after them, they are wholly <hi>asleep</hi> as to GOD, and never imploy'd about him, as if to think of Him were not any part of our business. O why should we be any longer such <hi>Fools,</hi> as to suffer the <hi>Business</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> of this World, which <hi>passeth away, and the lusts thereof,</hi> or the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of sin which are but for a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> so to bewitch us, that we can never be awake to GOD! Seeing that about <hi>Him</hi> we are most of all concern'd, that our Souls at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the most rational and full satisfaction, let our <hi>Reason</hi> be busied about him, above all things, that so we may be able both to live and die like <hi>men.</hi>

2. Let us <hi>exercise</hi> our Reason in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those things, especially, which are most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>apt</hi> to beget in us the most <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>lively sense</hi> of GOD. For as GOD hath appointed <hi>proper means</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> for the attaining to all those ends which he would have us to pursue: So hath it pleased him to ordain <hi>certain means,</hi> by the use whereof we may <hi>soonest</hi> and most <hi>perfectly</hi> come to the knowledg and belief of Himself. Such are his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Works,</hi> both of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </hi> which are therefore to be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently studied and meditated upon. We must very frequently <hi>read</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> his Word; and when we read or hear it, we must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>attentive</hi> to it, and take heed how we do it in a <hi>regardless</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> manner, or as a <hi>customary Task</hi> only, which we have set our selves to do; as tho the <hi>reading</hi> or the <hi>hearing</hi> of it, were our <hi>only</hi> or <hi>principal</hi> Business. Our work is to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> well of all that we read and hear, that we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>inform'd,</hi> and throughly <hi>convinced,</hi> and heartily <hi>affected</hi> with the matters which are therein commended, either to our <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Practice.</hi> In vain shall we either read or hear GOD's <hi>word,</hi> if we do not labour to <hi>see</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> GOD <hi>himself</hi> speaking to us, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering <hi>Himself</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> unto us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. To read in the <hi>Bible</hi> so many <hi>Chapters</hi> a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65384:77"/>
Day, or to hear so many <hi>Sermons</hi> a Week, is an Employment to as little purpose as the reading or hearing any common History, if we make it not our end to come better <hi>acquainted</hi> with GOD, and to be instructed in our <hi>Duty</hi> of Honouring and Serving him. And thus is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in our <hi>seeing,</hi> and <hi>observing</hi> and making <hi>use</hi> of the many and wonderful <hi>works</hi> of GOD: Whilst we endeavour only to serve <hi>our selves</hi> of them, and not to <hi>discern</hi> GOD in them, we improve nothing in our Knowledg of GOD by them. How many of us busie our selves daily <hi>abroad</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> or at <hi>Home</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> and what <hi>wonders</hi> of GOD's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> have we there constantly before our Eyes! and yet we profit no more in the knowledg of GOD by what we see, than the Beasts themselves. How many of us are very busie in studying and observing the courses of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and in searching in the secrets of <hi>Nature;</hi> and yet never have it once in their Thoughts to learn any thing of GOD by all his wondrous Works! If we would strengthen our belief of GOD, and make any proficiency in the knowledg of him, we must design this, and exercise our Reason in every thing to that end; and labour to <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>see</hi> how good and <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> how <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> GOD shews himself in every thing we meet with. There
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65384:77"/>
is not the most <hi>unlearned</hi> person in the World, but if he will give diligent heed to what he <hi>hears</hi> of GOD, though he connot <hi>read,</hi> and to what he <hi>sees</hi> of GOD, though he cannot <hi>see</hi> GOD himself; he may find enough to confirm him in the belief of GOD, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him very far in the <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD, even past all <hi>doubting.</hi> Especially,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If in the next place, he by serious <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> call upon GOD to open his Eyes that they may see, and his Ears that they may hear, and his Heart that it may understand the things which he hath made necessary for him to believe and know. Let us therefore in good earnest <hi>beg</hi> of GOD himself, that he would <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> himself more <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>convincingly</hi> to us in all the means of Knowledg and Understanding. No man can have a hearty desire to find GOD, but he may assure himself that GOD upon his hearty request will shew himself unto him. <hi>If thou seek the LORD thy GOD, thou shalt find him; if thou seek him with all thy Heart, and and with all thy Soul,</hi> Deut. IV. 29. <hi>God looketh down from Heaven to see if there be any that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and seek after GOD,</hi> Psal. XIV.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But alas! <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after GOD;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65384:78"/>
GOD is not in all his thoughts</hi> Psal. X. 4. If men had rather be without a GOD, than have one; if men be <hi>unwilling</hi> and <hi>afraid</hi> to find GOD, lest they should (as certainly they must) find in GOD a LORD and <hi>Master,</hi> whom they are bound to serve and obey; what wonder is it if GOD withdraw and hide himself from them that love him not? Why should he not depart out of sight, when he is but an eye-sore to them? Why should he not leave all those to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of their own Lusts, who desire not to have him reign over them? What reason can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why GOD should afford them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>eyes</hi> to <hi>see</hi> withal, who above all things cannot endure to see <hi>him?</hi> Or why should he not suffer <hi>Satan</hi> to blind their Minds, that they may never again be able to see that Light which they cannot love? If we would know GOD, let us shew by our earnest <hi>Prayers,</hi> that we <hi>long</hi> to know him.</p>
            <p>Let us never have an <hi>Ear open</hi> to any one, whatsoever he be, that calls in question the <hi>being</hi> of GOD, or would bring us to <hi>doubt</hi> of it. But on the contrary, let us resolutely stop our Ears, and refuse to hearken to the <hi>Atheistical</hi> Discourses of prophane and wicked Persons, of what Rank, Note, or Esteem soever they may be in the World. Let no
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65384:78"/>
one perswade us to think it either <hi>unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or <hi>unmannerly,</hi> thus to behave our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men of this temper. They may call us <hi>obstinate</hi> and <hi>sullen</hi> in refusing to hear Reason, and <hi>uncivil</hi> and <hi>clownish</hi> in turning away from our Betters. But how eminent soever, either for <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> any one may be, who would entertain us with such discourses, as tend to draw us off from believing a GOD; it cannot be neither <hi>Obstinacy</hi> nor <hi>Incivility,</hi> not so much as to take notice of what he saith.</p>
            <p>It cannot be thought <hi>unreasonable,</hi> or an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Stubbornness,</hi> not at all to hearken to any man's Discourse, which we are well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured before-hand can have no <hi>Reason</hi> in it. And we are sure before-hand, that whatever <hi>Reason</hi> may be pretended, (as none brags more of his being a Master of Reason, than the proud <hi>Atheist);</hi> yet no <hi>Reason</hi> at all can be given us, by any one for this opinion, That there is no GOD, or against our believing that there is one. And this is very plain, because as hath been said, no man can be in any degree <hi>sure</hi> that there is no GOD; and the belief that there is one, is at least <hi>probable,</hi> and certainly doth much <hi>good</hi> and no <hi>hurt.</hi> What <hi>Reason</hi> can there possibly be in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, perswading not to believe what can never be proved to be <hi>false;</hi> what it's very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65384:79"/>
               <hi>safe</hi> to believe, and the belief whereof doth the greatest <hi>good</hi> imaginable? Or again, What <hi>Reason</hi> can that Discourse have in it, which tends to perswade us to believe what no man can shew to be true; which it is so <hi>dangerous</hi> to believe, that a man hazards his Soul by it, and the belief whereof will certainly make the wide World too <hi>uneasy</hi> a place to live in? It cannot therefore be <hi>obstinacy</hi> or <hi>unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,</hi> never to hearken to any Discourse of which we know all this before-hand.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be <hi>uncivil,</hi> or <hi>unmannerly,</hi> how great or eminent soever the person be that would entertain us with such Discourses, to turn away our ears from him. What <hi>inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> can it be, to seem <hi>rude</hi> to him, who is so <hi>rude</hi> to the whole World, as in effect to call all men <hi>Fools</hi> but himself? Yea, how can one be <hi>uncivil</hi> to that man, who declares himself the common <hi>Enemy</hi> of Mankind, and of all <hi>Civil Society</hi> and <hi>Government?</hi> How can one be <hi>unmannerly</hi> to him, whose Discourse tends to no better end, than to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt all good <hi>Manners,</hi> and to banish <hi>Virtue</hi> from among men? He that tells us there is no GOD; by telling us so, <hi>absolves</hi> and <hi>dischargeth</hi> us from all manner of <hi>duty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> or <hi>civil respect</hi> to himself as our <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>superior.</hi> For if there be no GOD, who made us to differ from one another, Who
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65384:79"/>
made <hi>him</hi> our <hi>superior,</hi> or <hi>us inferior</hi> to <hi>him?</hi> GOD did not, if he must be believed; for he tells us there is none. And <hi>Man</hi> could not without our consent, for who gave any man that Right over his Fellows? If he have got to be higher than any one else by Might or Cunning; nothing can hinder any one to climb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>â¢â¢â¢</desc>
               </gap>never he can, as he has done; or to trample him under foot, instead of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee to him. Whoever then tempts us to <hi>Atheism,</hi> is soon answer'd if we please. We need do no more, but <hi>despise</hi> him. Or if we will be at any farther trouble with him, we need but ask him two or three Questions, and leave him to answer them to himself when he can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he tells us there is no GOD, and would have us believe it: before we do so, he cannot think it unreasonable we should ask him, <hi>How he knows it?</hi> If he can tell us this, and will not, he is too <hi>unkind</hi> to be thought a friendly Counsellor: and if he cannot, we have little cause to be fond of such a <hi>Teacher.</hi> Is it reason to believe one upon his word, that knows not that to be true which he teacheth? Is it wisdom to follow a Guide, who confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself to be blind?</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he persuades us to believe there
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65384:80"/>
is no GOD, it cannot but be very fit to ask again, <hi>Is it safe so to do?</hi> Or, <hi>Is it unsafe to do otherwise?</hi> He cannot assure us, 'tis <hi>safe</hi> to believe there is no GOD, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make us <hi>know</hi> that there is none. And he must needs confess, 'tis not <hi>unsafe</hi> to believe there is a GOD, because it can do no <hi>hurt.</hi> Is it reasonable then to leave the <hi>safe</hi> way we are already in, that we may follow him into another, wherein he cannot promise us any <hi>safety</hi> at all?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If he would have us to believe there is no GOD, 'tis not unreasonable to ask him, <hi>Why would he have us to believe it?</hi> Or, <hi>What good will it do either him or us?</hi> If it will do neither any good, Why should he persuade us, or we be persuaded to an unprofitable thing? There is danger in it; and what reason is there to do what we know 'tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to do, till we see what good may come of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If he say, 'tis fit to believe it, merely because 'tis a <hi>truth;</hi> We must needs ask again, <hi>How doth he know 'tis a truth?</hi> But yet 'tis in vain to ask him this, because 'tis impossible for him to tell us how he knows it, or to know it. And therefore we have yet no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe it is a truth, because he only
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65384:80"/>
calls it so, who doth not know that it is so. But suppose it were, I hope it may be fit to ask him again, <hi>Is he in good earnest, and would he indeed have us to belive it for a truth?</hi> If he be not willing we should believe it, why doth he tempt us to believe it? If he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have us believe it, would he not also have us behave our selves as men of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? If not, to what purpose are we to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it? If he would have us behave our selves as men that believe not a GOD, then may we do what we will, and can; we may rob his <hi>House,</hi> take his <hi>Money,</hi> defile his <hi>Wife,</hi> and cut his <hi>Throat.</hi> If he deny this, let us ask him, What is it that can make it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to do any of these things? What should restrain men from doing any thing they can for their own advantage? This is all that the <hi>Atheist</hi> can gain by persuading men to be of his Opinion, That he lays himself at every man's mercy to deal as he will with him; and cannot say, That man sins, that knocks him on the head for his good advice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there be a GOD, every one that is <hi>VVise</hi> will not only think himself highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to <hi>believe</hi> it, but so to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>behave</hi> himself in the world, as may be most <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to GOD. To what purpose can it be tobelieve that there is a GOD? or what good can this belief do us, if it do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65384:81"/>
us to live as men who are sensible that they have a GOD over them, whom they are concern'd to please in all things? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if there be a GOD who made us and all things, <hi>He must</hi> needs be concern'd with <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> with <hi>Him.</hi> And as we can expect no good thing but from <hi>Him,</hi> who is the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi> of all things; so neither can we hope to receive any good thing from him, if we do not our endeavour to <hi>please</hi> Him. Why should we thinkHe will bless us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our desire, if we be not careful to serve and honour him according to his <hi>Will?</hi> That therefore we may reap the good and benefit of this so necessary a Belief, we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, <hi>what</hi> it is that we believe, and what <hi>duty</hi> that belief must needs bind upon us. That which we believe, is, That there is a GOD; and to be GOD, is to be the <hi>first Cause</hi> and <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Maker, Preserver, Lord,</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the whole World, and all things therein; the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>highest Power,</hi> the <hi>greatest Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>chief Good.</hi> Now if GOD be all this, then it is very easy for every one to see certain <hi>duties</hi> lying upon us, as we are the <hi>creatures</hi> of GOD, which naturally arise from what we believe, even from this one point, That there is a GOD.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:65384:81"/>
1. GOD being the <hi>first Cause, Author,</hi> and <hi>Maker</hi> of all things, He is the very <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of all <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Life, Power, Wisdom and Goodness.</hi> All these are in him <hi>originally,</hi> as in the inexhaustible <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fountain;</hi> and there can be nothing at all of any of these things in the World, but what is derived from <hi>him;</hi> neither can any of these be any longer in the world, than it pleaseth him. All this must needs be very plain to every Understanding. If then we will live as men who are sensible that there is a GOD by whom we live, and without whom nothing can have either life or being;</p>
            <p>We must needs, <hi>First,</hi> have the <hi>highest</hi> and most <hi>honourable Thoughts</hi> of GOD, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> for him, that can possibly be in the heart of man. We are not to conceive of him, as of one whose <hi>excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>vertues,</hi> tho' they exceed those of any other Being whatsoever, are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within such or such <hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits,</hi> or are at such a <hi>degree,</hi> and no <hi>higher;</hi> but we are to think of him, as of one who in the <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> is <hi>infinitely</hi> above all the thoughts of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> of <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Glory</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> of <hi>boundless Power, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> such as is to be always admired and adored, but never to be fully seen or understood. We are how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65384:82"/>
to labour every day to <hi>know</hi> more and more of him, that the more we know, the more we may <hi>admire,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and even be ravish'd with those <hi>unconceivable excellencies,</hi> which to discern more clearly, will be our eternal happiness in Heaven. Our hearts therefore should be always fill'd with, and our mouths should sound forth the praises of GOD, every one singing with the holy Psalmist, <hi>Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name,</hi> Psal. CIII. 1. <hi>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my GOD thou are very great, thou art clothed with honour and majesty,</hi> Psal. CIV. 1. <hi>While I live will I praise the LORD; I will sing praise unto my GOD, while I have any being,</hi> Psal. CXLVI. 2. <hi>Let every thing that hath breath, praise the LORD,</hi> Psal. CL. 6. <hi>Be thou exalted, O GOD, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth,.</hi> Psal. CVIII. 5. <hi>Blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise,</hi> Neh. IX. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must needs be our Duty to walk <hi>humbly</hi> before GOD, and to <hi>abase</hi> our selves in his <hi>Presence,</hi> whose eyes are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>open</hi> upon us. We must always bear in mind, that he is our GOD and <hi>Maker,</hi> and we are at best but the <hi>work</hi> of his Hands, and had never been any thing, had he not been
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65384:82"/>
pleas'd to give us a being. How <hi>wise,</hi> how <hi>rich,</hi> how <hi>great</hi> soever we now are, or seem to the eyes of men; we have it all, even as far as our very <hi>Being,</hi> of GOD's free gift; and he can whenever he pleaseth, deprive us of all again. He made <hi>all things</hi> of <hi>nothing,</hi> and therefore <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>nothing</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>him.</hi> What is the <hi>clay</hi> in the hand of the <hi>Potter,</hi> who can do with it what he <hi>will?</hi> And how much less than that is <hi>man</hi> in the hand of GOD? The <hi>Potter</hi> can form the clay into a new <hi>shape,</hi> or cast it away and trample on it; but he neither gave it a <hi>being,</hi> nor can take away it's being from it. But GOD gave us, and all things, our very <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> look therefore how much <hi>nothing</hi> is less than <hi>all things,</hi> so much are the <hi>best</hi> of men less than GOD; we being all originally <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Say then with the Psalmist. <hi>LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledg of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? Man is like to vanity, his days are as a shadow that passeth away,</hi> Psal. CXLIV. 3, 4. <hi>Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea the stars are not pure in his sight. How much less man that is a worm, and the son of man which is a worm?</hi> Job XXV. 5, 6. <hi>All nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him, less than nothing, and vanity,</hi> Isa. XL. 17. <hi>Verily every man at his best
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65384:83"/>
state is altogether vanity,</hi> Psal. XXXIX. 5. And when ever GOD <hi>rebukes him, he makes his beauty to consume away like a moth,</hi> v. 11. <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity,</hi> Psalm LXII. 9. And shall such a thing as man be proud? Can man seem any thing in his own eyes, when he thinks upon GOD? Alas! what cannot he do with us, who with a word made all things of nothing? What can we do, either against him, or without him, without whom we cannot one moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in being?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If GOD be the <hi>Maker</hi> of us and of all things, then is it past all dispute, that both <hi>we,</hi> and <hi>all things,</hi> are <hi>His;</hi> and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the least <hi>right</hi> to our selves, and therefore none to any thing else, but what he is pleased to allow us. Nothing could make him so <hi>absolute a right</hi> in and over us, to <hi>use</hi> and <hi>dispose</hi> us at pleasure, as this, That he <hi>made</hi> us of <hi>nothing.</hi> We therefore and all things are <hi>absolutely his own;</hi> and being so, 'tis his indisputable right, to <hi>order</hi> and <hi>dispose</hi> of every thing as it shall seem good to him, to place us <hi>where</hi> he will, give us <hi>what</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he will, assign us what <hi>Condition</hi> he will, and put us to what <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> it pleaseth him. <hi>Know ye that the LORD he is GOD,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65384:83"/>
it is he that bath made us, and not we our selves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture,</hi> Psal. C. 3.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>first,</hi> It must needs be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty most humbly to <hi>acknowledg</hi> GOD's <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute right</hi> in and to us, and all things, and in a due acknowledgment of the same, to yield up our selves, and all things most freely, and without any grudging, to be disposed of by him, according to his own Will and Pleasure. We must leave it wholly to GOD, to use his right as he pleaseth, and to do what he will with his own; knowing assuredly, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he doth with us, or any other thing, he doth but what he <hi>may</hi> do, and can do us no <hi>wrong:</hi> Yea, he always doth what's <hi>best</hi> and <hi>fittest</hi> to be done, because he is of infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> Whatever therefore is come to pass, or shall come to pass in the world; whatever hath befallen, or shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us, it is our duty to <hi>submit</hi> to it, and to set our hearts at <hi>rest</hi> about it; remembring that GOD is always doing, what best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to do; and permitting to be done, what is most proper to be done. <hi>He doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</hi> Dan. IV. 35. What are we, that we should concern our selves any farther with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65384:84"/>
GOD's Doings, whatever they be, than to admire his <hi>Wisdom</hi> in them? The posture of Soul wherein we should always be, as best becoming us, is that of a most <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>willing Resignation</hi> of our selves, and all our concerns unto his ordering; every one say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after our most blessed JESUS, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. XXVI. 39. and v. 42. <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to account it our duty in all that we have or do, so to behave our selves, as becometh those who <hi>have</hi> nothing of their <hi>own,</hi> neither <hi>are</hi> their <hi>own,</hi> but must own both <hi>themselves,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> they have to be <hi>his,</hi> who made them. We must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take to our selves any other <hi>Liberty</hi> in any thing, than what GOD gives us. We must not make so bold with his <hi>right,</hi> as to do what we have a mind to do with <hi>our selves</hi> or any thing else; but enquire first, what he gives us <hi>leave</hi> to do. GOD is pleased to allow us as much liberty in all things, as may do us <hi>good;</hi> and hath freely bestow'd his good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon us, so far as they may be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>us</hi> in our serving of <hi>him.</hi> But as we have them of his gift, so hath he given them upon such <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>him;</hi> and upon no other terms we are to aceount them <hi>ours.</hi> Together with them, he has given us <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> to be careful
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65384:84"/>
ly observed by us in the use of them. It were very absurd for us to think any thing so <hi>ours,</hi> that we may <hi>use</hi> it to GOD's Dishonour, or to <hi>hurt</hi> our selves or others with what we have. Our <hi>Meat</hi> we have for <hi>Nourishment,</hi> not for <hi>Gluttony;</hi> our <hi>Drink</hi> for <hi>Refreshment,</hi> not for <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> our <hi>Cloaths</hi> for a <hi>Decent</hi> and <hi>Warm</hi> covering, not for <hi>Pride:</hi> Our <hi>Wit,</hi> our <hi>Strength,</hi> our <hi>Wealth,</hi> and all things, to do <hi>good</hi> with, but not to help or incourage us to <hi>hurt</hi> any one. All things we possess are our <hi>Master's goods,</hi> and we our selves are his <hi>Servants.</hi> No man ought to say, I may do what I will with mine <hi>own;</hi> for nothing is so our <hi>own,</hi> as that we are <hi>sole</hi> or <hi>absolute Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of it. As GOD is to be <hi>thank'd</hi> for the use and benefit of all, so is he also to be <hi>consulted</hi> and <hi>obey'd</hi> in the use of all. <hi>For the earth is the LORD</hi>'s, <hi>and the fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the world and they that dwell therein.</hi> Psalm XXIV. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it must needs be our duty, not to <hi>repine</hi> or <hi>murmur,</hi> not to be <hi>fretful</hi> and <hi>impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi> but to be <hi>content</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> whatever comes to pass.</p>
            <p>Do evil doers, and such as we think deserve worst at the hands of GOD, flourish and prosper; What's that to us? GOD is but doing his pleasure with his <hi>own.</hi> Have we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65384:85"/>
not all, and more than is our due? And hath not he, whose own are all things, a right to distribute them as he pleaseth? Hath GOD given others any thing that was ours? And is it not of his free and undeserved Gift, that any thing is ours? <hi>Fret not thy self because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity,</hi> Psal. XXXVII. 1. <hi>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thy self because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man that bringeth wicked devices to pass,</hi> v. 7. <hi>But wait on the LORD, and keep his way,</hi> v. 34. What have we to do to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at GOD's disposing of his own?</p>
            <p>Do we <hi>suffer</hi> evil things? Why should we not, if it seem good unto GOD? Are we not his? And may he not use <hi>his own</hi> as he will? What ever the evils be, or by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are brought upon us, we are to submit with <hi>patience.</hi> No instrument could hurt us, if he did not permit it; and may he not permit what he will to be done to <hi>his own?</hi> Are we rob'd or spoyl'd, let us say, <hi>The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away, blessed be the name of the LORD,</hi> Job I. 21. <hi>It is the LORD, let him do what seemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. III. 18. Whatever befals us, let us say, <hi>Behold here I am, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him,</hi> 2 Sam. XV. 26. <hi>I was dumb, and opened not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65384:85"/>
my mouth, because thou didst it,</hi> Psalm XXXIX. 9.</p>
            <p>Is our present <hi>Condition</hi> scanty, uneasy, unpleasant, unsuitable to our minds? What are we, that we should think to chuse for our selves, <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> condition of life, which we think best; who are not <hi>our own,</hi> neither can chuse, whether we shall <hi>live</hi> or <hi>die?</hi> Is not our <hi>Condition,</hi> whatever it be, better than we deserve? And is it not of GOD's chusing for us? And is it not fit he should place <hi>his own Goods</hi> in <hi>his own</hi> House, <hi>where,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> he pleaseth? Have we not all that we have right to have, when we have what it pleaseth GOD to give us? And are we not in the condition we should be in, when we are as it hath pleased GOD to dispose of us? <hi>Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, what makest thou?</hi> Isa. XLV. 9. <hi>Shall the thing formed, say unto him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> Rom. IX. 20, 21. <hi>Having food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us be therewith content,</hi> 1 Tim. VI. 8. Yea, this is our duty, <hi>to learn, in whatsoever state we are, therewith to be content,</hi> Phil. IV. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be a GOD, who made both
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65384:86"/>
               <hi>us</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the world, then is he our LORD, and the <hi>Governour</hi> of all the world. As he alone by reason of his <hi>infinite Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> can be thought fit to <hi>rule</hi> the world, so can he not have a more <hi>absolute Soveraignty</hi> over it, or <hi>Right</hi> to govern it, than that which is founded in <hi>Propriety;</hi> nor any <hi>Propriety</hi> more sure and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than that which ariseth from <hi>Creation</hi> or his making <hi>all things</hi> of <hi>nothing.</hi> Therefore <hi>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Psal. CIII. 19.</p>
            <p>It is then our duty, to be <hi>subject</hi> to his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> in all things. To <hi>submit</hi> to his <hi>Providence,</hi> in ordering all the Affairs of the world; and to <hi>approve</hi> of all his <hi>wise Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations,</hi> whatever changes or alterations he makes in <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> To <hi>obey</hi> all his <hi>Laws,</hi> and apply our selves diligently to the <hi>learning</hi> of them, that we may frame our whole lives by them. It must needs concern us, <hi>to be in the fear of the LORD all the day long,</hi> Prov. XXIII. 17. <hi>To stand in awe, and not sin.</hi> Psal. IV. 4.</p>
            <p>Again; If GOD, be our <hi>Governour,</hi> it must be our duty to <hi>trust</hi> to his Government, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> therein. For how can we be <hi>safer,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:65384:86"/>
or <hi>happier,</hi> than to be under the Government and Protection of infinite <hi>Power, Wisdom, and Goodness? The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of the Isles be glad thereof,</hi> Psal. XCVII. 1. Let us <hi>be careful for nothing,</hi> Phil. IV. 6. Neither <hi>take thought for the morrow,</hi> Mat. VI. 34. <hi>but trust in the LORD and do good: so shall we dwell in the land, and verily we shall be fed,</hi> Psal. XXXVII. 3. <hi>The LORD will bless the righteous, with favour will he compass him as with ashield,</hi> Isa. V. 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there be a GOD, who is the <hi>first Cause</hi> of all things, he must needs be the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Blessedness,</hi> and the <hi>chief good;</hi> no good thing can be expected but from him alone, and all our <hi>happiness</hi> must consist in his <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>The whole <hi>desire</hi> of our Souls should be to continue in his <hi>favour,</hi> and to have his <hi>love.</hi> Nothing should be so much our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and endeavour, even all the days of our life, as how in all things to <hi>please</hi> him, and to do such things only as we know to be most <hi>acceptable</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Next, It must certainly be our duty to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65384:87"/>
               <hi>love</hi> GOD above all things; for 'tis most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural not to love that <hi>best,</hi> which is <hi>best</hi> in it self, and doth us <hi>most good.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our duty to love nothing more than GOD, nothing <hi>so much</hi> as GOD; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in Subordination, or in <hi>Relation</hi> to him. <hi>That is,</hi> nothing but what GOD <hi>allows</hi> us to love, and so as for the love of GOD, we can any time be willing to part with it; nothing but what may <hi>help</hi> us the better to love GOD, and nothing that <hi>abates</hi> our love to GOD. We are to love GOD in all the things we love, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath any <hi>loveliness,</hi> but what is from GOD.</p>
            <p>And because GOD is the <hi>chief good,</hi> we are to be <hi>content</hi> with GOD, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else we want; and whatever else we have, never to be satisfied with it, or to make account that we have any thing at all, whilst we can find no good ground to hope that GOD is <hi>our</hi> GOD, and that we are in his <hi>favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Finally,</hi> Seeing GOD is the <hi>Author</hi> of all <hi>Goodness,</hi> we are on all occasions most humbly to address our selves to him in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> for a supply of all our wants of what sort soever; and to return him our daily
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65384:87"/>
               <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanks</hi> for every good thing we enjoy.</p>
            <p>He that doth not thus behave himself towards GOD, is no better for believing that there is a GOD; neither, whatever he may pretend, shall he easily persuade any considering man, that he believes any such thing.</p>
