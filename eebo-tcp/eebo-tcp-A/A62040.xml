            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SUch is the beauty of Holiness, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Divine Nature, and the reasonableness, and righteousness of the Service of God; as also the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Mans devoting himself wholly to it, that were not his understanding, which is the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>lesser world,</hi> strangely <hi>

                  </gap>uffled</hi> with <hi>clouds</hi>; his will, which as the <hi>Moon,</hi> borroweth its light from it, full of <hi>spots</hi> and <hi>changes,</hi> and desperately bent upon evil; his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as <hi>stars of malevolent influence,</hi> brutishly enslaved to his sensual appetite; and his whole nature deplorably vitiated, it were impossible for him, to turn his back upon the authority, commands, and threatnings of his Maker; to
<pb facs="tcp:63388:4"/>
trample on the bowels, and blood, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Redeemer; to despise the motions, and perswasions, and assistance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in order to his recovery out of that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless gulph of misery, into which he hath plunged himself, and his restauration to a state of purity and eternal happiness; and there would be no such need of calling so frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and of crying so urgently and earnestly to him, <hi>to exercise himself unto godliness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he that is an Atheist in his <hi>principles,</hi> and denyeth the being of such a thing as Religion, must deny his very senses, since his eyes, and ears, and taste, and feeling, do all loudly Preach a deity to him; So he that is an Atheist in his <hi>practices,</hi> and denyeth the making Religion his business, must deny his reason, and debase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a <hi>Beast</hi>; for common understanding, notwithstanding its great loss by the fall, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that he is made for higher things then the service of a brutish flesh, and the pursuit of earthly fading enjoyments, and that the worship of his God (the Fountain of his being, and well-spring of his happiness) as most sutable to his spiritual nature, as most conducing to his own advancement, interest and perfection, is most worthy of all his heart, and soul, and strength, and of all his time, and care, and labour.</p>
            <p>But alas the sad fruit of mans apostacy, in the depravation of his nature, abundantly manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self to every eye that is not stark blind. As an <hi>old disease,</hi> doth not onely afflict the part
<pb facs="tcp:63388:4"/>
of its proper residence, and by its habitual abode there, make a continual diminution of the strength; but also makes a path and Channel for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to run thither, which by continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluction, dig an open passage, and prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the natural power of resistance: So hath <hi>Original</hi> sin debauched the <hi>mind,</hi> and made it think crooked things straight, and straight things crooked, loathsom things lovely, and lovely things loathsom; perverted the <hi>will,</hi> and made it as a <hi>diseased stomach,</hi> to call for, and eat unwholsom meat, against his own reason; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled his <hi>affections,</hi> to sensuality and brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; chained the whole man, and delivered it up to the <hi>law of sin,</hi> and laid those strengths of reason and conscience in fetters, by which it might be hindered in its vicious inclinations, and course of prophaness. Hence it comes to pass, that neither the beauty of grace, nor equity of living to God, nor the absolute necessity of mans exercising himself to godliness, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him.</p>
            <p>So great is the <hi>glory and amiableness of the New Creation,</hi> that not onely the <hi>Saints</hi> who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with wisdom from above, and can judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, esteem it above their honours, and riches, and relations, and lives, and rejoyce in it as their peculiar priviledge and highest dignitie; but even <hi>Angels,</hi> behold it with admiration, and look on their own purity, and conformity to the divine nature and pleasure, as their greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Nay, <hi>God</hi> himself, whose being is the
<pb facs="tcp:63388:5"/>
pattern, and whose will is the rule of holiness, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished and enamoured with it, as that which is the travail of the soul of his dear son, the immediate work of his own spirit, and the end, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and master-piece of all the works of his hands; Yet this heavenly off-spring, this divine image, this supernatural beam of light, this resemblance and picture of Gods own perfections, this royal attire of the celestial Courtiers, which rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the poorest and meanest Christian, more noble and excellent then his highest, and richest, ungodly Neighbour, and makes him more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then a clear skie, bespangled with the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning stars, or an imperial Diadem, sparkling with the richest Diamonds, is the scorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of the blind unworthy world; That as <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> complained in his days,<note place="margin">

            </p>

think fit, and upon their own terms; but like those whom the <hi>Romans</hi> took in <hi>War,</hi> over whose persons and estates they had an absolute domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as a right to their works and service. Though the Commands of Christ, are all <hi>holy, just,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as profitable for man, as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for himself, yet he hath absolute authority over man, and all that he hath, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him what he pleaseth. As <hi>Laban</hi> said to <hi>Iacob, These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, these cattel are my cattel, and all thou seest is mine</hi>: So the Redeemer, by vertue of the price he laid down, his most precious blood, may say to every man, <hi>This soul is my soul, this body is my body, this estate is my estate, these children and friends are my children and friends, this name, and credit, and interest, is mine, and all thou haste is mine.</hi> Yet alas, men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>So absolute is the necessity of mans making Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion his business,</hi> that upon his diligence or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence herein, his eternal salvation or damnation
<pb facs="tcp:63388:6"/>
doth depend. If any man will be Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he must <hi>deny himself,</hi> disclaim all title, and disown all right to himself, have nothing more to do with himself, as upon his own account, and make an unfaigned, unreserved dedication of himself, and all that he hath to the honour and interest of his Redeemer. Sanctification is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from all common to sacred uses, and this must be done with all the heart, and soul, and strength, in the whole course of the life, by all that will escape the wrath to come; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth men to <hi>strive to enter in at the straight gate, to work out their salvations with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to be holy as he is holy, in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi>; and his word is like the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians, which cannot be altered.</hi> He hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned nothing but what his infinite wisdom saw fit, and he is resolved not to vary the least tittle, not to abate the least farthing of the price he hath set. Foolish men are so besotted by their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts, and befooled by the Devil, that they complement with Religion, and onely give it an outside formal salute, instead of cordial embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and real entertainment. They deal with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as <hi>Anacharsis</hi> saith the <hi>Athenians</hi> dealt with <hi>money,</hi> using it for no other end but to <hi>number and cast up accounts with,</hi> whereas it might have served them for excellent purposes. So they use Religion onely for a shew, for fashion, for custom, and are satisfied with an hypocritical way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God, and think to put God off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whereas it would serve them for high and
<pb facs="tcp:63388:7"/>
honourable ends, it would if entertained in the power and life of it, elevate the Christian above this beggarly world, enable him to combat with, and conquer his sturdy stubborn lusts, and the power and policy of Hell, help him to a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, to converse and communion with the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, and dress his soul for a blessed eternity.</p>
            <p>Reader, If thou art unacquainted with this high and honourable, this worthy and noble <hi>Calling of Christianity</hi>; I shall appeal to thy reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in the tender of some questions, possibly one or other of them may prevail with thee to bind thy self <hi>Apprentice</hi> to it. As a <hi>Fowler,</hi> according to the different nature of his game, contrives and appropriates his stratagems, that some he catcheth with <hi>light,</hi> as <hi>Larks</hi> with a glass and day nets; some with <hi>baits,</hi> as <hi>Pigeons</hi> with pease; some with <hi>frights,</hi> as <hi>Blackbirds</hi> with a low-bell; some with <hi>company,</hi> as <hi>Ducks</hi> with decoy fowl. So I shall endeavour to suit my questions to thy temper, whatever it be, that if either the <hi>light</hi> of reason, or the <hi>bait</hi> of unconceiveable and infinite profit, or the <hi>frights</hi> of dreadful threatnings and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or the <hi>company</hi> of Christ the captain of our salvation and all his followers and Souldiers, who marched to Heaven in this way, will win upon thee, I may perswade thee to make Religion thy business. <hi>O that being crafty, I might catch thee with holy guile!</hi> To this end I beseech thee to weigh the questions, again, and again, as thou readest them, and to dart up thy prayers to Heaven for a

One of the Sons main works, was to purchase the re-impression of Gods Image on man; the actual performance of which, is the peculiar office of the Spirit; hence he tells us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. <hi>I go away that the comforter may come,</hi> and again, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. <hi>The Spirit was not yet given,</hi> (i. e. so plentifully and universally) <hi>because Iesus was not yet glorified.</hi> And therefore we read, that in few days after his ascension, to acquaint us what was one main end and fruit of his death and suffering; he powreth down the holy Ghost in an extraordinary manner and measure. So that Creation, the work of the Father, doth as it were provide the matter, the wax.

            <p>Now Reader, doth not the Sanctification of the Soul deserve to be thy main business, when it is the curious work of the holy Spirit; as that which the Fathers eye was chiafly on in thy Creation, and the Sons in thy Redemption.</p>
            <p>Is not that worthy to be made thy business, <hi>which addeth a real worth to every thing, and without

Every one will grant, that what is so richly excellent, as to enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and add an intrinsick value to whatsoever it is affixed; and the lack of which maketh every thing (be they in other respects never so precious) low and mean, must needs deserve to be our business.

Why are some Angels advanced to the highest Heavens, waiting always in the presence of the King of Kings, honoured to be his Ministers and Deputies in the Government of this lower world; when other Angels are thrown down into the lowest Hell, for ever banished the Celestial Court, and bound in chains of darkness, as priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the day of execution? but holiness in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and want of it in the latter.</p>

That cannot be of mean worth, which can make a man encounter his last enemy with courage and conquest; at the sight of which, Kings, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Nobles, and the greatest Warriers have trembled, as <hi>leaves</hi> with the <hi>wind,</hi> and their hearts melted as <hi>grease</hi> before the <hi>fire.</hi>

            <p>Now Reader, Godliness is that wine which will cause thee to sing at the approach of this <hi>Goliah,</hi> and enable thee as <hi>Leviathan, to laugh at the shaking of his spear</hi>; when whole hosts of others, without Godliness, flie like Cowards before it, and would give all they are worth to avoid fighting with it. Heark what a challenge the godly sends to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, daring it to meet him in the field; O <hi>death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy victory! the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law; But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 57, 58. The Naturalists tell us of a precious stone called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunias,</hi>

Truely Godliness will do this for thee, it will turn this <hi>day of the perdition</hi> of ungodly men into <hi>a day of redemption</hi> to thee; As true Gold is not consumed by the hottest fire, and the <hi>Salamander</hi> can live in the greatest flames; so the godly man, in the midst of all those fires and flames, will live and flourish though millions of ungodly ones are scorched and tortured. As he is a <hi>King</hi> now reigning over his stubborn lusts and unruly passions; that will be his <hi>Coronation day,</hi> wherein he will appear before the whole world in all his glory and royalty. As he is a <hi>Husbandman</hi> now sowing to the Spirit; that will be his <hi>Harvest-day,</hi> wherein he shall reap the fruit of all his prayers, and tears, and watchings, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and labour, and sufferings.

            <p>Little dost thou conceive Reader, the worth of Godliness at that day. Godliness will then be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and admired, not onely by them that have it, and rejoyce in it; but also by the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and carnal wretches, and those who now despise and deride it.

O friend, what wouldst thou give at that day, that godliness had been thy business at this day!

O why should it not be thus in spirituals!

               <p>Be righteous in <hi>buying.</hi> Take heed lest thou lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est out thy money to purchase endless misery. Some have bought places to bury their <hi>bodies</hi> in, but more have bought those commodities which have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up their <hi>souls.

               <p>In buying do not work either upon the <hi>ignorance</hi> or the <hi>poverty</hi> of the Seller.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63388:31"/>
how cheap soever he buyeth, will make it an <hi>hard pennyworth</hi> in the end. He makes the best Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, that like holy <hi>David</hi> payeth the full <hi>just price. Nay</hi> (saith he, of <hi>Ornans</hi> threshing floor) <hi>but I will buy it for the full price,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 22, 24. <hi>Ahab</hi> never bought a <hi>dearer</hi> purchase then <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, for which he paid not <hi>one penny.</hi>

               <p>Do not work upon the Sellers <hi>poverty.</hi> This is to <hi>grind</hi> the faces of the poor, and great oppression; It is no mean sin in many rich Citizens, who take advantage on the <hi>necessity</hi> of poor trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The poor man must sell, or his Family starve; the rich man knoweth it, and will buy but at such a rate, that the other with all his labour shall not earn his own bread. God made the rich to <hi>releive,</hi> but these (I must be bold to say) <hi>rob</hi> the poor. Its an ill way for any to <hi>raise</hi> themselves higher in the world by <hi>trampling</hi> poor men under their feet. God hath sometimes made their houses, (as high and as firm as they were) to fall down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, who have thus sucked out the blood of poor mens hearts. Some will tell us, They do no wrong herein; for if poor men will not take their money, they may let it alone, they do not <hi>force</hi> them. Reader, if thy soul be died with this crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sin, I shall onely ask thee this question; <hi>Is this to love thy Neighbour as thy self? If thou hadst a Wife and several small Children, and the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God had called thee to this poor mans condition; wouldst thou be contented to work hard a whole week, and when thou wast compelled to fell thy wares to buy food for thy family, to receive (the money for materials deducted) but six pence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63388:32"/>
or twelve pence for all thy pains? Let thy own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be judge in this ease:</hi> Is not this, for men to live like <hi>fish,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> devouring the <hi>lesser</hi>? I have heard a Country Mercer say (who is now in heaven) that several times, when poor men have brought <hi>lace,</hi> or <hi>ribands,</hi> or other ware to him, he hath tried how low he could beat the price, and because of their necessities, he hath brought them to allow their commodities for less then the very materials cost them; but after he had so done, he durst not but give them a just equitable price; his conscience would not suffer him to make them <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> because their poverty necessitated them to <hi>sell.</hi> And truly where men act otherwise, though their consciences may be <hi>quiet,</hi> because <hi>asleep,</hi> yet they have no true <hi>rest,</hi> and the time will come that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will <hi>awake</hi> to their wo. When some of the Jews had bought Lands and Vineyards of their brethren at an under rate, they being forced to Mortgage them to get bread, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> rebukes them severely for working upon others extremity; and desires God to <hi>shake every man out of his possession,</hi> who did not make restitution, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 12, 13. Such <hi>wealth</hi> to a man, is like <hi>Ionah</hi> to the Whale; though he swallow it down, yet he will finde it too <hi>hard a Morsel</hi> to digest, and have no ease till he hath restored and vomited it up again.</p>
               <p>Be righteous in thy payments. Pay what thou agreest, and pay it in good money.</p>
               <p>Pay <hi>what thou contractest for.</hi> If thou buyest wares with an intention not to <hi>pay,</hi> thou <hi>stealest</hi> them; and truly such wealth will melt away like Wax

before the Sun. Such ill gotten goods, will as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in a damp <hi>Cellar,</hi> moulder and come to nothing. <hi>He that hath any such riches,</hi> saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, must speedily away with it, or else he locketh up a Theif in his Counting-house, which will carry all away, and if he look not the better to it, his precious soul also.</hi> He is notoriously unrighteous, that like the <hi>Harpie</hi> (which hath its name in <hi>Hebrew</hi> from injustice) seizeth upon all he can meet with as prey. Mark, Reader, how pious honest <hi>Iacob</hi> was in this particular; when the Patriarchs had bought Corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and given their money to them that sold it, yet when upon their return he found the money in their sacks; <hi>Take</hi> (saith he) <hi>the money that was brought again, in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hands; peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was an oversight,</hi> Gen. 43. 12. How many would have concealed the money, stopt the mouth of their consciences with the <hi>first payment,</hi> and have kept it now as <hi>lawful prize</hi>; but <hi>Iacobs</hi> consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was more tender mouthed.</p>
               <p>Let thy payments <hi>be in good Money.</hi> Its Treason against the King to make bad money, and its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the King of Kings (knowingly) to <hi>pay</hi> brass money; If thou dischargest thy debt in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate coyn, thou contractest a greater debt on thy soul, and defilest thy conscience.

               <p>I do not deny but amongst Christians, a man (that hath the opportunity) may choose out <hi>some,</hi> rather then <hi>others</hi> to be his most intimate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; Christ, though he loved <hi>all</hi> his Disciples, yet had <hi>one</hi> especially, <hi>the beloved Disciple, who leaned on Iesus bosome</hi>; Amongst <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> he vouchsafed to <hi>three</hi> onely the favour of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary friendship.

               <p>But if I might advise thee Reader, in such a Choice, I would give thee these two Cautions.</p>
               <p>First, That thou <hi>prefer those whom God prefers</hi>; I mean such as have <hi>most grace</hi>; Its a sign of a <hi>Coward</hi> to choose a <hi>weak</hi> enemy, and its a sign of <hi>little</hi> grace to choose the <hi>weakest</hi> Christian friends; He that hath most of Gods heart, deserveth most of thine; I am ready to think, that <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> that had <hi>more</hi> of Christs <hi>love</hi> then the rest, had <hi>more</hi> of his <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> then the rest.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In Answer to these things, I shall first lay down one or two Distinctions, and then some Positions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Distinct.</hi> There are sinners of several formes in Satans School. Some that learn too much the <hi>lesson</hi> he sets them, but quarrel not with the Scholars of a contrary Master; though they are ungracious, yet they are not out-ragious, these are wild Beasts in a Cage, or in Chains, that a man may sometimes take notice of without any hurt. Others do not onely study the <hi>lectures</hi> he sets them, be they never so full of blasphemie and debaucherie; but seek to make <hi>Proselites,</hi> and cast scorn and contempt upon all piety, and <hi>rail</hi> at those that will not learn their <hi>black art</hi>; these are in his upper form, and have proceeded from <hi>standing in the way of sinners, to sitting in the seat of the scornful,</hi> and will be ready in a short time to be sent to Hell, the onely <hi>Academy</hi> to which he prefers his Scholars; these are worse then the Dogs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they when the Israelites marched towards <hi>Canaan, not stir their tongues,</hi> but these bark at all that sets out for Heaven. Many who had risings and spots in the <hi>skin of the flesh,</hi> were not to be judged <hi>unclean,</hi> and shut out of the <hi>Camp,</hi> but those that had the <hi>scab spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> much in the skin (typifying those whose sinful courses were <hi>gaining</hi> and <hi>growing</hi> upon themselves or others, <hi>Levit.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 8.) they were to be thrust <hi>out of the Camp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Distinct.</hi> It is one thing to come into wicked mens company, as a mans <hi>occasions</hi> or <hi>relations</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and it is another thing to choose such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;

                  <hi>David was</hi> frequently amongst the bad, but his <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> was onely amongst the good. An <hi>Acquaintance</hi> is one thing, and a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion</hi> is another thing. <hi>Acquaintance</hi> is the <hi>Herd</hi>; A companion is the <hi>particular</hi> one, culled out of it for a <hi>special friend.</hi> Its one thing to have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate familiarity,</hi> and another thing to have <hi>common</hi> and <hi>civil commerce</hi> with such men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Position. To love my Neighbour as my self,</hi> doth not infer an <hi>equality,</hi> but the <hi>quality</hi> of my love. A Christian must love <hi>all</hi> men <hi>truly,</hi> but is not bound to love all men <hi>equally.</hi> The greatest degree of our love is limited by God himself (next to his blessed Majesty and our selves) to these two objects, <hi>the houshold of faith,</hi> and our <hi>own houshold,</hi> not <hi>excluding</hi> others, but <hi>preferring</hi> these, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> even within our <hi>selves,</hi> there is a difference in our love; we love our <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> and other <hi>vital</hi> parts, with a closer affection then those <hi>outward integral</hi> parts that are not of so great concernment to us. I may therefore love every man as <hi>my self,</hi> and yet love some above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and my own soul above <hi>all. Exemplar potius est exemplato. The example is before the thing exemplified.</hi> If a man is bound to love another as <hi>himself,</hi> he must needs love himself first, and <hi>more</hi> then another. Thy love to them, may cause thee to <hi>hope</hi> that thou mayst <hi>convert</hi> them, but thy love to thy self should make thee <hi>fear</hi> lest they should <hi>pervert</hi> thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Position.</hi> A Christian is bound to avoid all <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less society</hi> with wicked men. Mark, I say <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>; When our <hi>Relations</hi> command it, as amongst
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63388:85"/>
Husbands and Wives, and Parents and Children, or our <hi>Vocations</hi> call for it, then it is necessary. Those precepts that enjoyn us to forbear their company, are to be understood when we have no <hi>call</hi> to it. We may <hi>Trade</hi> with wicked men, we must perform all <hi>moral duties</hi> to our Kindred, and acts of <hi>courtesie</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to the worst of our enemies, so we be careful to keep our selves from their <hi>corruptions,</hi> and use their company no <hi>longer</hi> then the discharge of those duties doth require. When by admitting their <hi>persons,</hi> we cannot avoid their <hi>vices,</hi> we must <hi>deny both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Position.</hi> Christians should as God gives them opportunity, if there be any hope of doing good, <hi>endeavour to reform men, before they wholly reject their company</hi>; Nay, and <hi>pray</hi> for their welfare after they have refused them for Companions. Its small kindness to shut up a man that hath the <hi>plague,</hi> lest he should infect <hi>others,</hi> and to use no <hi>means</hi> for his own cure. If I finde that a man is <hi>desperately</hi> bent in wickedness, that Religion is the object of his <hi>laughter,</hi> and to give him any serious counsel, is <hi>to cast Pearl before Swine</hi>; I must judge such <hi>Ishmaels</hi> and <hi>Esaus,</hi> unworthy of humane society; but its a very hard case to shut a man up in a <hi>Coffin,</hi> and bury him before he be quite <hi>dead</hi>

                  </gap> Sometimes vicious men are in <hi>distress,</hi> and a godly man hath a call from God to do him some charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble office; here the Christian may have less <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>receiving hurt</hi> from them. Afflictions are <hi>bonds,</hi> and these beasts in <hi>Chains</hi> are not so unruly; <hi>Pauls Viper</hi> benummed with <hi>cold</hi> did not sting him; Here a Christian hath also more <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>doing good</hi> to

them. The hard <hi>mettal,</hi> when in the <hi>fire,</hi> may receive impressions. Men will take that Physick willingly in their <hi>sickness,</hi> which they refused in <hi>health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Position.</hi> A Christian may <hi>love a wicked man sincerely, though he wholly shun his society.</hi> He may affect him with a love of <hi>pity,</hi> though not of <hi>complacency</hi>; He may shew his love by powring out his heart in petitions to God for him. Though a Saint deny a scandalous sinner his <hi>presence,</hi> yet he doth not deny him his <hi>pity,</hi> nor his <hi>prayers</hi>; Nay, our <hi>Non-Communion</hi> may be a means of their conversion; <hi>If any obey not the word, have no company with him; that he may be ashamed,</hi> 2 Thes. 3. 14. Shame and <hi>Confusion,</hi> is a good step towards <hi>Conversion</hi>; A wicked mans presence <hi>burdens</hi> a Saint, and a godly mans presence <hi>hardens</hi> a sinner.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I Answer, More generally. All our Saviours actions are for our instruction, but all are not for our imitation. Christ indeed <hi>hath left us an example, that we should follow his steps,</hi>

Christ did nothing <hi>amiss,</hi> but he that shall undertake to do in <hi>all</hi> things as he did, will follow him <hi>too close,</hi> and do many things amiss. It may be commendable to imitate my <hi>Soveraign,</hi> but it is possible enough to do it so far as to be <hi>guilty of treason</hi> by it. Some of Christs actions were done by him as <hi>man,</hi> others were done by him as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> or <hi>God-man</hi>; In many of these latter we <hi>cannot</hi> imitate him, in others we <hi>may not.</hi> Who <hi>can</hi> work Miracles, forgive Sins, &amp;c. as Christ did? Who <hi>may</hi> appoint Apostles, constitute Laws for the Church, &amp;c. as Christ did?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. More particularly, <hi>Christ had a Call,</hi> which all others have not, to go amongst wicked men. Where should a Physitian be, but amongst his Patients? to deal with such is his <hi>calling.</hi> Christ came to <hi>call sinners to repentance,</hi> to heal their vitiated natures, and therefore it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary he should associate with them. He went amongst them, not as a <hi>friend</hi> to their <hi>sins,</hi> but as a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian</hi> to their <hi>souls</hi>; How should he otherwise have cast out Devils, cured their sicknesses, and proved his Deity to their faces? An Ambassadour being <hi>commissionated</hi> by his Prince, may do that, which if an ordinary Subject should do, may cost him his life. <hi>Abraham</hi> might (having <hi>liberty</hi> from God) <hi>stand still</hi> and <hi>behold Sodom</hi> flaming, when <hi>Lot</hi> might not so much as cast an <hi>eye,</hi> or have a <hi>glance</hi> towards it. Christ was sent to the <hi>lost sheep of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63388:87"/>
house of Israel,</hi> and so he went to them in discharge of his <hi>Errand</hi> and <hi>Mission</hi>; He had also a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission under his Fathers Hand and Seal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. <hi>Christ had no tinder about him to take fire,</hi> being conceived without <hi>sin</hi>; but we are little else then <hi>dry tinder,</hi> and therefore have cause to avoid the <hi>least spark. The Prince of this world cometh,</hi> saith Christ,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and findeth nothing in me.</hi> He cometh with his <hi>baits,</hi> but there is nothing in me, that will be <hi>nibling</hi> at them. Besides, his <hi>Deity</hi> was a perfect <hi>Antidote</hi> against all <hi>infection</hi>; As the <hi>beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> he could be in <hi>filthy</hi> places, and amongst <hi>defiling</hi> persons, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>least pollution</hi>; when we have such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful souls, that we are ready to receive the contagion from the least infectious breath; Our corrupt nature is like <hi>fire,</hi> which if there be any infection in the room, draweth it straight to it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. Christ did not <hi>choose</hi> the Company of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> though he was often amongst them. A <hi>Physitian</hi> is not in a <hi>Pest-house</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sinners were the <hi>guest,</hi> Saints onely the <hi>delight</hi> of Christ; wicked men had his <hi>company,</hi> but the Disciples onely were his <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>; He was intimate with none but <hi>beleivers</hi>; others were his <hi>care,</hi> they his <hi>comfort.</hi> It was to them he said, <hi>I have not called you servants, but friends; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of the Father, I have made known unto you,</hi> Joh. 15. 15, 16.</p>

               <p>I Proceed now, to shew wherein the Exercise of Godliness in evil Company consisteth.</p>
               <p>First, if thou wouldst exercise thy self to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in evil society, <hi>Labour to keep thy self unspotted from their sins:</hi> Ungodly men are called <hi>filthy,</hi> and compared to <hi>Swine,</hi> that are apt to <hi>defile</hi> all that have to do with them; They (as the Night) are <hi>dark</hi> and full of <hi>unwholsom vapours</hi>; it concerns thee therefore to be well fenced, that thy spiritual health may not be impared by them. Be careful that they <hi>hurt thee not either inwardly or outwardly.</hi> Thou art in a double danger amongst sinners; thou art in danger of having thy soul wounded, and also of having thy name and estate blasted. There is a necessity therefore of a double guard; of a guard upon thy <hi>soul,</hi> that it may not be wronged, and of a guard upon thy <hi>tongue,</hi> that thy outward comforts may not be ruined. I say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be watchful over thy <hi>soul,</hi> that thou contractest no guilt. Its hard to be <hi>near</hi> those that are dirty and defiled, and yet to keep our Garments <hi>unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>clean.</hi> Wicked men as <hi>Diers</hi> and <hi>Painters,</hi> who use colours, are usually besmeared <hi>themselves</hi> in their hands and habits, and they also besmear <hi>others.</hi> The Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> is called <hi>Asphaltides,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:63388:102"/>
or the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> because of the venemous vapours which arise out of it, insomuch that <hi>Birds</hi> which flye over it, fall down <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>beasts</hi> that drink of it <hi>sicken</hi> and <hi>dye.</hi> Some men have found <hi>evil soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> as poisonous to their souls, as brutes have found the <hi>Dead Sea</hi> to their bodies. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the thirds Concubine, by looking on a <hi>Bear</hi> frequently, was brought abed of a <hi>Monster.</hi> Thy frequent vision of their wicked actions, may cause too great a likeness in thy conversation. But the Saint should resemble the <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> which being cast into the fire, is nowhit defiled or impaired thereby, but therein shines most brightly; If it be closed fast (say some) in a ring of Lead, and cast into the fire, we may see the <hi>Lead molten,</hi> but the <hi>Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> not so much as <hi>mollified,</hi> or in the least <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished</hi>

The Command is, <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and shew my people their trangression, and the house of</hi> Jacob <hi>their sin,</hi> Isa. 58. 1. This belongs in some sense to every <hi>member,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Minister.</hi> They must reprove sin <hi>powerfully; cry aloud, lift up thy voice as a trumpet</hi>; particularly, <hi>shew my people their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and the house of</hi> Jacob <hi>their sin; Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> without serious <hi>Application,</hi> is like an <hi>Arrow</hi> with too many <hi>Feathers,</hi> which though we level at the Mark, is taken by the <hi>Wind,</hi> and carried quite from it.</p>
               <p>Some men shoot their Reprehensions, like <hi>Pellets</hi> through a <hi>Trunk,</hi> with no more strength then will kill a <hi>Sparrow</hi>; those make sinners beleive that sin is no such dreadful evil, and the wrath of God no such frightful end.

That sin is a <hi>work of darkness</hi>; The <hi>Prince of darkness</hi> is its <hi>Father</hi>; Its his natural off-spring, therefore called <hi>the work of the Devil,</hi> Iohn 8. 44. A <hi>dark heart</hi> is its <hi>Mother,</hi> there its conceived, thence its brought forth; In dark holes these <hi>vermine</hi> breed and swarm (<hi>Ephes. 4. 18. Hos. 4. 1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 4. 4.</hi>) Its portion is <hi>utter darkness, blackness of darkness for ever</hi>; all its inheritance lieth in <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the shadow of death.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. I learn that the <hi>works of darkness are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful</hi>; The sinner makes a sad market of all his wicked wares; He soweth <hi>vice,</hi> and reapeth <hi>vanity</hi>; promiseth himself much <hi>pleasure,</hi> and sindeth it wholly <hi>unprofitable; What fruit had ye in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death</hi>; O what a frightful monster is this miscreant; It hath <hi>fruitlesness</hi> in the beginning, <hi>shame</hi> in the middle, and <hi>death</hi> in the conclusion.</item>
                     <item>3. I learn that I onght <hi>not to have fellowship with these unfruitful works of darkness</hi>; Indeed, I have little reason, if I consider the two former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, yet how prone am I to it, either by my <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> when they sin; or by my <hi>secret complyance</hi> with them in their sin!

When others are <hi>bold</hi> to blaspheme God, I am apt through an <hi>ungodly bashfulness</hi> to <hi>hold my peace,</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle considering that I must one day answer as well for my <hi>sinful silence,</hi> as for every <hi>idle word.</hi> Its my duty to <hi>hold the jewel</hi> of my <hi>faith fast,</hi> lest Satan steal it from me; to <hi>hold</hi> my <hi>profession</hi> to the end, lest by leaving my <hi>Colours,</hi> I lose my <hi>Crown</hi>; but not to <hi>hold</hi> my <hi>peace</hi> in the quarrel of truth, lest by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sin in others, I wrong my own soul; Where is my love to <hi>others,</hi> if I stand still whilst they <hi>destroy</hi> themselves? It may well break the strings of my tongue (as of the Son of <hi>Cyrus</hi>) when sin (like the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>) is ready to kill my Father, or Brother, or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; Evil men are like <hi>Traytours,</hi> with whom if we <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>conceal,</hi> we are guilty. Where is my love to my <hi>self,</hi> if I take others <hi>intolerable burthens</hi> on my own <hi>back?</hi> Sin is a <hi>load,</hi> too heavy for the stoutest, for the strongest to carry. Should I by my <hi>silence</hi> give consent to others Oaths, or Lyes, or Ieers at godliness and godly men; I become a party in their bonds, and liable to make satisfaction for their <hi>debts,</hi> and may expect every moment when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice should <hi>Arrest</hi> me for them. O <hi>my soul!</hi> what answer dost thou give to these Arguments? Wouldst thou for all the <hi>World</hi> be one moment under the guilt of the <hi>least</hi> sin! Didst thou never feel its <hi>weight,</hi> and water thy couch with tears by reason of it? Hast thou not sighed out mournfully to God, <hi>There is no rest in my flesh, because of thine anger, nor quiet in my bones, because of my sin?</hi> And wilt thou for fear of <hi>mens</hi> displeasure, incur the infinite <hi>Gods</hi> anger? and to avoid (at most) a raze in thy <hi>flesh,</hi> admit a wide gash in thy <hi>conscience</hi>?

I might have more love to my <hi>self,</hi> and more respect for my <hi>neighbour,</hi> then to suffer sin upon him, through my cowardly <hi>silence,</hi> or to joyn with him by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>complyance,</hi> lest both be involved in the same <hi>vengeance.</hi> Lord, the supplies of thy Spirit is the onely <hi>preservative</hi> against all <hi>infections</hi>; be pleased to afford it to me, that I may <hi>keep my self pure</hi> in the most prophane society, and no way <hi>be partaker of other mens sin.</hi>

            <p>The Communion of Saints is the most desirable and delectable society that the whole creation affordeth.

            <p>God cannot affect contentious spirits; he would not appear in a <hi>blustring wind,</hi> or in an <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quak,</hi> but in a <hi>still low voice</hi>; when the <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> was over, then God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 13. 14.</p>

He giveth them his <hi>precept; A new Commandement give I unto you, that ye love one another</hi>; not but that it was an <hi>old</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but because envy and malice had prevailed so much among the Jews, that to love was a <hi>new</hi> thing. Again, This is my commandment, <hi>that ye love one another,</hi> as if there were nothing else that he required but this, or as if this of all the Commandments was that which Jesus loved best. He sets before them his own <hi>pattern, As I have loved you,</hi> so ought ye to love one another. The love of Christ should prevail with Christians to lay down their <hi>lives</hi> for him, and shall it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to lay down their <hi>strifes</hi> among themselves? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, How affectionately doth he pray to his Father to bestow this blessing upon them? <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. And the glory which thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me,</hi> i. e.

            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Petitioner,</hi> that is <hi>Christ,</hi> who was the <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the Father, <hi>in him dwelt the treasures of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge</hi>: He fully understood what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest would be most advantagious for his people. Besides, he was the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband</hi> of his Church, <hi>naturally</hi> caring for her welfare as his own, and so his <hi>love</hi> would prompt him to desire what his <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> saw most conducing to her happiness.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>repetition</hi> of his petition; He begs the same boon of his Father <hi>four times</hi> in three verses; He had the <hi>Spirit without measure,</hi> and so could not be guilty of vain ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>3. The <hi>particular season</hi> of this petition, for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the <hi>subject</hi> of it. He had in the former part of his prayer confined himself within the <hi>narrow compass</hi> of the Apostles; but in the 20. <hi>v.</hi> having made a perfect transition from them to all believers, <hi>to all that should believe on him through their word</hi>

It is not <hi>That they all may be enriched,</hi> or <hi>honoured</hi> upon earth; nay it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63388:141"/>
is not That they all may be <hi>adopted, sanctified</hi> and <hi>saved</hi>; but, <hi>That they all may be one as we are one</hi>; as if the whole Kingdom of Grace and Glory did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in this, and as if this once obtained, all were done that was needful for them. Besides, he makes this the visible <hi>character</hi> of their Christianity, that <hi>badge</hi> which would publish to all they met their relation to Christ; <hi>By this shall all men know ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another</hi>; this is the <hi>livery</hi> which will speak to what Master ye belong. <hi>By this,</hi> not by casting out <hi>Devils,</hi> but by casting out <hi>Discord</hi>; not by <hi>releiving</hi> one another occasionally, but by <hi>loving</hi> each other fervently, <hi>shall all men know ye are my Disciples.</hi>

            <p>The differences amongst Christians can never be sufficiently lamented; That they who are all <hi>near</hi> to God, should behold one another <hi>afar off</hi>; and they who are all <hi>acquainted</hi> with Christ, should be <hi>unacquainted</hi> among themselves. <hi>Iob</hi> laments this fault in his three friends, <hi>These ten times have ye reproached me; are ye not ashamed that ye have made your selves strange unto me?</hi> Job. 19.3. That they who are <hi>brethren,</hi> begotten of the same <hi>Father,</hi> born of the same <hi>Mother,</hi> fed at the same <hi>Table,</hi> educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the same <hi>Tutor,</hi> attended with the same <hi>Servants,</hi> arrayed with the same <hi>Garments,</hi> and heirs of the same <hi>Inheritance,</hi> should be strange to one another, is a great, a gross shame. Many <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Devils</hi> can agree together in one man, and yet in some parts not ten Christians can agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one house. One of the Fathers was so much affected with the divisions of Christians that he profest himself ready to let out his <hi>heart blood</hi> to cement them together. Both the honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63388:141"/>
and our own interest do both command us to unite. It was no small reflection on Christians that <hi>Mahomets</hi> great champion should have cause to say, <hi>I shall sooner see my fingers all of a length, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians all of a mind.</hi> Tis true, till we have all <hi>one eye,</hi> we shall never in all things be of <hi>one judgement</hi>; but must a small difference in <hi>opinion</hi> cause such a distance in <hi>affection</hi>? Must we make the Devils and enemies of Christ musick by our discords? when the foes of God and our own souls are in sight of us, shall we be fighting to make them sport, and to give them an opportunity to destroy us? The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the world warm themselves by that fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision which the heats of some weak Christians kindle. It is observable that the Spirit of God, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the contention between the herdsmen of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> cattel, and the herdsmen of <hi>Lots</hi> cattel, immediately subjoyns in the same verse, <hi>And the Canaanite and the Perezite dwelt then in the land,</hi> Gen. 13.7. Some think to shew the <hi>occasion</hi> of the difference betwixt them, their cattel increasing so much, and those Nations dwelling among them, they had not sufficient <hi>room</hi> and therefore <hi>wrangled.</hi> Others think that latter clause is inserted, to shew the hainous aggravation of their sin: It had been bad enough to have quarrelled where none but <hi>Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> had been in company and spectators of their strife; but its much worse to fall out in the midst of their <hi>enemies</hi>; hereby they expose their profession to <hi>derision,</hi> and their persons to <hi>destruction. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> observes that <hi>Dion</hi> calmed the boisterous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his mutinous Souldiers, by saying <hi>Your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies yonder</hi> (pointing to the Castle of <hi>Syracusa,</hi>

which he then besieged) <hi>behold your mutinous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi>: And shall neither the eyes of <hi>men</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> nor of <hi>God</hi> himself, which always observes the strifes and contentions amongst his children, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to put a way envying, and variance, and emulation, and wrath, and perswade them to <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</hi>! The foolish <hi>Cranes</hi> by fighting beat down one another, and so are taken: Civil dissentions make Christians a prey.

But one Saint is an <hi>Angel</hi> to another, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading and encouraging one another to <hi>holiness. They take sweet counsel together, and go to the house of God in company.</hi> The Patriarchs removed their Habitations for the benefit of water-springs. Every Saint is in some sense a <hi>Well of living water</hi>; and did men but know their worth, they would delight more to be with them. Sure I am, he that hath such a <hi>good Neighbour,</hi> shall never want a <hi>Good-morrow.</hi> As a <hi>Pomander Ball</hi> cast into a <hi>Censer,</hi> will fill the whole house with its pleasant savour, so a Christian will endeavour to perfume all that come near him. How pleasant then is the favour arising from many Christians in company together!</p>
               <p>The society of the <hi>Prophets</hi> is able to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a <hi>Saul</hi> to prophesie; The <hi>Pleiades,</hi> which are the seven stars, joyned in one <hi>constellation,</hi> (Canst

thou bind the sweet influences of the <hi>Pleiades</hi>? Job 38. 31.) help one another in their work, which is to bring on the <hi>Spring,</hi> the best season of the year; Christians in <hi>consort</hi> are an abridgement of <hi>Heaven,</hi> shining like a <hi>Firmament</hi> of bright Stars, not one <hi>malevolent</hi> aspect among them, and they all conspire together, to further a spring and new shoot of grace, the best of blessings in each others hearts. As Sincerity is the heart of Religion, so society is the breath of Religion, it helps to preserve it alive. The spiritual life of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> did upon their first quickening, appear by this, and twas also very helpful for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and increase, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>No Christians are so <hi>full,</hi> but they stand in need of their <hi>fellows</hi>; He that had as <hi>large a stock of grace as any</hi> since <hi>Christ,</hi> yet could not <hi>live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commerce with others,</hi> Rom. 15. 24. The goodliest house may want a <hi>shoar.</hi> The <hi>Shunamite,</hi> though she told the Prophet she dwelt among her own people, and therefore needed not any to speak for her to the King, was glad to receive that kindness by the hands of the Servant, which she denyed to accept from his Master.</p>
               <p>I shall mention the advantage of good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in five particulars.</p>
               <p>First, By good Company, <hi>sinful souls have been converted.</hi> A <hi>crooked</hi> Bough, joyned to a <hi>strait</hi> one, groweth strait; <hi>Latimer</hi> was <hi>converted</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> by the good Company and Conference of Master <hi>Bilney.</hi> The Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> came to be <hi>in love</hi> with the Bridegroom, by being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his Bride; by being acquainted with the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63388:144"/>
                  <hi>Church,</hi> they became enamoured with <hi>Christ.</hi> At first they wondered at her fondness of him, that she was so impatient till she had found him (<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8, 9.) but they had not been long with her, before the heat of her love had warmed them with the same earnest desire and longings. <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside, that we may seek him with thee!</hi> Cant. 6.1. They that come where <hi>oyntments</hi> and <hi>sweet spices</hi> are stirring, carry away some of the savour. <hi>One live coal</hi> may set a whole <hi>stack</hi> on fire; <hi>Evil Company,</hi> like the River <hi>Melas</hi> in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> makes all the sheep that drink of it <hi>black</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fulk. Meteor.</hi> lib. 4.</note> but <hi>Good Company,</hi> rather like <hi>Clitumnus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> makes them that drink of it <hi>white. Saul,</hi> by being in Company with a <hi>wise</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, was brought to hear of a <hi>Kingdom; He that walketh with wise men, shall be wise,</hi> Prov. 13. 20. This made <hi>Algerius</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Martyr, say, <hi>I had rather be in Prison with</hi> Cato <hi>a wise man, of whom I might learn some good, then in the Senate-house with</hi> Caesar.</p>
               <p>As <hi>one Circle</hi> caused by a <hi>stone</hi> thrown into the water, begets a <hi>second,</hi> and that a <hi>third</hi>; And as <hi>one Rain-bow</hi> begets another, and they two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beget a third; so <hi>one Christian</hi> helps to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get another to Christ, and they two joyning, turn more from the errors of their ways. <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> like an <hi>Elixar,</hi> by contraction, if any dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in the mettal, will render it of the same property. The <hi>Indians</hi> were brought to embrace the Christian faith, by the holy conference and company of <hi>Edesins</hi> and <hi>Frumentius,</hi> two private Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:63388:144"/>Secondly, By good company <hi>pious souls have been confirmed.</hi> Whilst <hi>Latimer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> lived, they kept up <hi>Cranmer</hi> by intercourse of letters. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>conference</hi> is a great help to <hi>perseverance.</hi> The staff of <hi>bonds</hi> was the Jews <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>safety, Zach.</hi> 11.14. Company causeth <hi>courage</hi>; the <hi>beams</hi> of joy are the hotter for <hi>reflection. Ipse aspectus viri boni delectat,</hi> saith the Moralist, <hi>The very countenance of a good man makes us chearful.</hi> Our sight of him is reviving to us. When <hi>Paul</hi> saw the brethren, <hi>he blessed God, and took courage, Act.</hi> 28. 15. When <hi>many Mariners</hi> pull at a rope together, they strive with the more alacrity; therefore Christ sent his Disciples by <hi>two</hi> and <hi>two, Mark</hi> 6.7. When <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> went against the Philistines, he would take his <hi>Armour-bearer</hi> along with him. The blessed Jesus going into the Garden to his bitter, bloody Agony, chose <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to accompany him. The great Apostle expected comfort from the <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mans</hi> company, and hoped to confirm them by his; <hi>For I long to see you, that I might impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established.</hi> The <hi>closer</hi> the <hi>stones</hi> of the Edifice are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>stronger</hi> is the Building; <hi>That I might be comforted together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me.</hi> Grace is the <hi>Oyl of gladness,</hi> and the more of this oyl, the more of gladness; when <hi>Pauls</hi> faith and the <hi>Romans</hi> met in one channel, such a river of <hi>oyl</hi> would be a river of <hi>pleasure</hi>: The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such flames could not but become a good fire, to refresh and rejoyce their hearts: <hi>Iob.</hi> 41.16. As its said of Leviathan, that his scales <hi>are his pride, i.e.</hi> his streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h in which he boasteth; and the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63388:145"/>
reason of it is rendred, <hi>One is so near to another that no air can come betweeu them; They are joyned one to another they stick together, that they cannot be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>: So it may be said of the people of God, Their <hi>unity</hi> will be their <hi>security</hi>; when one is so <hi>near to another that no enemy can come between them, when they are joyned one to another and stick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they cannot be sundred,</hi> then it may be said of them as of him, <hi>In their neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before them,</hi> ver. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By good company <hi>erring Saints have been recovered.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> lay sleeping in his sin till his good friend <hi>Nathan jogged</hi> and <hi>awakened</hi> him. Many a one hath been <hi>roused</hi> out of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual lethargy by private admonition. Hence saith <hi>Solomon, Two are better then one, because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but wo to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up,</hi> Eccles. 4. 9, 10. Men that are troubled with the <hi>Falling-sickness,</hi> are sometimes carried away and die with their distemper, it seising upon them when <hi>none</hi> is with them; but when they fall amongst <hi>company,</hi> by rubbing and chaffing them they often come to themselves again. Every scandalous sin especially is a kind of <hi>Falling-sickness,</hi> very dangerous to the soul; its ill therefore for them that are overtaken with it and have none with them by serious admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to recover them out of it.</p>
               <p>I have read of a <hi>Minister</hi> that in the night had a sudden motion to go visit a certain neighbour, and though he argued with himself the <hi>unseasonableness</hi> of the time, and his <hi>ignorance</hi> of any cause for such an
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63388:145"/>
action; yet the impulse upon him was so strong that he could not withstand it; so going to that friends house late in the night, he found none at home save the Master of the house. <hi>Truly,</hi> (saith the Minister to him) <hi>I am come to your house thus late, but I know not to what end, nor for what purpose. Yea</hi> (saith the man of the house) <hi>but God knoweth; for I have made away, through my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, so many childrens portions, and here is the rope in my pocket, with which I was going to hang my self. But what,</hi> replied the Minister, <hi>if I can tell you of one that made away with more por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet was saved? Who was that</hi>? said the Neighbour. <hi>Adam,</hi> saith the Minister, <hi>who as a publique person, was intrusted with the stock of all his posterity, and prodigally wasted them, yet was saved.</hi> Thus by his serious and seasonable counsel, he stayed the man from his purpose, and was, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, instrumental for much spiritual good to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By good Company, <hi>dull Christians have been quickened.</hi> Two cold things, <hi>steel</hi> and <hi>flint,</hi> smitten together, send forth <hi>fire.</hi> When two lye together they have warmth, but how can one be warm alone? <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 11. When <hi>David</hi> was old, and his natural heat decayed, they got a young damsel to lye neer him, and to put some warmth into him; <hi>Cold</hi> Christians have been <hi>heated,</hi> by being near others that have been <hi>glow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing coals.</hi> When <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothens</hi> came from <hi>Macedonia, Paul</hi> was <hi>pressed in Spirit</hi>; before, he was <hi>warm,</hi> but then in a <hi>light flame,</hi> Act. 18. 5. Some men of weak stomachs, have fed the more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63388:146"/>
for seeing others fall so heartily to their meat. <hi>As Iron sharpeneth Iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend,</hi> Prov. 27. 17. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the words thus, <hi>Rub Iron against Iron, and it giveth an edge unto it; so if a man lye often gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon his friend, by unkind usage, it will shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his countenance to discontent, and make his spirit keen and angry</hi>; and to make good this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, they observe, that the wise man doth not say, <hi>so a friend sharpeneth,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>so a man</hi>; because, by his unworthy carriage, he puts off the nature of a friend, and therefore doth not deserve the name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> But I rather incline to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation; <hi>As Iron sharpeneth Iron</hi>; Rub one <hi>file</hi> against another, and though before they were <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>blunt,</hi> they both become thereby <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>sharp</hi>; So friends that are <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>backward,</hi> and over-run with <hi>rust,</hi> for want of use, by mutual conference and communion, they become <hi>lively, quick,</hi> and <hi>keen,</hi> about spiritual things. Christian society, like rubbing Iron a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iron, takes away that rust which made them so dull and unactive, and sets a spiritual edge upon them. <hi>Vrbanus Regius,</hi> an eminent <hi>Dutch</hi> Divine, meeting with <hi>Luther</hi> about <hi>Goburg,</hi> he spent a whole day in conference with him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In vit.</hi>
                  </note> of which himself writeth, that <hi>he never had a more quickening, comforting day all his life time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, By good Company, <hi>much sin hath been prevented</hi>; Christian society is like the <hi>pulse,</hi> which ariseth from the heart, and hath a double Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of contraction, and dilatation, both for the <hi>expelling of noxious fumes,</hi> through the insensible
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63388:146"/>
pores of the flesh, and for the drawing in of <hi>cool air</hi> to refresh the heart and vital parts. Its useful to <hi>increase grace; Sothern-wood</hi> groweth best in Gardens where its first planted; Grace shoots up most in Gods Vineyard, amongst his Plants; The <hi>out-lying Dear,</hi> that leave the <hi>Herd,</hi> seldom <hi>thrive.</hi> Those parts dye that are severed from the body. Its useful to <hi>prevent vice.</hi> That deformed <hi>Harlot</hi> hath been ashamed to appear in such <hi>honest</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The <hi>Romans</hi> durst not call for their <hi>obscene Plays</hi> in <hi>Catos</hi> presence.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> was like to be slain, <hi>Abishai</hi> came and <hi>rescued</hi> him; good company hath prevented the Christians falling from Christ. <hi>Peter</hi> confest Christ among the <hi>holy Apostles,</hi> though he denyed him among the <hi>ungodly Servants</hi> of the High Priest. <hi>If one prevail against a man, two shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, and a threefold cord is not easily broken,</hi> Eccles. 4. 12. <hi>Two streams</hi> united into <hi>one channel,</hi> may bear up a Vessel of some burthen. <hi>Iunius</hi> being much tempted to <hi>Atheism,</hi> profest himself very much helpt against it, by <hi>discoursing</hi> with a plain <hi>Countryman</hi> near <hi>Florence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Naturally, saith <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> A man hath but <hi>one head</hi> to advise him, <hi>one tongue</hi> to speak for him, <hi>two hands</hi> to work, <hi>two feet</hi> to walk, and <hi>two eyes</hi> to see for him. Now, saith he, had a man that skill and cunning, to make that one head <hi>many,</hi> and that one tongue <hi>many,</hi> and so his eyes, and feet, and hands <hi>many,</hi> he would hardly be circumvented by any carnal policy. Good Company doth this, it makes that one head many, that one tongue many, those two hands,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63388:147"/>
eyes, feet, <hi>many</hi>; for Saints study for others good as well as their own; their <hi>eyes,</hi> their <hi>tongues,</hi> their <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> are always imployed for the benefit of their companions. Now in <hi>many Counsellours there is much safety.</hi> He that hath <hi>many eyes</hi> to watch for him, is likeliest to be kept from falling. No <hi>Vessels</hi> are in such hope of security, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from Pyrates, as those that sail with so strong a <hi>Convoy.</hi> As God hath set <hi>conscience</hi> to watch over the <hi>inner man,</hi> and by reason of that help we avoid much unholiness; so God hath set <hi>Christians</hi> to watch over one anothers <hi>outward man</hi>; and truly, these eyes being over us, may prevent the commission of much evil.</p>
               <p>The society of Saints, is sometimes in Scripture compared to a <hi>Garden</hi>; It hath fruits and drugs in it, of <hi>all sorts,</hi> some for <hi>food,</hi> some for <hi>Physick,</hi> some for <hi>corrosives,</hi> some for <hi>Cordials,</hi> some to <hi>warm</hi> the frozen Saints, some to <hi>cool</hi> the fiery sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, some are profitable for one purpose, some for another; <hi>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; So we being many, are one body in Christ, and we all members one of another,</hi> Rom. 12. 5, 6. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Christians, is a great <hi>Fair,</hi> where <hi>all sorts</hi> of provision, both for <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> is to be had. Hence Satan is so busie and diligent, if it be possible, to prevent Christian Communion, <hi>I was coming once and again, but Satan hindered me,</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 18. And his servants have learned this of their hellish Master. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, and the Heathen Emperours banished Christians into <hi>Islands</hi> where they could not have <hi>access one
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63388:147"/>
to another,</hi> being suspicious that their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion would tend much to their mutual comfort and confirmation. <hi>Bradford</hi> was accused to do more hurt in prison, by his <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Speeches,</hi> then in the Pulpit by his <hi>Preaching.</hi> One Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cometh to another, as <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Romans, with the fulness of the blessings of the Gospel of Christ.</hi> Therefore as <hi>Cato</hi> would often make <hi>division</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Servants, judging their <hi>union</hi> to tend to his disadvantage; so Satan soweth <hi>discord</hi> amongst Christians, knowing their concord would tend to the throwing down his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Surely, of all fellowships, this is the onely <hi>good fellowship</hi>; Next to communion with God, there is no communion like the communion of Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:63388:149"/>Tis true, the combination of wicked men is no true <hi>union</hi>: but rather a <hi>conspiracy</hi> against God, and against their own souls. Satan serving them, by drawing them into this <hi>league,</hi> and making them to be of one hellish heart, infinitely worse then <hi>Scyron</hi> and <hi>Procrustes,</hi> famous Robbers in <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> served the poor Travellers, <hi>why by cutting short the taller, and stretching out the lesser, brought all to an even length with their bed of brass</hi>; Yet such a confederacy may well move us to pity such distracted ones, and doth too much reflect upon us for our dissentions.</p>

How averse are our souls to any thing that is spiritual! How many excuses, pretences, delays will they make! To <hi>sin</hi> man needs no <hi>Tutor</hi>; he can ride <hi>post</hi> to Hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>spur</hi>; but how backward to do that work which he must do or be undone for ever! The <hi>stone</hi> is not more untoward to flye, nor <hi>lead</hi> to swim, then our carnal hearts to exercise any grace, or perform any duty incumbent on us: Our <hi>head-strong passions</hi> hurry us, our <hi>worldly interests</hi> byass us, and our <hi>desperately wicked hearts</hi> draw us from God and Heaven.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63388:150"/>
dull to understand Gods way, and so backward and heavy to walk in it.</p>
               <p>How much are we in the dark about the ways, and Word, and Truths of God! and how apt through mistakes to stumble and fall, calling <hi>evil good,</hi> and <hi>good evill!</hi> and do we not want their company who carry a <hi>light,</hi> a <hi>lanthorn with them?</hi> How often do we flatter our selves that we are <hi>rich</hi> in grace, and in the favour of God, when its <hi>little so,</hi> looking on our selves through the <hi>false specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of self-love? and doth it not behove us to be much in their society who will set before us a true <hi>looking-glass,</hi> wherein we may behold the <hi>native countenance</hi> of our souls without any fraud or fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? We are full of doubts, and want counsel; and <hi>Physitians</hi> that are able themselves, will in their own cases ask advice of others. We are liable to many <hi>sorrows,</hi> and want comfort; and who can give it us better then those who fetch all their cordial waters out of Scripture? We are apt to <hi>slumber</hi> and <hi>nod,</hi> and neglect our spiritual <hi>watch</hi>; the flesh is drowsie, and the cares of the world fume up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our heads, and incline us to sleep; what then will become of us if we have none to jog and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us? It will go but ill with the new man, if whilst he hath so many enemies to hurt him, he hath never a friend to help him; <hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daily, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>I have somewhere read of a King, that having many servants, some <hi>wise,</hi> some <hi>indiscreet,</hi> some <hi>profitable,</hi> some <hi>unprofitable,</hi> was asked why he would keep those foolish unprofitable fellows.

To which he answered, <hi>I need the other, and these need me, and so I will have them all about me.</hi> I am sure weak Christians need the strong; its ill for a tottering house to have no prop; and strong Christians may need the weak; That knife which is best mettal, may sometimes need a dull Whetstone; The smallest <hi>wheel,</hi> nay, <hi>pin</hi> in a Watch is necessary; and so each needing the other, there is great need they should hold together; While there is flesh and spirit combating within us, and the worse so potent and likely to conquer, we shall want all manner of <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> to relieve the better part.</p>

lose not such seasons, as they love their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal souls, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 24, 25. <hi>But</hi> Thomas <hi>one of the twelve, was not there when Iesus came; The other Disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands, the print of the Nails, and put my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the print of the Nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</hi> Had <hi>Thomas</hi> been <hi>present</hi> when the Lord appeared, how strongly might he have withstood Satans assaults against his faith! His senses had been sufficient to have confuted the father of lies, and helpful to have quencht his fiery darts; but by his <hi>absence</hi> how dangerously was he shaken in that fundamental truth!</p>
               <p>Satan hath a wonderful advantage of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom he meets (without any warrant from God) <hi>alone.</hi> If I travail alone between <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> I have the Law for my protection, that if I be robbed, I may recover my loss of the Country; but if at other times, it is at my own peril. If I be alone at the <hi>call of my God,</hi> either when secret duties, or my particular calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and my grand enemy set upon me, I may expect help from him whose work I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; but if when he commandeth me to asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with his people, I needlesly wander from them, and any hurt befal me, I must thank my self, and look for no reparation at his hands. It is observable, that the house of <hi>Iobs</hi> Eldest Son, which was the grave wherein all his children were buried, <hi>stood alone</hi>; otherwise the wind from the Wilderness, could not have smote the four

corners thereof. O tis dangerous to be solitary, when God requires thy company amongst his chosen.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>wo to him that is alone,</hi> such a man shall be sure to have Satan for his companion. He is ever ready to <hi>assault,</hi> when none is neer to <hi>assist. Eve</hi> was tempted with too much suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess when she was <hi>alone,</hi> without her Husband; <hi>Dinah</hi> gadding from her fathers house, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; <hi>Ioseph</hi> was then assaulted, when the whole Family was gone, save the instrument of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault; How soon are <hi>straglers</hi> snapt up, when those that march with the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> are safe! <hi>Pyrates</hi> lye skulking to find a Vessel sailing <hi>alone,</hi> when those that sail in company are a convoy to each other; They who <hi>separate,</hi> are soon <hi>seduced.</hi> The <hi>Cormorant,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Eagle</hi> hath this property, that she will not seise upon the fish in the water, when they are in <hi>sholes,</hi> but when <hi>single</hi> she makes them her prey. Solitude is not more hurtful to the <hi>body</hi> then to the <hi>soul,</hi> and to <hi>nature</hi> then to <hi>grace.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was an exile from the society of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and wandred abroad, he fell into diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and distrust, nay, into hard and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts of God; as if he had forgotten to <hi>be gracious,</hi> as if he himself had <hi>cleansed his heart in vain</hi>; He then said, in his haste, that <hi>all men</hi> (even <hi>Samuel</hi> who had anointed him to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and promised him from God, that he should be King) <hi>were lyars.</hi>

                  <hi>Ferus</hi> on <hi>Matthew</hi> affirmeth, that it was the practice of the Monks, to meet together once in a week, and to acquaint each other with their <hi>temptations,</hi> the <hi>means of resistance,</hi> and <hi>the issue thereof</hi>; I believe, if Christians were more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, in declaring to one another the state of their souls, their experiences in point of loss or gain in spirituals, and sense of Gods favour or anger, &amp;c. it would much tend, not onely to the honour of God, but also to the defeating of our great enemy, and our own mutual advantage. <hi>Satan</hi> hath many <hi>wiles</hi> where-with to wrong and destroy souls; he proceedeth many times in the same method with several Christians; now when one acquainteth another with the snares he laid to catch him, and the way he took to avoid it, hereby the other is fore-warned and fore-armed; fore-warned to expect that such a trap should be laid for him, and fore-armed how to avoid it. An <hi>Almanack, Calculated</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> without any sensible error, may serve the whole <hi>Kingdom.</hi> That which hath been one Saints condition or temptation, may be any Saints; and that way which one hath taken to escape a peril, or improve a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, may be useful and helpful to any of the Saints.</p>

enter into an hard board; by precept upon precept, and line upon line, we may beat truths into the heads of them that are very dull. <hi>Iobs</hi> friend tells him, <hi>Behold thou hast instructed many,</hi> Job 4. 3. In this sense <hi>Iob</hi> was <hi>eyes</hi> to the <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> to the <hi>lame; eyes</hi> to prevent their wandring in a wrong way, and <hi>feet</hi> to prevent their stumbling in the right way. <hi>David</hi> was no Priest yet he would teach others Gods precepts; When he had once tasted Gods <hi>love,</hi> others should taste some honey drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from his <hi>lips; Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee,</hi> Psal. 51.</p>
                     <p>It is a noble Work for Christians that have abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and understanding to take some pains to teach and instruct them that are ignorant.

How can a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant please his Master that doth not know his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? They cannot do <hi>the good</hi> they should, because they know not their duty: They who are almost quite blinde will do but little work. They are more open to temptation both from evil men and the evil one, because of their ignorance. Its as easie to give a <hi>child poison</hi> as <hi>wholesom milk,</hi> because it hath not wisdom to discern the difference: Its not hard to put the <hi>poison</hi> of error into their mouths, who are but <hi>babes</hi> in understanding.

                  <hi>Ionah,</hi> by which all may see how much he bears with his froward children.</p>
               <p>First <hi>Ionah runs</hi> from his business; God sends him to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> he will go to <hi>Tarshish</hi>; here was plain <hi>rebellion</hi> against his <hi>Soveraign.</hi> One would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the jealous God should have given him a <hi>Traytors</hi> wages, and when he was at Sea have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the <hi>Ocean of waters</hi> to have swallowed up his <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>fire and wrath,</hi> his <hi>soul</hi>; but <hi>loe,</hi> he cannot permit his <hi>Ionah</hi> to perish; he will rather <hi>whip</hi> him to his work, then let him <hi>wander</hi> to his <hi>ruine.</hi> But how gentle is the rod? God cannot forget the <hi>love</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> though <hi>Ionah</hi> forget the <hi>duty</hi> of a <hi>childe,</hi> but will rather work a miracle, and make the <hi>devourer</hi> his <hi>Saviour,</hi> then <hi>Ionah</hi> shall miscarry. Tis true, he was tossed with a violent tempest and thrown over-board, but God provided him a shelter before the storm, and prepared a <hi>Whale</hi> to swallow him down, not for his <hi>destruction,</hi> but his <hi>deliverance; And the Lord spake to the fish, and it vomited up</hi> Jonah <hi>upon the dry land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well now, the childe is <hi>brought home,</hi> you will look that he should make some recompence for his former disobedience, by his <hi>faithfulness and diligence</hi> for the future; that the <hi>danger</hi> he had been in, the <hi>death</hi> he had so narrowly escaped, the <hi>miracle</hi> which had been wrought for him, and the <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mercy</hi> he had so lately received, should have melted him wholly into <hi>Gods mould,</hi> and have made him, like <hi>Abraham,</hi> to have come up wholly to <hi>Gods foot.</hi> But alas he addeth sin to sin, and neither mercy nor misery prevail with him to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Indeed he undertakes the journey and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63388:169"/>
he was called to upon a second command, but as unwillingly as the <hi>Bear</hi> goeth to the <hi>stake.</hi> After he had pronounced a <hi>sentence of death</hi> upon the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivites,</hi> and shewed them a <hi>warrant</hi> under the high Gods <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>seal</hi> for their speedy <hi>execution</hi>; how ill doth he take it, that upon their humble petition a <hi>Reprieve</hi> should be granted them? he frets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly against God, and through the <hi>exceeding heat</hi> of his heart his <hi>tongue blisters</hi> with casting Gods mercy in his teeth. He was wrath for that in which he had cause to rejoyce: His love to his brethren might have made him glad of their escape, and his love to his God should have quieted him in all his wise and holy proceedings; <hi>But it displeased</hi> Jonah <hi>exceedingly, and he was very angry, and he prayed unto the Lord: O Lord, was not this my saying in my Country? for I knew that thou art a gracions God, &amp;c. Therefore O Lord take away my life.</hi> He quarrels with Gods providence, and he doth as it were <hi>twit God</hi> with (that which is the glory of all his Attributes and actions, and the best friend the poor children of men have) his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Pity,</hi> desiring rather the destruction of above <hi>sixscore thousand persons,</hi> then that himself, by the blind ignorant world, should be reckoned a <hi>false Prophet.</hi> Behold <hi>impatience</hi> in its largest dimensions! <hi>Ionah</hi> will <hi>dye,</hi> because so many thousands are allowed out of infinite kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>live.</hi> O what a nest of vermine was in the womb of this disobedience! Here is <hi>pride</hi> both in preferring his own will before Gods, and in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness to suffer a little in his repute in the eye of the people: Here was <hi>passion</hi> to the height, and that against God himself: Here was <hi>murmuring</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:63388:170"/>
against sparing mercy, and the Divine pleasure: Here was <hi>unbelief,</hi> as if God could not repair his name, and repay him for the loss of his credit: Here was <hi>uncharitableness</hi> and want of love towards the poor <hi>Ninivites,</hi> whose condition called for the deepest compassion. What <hi>answer</hi> can be judged <hi>tart</hi> enough to such a passionate prayer? What <hi>language</hi> can be too <hi>harsh,</hi> what <hi>carriage</hi> can be too <hi>heavy</hi> towards such a cross-grain'd child? Its abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable for <hi>any man</hi> to contend with his <hi>Maker.</hi> Its bad for <hi>servants</hi> to strive with their <hi>Master</hi>; or <hi>children</hi> to resist their <hi>Father,</hi> though both these are their <hi>fellow-creatures</hi>: But for any to contend with God, whose <hi>dominion</hi> over us is unquestionable, and their <hi>dependance</hi> on him indispensable, between whom and them there is an <hi>infinite distance,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worse: But for <hi>Ionah,</hi> not onely a <hi>man,</hi> but a <hi>new man,</hi> a <hi>child of God,</hi> a <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord, that should have taught others by his precepts and by his pattern, to submit to the severest Divine pleasure, one that had been signalized above others with eminent and distinguishing favours, both for this and the other world, <hi>to flie thus in Gods face,</hi> is worst of all. Surely, no <hi>punishment</hi> can exceed the desert of such <hi>peevishness,</hi> such <hi>passion</hi>: Some dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>thunder</hi> cannot but be expected, as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of such <hi>hot weather.</hi> But <hi>hear O heavens, give ear O earth, and be astonished</hi> at the calm milde voyce of the Great God; <hi>And the Lord said unto Ionah, Ionah, dost thou well to be angry?</hi> Mark what <hi>love</hi> sounds in <hi>this language</hi>?

Some of the Heathen were so sensible of their proness to erre, and to be partial in their own cases, when they had erred, that they both kindly accepted reproofs, and earnestly desired a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover.

and call thee to repentance, then for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee, and set thy sins in order before thine eyes?

This ordinarily must be wrought in thee, either by admonition from <hi>man,</hi> or by some severe rebuke from <hi>God.</hi> Consider serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore, whether it be not easier to take a faithful check from thy <hi>fellow creature,</hi> then to be called to repentance by some dreadful judgement from the <hi>jealous God.</hi> O tis a <hi>fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; for our God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming fire.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. V. How a Christian should exercise himself to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in Solitariness; As also a Good Wish about that Particular.</head>
            <p>THirdly, Thy duty is to exercise thy self to Godliness in <hi>Solitude.</hi> A gracious person is not onely consciencious in <hi>company,</hi> but also when he is <hi>alone</hi>; His whole life is nothing else but a walking with his God. <hi>When I awake I am still with thee,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psa. 139. 18. He no sooner opened the eyes of his body in the morning, but he was lifting up the eyes of his mind to <hi>Heaven</hi>; When he was <hi>alone</hi> in his <hi>bed,</hi> he was in <hi>company</hi> with his <hi>God.</hi> As <hi>God</hi> was still with him, so he was still with <hi>God; Nevertheless I am conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with thee,</hi> Psa. 73. True sanctity is visible in <hi>secresie</hi> to him that is Omniscient. The Saint is many times <hi>most busie</hi> when he hath <hi>nothing to do,</hi> and may say more truly then <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>African, Nunquam minus solus, quam cum solus, I am never less alone, then when alone.</hi> The <hi>pulse</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> beats as well in <hi>solitariness,</hi> as in company, and so doth the pulse of the gracious soul towards his God and Saviour. Its said of <hi>Domitian,</hi> that he did one hour in a day sequester himself from all persons, to no purpose,<note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> for it was to <hi>catch flies,</hi> which was the original of that answer, to one that asked, Whether any body were with the Emperour, <hi>Ne mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:63388:200"/>
withdraweth from the press of the world, it is that he might draw nearer to the Lord. <hi>Isaac</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the <hi>Fields</hi> to meditate of God, Christ go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the <hi>Mountain apart to pray to God. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> to the <hi>Rivers side; Peter</hi> to the <hi>house top</hi>; The Church to the <hi>secret place of the stairs,</hi> and all to enjoy communion with their God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 35. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>and</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>A Saint therefore sequestreth himself from the <hi>noise</hi> and <hi>clamour</hi> of company, and worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that he might have the more free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate converse with his Redeemer. A <hi>forced ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> from Men, to dwell among <hi>Beasts,</hi> hath been bewailed as a great misery; but a <hi>free</hi> retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from creatures, to enjoy more of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>God,</hi> is a great felicity. <hi>Woodrow,</hi> an hearb of an extraordinary pleasant smell, delighteth in dark and shadowy places. So the Christian, who in company refresheth others with the fragrancy of his graces, loveth sometimes to be <hi>obscure</hi> and in <hi>secret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Heathen</hi> were so affected with the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>vexation</hi> of the world, that they wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his stay within doors, and his abode amongst his Books. <hi>Thales</hi> left the affairs of state, that he might have time for <hi>Contemplation. Cato</hi> in his old age, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hdrew from <hi>Rome,</hi> to live as he used to say, out of the crowd of the world; And the <hi>Romans</hi> were so much convinced of his prudence herein, that as they passed by his house to which he retired, they would ordinarily cry out, <hi>Iste solus scit vivere; This man alone know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to live.</hi> Old <hi>Similis</hi> having lived long in the Wars, and afterwards for seven years devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself to <hi>solitariness,</hi> when he died left this Epitaph behind, <hi>Here lieth old</hi> Similis, <hi>yet one that lived but seven years. Hiero</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,</hi> gave over his Kingdom, to live a solitary life. Others out of a deep <hi>melancholly,</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided all society, and delighted onely like the <hi>Shrick Owl</hi> and <hi>Bittern,</hi> in desolate places and Monuments of the dead, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Socrates</hi> in his Ecclesiastical History (<hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18.) speaks of some, so strangely averse to all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with men, that they have immuted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>Cels</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> for sixty and ninety years together, even as long as they lived.</p>
            <p>But Reader, I would not advise thee to such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> retirement, nor to any at all upon such <hi>low, mean</hi> grounds. Those voluntary sequestrations of deluded <hi>Votaries</hi> amongst the <hi>Papists</hi> from humane society, are I dare say, as unacceptable to God, as uncomfortable to themselves. Such solitary persons, bring little comfort to their own souls, little honour to God, and do no good at all to others. By how much as doing God great service, is better then doing him
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63388:201"/>
little; as doing good to many, is better then doing good onely to my self, so much is Company before solitariness. But the most publique Christians have their times for <hi>privacy</hi>; Its no mean misery, to be either <hi>always alone,</hi> or <hi>never alone</hi>; He that is always crowded with Company, can neither enjoy himself, nor his God as he ought.</p>

                  <hi>guard thy heart against vain thoughts</hi>; This is the first work to be done, without which all that I have to commend to thee will be in vain. Its to no purpose to expect that a <hi>glass</hi> should be filled with <hi>costly wine,</hi> when its filled already with <hi>puddle water.</hi> When the house before-hand was taken up by <hi>strangers,</hi> there was not room for Christ himself in the Inne.

               <p>Some persons, though poor, when they are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, delight in the fancies and imaginations of <hi>great preferments,</hi> and <hi>pleasures,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> as if they were real; whereas they are the meer <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's</hi> and <hi>Fictions</hi> of their own brains, and have no existence, but in their thoughts.

               <p>Others please themselves in the thoughts of <hi>sinful sports,</hi> or <hi>cheats,</hi> or <hi>unclean acts,</hi> and sit brooding on such Cockatrice eggs with great delight.

               <p>Others entertain themselves with <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>useless thoughts,</hi> such as tend neither to the informing the mind, nor reforming the heart or life: Like <hi>vagrants,</hi> a man meets with these in every place, but can neither tell whence they come, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go; they have neither a good cause, nor do they produce any good effect. Such thoughts might be in a <hi>Davids</hi> heart, but they were the object of his <hi>hate,</hi> Psa. 119. 103. <hi>I hate vain thoughts</hi>; The best Christians heart here, is like <hi>Solomons</hi> ships, which brought home, not onely <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> but also <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Peacoks</hi>; it hath not onely <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> but also <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi> thoughts; But these latter are there as a <hi>disease,</hi> or <hi>poison</hi> in the body, the object of his <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>abhorrency,</hi> not of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>

Hereby it differeth from occasional meditation, which is sudden and soon vanisheth; this calls at the door, salutes us, and takes its leave; that comes in and stays some time with us. Occasional medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is <hi>transient,</hi> like the dogs of <hi>Nilus, that lap and are gone</hi>; set meditation is <hi>permanent, it</hi> (as the Spouse beg'd of Christ) <hi>lodgeth all night between the breasts.</hi> This duty cannot be done unless the mind be kept close to it; the person that is negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, cannot do this work of the Lord. Things of importance are not to be hudled up in haste. <hi>Loose thoughts,</hi> as <hi>loose garments,</hi> hinder us in our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

                  <item>3. It is about some <hi>sacred subject.</hi> As good meat and drink breed good blood, so good subjects will breed good thoughts. There is abundant matter for our meditation; as the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ, the three-fold state of man, the four last things, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the creature, the sinfulness of sin, and the love and fulness of the blessed Saviour, the Divine Word and Works; out of these we may chuse som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one thing, sometimes another to be the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular subject of our thoughts, <hi>Exo.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Ps.</hi> 1.1. <hi>and</hi> 119.148. <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. To undertake more then <hi>one</hi> at a time, will deprive us of the benefit of all. Too <hi>much</hi> food will rather destroy then encrease the natural heat: A little wood may help that fire to burn, which a great quaintity would smother. Whilst the Dog runs after two Hares, now after one, and presently after the other, he loseth both. Many subjects, as a press or crowd of people do but hinder one another. Those streams are strongest which are most united. Greediness of appetite, and receiving too much food weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth digestion. Simples are most operative, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and compositions are often used to allay their force.
<p>When thou hast fixt upon the <hi>subject, meditate</hi> (if it may be) on its <hi>causes, properties, effects, titles, comparisons, testimonies, contraries,</hi> all will help to

Now I say to thee, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> when he told him of his thoughts and resolution of building a temple; <hi>Do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.2. or as God to <hi>Moses,</hi> concerning the Jews; <hi>They have well spoken all that they have said; O that there were an heart in them to keep my commandments</hi>!

When the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman hath been at Market and filled his Purse, he is in most danger of robbing as he goeth home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The Tempter will be sure to be present with me, whoever be absent; <hi>He walks to and fro in the earth,</hi> and whilst I am in his Circuit, I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his company; Though he be more bold then wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and though I deny his desires, defie his works, and resist him, and sometimes foil him, yet he will

still attend to sollicite me to folly; wherever I go, he will find me out; and whatever I do, I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him at my elbow; he hath a double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of me in solitude, partly in that I have no <hi>visible second</hi> to assist me; he hopes when I am <hi>alone,</hi> tis a good time to set upon me, and that he is strong enough by force to ravish and defile me; Partly, in that <hi>shame</hi> which restrains from sin in <hi>publique,</hi> hath no place, no prevalency in <hi>private.</hi> He will tell me that <hi>secresie</hi> may be a <hi>curtain</hi> to hide my sins from the worlds eye, of which I am so much afraid. As <hi>Josephs</hi> Mistress, he will cry, <hi>Come lie with me, be bold to sin, to take thy pleasure, for here is no man present to know it, or to reveal it to thy disgrace.</hi> And for <hi>God,</hi> he hath <hi>forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see it; How shall God know? can he judge through the dark Cloud? Thick Clouds are a covering to him, that he doth not see, and he walketh in the circuit os Heaven.</hi> But O my soul, thy double danger calleth upon thee to be the more vigilant and diligent in minding thy duty. When thou hast no humane friend to watch over thee, thou art the more concerned to watch over thy self. They that live far from Neighbours, are the more liable to Thieves, and therefore if wise, will make up that want by extraordinary watchfulness, and a greater provision of armour and weapons; If one Devil be too hard a match for many secure Christians, how unable will one single Christian be, to encounter with many, with a Legion of Devils! Shouldst thou be idle in solitude, or suffer thy thoughts to wander, expect more then good Company, and such as

Besides, Consider, Though thy thoughts are mantled from the view of men, yet thy <hi>God knoweth thy thoughts a far off,</hi> long before thou thinkest them, <hi>and will judge the secrets of mens hearts, according to his Gospel</hi>; He that numbereth the stars of Heaven, numbereth all the thoughts of thy heart; <hi>I know the things that come into your mind, O house of</hi> Israel, <hi>every one of them,</hi> Ezek. 11. 5. And he that punisheth men for wicked deeds, doth not let them escape for their evil thoughts; <hi>Hear O earth, behold I will bring upon this people, the fruit of their thoughts,</hi> Ier. 6. 19. Nay, thy God will scourge men both for and by their thoughts; accusing thoughts are stinging vipers; That worm of conscience which will ever ever gnaw the sinners heart, to his unconceiveable misery, is bred in his thoughts; <hi>O therefore wash thy heart from wickedness, let not vain thoughts lodge within thee.</hi> Remember also O my soul, if thy most retired thoughts are legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy God, then thy secret actions are all open and visible to his eye. Never presume upon sin, in hope of secrecy; for though thou mayst cover the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of creatures with a bushel; yet thou canst not the <hi>glorious sun</hi> of righteousness; nothing is hid from his sight; <hi>There is no darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity can hide themselves.</hi> Lord, thou hast told me, <hi>There is nothing hid which shall not be revealed, nor secret which shall not be made known</hi>; I confess my wicked heart is apt to argue impunity from secrecy, and to think I am invisible to thee, because thou art invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the eye of my sense; O affect my heart so

               <p n="7">7.

If I meditate what is good to be done, and do not the good meditated on, I lose my labour, and take much pains to no purpose; Cogitation is the <hi>sowing of the seed</hi>; Action is the <hi>springing of it up</hi>; the former is hidden and under ground, the latter is visible, and many are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it; If the seed should still lye buried in the earth, it is but lost and thrown away, tis the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up that causeth the <hi>Harvest</hi>; Meditation is the <hi>womb</hi> of my actions; action is the <hi>Midwife</hi> of my meditations; An evil and imperfect conception, if it hath the favour of a <hi>birth,</hi> yet the mind is but delivered of a <hi>monster,</hi> and of that which had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter been stifled in the womb, then ever seen the light. A good and perfect conception, if it want strength for its birth, perisheth and comes to nothing; like <hi>Ephraim, It playeth the part of an unwise Son, and stayeth in the place of the breaking forth of Children</hi>; Its pity that such conceptions should prove abortive, or such beautiful children be still-born. Lord, thou hast appointed me to meditate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously on thy statutes, and those excellent subjects contained in them. I confess my heart is unwilling to this needful and gainful work, and apt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in the management of this sacred duty; If thou pleasest not to lay thy charge upon it, and to use thy power over it, it will either wholly omit it, or perform it to no purpose; Why should it not dwell now upon thee by meditation, with whom I hope to dwell for ever! What unspeakable joy might I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in and from thy self, could I but get above this earth and flesh! <hi>O who will bring me into that strong City not made with hands! Who
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:63388:256"/>
will lead me into thy holy hill of Sion by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Wilt not thou O God</hi>? Grant me thy Spirit I beseech thee, that my spirit which lives upon thee may be <hi>united</hi> in thinking of thee, and may live wholly to thee.</p>

            <p>Every day with a godly man is an <hi>holy Sabbath to the Lord</hi>; Godliness is not his holy days, or high days, but <hi>every days</hi> work; and his exercise every part of every day; <hi>I have enclined my heart to keep thy statutes</hi> (not by fits and starts, but) <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unto the end,</hi> Psa. 119. 112. The Flower called <hi>Heliotropium</hi> or <hi>Turn-sol,</hi> turneth its face towards the Sun from morning to night, so doth the true Christian towards the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Command of God is, <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23. 17. And the carriage of holy men is answerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; <hi>The twelve Tribes served God instantly day and night,</hi> Act. 26. 7.

                     <item>1. A <hi>Precept</hi> to secret prayer, <hi>Pray to thy Father in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi>; The Priest was every morning to renew the Fire on the Altar, and to offer Sacrifice; <hi>And they offered burnt-offerings unto the Lord, even burnt-offerings mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening; And they offered the daily burnt-offerings
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63388:272"/>
offerings by number, according to the custome, as the duty of every day required,</hi> Ezra. 3. 3, 4. So also in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Asaph and his Brethren mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred before the Ark continually, as every days work required,</hi> 1 Chron. 16. 33. <hi>Solomon</hi> took after his Father, 2 Chron. 8. 14. And what is the <hi>substance</hi> of those <hi>shadows,</hi> but that Christians who are a <hi>spiritual Priest-hood,</hi> should every day have their solemn <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> addresses to God, and offer up <hi>holy sacrifices, acceptable to God in Iesus Christ. Davids</hi> purpose was to be early at prayer. <hi>O God, my voice shalt thou hear in the morning, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> And his practice was answerable; <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried,</hi> Psa. 5. 3. and 119. 147. He was up before the <hi>day,</hi> and risen and at work before the <hi>Sun</hi>; Nay, he tells God, <hi>In the morning shall my prayer prevent thee</hi>; As if he would be at his prayer before God were <hi>stirring</hi> and <hi>going abroad</hi>; But surely we cannot rise so early but God is awake before us, for <hi>he that keepeth Israel, never slumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nor sleepeth; His eyes are ever waking,</hi> who holdeth sometimes, <hi>our eyes waking</hi>; But <hi>David</hi> meaneth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his prayers should prevent <hi>Gods servants,</hi> his severest or most solacing providences, not <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>; He would send a Messenger with Petitions or Thanksgivings to God, before God should send any Messenger with good or bad tidings to him; he would be too early either for crosses or comforts.</item>
                     <item>2. The <hi>Promise</hi> to secret Prayer; <hi>And thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly</hi>; God heard <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi> on the <hi>House top</hi>; The Sun of Righteousness looks as

               <p>As the <hi>Flowers</hi> open themselves in the <hi>morning,</hi> to take in the sweet influences of the Sun, so should the Christian open his heart in the morning, to receive a blessing from the <hi>Father of lights.

               <p>Gods <hi>mercies</hi> prevent us early, and therefore our <hi>prayers</hi> should prevent him. <hi>His going forth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as the morning, he satisfieth us early with his mercies, that we may rejoyce and be glad all our

How great and how many are the mercies with which our God loadeth us every morning, and are we not sordidly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful if we neglect the acknowledgement of them!

The <hi>Blind,</hi> and <hi>Lame,</hi> and <hi>Deaf,</hi> would tell us that <hi>Limbs</hi> and <hi>Senses</hi> are a great mercy; The <hi>Hungry,</hi> and <hi>Naked,</hi> and <hi>Houseless,</hi> and <hi>Friendless,</hi> would tell us that <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Habitations,</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> are great mercies; Poor <hi>Prisoners,</hi> and such as are vexed with cruel <hi>Wars,</hi> and forced to flie before their enemies, will tell us that <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are great mercies. The <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, could we speak with them, would tell us, the <hi>Patience of God,</hi> the <hi>Gospel of our Salvation,</hi> the <hi>tenders of Grace,</hi> are inestimable mercies, and do not all these, which every morning are (notwithstanding our notorious

abuse, and frequent forfeitures) renewed upon us, deserve our solemn and sincere thanks every morning? The Jews, some tell us, are bound to say over an <hi>hundred Benedictions</hi> every day, and among the rest these two, when they go out in the morning; <hi>Blessed be he that created the greater light,</hi> and when they come in at evening, <hi>Blessed be he that caused darkness; David</hi> was frequent at this duty, <hi>I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be continually in my mouth. Seven times a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Psa. 34. 1. and 119. 164.

               <p>Our many <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>necessities,</hi> command us to be every morning at Heavens Gate for supply; We are needy indigent creatures, and must get our living wholly by begging; all the day long, we want forbearing, preserving, supporting mercy. It must be Divine power, that must enable us to follow our callings, to stir or move about our business, that must defend and protect us in our out-goings and incomings, and prosper and succeed our undertakings; God alone can shield us from spiritual and corporal enemies, that can supply us with inward and outward good things, and surely such blessings are worth asking. They who will have mercies that are not of the growth of their own Country, Earth, must send thither (to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) where they are to be had. Prayer, like the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> good House-wife, <hi>fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our food from far</hi>; As the Merchants Ships, it supplieth us with commodities of all sorts, from
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63388:274"/>
                  <hi>forraign Countries.</hi> No mercies hang on so low a bough, as to be pulled to us, and gathered by our own armes, therefore it behoveth us to beg, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread</hi>; Besides our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and difficulties every day are many, and call us to be early and earnest at this duty. Our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, every company, all earthly affairs are snares, and temptations to us, unless they are sanctified by prayer. Its not safe to drink of those streams wherein so many <hi>poisonous creatures</hi> dip their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous heads, unless this <hi>Vnicorn</hi> hath healed them.</p>
               <p>They who walk abroad without <hi>prayer,</hi> may fear they walk abroad without Gods <hi>Protection; Oratio matutina clavis diei</hi>; Morning prayer is the key of the day, which openeth the treasury of divine bounty, and locketh the soul up in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A Prayerless person goeth all day unarmed, and may expect many wounds from that hellish crew, that lye always in ambush to destroy him; The neglect of this pass, gives Satan a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to take the City; When <hi>Saul</hi> had left off calling at Heavens gate, the next time you hear of him is, knocking at (a Witches, at) the Divels door. Prayer is one of the <hi>great ordinances</hi> that batters down the strong holds of the Devil; hence he sets his wits at work, to divert men from it. It is the Souls armour, and Satans terrour; he that knoweth how to use this <hi>holy spell</hi> aright, need not fear but he shall fright away the Devil himself. The Lord Jesus, when he marcht out against the powers of darkness, and was to fight with them hand to hand, armed himself before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

with prayer, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 21, 22.) not onely for his own <hi>protection,</hi> but also for a pattern to us. Every day we walk in the midst of enemies, which are both mighty and crafty, and will watch all advantages to undo us; and should we go amongst them without <hi>prayer,</hi> we are sure to become their <hi>prey.</hi> Its too late to wish for weapons, when we are engaged in a Battel; <hi>Caesar</hi> cashierd that Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who had his armour to <hi>furbish</hi> and make ready, when he was called to <hi>fight.</hi> The moral of the Fable is good; The <hi>Boar</hi> was seen, <hi>whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Teeth,</hi> when no enemy was near to offend him, and being asked the reason, why he stood sharpening his weapons when none was by to hurt him; he answered, <hi>It will be too late to whet them when I should use them; therefore I whet them before danger, that I may have them ready in danger.</hi>

               <p>Another duty that concernes thee in secret, is to <hi>read some portion of the Word of God.</hi> The Work-man must not go abroad without his <hi>Tools.</hi> The Scripture is the Carpenters <hi>Rule,</hi> by which he must square his building; the Tradesmans <hi>Scales,</hi> in which he must weigh his commodities; The Travellers <hi>Staff,</hi> which helpeth him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: There is no acting <hi>safely,</hi> unless we act <hi>scripturally; Bind it continually upon thy heart, and tie it about thy neck; When thou goest it shall lead thee, when thou sleepest it shall keep thee, when thou wakest it shall talk with thee; For the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a lamp, and the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</hi> Prov. 6. 21, 22, 23.

He that hath a great way to go, or much work to do, and that upon pain of death, and but a little time for it, hath little reason to laze or loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When we have but a little paper, and much to write, we write small and thick.

The shortest moment is too much for the service of sin; He that sinneth but once, sinneth too much by once; If it be that they might honour God, and get grace; and lay hold on eternal life; why do they not set about it, and make it their business?

               <p>The <hi>perils</hi> of the night, call for our <hi>prayers</hi> at night; If there were no fear of visible Thieves and Robbers, yet there is of invisible Devils; We cannot bolt our doors so fast, but they will find the way in. We never lye down to sleep, but those roaring Lyons are waking and waiting by our bed side to devour us. If God were not our guard, we could not sleep a moment in quiet. He that goeth to bed, before he hath gone to God, by humble and hearty supplication, lieth down before his <hi>bed is made,</hi> and may well expect to find it uneasie all night; nay, like a foolish <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> of a <hi>Fort</hi> beleagured with cruel and crafty enemies, he takes his rest, before he hath set his <hi>watch,</hi> and is liable to be called up at midnight, or to be kild in his bed every moment.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. How a Christian may exercise himself to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in visiting the Sick.</head>
            <p>FIfthly, Thy duty is to exercise thy self in <hi>visiting the sick</hi>; The Visitation of the sick, is a work of as great <hi>weight</hi> as any (injoyned us) relating to others, and as much neglected and slighted in its management, as almost any duty commanded. Sickness is so common, and Death so ordinary, that with most their frequency takes away the sense of them, and charity in many sickens and dieth as fast as others bodies. The generality of pretended Christians, like the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Levite,</hi> if they see a man <hi>wounded,</hi> both in his body and soul, though it be to <hi>death,</hi> pass on the <hi>other side of the way,</hi> not caring to meddle with any that are in misery. They tell us they are true <hi>members</hi> of Christ, but like a <hi>bag</hi> of <hi>suppurated blood,</hi> they feel nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have any communion with the body. Many on their dying beds, whose souls are worse and more dangerously sick then their bodies, may speak to their Minister or Neighbour (for the duty belongs to the People as well as the Pastor) almost in the words of <hi>Martha to Christ; Sir, If thou hadst been here, my soul had not dyed</hi>; Some visite the sick, but rather out of a <hi>complement,</hi> then out of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> or to profit themselves more then their Neighbours. The Ingenuous Heathen <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <pb n="555" facs="tcp:63388:301"/>
will tell such; <hi>If a man visit his sick friend, and watch at his Pillow for charity sake, and out of his old affection, we approve it; but if for a Legacy, he is a Vulture, and watcheth onely for the carcass.</hi> The discourse of these is chiefly about <hi>worldly affairs,</hi> and nothing about the great concernments of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Others sometimes go about the work, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it so ill, administring <hi>Cordials,</hi> when there is need of <hi>Corrosives,</hi> sowing Pillows under their sick friends heads, that they may die easily; or if they tell them of their danger, they do it so coldly and carelesly, and by halves, that as he said, there is <hi>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their soul-sickness is curable, but the unsutable medicines they take, make it incurable. It may be said of many a soul, as <hi>Adrians</hi> Counsellers said of him; <hi>Multitudo medicorum, &amp;c. Many Physitians have killed the Emperour</hi>; Ah! How dreadful is it, when unskilful and unfaithful Mountebanks, undertake to tamper and trifle with immortal souls, that are just entring into their eternal estates; <hi>Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they know not what they do. Galen</hi> saith, in respect of bodily Medicines, <hi>In medicina nihil exiguum, There is nothing small in Physick</hi>; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in it is of great consequence; A little mistake may cause death; I may upon greater reason say, <hi>There is nothing little in spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>; A small error in our prescriptions to sick souls, may cause dreadful mischief; Instead of <hi>curing</hi> we may <hi>kill</hi> the patient; <hi>Hazaels wet cloth</hi> was not more deadly to his Masters <hi>body,</hi> then the discourse of most is to their sick neighbours <hi>souls.</hi>
               <pb n="556" facs="tcp:63388:302"/>
Fear of displeasing, and a natural propensity to flatter, prevail with too many to <hi>sooth</hi> their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friends into unquenchable flames. But surely there is more love (as well as more faithfulness) in <hi>frighting</hi> a sick person out of his spiritual Lethargy, then in <hi>fawning</hi> him into the eternal lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with Fire and Brimstone. Some venemous creatures tickle a man till he <hi>laughs,</hi> even when they <hi>sting him to death,</hi> so doth the flattering Minister or Neighbour; he raiseth a sick man, void of grace, to the Pinnacle of joy, and highest hopes of Heaven, and thereby throweth him down into the Culph of irrecoverable sorrows, and leaves him to undeceive himself in hell.</p>

The Ministers of Christ are especially enjoyned this task; but every member of Christ also, when God gives him opportunity, oweth this debt to his Neighbour, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>If any be sick, let him send for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him.</hi> The same word which commandeth the sick man to <hi>send,</hi> commandeth the Elder to

                  <hi>go.</hi> Indeed its a gross fault in many sick persons (and therein they are exceedingly their own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) that they either send not at all for the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> or if they do, not till they have done with the <hi>Physitian</hi>; when their <hi>bodies</hi> are past all hope, then they look after some hope for their <hi>souls.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question it is a duty for the <hi>Elder</hi> sometimes to go <hi>uncalled; Its good manners to be an unbidden guest at a house of mourning.</hi> Our Master <hi>was found of them that asked not for him,</hi> and so should his servants. There are those that can invite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Neighbours Tables, who withdraw themselves from their Chambers. Some are <hi>drunk</hi> so often with their Parishioners whilst they are in health, that they are afraid or ashamed to discourse seriously with them when they are sick. God may speak to many, as to the Shepherds of <hi>Israel; Wo be to the Shepherds of</hi> England <hi>that do feed themselves; should not the Shepherds feed the Flock? ye eat the fat, and ye cloth you with the Wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flock; The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,</hi> Ezek. 34. 3, 4. None are more <hi>cruel</hi> to the <hi>Flock,</hi> then those that are most <hi>covetous</hi> of the <hi>Fleece.</hi>

               <p>This duty also belongs to <hi>private members,</hi> as well as to publique Officers.

Be couragious</hi>; For which faithful counsel he was condemned and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accordingly. Its our duty to assist them that die natural, as well as those that die violent deaths. To visit persons in their affliction, is one <hi>testimony</hi> of the truth of our Religion at this day. <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> are like Father and Child. <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the Fatherless and the Widows in their afflictions,</hi> &amp;c.

Saints right to heaven. Whereof <hi>Luther</hi> gives this reason; because the consciences of the wicked shall justifie Christ as well in the absolution of the godly, as in their own condemnation. Though Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do not give their almes, or visit the sick, <hi>to be seen of men,</hi> yet in doing many offices of love, and acts of charity, they <hi>are seen of men.</hi> So they who can <hi>witness</hi> the truth of Christians mercy, will be forced to acknowledge the equity of Christs sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

Of <hi>doing good</hi>; I think it the more necessary to speak to this Motive, because many are apt to judge all pains with sick persons to be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

Though I would not give the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to any men to defer their turning to God, beleiving him worse then mad, who puts off the weighty business of his soul, because peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God may grant him repentance <hi>hereafter</hi>; yet I must obviate this suggestion of the Divel, which hinders men from doing their duty; God may shew mercy to a soul at last; There is one example in Scripture, that none might despair. <hi>Sickness</hi> is with some men the <hi>tide-time</hi> of devotion. They who scorned godly men, and made a mock of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness

in their health, will prize the Saint, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire his sanctity above all the world, when they lye upon sick beds, and consider what an holy God they are going to appear before. Sickness, as one saith, is, <hi>Officina virtutis, morum disciplina, The shop of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the school of manners</hi>; Therefore King <hi>Alfred</hi> was wont to say, <hi>I ever find my self best, when worst; best in soul, when worst in body; the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my body, is physick to my soul</hi>; Experience daily informeth us that the <hi>Swaggerers</hi> and <hi>Gallants</hi> of the world (whose consciences are not seared with an hot Iron) though they gave themselves up to Drunkenness, and Gluttony, and Gaming, and Whoredom, and all manner of wickedness in their youth and strength, yet when they are weakened much with a disease, and have no hopes of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing longer on earth, begin to wish <hi>that they had spent their time to more purpose, and are sensible of their neglect of God, and Christ, and their Souls, and Eternity</hi>; then many of them will desire the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of those that fear God, and beg their prayers, and hearken to their counsels, and would give all they are worth for a little of their grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Even <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Prophets and People of God in his health, will send a Prince to <hi>Elisha</hi> with a large present, and most submissive expressions (thy Son <hi>Benhadad</hi>) in his sickness, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.9.

earthly things; carnal comforts hinder their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after spiritual; They take up with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as <hi>Esau,</hi> and say, <hi>they have enough</hi>; but sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes them know the emptiness of all sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things. When men are sick, they cannot <hi>rellish</hi> the worlds dainties and delicates; The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, and riches, and pleasures of the earth, are all unsavoury and uncomfortable to them. They now see the vanity of those things which heretofore they so much idolized, how unable they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive their fainting spirits, or to allay their pain, or purchase them the least ease, or procure them the least acceptance in the other world; and hence the <hi>price</hi> of the worlds market <hi>falls abundantly</hi> in their judgements. <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us of a Brother of his, that when he gave him many good instructions, and he being a Souldier, regarded them not, he put his finger to his side, and told his Brother; <hi>One day a Spear shall make way to this heart of thine, for admonition and instruction to enter.</hi>

When the <hi>Wax</hi> is softned, then we clap the Seal upon it, lest it harden again, and be incapable of any impression. When the hand of God hath by sickness made the <hi>heart</hi> of thy wicked friend or brother <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> then do thy utmost to stamp the Image of God upon it; <hi>Paul</hi> would preach whilst <hi>a door was opened,</hi> and there was likelyhood of doing good. Its a great encouragement to work, when the subject upon which we bestow our pains, seems <hi>capable</hi> of what we prosecute, and probable to answer our labour.

The Smith strikes when the <hi>Iron is hot,</hi> he knoweth if he should stay till it is cold, his labour would be in vain; Friend, take the advantage of others bodily sickness, to further their spiritual health, lest they either die in their sins, or harden upon their recovery.

If this mans work be now to do, when his life is ending, how sad is the condition of his precious soul? O that I were wise to consider timely, and to provide seasonably for my latter end.</hi> The sight of a <hi>dead</hi> man, was instrumental to the spiritual life of <hi>Waldus.</hi> The sight of others sickness may well quicken me to the greater industry and diligence after spiritual health. Do I behold my Neighbour, whose Sail formerly sweld with a full gale of worldly enjoyments, now <hi>wind-bound,</hi> chained to his chamber, or fettered to his bed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to rellish his food, or take any comfort in his friends? Do I see him full of <hi>Aches,</hi> and <hi>Pains, Tossings,</hi> and <hi>Tumblings,</hi> crying out in the evening, <hi>Would God it were morning, and in the morning, Would God it were evening, because of the anguish of
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:63388:306"/>
his Spirit</hi>? Do I behold his <hi>cheeks pale,</hi> his <hi>eyes sunk,</hi> his <hi>lips quivering,</hi> his <hi>loyns trembling,</hi> his <hi>heart panting,</hi> and <hi>nature striving</hi> and <hi>strugling</hi> with the disease to keep its ground, and yet at last forced to <hi>quit the field,</hi> and leave the victory to its adversary, how many excellent observations may I draw from such a Text? <hi>What a fool am I, to trust the world, which leaves this man in his greatest want? How mad am I in loving sin, which is the cause of all these crosses and miseries, and which makes death so mortal to poor souls? Of how much worth and value is the blessed Redeemer, who will comfort a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in such a time of need, and carry him through his last conflict with joy and conquest? How careful should I be to get and keep a good conscience, which in such a day of extremity will yeild me true courage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>? The wise man doth not without cause tell us, <hi>It is better to go into the house of mourning</hi> (to the terming or charnel-house) <hi>then to the house of feasting, for that is is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to heart,</hi> Eccles. 7. 2. Men in a <hi>house of feasting,</hi> are apt to be forgetful of their duty to God, themselves, and their Neighbours, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 13, 14. <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 3, 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 11, 12. When the <hi>body</hi> is filled, the <hi>soul</hi> is often neglected. <hi>Iob</hi> was afraid of this in his Sons, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>It may be my Sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts,</hi> i. e. <hi>when they had been feasting at their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house,</hi> God gives <hi>Israel</hi> a special caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 12, 14. Men in an house of mourning, are put in mind both of Gods <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> who draweth away their breath and they perish, <hi>Psa.</hi> 104. 29. and their <hi>own frailty,</hi> how
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:63388:306"/>
soon they are gathered and withered, even in their prime and pride, <hi>Psa.</hi> 39. 5. I am <hi>blind</hi> if I do not see mine own end, in the end of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and <hi>distracted</hi> if I do not provide for my last enemy, which I must necessarily encounter. Thus its a mercy to our selves, to be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; and whilst we visit the sick, we visit our own souls. Who would not do his <hi>Neighbour good,</hi> when he may be confident it will tend to his <hi>own gain</hi>! I have but hopes by my visit, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaging a <hi>sinner</hi>; but I may be <hi>sure,</hi> if I be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful therein, of profiting my <hi>self.</hi>

to mind and further our Neighbours <hi>temporal wealth,</hi> but much more his <hi>spiritual welfare.</hi> Twas true which <hi>Bucers</hi> Physitian told him, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his eagerness to die, <hi>Non sibi sed multorum utilitati se esse natum, That he was not born for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but for the good of many others</hi>; Every Saint is to be as it were a <hi>common stock</hi> for the profit of many.

Its a good step to the cure, to understand fully the <hi>disease,</hi> and the constitution of the Patient; therefore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians <hi>feel the pulse, view the urine, enquire of the sick person,</hi> or his <hi>friends,</hi> concerning his <hi>former course of life, diet,</hi> present <hi>digestion</hi> of his <hi>food,</hi> place of his <hi>trouble</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> &amp;c. that they may proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds, and give sutable and effectual advice. So shouldst thou Reader, in visiting the sick, inform thy self either by conference with some serious Christians of their acquaintance before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, or by some searching prudent questions to the sick, concerning the condition of their souls.
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:63388:308"/>
The <hi>ignorance</hi> of a Physitian, may occasion the death of the Patient. Some practitioners in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, who intend much good, do much hurt, for want of <hi>judgement</hi> to find out the tempers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of the sick. A mistake in <hi>soul-cases,</hi> is of more hazard then in <hi>body-sickness.</hi> If I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to <hi>humble</hi> a person who is already cast down sufficiently, and wants a Cordial, or to <hi>comfort</hi> one who is full of presumption already, and needs a Corrosive, how good soever my meaning may be, my acting is evil, and instead of releiving, I may destroy my Brother. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches did not without cause enjoyn the Minister, or such as were appointed to visit the sick, <hi>to continue with them seven days together,</hi> that in that space they might discover the man, before they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him, either in a way of Admonition, or Counsel, or Consolation. <hi>Iobs</hi> friends when they came to visit him, spake not a word, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or advising him, till they heard him open his mouth and curse the tongue that told the news of his birth. The knowledge of the sick mans spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual condition, is as it were, the <hi>foundation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we must build all our discourse with him, and prayers to God for him; or at least it is the <hi>rule</hi> by which we must build, and therefore its very dangerous to mistake in it. If the <hi>Foundation</hi> be laid ill, the superstructure will never stand well; If the <hi>rule</hi> be crooked, the building cannot be strait. A blind Archer may as soon hit the Mark, as one ignorant of his Neighbours state, advantage his soul.</p>

Its not easie so to write the bill, that the sick may receive, what is prescribed to his greatest content and advantage; For as many perish <hi>errore medici</hi> as <hi>vi morbi,</hi> by the <hi>error of the Physitian,</hi> as by the <hi>power of the disease.</hi> Though I judge it next to impossible, for me to set down exactly and fully, directions answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the difference of sick persons condition, disposition, education, calling, guilt, &amp;c. yet I shall speak to the most ordinary cases, and be careful not to omit the main work, namely, that which concerneth the conversion of graceless and Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less persons, if on a sick bed, <hi>God peradventure will give them repentance.</hi>

of them, whose lives do not speak a positive holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, especially whilst we are endeavouring their good) then in general I would advise thee to speak.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the <hi>depravation of mans nature, and the transgressions of life, with the sad aggravations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> How <hi>holy</hi> man was by creation, how univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally and desperately <hi>vicious</hi> he is by his fall from God, and what horrid unthankfulness he is guilty of in continuing in sin, notwithstanding the grace that is offered to him in the Gospel. Its fit to speak to the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and to the <hi>difference</hi> and <hi>contrariety</hi> of his heart and life to it; to the <hi>sinfulness of sin,</hi> in its offensiveness and opposition, to the nature and word of an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Holy, Glorious, and Gracious Majesty, in its destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveness to the present peace and future perfection of his own precious and immortal soul, and in that the <hi>stain</hi> of it is so deep, and the venome of it so great, that nothing beneath the <hi>blood of God</hi> could wash out its <hi>spots,</hi> or be a sufficient Antidote for its <hi>poison.</hi> Tell him of the <hi>folly</hi> of sinners in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Heaven for Earth, Angelical Delights for brutish Pleasures, the blessed God for a base lust; and of his own <hi>madness</hi> likewise in running on so eagerly upon his own ruine against the counsels of men, the commands, threatnings, and intreaties of God, the convictions of his conscience, the calls and invitations of a loving Redeemer, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Speak to the <hi>merit of sin,</hi> how it being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against an infinite Majesty, deserveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wrath and severity; Tell him that the <hi>Wages
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:63388:310"/>
of Sin is death,</hi> temporal, spiritual, eternal; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the justice, holiness, and jealousie of God, how he will <hi>by no means clear the guilty,</hi> but hath threatned all manner of plagues and judgements on the workers of iniquity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail in the least of accomplishing his word; how he is resolved to make all the Children of Men feel sin to be an evil and bitter thing, either in <hi>broken bones on earth,</hi> or, <hi>broken backs, and endless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in hell.</hi> Let him know his own obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by reason of his many and greivous sins, to the curse of the Law, the wrath of the Lord, and the vengeance of the eternal fire. Tell him that he is by nature a Child of Wrath, an Enemy to God, and an Heir of Hell; that it had been just to have cast him out of the Womb into Hell; that Gods patience in bearing with him thus long, will but increase his condemnation and endless misery, unless he prevent it by sincere conversion.</p>
               <p>This is the first thing requisite in order to the recovery of his soul. Till sin be discovered in its hainous nature, and bloody colours, it will never be lamented, nor the Saviour esteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the duty of the Sinner. The first thing usually, which the Spirit doth in the change of a sinner, is to <hi>convince him of sin,</hi> Joh. 16. 8. And this is also first in the Ministers commission, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. The great neglect of this in Ministers and others, is one reason that so few Sinners are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, the needful work of humiliation is so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously slighted, that poor souls go sleeping and dreaming <hi>all is well,</hi> till they come to be undeceived in Hell.</p>

therefore if it were possible for him to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a <hi>carnal estate,</hi> Heaven would be no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is, no place of joy or pleasure to him.

               <p n="2">2. Of his <hi>state by faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> how the <hi>Son of God</hi> can alone deliver him from the wrath of God; that there is <hi>no name under heaven, by which he can be saved, but the name of Christ</hi>; that all his prayers, and tears, and duties, cannot satisfie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice for the least of his sins, or deserve the least favour on the behalf of his soul; that he must of necessity be united by faith to Christ, and submit to his guidance, and give up himself to his Government, or perish eternally; that though Christ died for him without his will, yet he will not save him against or without his will, but he must be heartily willing to accept Christ as his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Soveraign, as ever he looks for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the evil of sin in the pain it brings on their bodies, makes their affections <hi>combustible,</hi> it will be much the easier to kindle the <hi>fire</hi> of repentance in them; Affliction <hi>boareth</hi> or <hi>openeth</hi> the <hi>ear,</hi> and then its seasonable to <hi>drop</hi> some wholsom counsel into it.

The Eastern people do Plow and sow their grounds, when the former Rain hath <hi>softned</hi> it; and why should not I endeavour to Plow up the fallow ground of my Neighbours heart, and to sow in it the seeds of savoury instructions, when it is made tender by sickness?

O how harsh is it for a child to be jocond, when he is far from home! Weeping is good language for them that sit down by the River of <hi>Babylon; How can I sing the Lords songs in a strange Land</hi>? Again, It is better to go into the house of mourning, as it is most <hi>profitable to my precious soul.</hi> Grace thrives best in a <hi>wet</hi> soyl; <hi>By the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi> The inner man is best when <hi>clad in mourning.</hi> Trees planted by the <hi>water-side,</hi> hang with clusters, and bring forth fruit in due season. The sick bed is a Pulpit, and though there be a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in it, he may teach me rare instructions; If he be wholly silent, his condition Preacheth to me, that <hi>sin</hi> is the <hi>greatest evil,</hi> that the <hi>world</hi> is a <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>impostour,</hi> and that grace is the most desireable created good. His dark chamber, weeping friends, watered couch, aking head, trembling heart, pale lips, quivering loyns, all call aloud to me to consider of, and prepare for such an hour. <hi>Abel, being dead, yet speaketh; My sick, my dead Neighbour speaketh; Prepared be, to follow me.</hi> Some have been raised to life by beholding the dead.

Sinners observe their seasons for the gratifying their Loves, and the satisfying their lusts. The Thief waiteth for the full Purse, till the Market is over, and commodities be sold.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. How a Christian may exercise himself to Godliness, on a Dying Bed.</head>
            <p>SIxthly and Lastly; Thy duty is to exercise thy self to Godliness (if God give thee opportunity) <hi>on a Dying Bed.</hi> The work of a Saint is to glorifie God, not onely in his <hi>life,</hi> but also in his <hi>death.</hi> The <hi>Silk-worm</hi> stretcheth out her self before she spin, and ends her life in her <hi>long wrought clew</hi>; The Christian must stretch out himself on his dying Bed, and end his life in the work of his Lord. Every <hi>Man</hi> by his death, payeth his debt to <hi>nature.</hi> He is <hi>earth</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his <hi>Original creation,</hi> and must be <hi>earth</hi> in regard of his <hi>ultimate resolution; Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return,</hi> Gen. 3. 19. The <hi>Sinner</hi> when he dyeth, payeth his debt to <hi>Sin, Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi>; To <hi>sin,</hi> as he is the <hi>servant of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> and so must receive its <hi>wages,</hi> which is <hi>death</hi>; To <hi>Satan,</hi> as he hath sold himself to work wickedness at his will, and so must have his tempter to be his eternal tormentor; To the <hi>Law,</hi> as he hath violated its precepts and commands, and therefore must undergo its punishment and curse. The Saint when he dieth, payeth his debt to <hi>God,</hi> for he oweth him honour as well by his <hi>death,</hi> as by his <hi>life</hi>; Hence we read, not onely of their <hi>living in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to the Lord,</hi> but also of their <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to the Lord</hi>; (Rom. 14. 8.
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:63388:330"/>
Rev. 14. 13.) Which though some expound in that place of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to the <hi>cause</hi> for which they died; they did not dye out of humour or obstinacy, or any carnal selfish interest, but purely as <hi>Martyrs</hi> at Gods call, and for Gods cause; <hi>They loved not their lives to the death for the testimony of Iesus</hi>; Yet the words may as clearly speak;

                  <item>2. The <hi>manner</hi> of their deaths; They died in the fear of God; they exercised grace as well in sickness as in health, and when dying as when living; their spiritual motions were <hi>quick,</hi> when their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions were <hi>slow.</hi>

               <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of <hi>Lucius Metellus</hi> high Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> that though he lived to a great old age, his <hi>voice</hi> did not fail him, nor his <hi>hand</hi> shake in his sacrificing to the Gods. Its said of <hi>Moses</hi> when he was a hundred and twenty years old and dyed, that his <hi>natural sight did not fail him, neither was his heat abated</hi>; So it may be said of the Christian, that though he die old, his spiritual sight doth not fail him, nor his divine heat abate. As <hi>Caleb,</hi> he is as strong in regard of grace, his inward strength, when he is entering into the promised <hi>Canaan,</hi> as he was when he first went forth as a spie by faith, to search the land <hi>flowing with milk and honey.</hi> The Heathen counted him happy that dyed either in the midst of the <hi>goods of fortune,</hi> (hence they say, if
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:63388:330"/>
               <hi>Priamus</hi> had died a little before the loss of his Town, he had died the greatest Prince in all <hi>Asia,</hi>) or in the exercise of their <hi>moral vertues</hi>; Hence they so highly extol <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> who seemed to dare even death it self, out of resolution and fortitude; Though those seeming vertues were but as <hi>Austin</hi> terms them, <hi>Splendida Flagitia, Famous Vices,</hi> and their confidence arose not from any grounded knowledge of their good estates, but from their blindness and ignorance of their depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wicked, and woful estates. He is the happy man indeed, that <hi>dieth in the faith, that sleepeth in Iesus,</hi> that goeth to his grave in the exercise of grace. The Master of Moral Philosophy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth that Pilot whom a Ship-wrack swalloweth up at the <hi>Stern,</hi> with the <hi>Rudder</hi> in his hand. The most high God commendeth that person whom death seiseth, doing the work for which he was sent into the world. Even the <hi>blind Mole,</hi> if <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> may be credited, opens <hi>his eyes</hi> when he comes to dye; and the <hi>crooked Serpent</hi> stretcheth out her self <hi>straight,</hi> when she is going to fetch her last breath; and shall not the Saint be best at last?</p>
            <p>Reader, Observe how careful the Saints have been to do their last work well, and to go out of the world like some sweet <hi>spices, perfuming</hi> the room in which they fetch their last breath, with holiness, and leaving a <hi>sweet savour</hi> behind them. Jacob <hi>when dying, worshipped, leaning on his staff,</hi> Heb. 11. 21. What a Character doth he give of the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> and what blessings doth he pray for, and prophesie to come on his children, when he

How was his heart enlarged in pantings after the Lord Christ? <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. <hi>and</hi> 49. <hi>per tot.</hi> The <hi>living waters</hi> of his graces ran with the greater strength, when they were empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of glory. <hi>Moses</hi> like the dying <hi>Swan</hi> sings most sweetly, being to go up to Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> to dye there. What excellent doctrines, reproofs, instructions, doth he deliver to the <hi>Israelites</hi>? How pathetically, rhetorically, divinely doth he dictate his last legacies to his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical children? who can read and not be ravished with wonder and delight! <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33. <hi>Ioshua</hi> like the <hi>morning star,</hi> shines brightest at last; He gives his people so strict a charge to serve the Lord, such gracious counsel, when he was <hi>going the way of all the earth,</hi> that it could not but be remembred many days after. Dying <hi>Ioseph</hi> will lay his bones at stake for Gods faithfulness, and that he will visit <hi>Israel</hi> and deliver them out of <hi>Egypt. Sampson</hi> did the Church of God much service, in slaying more of her enemies at his death, then in his life. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Olympia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander</hi> among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> were famous for their care to die <hi>handsomely,</hi> and not to commit at last any ill beseeming action, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their memories should have been rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious; But the Christians care hath always been, to die <hi>holily,</hi> and to do their God most <hi>service</hi> when they are going to that place where they shall do him no more in a proper sense.

            <p>The blessed Prince, and Lord of life, should be our pattern at death. He got his Father most glory, he did his Church most good, by his death, though he was eminently serviceable to both all his life time.

What holy counsel and comfort did he give his Disciples to prepare them for his departure, in his last (and one of his longest) Sermon! <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14, 15, 16. What an heavenly prayer doth he put up to his Father for them, and all his elect! to give them both a taste and a pledge of that intercession which he was going to Heaven to make for them. When he was hanging on the Cross, under such an heavy weight as the sins of the whole World, Grace was not depressed.

This World is as a common Inn, wherein all are lodged, and no difference is made between the good and bad, onely that the worst men have the best usage; but the very moment of mens dissolution makes a plain and vast distinction. Death is <hi>the way of all the earth,</hi> according to <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s Periphrasis of it; but this way hath two turnings; one on the right hand to joy and bliss; another on the left hand to misery and horror; now as when the attendants of two Lords, travail together on the road, their servants cannot easily be distinguished, especially if the Servants of the one, counterfeit the livery of the other; but when they come to the <hi>Bivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the parting way, then its clearly known who belong to the one, and who to the other, for each then followeth his own Master, waits on him to his house, stayeth and abideth there with him; So though whilst men live, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing themselves Christians, and most for a shew at least, putting on the livery of Christ, it is not known who belong to the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> and who to the <hi>Prince of the powers of the Air,</hi> but death will discover it to themselves, and the Elect Angels.</item>

he tells me, I have been faithful in the Ministery, and so have merited Heaven; but blessed be God, who brought those Texts into my mind; Not I, but the grace of God in me; What hast thou that thou hast not received?</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> never met with so much opposition, as when they were to take possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then all the Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> combined together, and came out and fought them.

            <p>Now Reader, What need hast thou to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and holy on a dying Bed, to the utmost of thine ability, and to fetch in all the strength thou canst from Heaven, when thou hast such cruel powerful enemies to encounter with? Its was one of the most quickening prevalent arguments, that <hi>Alexander</hi> used to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> before their third and last fatal Battel with <hi>Darius, That t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Consider, <hi>Its a special season where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou mayst glorifie God.</hi> A Saint by his death may bring God more honour then by all his life. The Actions and Speeches of dying men, make a deep impression on the hearts of those that are about them. The wicked themselves, who have mocked at the purity and strictness of the Saints lives, have admired their patience and chearfulness in their
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:63388:336"/>
deaths. Though they look on the beleivers words in health, as savouring of self and sinister ends, and humour, and so neglect them; yet when they hear a dying Saint commend the love and faithfulness of God, the pleasantness, and excellency of his ways and worship, and to bless the time, and pains, and strength, that ever they spent in his service, they esteem his language and begin to have other thoughts of Holiness and Heaven; for they consider, that surely now the man is entering upon the borders of eternity, he is serious and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Hence the Patriarchs, knowing the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of such words, urge <hi>Ioseph</hi> with <hi>Iacobs</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charge; <hi>Thy Father, when dying, said, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give I pray thee, the iniquity of thy servants,</hi> Gen. 50. 16.

The enemies of Christ, beholding at the death of Christ <hi>how the Rocks were rent, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness covered the face of the earth, how the vail of the Temple was torn in sunder, the graves were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the dead raised,</hi> were forced to cry out, <hi>Doubtless this man was the Son of God:</hi> So when the adversaries of Gods people, see them on their Death-beds, and behold their <hi>patience</hi> in bearing their sickness, their <hi>Faith</hi> in relying on their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, their <hi>charity</hi> in forgiving their enemies, their <hi>zeal</hi> for the honour and interest of their Master, their <hi>constancy</hi> in defending the Gospel they did before profess, they are compelled in their consciences to acknowledge, <hi>Doubtless these are the Servants, the Sons and Daughters of God.</hi>
               <pb n="626" facs="tcp:63388:337"/>
Much more will a holy behaviour on a Dying-bed benefit such as fear God. It convinceth <hi>sinners,</hi> that they, whether they will or no, must have other thoughts of holiness and holy men then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and it confirmeth <hi>Saints</hi> in their gracious practices, and makes them more diligent in their preparation.</p>

It is the unhappiness of <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> and <hi>wicked men,</hi> that when they come to dye, they cannot commend the <hi>work</hi> that they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the <hi>wages</hi> which they have merited, or the <hi>Master</hi> whom they have served; but its the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christians, that they have cause to praise
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:63388:338"/>
the sweetness of that <hi>love</hi> which they have tasted, the equity of those <hi>Laws</hi> which they have obeyed, the grace, and mercy, and bounty, and faithfulness of that <hi>Lord</hi> whom they have prayed to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and worshipped, and the vastness, and richness, and certainty, and eternity of that <hi>reward</hi> which they are going to possess. The men of this earth, when they are dying, do often cry out and complain of the falseness and unfaithfulness of the world, and the flesh, how they have cozened, the cheated, and deceived them; and of their own folly and madness, in toyling, and moiling, and drudging night and day, to please and gratifie that which now in their extremity turns them off. O how should the Children of God extol their Father, and his care of them, and kindness to them, magnifie their Redeemer, and his passion for them, and affection to them, exalt the Word and Ways of the Lord, as those which they have found by experience to be the most comfortable and gainful ways. The last breath of a Saint, should be spent in his Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Oportet Imperatorem stantem mori,</hi> was <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasians</hi> Motto. <hi>Oportet Episcopum, concionantem mori,</hi> was holy <hi>Iewels</hi> Motto. <hi>Oportet Christia num glorificantem Deum mori,</hi> should be every Saints Motto.</p>

If thou hast wronged others, either in name, or goods, or body, seek reconciliation, and make satisfaction, for this is righteous and just; <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ought against thee,</hi> thou hast never more need of reconciling thy self to him, then when thou art approaching the Altar of death, there to offer up the last sacrifice to God in this world. If thy Brother have wronged thee in any sort, remit it, this is charity; to do otherwise, is to give place to the Devil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16, 17. and thou hast least cause to give him ground when his rage is greatest, and his barteries strongest, in thy last conflict with him.

            <p>Many Saints who died violent and cruel deaths, yet gave their very enemies cause to admire their patience; They wearied out their bloody Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors by their meekness and patience. <hi>Bonner</hi> said of the Martyrs in Queen Marys days, <hi>A vengeance on them, I think they love to burn.</hi> When that old Disciple <hi>Policarp</hi> came to the stake at which he was burnt to death, he desired to stand untied, saying, <hi>Let me alone, for he that gave me strength to come to the fire, will give me patience to endure the flame without your tying. Cassianus</hi> with admirable meekness, suffered a cruel Martyrdom from his own Scholars, who at the command of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Tyrant, became his Executioners, some
<pb facs="tcp:63388:349"/>
with their Pen Knives, pricking and lancing his flesh, others casting stones at him, till they had killed him. <hi>Eulaliae</hi> a chast virgin, of a noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Portugal,</hi> being for a time kept close by her Parents, for fear her bold Profession should cause her death; one night getting from them, and appearing before the Tribunal of <hi>Maximnus,</hi> she was for refusing to sacrifice to his Idols, Executed in this manner, first two Hangmen with all their might, rent her joynts in sunder, then her flesh was scratched from her sides, with the Talons of Wild Beasts, and hot burning Torches were set to her sides, which ended her life.</p>
            <p>A Christian should also exercise patience and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Gods will, under his pain; It is the rule of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that that sickness is most dangerous in which the sick man alters his countenance. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly its ill and unbecomming Christianity, when men who in health are mild and meek, in sickness are altered to be peevish and passionate, that their relations and attendants who pity their pain, and pray for their ease, and watch, and work night and day to serve them, are requited with harsh words, and fretful returns. <hi>Cajus Marius,</hi> suffered the veins of his legs to be cut out for the cure of his Gout, and never shrunk for it.

And shall not Christians, who dye in their Beds in peace, with much less pain, be patient! Many who knew not God, did look on death as a favour, and one of the greatest which their Gods could bestow on them. <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Trophonius,</hi>

desired the favour of the Emperor, to have leave to kill himself.</p>
            <p>Especially the thoughts of the happy issue of the most painful sickness and death to a Child of God, may as the wood thrown into the bitter waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> make them sweet unto him. Some chuse to be <hi>cut,</hi> rather then to be daily tortured with the <hi>stone,</hi> though they know that cutting will put them to much pain, because they hope that <hi>cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> will cure them of their distemper. When a Gaoler knocks off a Prisoners Fetters and Bolts, though it puts him to much more pain then the constant wearing them, though every blow goeth to his heart, yet he flincheth not, he complaineth not, because he knoweth his future ease will make amends for his present pain. Christians are here fettered with sin and misery, which constantly grate upon their spirits. Death is the Gaoler to knock of their shackles, and let them into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, what though it put them to much pain, they may bear it with much patience, knowing that it will end in eternal pleasures.</p>
            <p>Though an Hypocrite like a <hi>piece of Brass,</hi> when stricken with the Hammer of Sickness or Death, maketh a sharp and irksome noise, with impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and breaketh in peices, is undone for ever; yet the sincere soul, as a <hi>piece of Gold,</hi> when so smitten, may sound sweetly, and be pliable; True Gold may be stretcht out in length and breadth, in thin and fine leaves, as you please.</p>

A sinner indeed, is every day carrying more Faggots to that pile in which he must burn for ever, and always twisting those cords with which Devils will eternally scourge him, and therefore the guilt of his wicked life, and fear of his dreadful wages, may well represent death to him in a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vizard.

O the howlings, the screeching, the groans, the grief which possesseth this poor soul, when he is attached by Devils, those merciless Officers, and carried by them to the lake that burns with fire and brimstone for ever. The Spirit being now gone, the Body remains a cold lump of Clay, forsaken of its dearest friends, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to its nearest relations, sit for no company but the wormeaten congregation, amongst which it must abide till the last day, when it shall be joyned to the soul, and partake with it in unconceiveable and endless torments.</p>

If thou wouldst not meet with the end of such men, avoid their ways; Lord, I confess my self a great sinner, and thou mightest justly leave me to walk in the counsel of the ungodly, and to go in the paths of the destroyer, that my feet should tend to death, and my steps take hold of hell, yet for thy sons sake, <hi>teach me thy way, and lead me in thy righteousness,</hi> that my soul may <hi>never be gathered with sinners, nor my life with bloody men,</hi> that I may <hi>die the death of the righteous, and my latter end may be like his.</hi>

As I fall now, I lie for ever. My eternal estate dependeth more upon my death then my life. Its possible, (though rare) that a prophane life may be corrected by a penitent death; but a wicked death can never be amended. He that shoots off a piece, if he be not steady just at its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, loseth his Charge, and misseth his Mark; He that dieth ill, dieth ever, he is killed with death. He that goeth awry when he goeth out of the world, shall never come back to recal or amend his steps. If I am a conqueror now, I am a conqueror for ever; if I am foiled now, I am foiled for ever.

In <hi>Heaven</hi> there is solace without the least grain of sorrow; In <hi>Hell</hi> there is mourning without the smallest dram of mirth; but on <hi>Earth</hi> there is no estate without mixture. The Saints have joy in God, but if need be they are in heaviness through manifold tribulations, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 6.</hi> The merry sinners in the midst of their pleasures, have their hearts heavy; Some of the wiser Heathen, were so sensible of humane miseries, that one of them when <hi>Ancient,</hi> told his Scholar, that if it were offered him to be young again, he would not accept if. Saints of all men must expect a large draught of sufferings. The world is their enemy, and raiseth all its forces against them. If I be a Disciple <hi>I</hi> must look to follow my Master in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Cross: O my soul, why shouldst thou hug that

which hates thee, and doat on this world, which is neither a fit match for thee, as being unsutable to thy nature, nor (if she were, can be) faithful to thee, being made up of wavering and inconstancy! Or secondly, Is it <hi>the pain of death</hi> that thou art so frighted at? Surely the <hi>fear</hi> of it is the greatest torment; How many have felt greater pain in divers diseases, as in the <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Strangury,</hi> or <hi>Collick,</hi> then in a dying hour? Some of Gods Children have felt very little pain in the judgement of those that have seen them dying; The <hi>waters</hi> of <hi>Jordan,</hi> though rough to others, have <hi>stood still</hi> when the <hi>Ark</hi> was to pass over. But though I were sure my pain should be <hi>sharp,</hi> yet I am as sure it shall be <hi>short.</hi> In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinckling of an eye, I shall be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported over the gulp of misery, into endless glory. My pangs will be almost as soon gone as come; Sorrow will endure but for a short night, joy will come in the morning; If I were assured of a great purchase made for me in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Turky,</hi> which upon my first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over I should enjoy, would I not adventure a passage through the boistrous Ocean, to take possession? My Saviour hath made a larger, a better purchase for me in Heaven. He is gone before to prepare a place for me; My passage thither, though it may be more painful, is less perillous; Its impossible for me to miscarry in it. O why am I so slothful to go in and possess the good Land! Surely, the pleasures of the end, may well sweeten the ways to it, were they never so bitter. With what chearfulness do some women undergo their sharp throws, and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, supported with this cordial, that a child shall thereby be born to them? O how infinitely inferiour
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:63388:366"/>
is the joy of a man child brought forth into this world, to the joy of a sanctified soul, brought out of this world into Heaven!</p>
               <p>Again, I have a tender Father, who knoweth my frame, and will lay no more upon me, living or dying, then he will enable me to bear. He hath said it, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee</hi>; O my soul, thou hast little reason to dread a contest with this enemy for this cause. Thou mayst contentedly undergo a little pain, to go to thy dearest Lord, when many a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath suffered greater to satisfie his hellish lust.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Is it thy <hi>future condition</hi> that makes thee unwilling to dye? Dost thou not know that death is thy portal, through which thou shalt pass into the true Paradise? Its the straight gate through which thou shalt enter into life; Though its the wicked mans <hi>shipwrack</hi> which swalloweth him up in an Ocean of wrath and torment, yet its the Saints <hi>putting into harbour,</hi> where he is received with the greatest acclamation, and richest welcom imaginable.</p>

sickness the fore-runner of death, is come to bring thee tidings that the Winter of thy misery, and cold, and hardships is past, and the Summer of thine eternal light, and joy, and pleasure, is at hand?

O that I could so live, that I might not only be always <hi>ready,</hi> but also when God calls me, <hi>desirous</hi> to dye. If I borrow any thing of my Neighbour, I pay it back with thanks. My life is Gods, he lends it me for a time. Why should I not when he calls for it, restore it with thanks, that he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to lend it me so long?

The knowledge of an approaching evil, is no small good, if improved.

               </gap>ving by Faith: Setting God always before our eyes.</head>
            <p>I Come now to the second thing promised; namely, to lay down the <hi>Means,</hi> whereby Christians may come to make Religion their business.</p>
            <p>First, If thou wouldst exercise thy self to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, be sure <hi>that thou layest a good foundation in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart and nature.</hi> I begin with this, because it is the chiefest requisite, and the ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is of all. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness must first <hi>spring</hi> up in the <hi>heart,</hi> before it can <hi>overflow</hi> in the <hi>life.</hi> Other means are like those parts of the body, the want of which may be supplied by others; but this is like the heart, which if wanting, nothing can make up its want. A <hi>dead man</hi> will as soon arise and walk, as an unsanctified person make Religion his business. Every thing will act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>principle</hi> which is predominant in it: Though for a time it may by violence work contrary
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:63388:372"/>
to its natural inclination, yet it will endeavour the removal of that force, and return to its old course. <hi>Fire</hi> moveth <hi>upwards,</hi> and earth <hi>downwards,</hi> both str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ving to overturn what standeth in their way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the place of fire is <hi>above,</hi> of earth <hi>beneath.</hi> A river may be stopped and hindred in its current, but it will never cease till it hath overborn the dam, and attained its former passage. <hi>Water</hi> that is naturally sweet, may be made brackish by the over-flowing of salt water; but it will not leave till it hath workt out that saltness, and returneth to his natural sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so every man whether good or bad, will act according to his nature, whether gracious or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A good man may be hindred in his holy course by temptations, and the violence of the flesh; but because his nature is gracious he will never be at rest till he hath forcibly broke through those impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and got into his former way of Godliness. An <hi>evil man</hi> may step into the path of piety through the example of others, or good education, or some slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der convictions of a natural conscience, but he will quickly be weary, he will not hold out in it; he will break through those obstacles, because his nature, the stream of his heart, runs another way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> of man is like the <hi>Spring</hi> of the Clock, which causeth the wheels to move right or wrong, well or ill; Hence it is that Gods precept is to this, <hi>Make you a new heart and a new spirit</hi>; and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of this, <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, and they shall never depart away from me.</hi> The fear of God in the heart will bind thee fast to <hi>God</hi> in thy life. If the heart be throughly drawn to him, the tongue
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:63388:372"/>
and hand will not depart from him. If the heart once set forward for God, all the members will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after; the <hi>mouth</hi> will praise, the <hi>ears</hi> will attend to him, the <hi>eye</hi> will watch him, the <hi>seet</hi> will go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; all the parts, like dutiful handmaids, in their places will wait on their Mistris. There was a great Master among the Jews, which bid his Schollars to consider and tell him, <hi>What was the best thing, or the best way, in which a man should always keep:</hi> One said, <hi>A good Companion</hi> was the best thing in the world; another said, <hi>A good Neighbour</hi> was the best thing he could wish; A third said, <hi>A wise man, or one that could for esee future things</hi>; A fourth said, <hi>A good eye,</hi> that is, a liberal disposition; At last came one <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and he said, <hi>A good heart is better then them all. True,</hi> said the Master, <hi>thou hast compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in two words all that the rest have said; For a good heart will make a man both contented, and a good companion, and a good neighbour, and help him to foresee things that are to come, that he may know what is on his part to be done.</hi> Indeed without this there can be no godliness; all professions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are but a shew, a shadow; and where there is this, there is all godliness in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. As the King of <hi>France</hi> said of <hi>Dover,</hi> that it was the <hi>key of England</hi>; and if his son, who then invaded the Britains, had not that, he had nothing; So it may be said of the heart, <hi>It is the key of the whole man</hi>; it opens and shuts the door to Godliness and Wickedness; and if grace hath not this, it hath nothing. The Philosopher when he would perswade the King to settle his residence in the midst of his Dominions, and thereby keep all his people the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:63388:373"/>
in subjection, took a <hi>Bulls hide</hi> ready tanned, upon which when he stood on any side of it, still it rose up on the other; but when he stood on the <hi>middle,</hi> he kept down all alike. The onely way to subdue sin, is to do it in the <hi>heart</hi>; that commands all; otherwise though one unruly passion may be kept down, another will rise up.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> is the great <hi>Work-house</hi> where all sin is wrought, before its exposed to open view; Its the <hi>Mint where evil thoughts are coyned,</hi> before they are currant in our <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions; Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> Matth. 15.19. that is the <hi>nest</hi> in which those <hi>Hornets</hi> breed. The <hi>heart</hi> is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of <hi>sinful words,</hi> as well as sinful thoughts; <hi>Out of the heart proceed false witness, blasphemies,</hi> Matth. 15.19. They were in the <hi>heart</hi> before ever they were in the <hi>tongue.</hi> Its faid of the <hi>Weasel</hi> that it conceives at the <hi>ear,</hi> and brings forth at the <hi>mouth:</hi> Every sinner conceiveth at the <hi>heart,</hi> what he brings forth at the <hi>mouth.</hi> Such stinking <hi>breath</hi> comes from rotten <hi>inwards.</hi> The heart is the <hi>

                  </gap>sel</hi> of poisonous liquor, the tongue is but the <hi>tap</hi> to broach it; <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.</hi> The heart is the <hi>Forge</hi> also, where all our <hi>evil works</hi> as well as words are hammered out; <hi>Out of the heart proceed murthers, and thefts, and adulteries, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions,</hi> Matth. 15.19. You will say that murthers and thefts are <hi>hand-sins,</hi> and that adulteries and fornication belong to the <hi>eye,</hi> and outward parts of the body; but alas, the <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>womb</hi> wherein they are conceived and bred; the <hi>outward parts</hi> are but the <hi>Midwives</hi> to deliver the mother of those monsters, and to bring them into the world; <hi>An
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:63388:373"/>
evil man, out of the evil treasure in his heart, bringeth forth evil things:</hi> There is no sin but is drest in the <hi>withdrawing room</hi> of the heart, before it appear on the <hi>stage</hi> of the life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apollidorus</hi> dreamed one night that the <hi>Scythians</hi> had taken him and flea'd off his skin,<note place="margin">Plut. Moral.</note> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to boil him, and as he was lifting into the Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, his heart said unto him, <hi>Its I that have brought thee to all this.</hi> There is a real truth in this, that the <hi>heart</hi> brings men both to all their <hi>sins,</hi> and all their <hi>sufferings.</hi> As the <hi>Chaos</hi> had the seed of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and wanted nothing but the motion of the good Spirit to produce them; so the <hi>heart</hi> hath the <hi>seed</hi> of all evil, and wanteth nothing but the motion of the evil spirit, and a fit opportunity to bring it forth.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to go about an holy life, till the <hi>heart</hi> be made holy. The <hi>Pulse</hi> of the <hi>hand</hi> beats well or ill, according to the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate of the heart,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vital parts. Our <hi>earthly members</hi> can never be mortified, unless the <hi>body of sin</hi> and death be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. The foul <hi>bird</hi> of sin must be killed in the <hi>nest,</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> or it can never be thrown on the <hi>dunghil,</hi> die in the <hi>life.</hi> Therefore the Holy Ghost calls on men to take away the cause, if they would have the effect to cease. <hi>O Ierusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness. Cleanse your hearts ye sinners, and purifie your hands ye double-minded</hi>; first the heart cleansed, then the hands, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.7,8. If the <hi>chinks</hi> of the ship are unstopt, twill be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to labour at the <hi>Pump.</hi> It is not <hi>rubbing</hi> or <hi>scratching</hi> will cure the <hi>itch,</hi> but the blood, whose corruption is the cause of it, must be purified. When
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:63388:374"/>
the <hi>water</hi> is foul at the <hi>bottom,</hi> no wonder that <hi>scum</hi> and <hi>filth</hi> appear at the top. There is no way to stop the issue of sin, but by drying up the matter that feeds it.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moses</hi> cast the tree into the bitter waters, and sweetned the <hi>Springs</hi>; And as <hi>Elijah</hi> cast salt into the fountain, and thereby healed the waters; so the salt of grace must be cast into the <hi>Spring,</hi> the <hi>fountain of the heart,</hi> or the streams of the life will never be <hi>sweet.</hi> Till trees are grafted, and their nature altered, all the fruit they bring forth is wilde and harsh, and little worth: Till the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is grafted into Christ, and a new and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature be infused into him, all his fruit is unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and unacceptable to God, vain and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himself. Such a one is like a <hi>Cypress</hi> tree, fair to look on, but barren. Like a <hi>Painter,</hi> he may make a great stir about the <hi>colours</hi> and <hi>shadows</hi> of things, the form of Godliness, and shew all his wit, and art, and skill in expressing the outside, but wholly neglecteth the <hi>substance,</hi> and contemneth the inward parts, the power thereof.</p>
            <p>There be several things which may help to make the life fair in the eyes of men; but nothing will make it amiable in the eyes of God, unless the heart be changed and renewed. Indeed all the <hi>medicines</hi> which can be applied, without the sanctifying work of the Spirit, though they may <hi>cover,</hi> they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>cure</hi> the corruption and diseases of the soul. The best man without this is like a <hi>Serpent</hi> painted as it were <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>poysonous within.</hi> As the herb <hi>Biscort,</hi> he may have smooth and plain leaves, but a <hi>croked root.</hi> Or as a Pill, be guilded on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:63388:374"/>
when the whole mass and body of it is bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; It is one thing to be angry with sin upon a <hi>sudden discontent,</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> may be with his <hi>Wife,</hi> whom he loves dearly; and another thing to <hi>hate</hi> sin, as that which we abhor to behold, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to destroy. A filthy heart, like a foul body, may seem for a while to be in good plight; but when the <hi>heats</hi> and <hi>colds</hi> of temptations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, twill bewray it self. Some Insects lye in a deep sleep all the Winter, stir not, make no noise, that one would think them dead; but when the weather alters, and the Sun shines, they revive and shew themselves; So though lusts may seem dead in an unregenerate man, they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid asleep, and when opportunity is, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive. <hi>Shame</hi> may <hi>hide sin,</hi> but it will not <hi>heal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Fear</hi> may do somewhat to <hi>curb</hi> a vitiated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it cannot <hi>cure</hi> it; The <hi>Bear</hi> dares hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch his desired <hi>honey,</hi> for fear of the <hi>sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Bees</hi>; The <hi>Dog</hi> forbears the meat on the <hi>Table,</hi> not because he doth not love it, but because he is afraid of the <hi>Cudgel</hi>; Many leave some sin, in their outward actions, as <hi>Iacob</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> for <hi>fear</hi> they should starve if they kept it, who are as fond of it, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of his Child. This inward love of sin, is indeed its life, and that which is most dangerous
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:63388:375"/>
and deadly to the soul. As an <hi>imposthume</hi> is most perillous for being <hi>inward</hi>; and private <hi>Rocks</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, split more vessels then those that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above water; so sin raigning onely in the heart, is oftentimes more hurtful then when it rageth in the life; Such civil persons go to Hell without much disturbance, being asleep in sin, yet not snoring, to the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quieting of others; they are so far from being jogged or awaked, that they are many times praised and commended.</p>
            <p>Example, Custom, and Education, may also help a man to make a fair <hi>shew</hi> in the flesh, but not to walk after the spirit; They may <hi>Prune</hi> and <hi>Lop</hi> sin, but never stubb it up by the <hi>roots.</hi> All that these can do, is to make a man like a <hi>grave,</hi> green and flourishing on the surface and superficies, when within there is nothing but noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somness and corruption. It hath often appeared that those means which the great Moralists have used to bridle their lusts and passions, have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like strong sents to <hi>Epileptick</hi> bodies, <hi>raised</hi> them, then <hi>recovered</hi> them. Indeed if the cheif fault were not in the <hi>vital parts,</hi> then outward applications might be effectual; but when the heart and lungs, and inwards are all corrupted, <hi>Plaisters</hi> applied to the <hi>face,</hi> or <hi>hands,</hi> or <hi>thighs,</hi> or <hi>sides,</hi> will do little good. When the fault is in the <hi>foundation</hi> of an house, it cannot be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Plaistering</hi> or <hi>rough-cast.</hi> A <hi>Leopard</hi> may be flea'd, but he is spotted still, because the spots are not onely in the skin, but in the <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>bones,</hi> and <hi>sinews,</hi> and most inward parts. When the disease is <hi>accidental,</hi> as to lose the sight by the
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:63388:375"/>
               <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> or the like, there the Physick of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality may be advantagious; but where the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease is <hi>natural,</hi> as in the man that was born blind, there Physick will do no good; a <hi>miracle</hi> alone must restore such a one to his sight.</p>
            <p>Unsanctified persons at best, act from themselves, and therefore for themselves. As the <hi>Kite,</hi> they may spread their wings, and soar aloft, as if they touched Heaven, when at the highest, their eyes are upon their prey upon earth. <hi>Lucullus</hi> told his guests, when he had feasted them liberally, and they had admired his bounty in their costly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; <hi>Something my Friends is for your sakes, but the greatest part is for</hi> Lucullus <hi>his own sake.</hi> An unconverted person may do something, some small matter for the sake of Religion, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of illumination, &amp;c. but the most that he doth is for his own sake, for that credit or profit which he expecteth thereby. If any thing be enjoyned which thwarteth his interest, he will reply with <hi>Ajax,</hi> when commanded to spare <hi>Vlysses, In other things I will obey the Gods, but not in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, Make sure of this inward change; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, though thy conversation may be speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it can never be gracious, nor thy profession durable. If the house be built on <hi>loose earth,</hi> it will never stand long. When the principles are variable and uncertain, so will the practices be. If the arguments upon which thou takest upon thee the livery of Christ, and the grounds of thy engagement in his service, be not firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the love of God, and hope of eternal
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:63388:376"/>
life, &amp;c. such as the world and flesh cannot over-top, thou wilt throw up thy profession, and leave thy Master, when thou art offered in thy blind judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a better service, though it be but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of sin for a season, with eternal pains at the end of them, for thy soul, and Saviour, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal salvation. How well may he prove a <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> who is worse then naught when he first sets up? I wonder not that many pofessors disown the Lord Jesus, when they were ignorant <hi>why</hi> they at any time owned him. He that takes up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on <hi>trust,</hi> will lay it down when it brings him into trouble. As the <hi>Celendine</hi> springeth and floweth at the comming of the Summer birds, but withereth at their departure; And the Corn that promiseth a good Harvest in the Blade, is blasted in the Ear, because its root is withered and naught; So the person that hath no sound foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though he seem to look high, will never hold out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turnsel</hi> makes a shew for a time, with white velvet leaves, and yellow flowers, but fadeth away without bringing forth any fruit; Christ tells us, some which heard the word, though for a season they rejoyced in it, when tribulation came because of the word, were offended at it, because they had no root.</p>
            <p>To prevent that sad Apostacy which many are guilty of to their eternal undoing, Friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider serionsly beforehand, what it will cost thee to be a <hi>Christian indeed.</hi> A foolish builder, that undertakes to raise a structure as high as Heaven, and pondereth not the charge thereof, gives over
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:63388:376"/>
before he hath half finished it, and so loseth all his expence and labour. As in marriage one that is wise, and considereth the person, his portion, and his precepts, with the cares and burdens that are incident to that condition, for such <hi>must have trouble in the flesh,</hi> and after this, upon mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, accepteth him for an Husband, will stick and cleave to him loyally and faithfully, whatever befalls him; whereas a foolish Maid that hudleth up a match in haste, hand over head, promising her self nothing but delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when she comes to suffer poverty or impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, or disgrace with her Husband, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of her bargain, and forsakes <hi>the guide of her youth</hi>; So the Christian that hath duly pondered the excellencies in Christ; his misery without Christ, absolute necessity of Christ; what love, and joy, and peace, and endless bliss, God offereth with his Son; what Christ expecteth from all that will be married to him, even the denyal of themselves, the taking up of their Cross, the contempt of Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Estate, Life, and all for him, and after he hath duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all this, gives himself up to Christ, will be faithful unto death, and own the Lord Jesus Christ, whatever it may cost him, when the man that followeth Christ for the loaves, or for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or on a sudden strikes a league with him, expecting nothing but comforts and joy in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, will quickly leave him, if called to suffer with him. He that followeth Christ, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not <hi>why,</hi> will forsake him, he knoweth not <hi>how.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="706" facs="tcp:63388:377"/>If thou art, Reader, to begin this work of entering thy self into Christs Army, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise thee to bethink thy self upon what grounds thou engagest in his quarrel; For Christians are not called to their spiritual war for love of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Cocks that fall to it upon sight of each other. Consider, the <hi>enemies</hi> thou art to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, how potent, and crafty, and cruel they are, continually seeking thy destruction; the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> thou art to fight under, how <hi>wise</hi> he is to direct and command thee, how <hi>able</hi> to protect and defend thee; how <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>bountiful,</hi> to crown and reward thee; the excellency of the <hi>cause</hi>; it is for thy soul, thy God, thy Saviour, thy salvation; the dangers thou must encounter, and hardships thou willt be called to endure; the certainty of thy <hi>conquest</hi>; how impossible it is to miscarry in so just a quarrel, under such<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Captain, and then list thy self to fight the good fight of faith, and fear not but thou shalt be more then a conqueror, through him that loves thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou wouldst exercise thy self to godliness, <hi>Live by Faith.</hi> The life of Faith, its the onely life of holiness; and unbelief is the mother of all Apostacy. When God would perswade <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to sincere and singular godliness, he doth it by offering him sure footing for his faith, <hi>I am God Alsufficient, or the Almighty God; Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. knowing that unless his faith were firm, his steps could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be even; If he had not beleived Gods <hi>power,</hi>

            <p>Faith is one of the best <hi>Antidotes</hi> against the <hi>poison</hi> of <hi>prophaness,</hi> and one of the greatest helpes to holiness; None are more faithful to God, then they who have most faith in God.

Is the pains of a violent death, which will quickly be over, and the most the World can do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, comparable to the pains of eternal death?</hi> And thus Faith by the terror of this great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, drowns the noise of those small peices, that the soul is deaf to their report.</p>

If the world cannot terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Saint with its fiery Furnace, to disown and deny his Saviour, it will seek to inchant him with its Musick, and thereby to make him deaf to the Call and Commands of Christ. Thus it served <hi>Ioseph</hi>; When it could not prevail on the <hi>left hand,</hi> by selling him for a <hi>slave,</hi> it tryeth him on the <hi>right hand,</hi> by setting a <hi>Dalilah</hi> to tickle him with pleasure; but by Faith he saw the Hook under the Bait, and durst not nibble at it, much less swallow it. Though the world like <hi>Iezabel,</hi> painteth her face, and tireth her hair, to render her amiable and lovely, and as a Srumpet, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her naked Breasts of pleasure and profit, to entice the beleiver to go a Whoring after her; yet he vieweth by Faith the deformity of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

The beleiver can glory more in his refusal of glory for Christ, then unbeleivers in all their preferments. Indeed, if the Christian did consult with sense, or carnal reason, he would take the worlds present money, but the beleiver doth not consult with flesh and blood, like wise <hi>Abigal,</hi> knowing how much it will conduce to his advantage, he can part with his esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besides, Faith discovers pure Rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, more noble and excellent delights, to be the portion of those that refuse to grate their teeth with such kennel water. As man is a rational creature, he would sell his wares to them that will give <hi>most.</hi> Now Faith sheweth how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God out-bids the world. Sense saith, The world offereth fair, it offereth comforts, sutable to thy flesh, such as they desire, and it offereth ready money, present possession: But saith Faith, <hi>God offereth thee better</hi>; The comforts he offereth are more excellent, being sutable, not as the Worlds, to a carnal brutish nature, but to an heavenly divine soul, and more durable, being eternal, when the pleasures <hi>of sin</hi> are but for a season. He that hopes for no better market, will take the present money offered him; But he that is assured of

greater gains, will refuse the lesser. An unbelei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver who expects no better bargain then what this life affords him, may well take up with present pay, what ever it be; but the Beleiver who seeth the glory to be revealed, and fulness of joy in Heaven, and is assured that if he be faithful unto death, he shall receive that eternal crown of life, turns his eyes off the honours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this beggarly world.

Heaven are little in his eye; but Faith soars aloft, it carrieth the Christian up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and then the whole earth is but a small spot in his eye. <hi>Ioseph</hi> bids the <hi>Patriarchs, Regard not your stuff, for the good of all the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>is yours:</hi> So saith Faith to the Christian, <hi>Regard not the lumber and rubbish of this world, for all the great and good things of the other world are thine.</hi> Faith gives the soul a taste, the first fruits of Heaven; And as <hi>no man, having drunk old wine, desireth new,</hi> for he saith, <hi>the old is better</hi>; So no man, having tasted the wine of Heavens pleasures, desires carnal delights. A Pilgrim travelling to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (saith one) came to a City where he saw a goodly Training and Mustering, there he had a mind to stay, but that he remembred that was not <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He came to another City, where he saw gallant sports and pastimes, there he had some good will to abide, but that he remembred it was not <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He came to a third, where were goodly buildings, Fair Ladies, curious Musick, &amp;c. where also he had some thoughts of setling, but still he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred <hi>it was not Ierusalem:</hi> So the beleiver, when the world offereth him great treasures, high honours, &amp;c. may through the subtlety of his flesh, have a mind to embrace them, onely seeing by Faith <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where are greater treasures, higher honours, he slights and rejects them; <hi>By faith</hi> Moses <hi>refused to be called the son of</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>daughter; esteeming the reproaches of Christ, greater riches then the treasures of</hi> Egypt; <hi>for he had an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi>

The <hi>Crocodile</hi> cannot endure the sight or smell of <hi>saffron,</hi> therefore in <hi>Egypt</hi> they sow <hi>saffron</hi> to keep him away. Faith is this <hi>saffron,</hi> Cant. 4. 14. which drives away the Devil.

This is the onely <hi>holy water,</hi> that will fright away the Devil. Our blessed Saviour in his speech to <hi>Peter,</hi> acquaints us how to subdue Satan; <hi>Peter, Peter, Satan hath desired to winnow thee as Wheat is winnowed, but I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Which words imply, that whilst <hi>Peters</hi> Faith stood firm, he should not forsake Christ; whilst that was <hi>up,</hi> he could not be <hi>down</hi>; His <hi>Faith flagged</hi> before his courage failed, or he himself fell so fouly. A <hi>Tree</hi> is soon felled when the <hi>Root</hi> is once loosened; Faith roots the soul in Christ, and therein his safety consists; but as his Faith fails, so he is loosened from Christ, and thereby in danger of falling. The Christians strength lieth in his Faith, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> in his Hair; if the uncircumcised one can deprive us of this, he may make sport enough with us.

            <p n="3">3. Faith enableth to conquer the flesh. The great Apostle who lived by <hi>Faith,</hi> brought under his <hi>body,</hi> and crucified the <hi>flesh. Faith</hi> seeth the safety of the body to consist in its subordination to the soul, and that the onely way to save the life, is at Gods call to lose it; <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>left his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Country, and obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. Indeed, the flesh is the worst enemy of the three, partly in that it is so <hi>near</hi> us, always about us, so that we can as well flye from our selves as from it. A Traytour in the <hi>Bed chamber,</hi> is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then one in open armes against us in the Field. A Snake in the <hi>bosome,</hi> is like to do more hurt then one under the grass; partly in that it <hi>knoweth our minds exactly,</hi> and so can temper its poison sutable to our Pallats; but Faith can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its secret conspiracies, and prevent their execution. Though it dig its mines never so closely, and covertly, and craftily, Faith will find them out and countermine them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith enableth (as to dye to sin, so) <hi>to live to God.</hi> The life of holiness doth so much depend on Faith, that its said to consist wholly in it. <hi>The just shall live by his Faith.</hi> Though he cannot live
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:63388:385"/>
by <hi>sense,</hi> that upon which he lives being invisible; nor by <hi>reason,</hi> because his food is supernatural; yet he can live by faith, and make a good living of it too. As the body lives by the soul, so Religion lives by <hi>Faith.</hi> A mortal wound in faith, lets out the heart blood of all holiness. Tis faith that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates and animates the new creature. Faith puts him upon high designs, and holy enterprises for God and his own soul. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I beleive, therefore have I spoken</hi>; It may be said of a Christian, <hi>He beleiveth, therefore he speaks so much of God, for God, and to God. He beleiveth the unquestionable certainty, incomparable excellency, and eternity of that reward which is set before him, and therefore he prayeth, and watcheth, and readeth, and heareth, and denyeth himself, and worketh night and day that he may attain it. Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving the report of <hi>Columbus,</hi> concerning the richness of the <hi>Indian</hi> Mines, and the likelyhood of his possessing them, was at great cost and charge in sending out men in Ships, and made them ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their lives, and labour hard to get those Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Silver veins. Faith beleiveth the report which the Gospel makes of the glory to be revealed, and the unsearchable riches in Christ, and the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, nay, certainty of his enjoying them, if he will but strive and labour, and use those means which God hath appointed, and this puts the soul upon its greatest industry and integrity, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what the word requireth, in order thereunto, and a resolution to obtain them, what ever it cost, or to dye in the undertaking.</p>

The extension of the branches, ariseth from the intension of the sap; and how shall that be conveyed but by the bark? Christ, like <hi>Ioseph,</hi> keeps the granaries, wherein is abundance of soul-food, and faith unlocks those Store-houses, and takes out supplies. As <hi>Pharoah</hi> when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> cryed to him for bread, said, <hi>Go ye to</hi> Joseph, <hi>and what he saith to you do</hi>: So God saith to Christians that call on him for Grace, <hi>Go ye to Christ by Faith, and he will relieve you.

of our selves in all things, and at all times, that we may please God always.</hi> He that watcheth hath his <hi>eyes in his head,</hi> according to the wise mans phrase, and seeth (as the <hi>Chineses</hi> say of themselves) with both eyes. <hi>David</hi> expresseth it fitly, <hi>I said I will take heed to my ways,</hi> Psa. 39.1. i. e. <hi>I will ponder my paths, and consider where I set my feet, lest I should tread awry.</hi> Without this wariness there is no safe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secure <hi>Laish</hi> is made a prey to their enemies; and the secure soul is made a prey to his spiritual adversaries, <hi>Iudges</hi> 19.9,10. Soul-Lethargies are most dangerous, most deadly. Those that slept in the sweating sickness generally died. He who watcheth not is led about (like one in his natural sleep) by any temptation, he knoweth not how nor whether. When the <hi>Wolves</hi> in the Fable once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the <hi>Sheep</hi> to part with the <hi>Dogs,</hi> they soon devoured them.

Its said most truly, in respect of a Natural life, <hi>In him</hi> (meaning God) <hi>we live, and move, and have our beings, Act.</hi> 17. 28. <hi>We live</hi>; Now as God hath made the <hi>heart</hi> the spring of natural life, and hath drawn from thence a multitude of <hi>arteries,</hi> to carry the vital spirits through the whole body, and disperse life through every part of it. So he hath made the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> the spring of spiritual life, and his <hi>Ordinances</hi> the <hi>Arteries,</hi> to convey life to every part of the soul. <hi>In whom we move</hi>; As God hath from the <hi>head</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

So the Lord, from Jesus Christ the <hi>Churches head,</hi> through the sinews of <hi>sacred duties,</hi> conveyeth spiritual sense and motion to all his members. And <hi>have our being</hi>; To preserve our being, he hath made the <hi>Liver</hi> a fountain of blood, and from thence drawn the <hi>Veins</hi> to convey it over the body, to the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole; <hi>Ordinances</hi> are those <hi>Veins</hi> which convey and disperse gracious spirits over the whole new man; <hi>With him is the well of life,</hi> Psa. 36.</p>
            <p>Sacred duties are as needful every day for our souls, as food and raiment for our bodies. The body must continually be repaired with nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because it is continually consumed by our natural heat; <hi>Yesterdays bread</hi> will not keep the laborer to day in strength and vigor to go through with his work; he must have new diet, or he cannot hold out.

When <hi>Ionathan</hi> through fasting became faint, <hi>He tasted a little honey and his eyes were enlightened; How much more, said he, if happily the people had eaten liberally of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 29, 30.

There is a sensible decay of the strength in Husbandmen (whose work is great) upon one days abstinence.

            <p>Much fasting takes away the stomach; and omission of Closet duties at one time, makes a man more backward to them, and dead about them another time. When a Scholar hath plaid the Truant one day, its difficult to bring him to School the next day; Fear and Shame both keep him back, when he comes thither he is the more untoward about his book.

            <p>The Apostle speaking of that day, puts the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Where shall the sinner and ungodly appear</hi>? 1 Pet. 4. 18. <hi>Now</hi> indeed, those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Reader, At this day think much of that day of judgement, hereby thou wilt be stirred up to judge thy self, to repent of sin, to ensure an interest in Christ the Judge, to keep a good conscience, and so to think, speak, and act, as one that must be judged by the Law of liberty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>and</hi> 17. 31. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.

            <p>Eighthly, If thou wouldst exercise thy self to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; <hi>Call thy self often to account.</hi> This is a special help to holiness; <hi>I considered my ways, and turned my feet to thy testimonies,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psa. 119.5. A man that goeth out of his way, will continue wandering, if his mind be occupied about other things, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not what he is doing, and whither he is going. The Christian that is careless of his carriage, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom compareth his heart and life with the divine commands, to observe how they agree or disagree, will never <hi>order his conversation aright</hi>; When a <hi>clock</hi> is out of order, we take it <hi>to peices,</hi> and search where the fault lyeth, knowing that one wheel amiss may hinder the going of the whole Clock. Our hearts are every day out of order, our work must be to take them to peices by Examination, and to see where the great fault is. <hi>Seneca's</hi> sober young man, <hi>Ita laborat, ita ludit, ita caenat, ita potat, ita lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, ita vivit, ut qui ephemerides Patri est approbatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

that is daily to be accountable for all to his Father.</hi> He that would keep his spiritual estate, must keep his <hi>Account-books</hi> well; The neglect of this, hath been the breaking of many Tradesmen. When Shop-keepers live high, far above their incomes, and for want of searching into their Books, are ignorant whether their gains will allow such large expences, it is no wonder if they prove worse then naught. They who expect the coming of great and severe strangers, who will observe narrowly how their house lyeth, and how their vessels are kept, and publish it either to their credit, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, according as they find; will keep their houses in order, sweep them clean, have their pewter bright and clear, and all things exactly in their places. When the Christian looks every night for the coming of Gods Deputy, his <hi>conscience,</hi> to spy and search into his heart and life; how clean and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both have been kept all the day, it will be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means to make him watchful over his ways, and exact in his carriage and conversation. <hi>Bee-Masters</hi> tell us, that they are the best <hi>hives</hi> which make the <hi>greatest noise</hi>; So that conscience is the best, which makes the greatest noise in daily reasonings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates before its own bar.</p>
            <p>Examination is the quickest way to bring the <hi>erring sheep home</hi> to the fold. Honest men will examine their <hi>weights</hi> and <hi>measures</hi> by the standard, that if they be defective they may be mended. The honest heart will examine its thoughts, its words, its actions by the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> that their unsutableness to its strictness and latitude may be repented of, and to the utmost of its power reformed, <hi>Let us search and try our ways</hi>;
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:63388:415"/>
For what cause? What will be the issue of such a scrutiny? <hi>And turn again to the Lord, Lam.</hi> 3.39. What man will seek to a <hi>Physitian,</hi> or accept his advice, or take his prescriptions, who doth not know himself distempered, and feel his disease? Tis examination of our hearts and lives, by the holy and pure Law of God, that gives thee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our spiritual sickness, and helpeth us to feel it, to prize our Physitian, and thankfully and heartily to accept his directions for our cure.</p>
            <p>Its observed of the <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> that they keep their <hi>banks</hi> (notwithstanding the threats of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Ocean) with little cost and labour, because they look narrowly to them, and stop them up in time; If there be but; a small breach, they stop it presently, and hereby save much charge and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Frequent examination will do this courtesie for the Christian, it will maintain his peace with little charge and trouble comparatively; As soon as any breach is made by sin, that Arch-make-bate, between God and the soul, it will help the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to run presently to Christ to heal and make it up in Heaven by his merits; and in the soul, by his purifying and pacifying spirit.</p>
            <p>The counsel which the <hi>Philosopher</hi> gave the young men at <hi>Athens,</hi> may sutably and profitably be applied to Christians; <hi>That they should often view themselves in a glass, that if they were fair and well featured, they should do such things as were beseeming their amiable shape; but if soul and ill-favoured, that then they should labour to salve the bodies blemishes, by the beauties of a mind, accoutred with the ornaments of vertue and good literature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="783" facs="tcp:63388:415"/>Examination is a special preservative against sin; No Children are more bold to defile themselves, and to play with dirt, or rake in kennels, then those who know their Parents are so foolishly fond (like <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Adonijah</hi>) that they never displease them at any time, in saying, <hi>Why hast thou done so?</hi> The Child that expecteth to be reckoned with at night, will be careful how he dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth his cloaths in the day.</p>
            <p>Examination will help the Christian, if not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a coming disease, yet to <hi>prevent</hi> its growing and increase.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ship</hi> that leaketh, is more easily emptied at the beginning then afterwards; The <hi>Bird</hi> is easily killed in the <hi>Egge,</hi> but when once hatcht and fledged, we may kill it when we can catch it. A frequent reckoning with our selves, will pluck sin up before it is rooted in the soul.</p>
            <p>Examination will help the Christian that hath fallen and bruised himself, to heal the wound whilst it is fresh, before it is festered; This one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if there were no more, is extraordinary. As the <hi>sting</hi> of a <hi>Bee,</hi> though the <hi>Bee</hi> be fled, works it self into the flesh deeper, and diffuseth its venome more strongly, causing the greater pain, that every man, unless foolish, will speedily pull it out, lest he encrease his own anguish; Truly so doth sin, though the honey, the pleasure of it be gone, yet the sting remains, and the longer it is before it is pulled out by Faith and Repentance, the deeper it works it self into the soul, and the more sorrow it will put us to in this or the other world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="784" facs="tcp:63388:416"/>Tis examination at night, that brings the soul to mourn for, and repent of its failings in the day; Tis like the tree which <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When sin is admitted into the soul, and as a Theif in the night stole in at unawares, when the eye of the souls watchfulness was fallen asleep; Examination will light the Candle of the word, and search the house narrowly, and find out this ill guest, and before it hath done so much mischief as it intended, apprehended it, indict, condemn, and execute it.</p>
            <p>Examination every day, is like purging the body at the beginning of a distemper, which takes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath habituated it self, and so is much the more easily repelled. An enemy may much sooner be forced out of his holds, when he hath newly taken possession, then when he hath continued so long as to cast up his banks, make his ditches, placed his Guns, and fortified them. After we have been foiled by our spiritual enemies, and by examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on find out the cause, it will make us more watchful at that gate at which they enter'd, and careful of that particular wherein they got the advantage of us. As when <hi>David</hi> had received intelligence, that the <hi>Amonites</hi> had given his Army some small defeat, he sends <hi>Ioab</hi> word of the reason, <hi>they went too near the City,</hi> and wisheth him to <hi>make the battel more strong against the place,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. So examination
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:63388:416"/>
finds out the reason of a Christians defeat by Satan, either it was through self-confidence, or want of spiritual watchfulness, or love to some known sin, and helpeth the Saint to bewail the cause of his defeat, and directe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Frequent examination keepeth the conscience <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> that the least touch of sin will be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and troublesom to it. When the heart is used to yeild at a <hi>small Willow,</hi> it will never be quiet under a great Oak. Searching into our souls, makes sin more loathsom to us. Whilst these filthy sinks are unstir'd, they do but little disturb us, or annoy us with their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy savour, but when by examination we rake into them, their noysom stench offendeth us extremely, and shews us what need we have of cleansing.</p>
            <p>Examination every night, will help the Christian to a <hi>good nights rest</hi>; How comfortably may he lye down, who hath made all even with his Maker, and heard his everlasting Father bidding him <hi>Good-night?</hi> How quietly may he sleep, who hath his pardon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Pillow! he needs not fear any Officer to call him up at midnight, and attach him for any treasons or misdemeanours.</p>

the Chronicles of other Countries or Kingdoms, some ages past, and yet not know the passages of their own souls one day past!</p>
            <p>Reader, If thou wouldst walk closely with God, and keep even with him, reckon daily with him; Call thy self to a strict scrutiny, <hi>What do I? how live I? where am I? is the work I do, warrantable by the word or no? is my life the life of Faith, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, or no? am I in Gods way, under his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or no? Have I truth of grace, the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, or do I please my self with the form of it? Do I thrive and increase in grace, or do I decay and decline? Suppose I were to dye this night, what ground have I to hope for Heaven? what assurance that I shall escape the power and rage of frightful Devils? What evidences have I, that I am a new creature, engrafted into Christ, and thereby entitled to life and bliss?</hi> Thus feel the pulse of thy soul, enquire into its state, visit it often, and see how it doth.</p>
            <p>Call thy self to an <hi>account for thy sins</hi>; Let <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life sins, open</hi> and <hi>private sins, omissions, commissions, personal, relative,</hi> be all reckoned for. Ask thy soul as <hi>Rebecah, Why am I thus? Why am I so false to my God? so unfaithful to my Covenants?</hi> The heart is like a <hi>Ditch,</hi> into which filth is continually running, and therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee by examination, to be always emptying it. The <hi>Stable</hi> that is daily fowled, must be daily cleansed; The <hi>hands</hi> that are daily contracting dirt, must be daily washed. Our souls are more polluted and diseased then our bodies; we have always a filthy issue of sin running, which we must be daily searching into, and dressing, or our stench will make
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:63388:417"/>
us loathsom to, and unfit for any communion with God or his people.</p>
            <p>Call thy self to an account daily <hi>for thy mercies</hi>; Ask thy self, <hi>How much am I indebted to my God? what privative, what positive mercies do I partake of? what old, what new, what night, what day mercies, what mercies at home, what abroad, what personal, what domestical, what national mercies do I enjoy? or am a sharer in? what bodily, what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercies do I receive? what time, what talents, have I to trade with, and reckon for?</hi> This will help the soul to be speedy and hearty in thankfulness, and force it to <hi>Davids</hi> Interrogation, <hi>What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> What hot love should I return, what an holy life should I lead? Do this daily; It is much better to pay sums when they are <hi>little,</hi> then when they are <hi>large.</hi> Wise men that are able, find it the best way to <hi>pay ready money for their wares.</hi> Neglect herein, causeth many mistakes and inconveniencies, and many times differences amongst friends.</p>
            <p>Having spoken to this particular in the sixth Chapter, I shall say no more to it here, though indeed I judge it next to a new nature, not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any means of godliness.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If thou wouldst exercise thy self to godliness, <hi>Avoid the occasions of sin</hi>; he that would avoid the <hi>commission</hi> of sin, must avoid the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of sin. If we would not fall down the Hill, we must beware of coming <hi>near the brow of it. Keep thee far from an evil matter</hi>; Children which in frost venture upon the Ice, may possibly be safe, but
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:63388:418"/>
yet many times they break their <hi>limbs,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lose their <hi>lives.</hi> Its possible for a Saint to come off safe from occasions of sin, but is very seldom seen. A <hi>fair booty</hi> makes many a man a <hi>Theif,</hi> who otherwise might have lived honest. It was counted therefore a great part of wisdom in <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he had taken the beautiful daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Darius</hi> Prisoners, not to <hi>see the</hi> fair Ladies, lest their beauty should have enticed him to folly; The same word in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> signifieth both <hi>an eye</hi> and a <hi>fountain,</hi> to shew that from the eye, as from a fountain, sin doth too often flow; <hi>Iobs</hi> practice was such, that he would not <hi>look</hi> on a <hi>Maid,</hi> lest he should lust after her; And <hi>Davids</hi> prayer was, <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> We take the <hi>wind</hi> of those that are infected with contagious diseases. The wise man gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table counsel to men, if they would avoid drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness; <hi>Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it casteth its colour in the glass,</hi> Prov. 23. 31. When it laughs in thy face, then shut thine eyes, lest it steal into thy heart; We are ready to think, what hurt, what danger is there in beholding, the wine in the glass, sparkling and brisky? But <hi>Solomon</hi> knew that from <hi>looking</hi> on it, men come to like it, from liking to <hi>tasting,</hi> from tasting to a <hi>draught,</hi> from one draught to <hi>another,</hi> till the man is metamorphised into a <hi>beast. Gen.</hi> 39. 10, <hi>Psa.</hi> 119. 37. The wise <hi>Socrates</hi> could advise men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of those <hi>meats</hi> which would entice men without hunger to eat, and those <hi>drinks</hi> which would entice a man without thirst to drink, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if men come within those traps and baits,
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:63388:418"/>
they are easily taken. A guest may easily be kept out of the house at first, but if once entertained, its hard to turn him out of doors. When a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Fort once comes to <hi>parley</hi> with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that besiegeth him, there is great fear that the place will be surrendred. I have read of one that having a great mind to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet knowing it to be a corrupt place, and a corrupter of others, entered the City with his <hi>eyes close shut,</hi> neither would he be perswaded to see any thing there but <hi>Peters</hi> Church, which he went to visit. <hi>Solomon</hi> perswades his Son, if he should not be enticed by the Harlot, that he would not come near her house, <hi>Remove thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her house,</hi> Prov. 5. 8.</p>
            <p>He that carrieth always along with him, an heart ready to break out into a flame, prone to all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, had need to take heed of those <hi>Bellows</hi> that will help to blow up the fire. <hi>I more fear,</hi> saith <hi>Luther, that which is within me, then that which is from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> When a distempered stomach comes to meet with tossing waves, sickness ensueth, though the prime cause is not from the <hi>Billows</hi> without, but <hi>Choler</hi> within. <hi>Occasion</hi> and the heart, are like <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> and <hi>Sechem,</hi> if they meet, they usually part not till folly is committed. Those that desire to hinder the generation of Vice, that brat of Hell, must keep the <hi>Male,</hi> occasion, and the <hi>Female,</hi> a wicked heart asunder, one from the other. They who have bodies always ready to take infection, must be more careful of their diet and company then others; Insensible Vapours bring forth horrible Tempests; <hi>Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.</hi>
               <pb n="790" facs="tcp:63388:419"/>
The best heart is like a <hi>flint</hi>; there is fire in it, though it doth not appear; occasion is the <hi>steel</hi> that fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it forth, which being let alone would be quiet. <hi>Bees</hi> in winter being sensible of their weakness, keep their hives, and will not expose themselves to the sharp air and bitter frosts, lest thereby they sicken and dye. Alas, how weak is man! how unable to resist the occasions of sin! no more then the Hound can forbear pursuing the Hare before his eyes, and therefore it concerns him to avoid them. A <hi>candle</hi> newly extinguished will quickly be lighted again. Powder meeting with a light match, presently takes fire.</p>
            <p>For this cause it was ordained of God in the law of the <hi>Nazarite,</hi> who did for a time specially consecrate himself to God, that besides his not coming to the dead, and suffering his hair to grow, he should abstain from these things; 1. from <hi>wine,</hi> and <hi>strong drink.</hi> 2. From the <hi>vinegar</hi> of wine or strong drink. 3. From any <hi>liquor of grapes,</hi> though it were but the water wherein they were steeped. 4. From the <hi>green</hi> or <hi>moist grape.</hi> 5. From the <hi>dried grape</hi> or <hi>raisin.</hi> 6. From the <hi>husk</hi> or <hi>kernel</hi> of them, <hi>Numbers</hi> 6.3,4. Had the <hi>Nazarite</hi> eaten but the <hi>skin</hi> of the grape or raisin, he had broken the law: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the holy Ghost would teach us that those who separate themselves from the world, to be in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner serviceable to the Lord, must avoid not onely plain sin, but the <hi>appearance</hi> of sin, and all <hi>occasions</hi> of it, though we may look upon them but as the husks of grapes, to be of small moment and little danger. <hi>Beza</hi> giveth this reason why the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> when he saw the man that fell among theives,
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:63388:419"/>
passed on the other side of the way, <hi>Ne cadaveris contactu pollueretur; Lest he should be defiled with the touch of the corps.</hi> He would be so far from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dead carkass, that he would pass on the other side of the way when he saw one dying. <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men; avoid it, pass not by it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> come not not near it) <hi>turn from it and pass away,</hi> Prov. 4. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>He that will do all he <hi>may,</hi> will quickly do what he <hi>may not.</hi> Its lawful to enjoy bodily pleasures and delights, but not to <hi>buy</hi> them with hazard to our souls. Souldiers in a Garrison that venture to <hi>the outmost line,</hi> are often snapt up by those that besiege them. We sometimes when in danger of a siege, burn down those houses in the skirts of the City which might be serviceable to us, when we cannot well defend them, lest they should prove helpful to our enemies against us. <hi>Theseus</hi> is said to cut off his golden locks, lest his adversaries should in fight take hold of them. Even in things lawful its commendable for Christians to deny themselves, when there is danger by taking liberty therein of gratifying the enemies of their souls. <hi>Cotis</hi> King of <hi>Thracia</hi> manifested possibly more <hi>prudence</hi> then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality in breaking the <hi>cupboard of curious glasses</hi> presented to him,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> lest (his nature being extremely cholerick) he should deal too severely with his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in case they had broken any of them. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath a story of <hi>Satyrus,</hi> that being a pleader, and knowing himself passionate, and in that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the mind apt to commit many indecencies, and to rush into foul extravagancies, he used to <hi>stop

The servant that hath been trusted and honoured by his Lord, if he prove a <hi>Theif,</hi> and steal from his Lord, provokes him to take his stock out of his hands, and to trust him no longer.

body acquainted with their ware. When the great Usurer that is worth thousands in Bills and Bonds, and the rich Shopkeeper, whose estate swelleth to a vast bulk, never proclaim what they are worth, but rather endeavour to hide it; Those that have least spiritual riches, are most guilty of boasting; <hi>Laodicaea</hi> bragged much that <hi>was poor, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and blind, and naked, and worse then naught,</hi> They who are fullest of <hi>Faith,</hi> and richest in good works, make the least sound; When their hearts and lives like the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> shine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with grace and holiness, they do not, they will not, <hi>know it.</hi> They consider their greatest light and lustre, is but a reflection from the Father of lights, and therefore they have no reason at all to boast of <hi>borrowed goods.</hi>

He is but <hi>enlivened dust, moving earth, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned clay,</hi> that which beasts trample under their feet; He hath nothing that good is, but what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; He lives wholly upon the alms and charity of another.

not agree. As he is a sinner, he is more vile and base, more noisom and loathsom then any Toad, or Snake, or Serpent, and hath he any reason to be proud? Reader, be <hi>cloathed with humility</hi>; learn of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, for he was <hi>meek and lowly in heart. Though he thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant,</hi> Phil. 2.7,8.</p>
            <p>When <hi>pride cometh, then cometh a fall.</hi> As a Wrastler, if he can lift his fellow <hi>from the ground,</hi> quickly gives him a fall; so the Devil, if he can lift up with pride, doubts not but to throw them. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians observe that the <hi>Dropsie</hi> and <hi>Consumption</hi> are usually together: when once thou swellest with this <hi>Dropsie</hi> of pride, expect a <hi>Consumption</hi> of thy god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. He walks but dangerously who walks on high places, as on the ridges of houses, and on ropes; he that walks below is more safe. Angels, <hi>Adam, David, Hezekiah, Peter,</hi> and many others in Scripture confirm the Wisemans Proverb, <hi>Pride goeth before a fall.</hi> Trees that are set on <hi>mountains</hi> are easily shaken and torn up by the roots, when stormy winds arise. Indeed tis no wonder that a proud man should fall into sin, for he relieth on his own strength, which is but a broken reed. <hi>Peter</hi> had not fallen so fouly, if he had not undertaken to stand upon his own legs, which were too weak to bear his weight; But <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore honour is humility.</hi> The lower the foundation, the higher the building.</p>
            <p>A proud man hath a great infelicity, in that he is his own enemy, and makes all others his enemies. <hi>God</hi> is his enemy; there is no sinner whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims such open war against, in such express terms,

Pride makes him scorn friends (for familiarity would deprive him, he thinks, of that reverence which he deserves) and therefore all must be his enemies; but he is his <hi>own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> most, in cutting such a gash in his soul by his <hi>pride,</hi> and making way for all other sins to fall on. He that <hi>is lifted up with pride, quickly falls into the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil.</hi> Satan had found this vice, <hi>Pride,</hi> by experience so prevalent to draw the creature from God, that he knew no better bait to catch <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> with, <hi>Ye shall be as gods</hi>; and when afterwards he encountred <hi>David,</hi> 'twas with this weapon; <hi>he tempted</hi> David <hi>to number the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet alas, though it be so prejudicial, how natural is it to us? <hi>Pride</hi> is a weed, a worm that gets into the best Garden. It was a witty taunt which a proud Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had from a friend of his, that upon his election went to <hi>Rome</hi> on purpose to see him, where finding his behaviour stretcht to nothing but pride and state, he departed and put on a <hi>mourning suit,</hi> and the next day comes in black to visit him; The Cardinal asking the cause why he was in mourning, he answered, <hi>It was for the death of Humility; which fetcht its last breath in him when he was elected Cardinal.</hi> Most of us have cause to put on mourning upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

            <p>They who know the <hi>anger</hi> of God, will stand in awe and not sin; They know that God is not to be mocked; <hi>for it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, for our God is a consuming fire.</hi> They know his fury is terrible, intolerable; none can abide it, no sinner can avoid it; therefore they hate sin, the object of it, and flie to Christ, who delivereth from it.</p>
            <p>O what a work, a gracious sanctifying work doth the knowledge of God make in the soul! It makes the understanding to esteem him
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:63388:426"/>
above all, the will to chose him before all, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to desire him, to delight in him more then all; the whole man, to seek him, to serve him, to honour and praise him beyond all in Heaven and earth. What is the reason that God is so much loved, admired, and worshipped, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in his Church, when all the World besides despise him, but this, <hi>In</hi> Judah <hi>is God known, his name is great in</hi> Israel! <hi>Psa.</hi> 76. 1.</p>
            <p>O Reader, be confident of this; the more thou knowest of the excellencies of God, the more thou wilt prize his Son, submit to his spirit, crucifie the flesh, contemn the world, fear to offend him, study to please him; the more holy thou wilt be in all manner of conversation.</p>
            <p>Hence the main work of Christs prophetical office was to reveal God to the world.</p>
            <p>And the Devils great work is to keep men from this knowledge of God, knowing that it will tend so exceedingly to their sanctification and holiness, and to the overthrow of his interest. The Miller mufleth and blindeth his Horse that draweth his Mill, and thereby keeps him at his round, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, in making him to think he goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The first work of the <hi>Philistines</hi> was, to put out <hi>Sampsons</hi> eyes, and then they made him grind at their Mill and make them sport. The <hi>Eagle</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny, Nat.

Satan darkneth mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,

and thereby commandeth their wills and affections, and destroyeth the whole man; <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that perish, whom the God of this world hath blinded their minds, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God should shine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>When men are spoken in Scripture to be vicious and prophane, they are onely said <hi>not to know the Lord,</hi> and <hi>there is no knowledge of God in the land, Ier</hi> 4 22. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Those that are ignorant of God, abound in all manner of Atheism and wickedness.

As a <hi>sickly</hi> man is hindered in his journey by every storm, and ready to run to an House or stand under an Hedge at every shower; so is a discontented person, ready to turn aside or stand still at every unexpected providence; when a contented man like a lusty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved travellar, keeps on his course whatsoever weather comes.

so much, and so long about them, till they make themselves a prey to Satan, and no whit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or secure those persons or things about which they are so immoderately anxious and sollicitous.</p>
            <p>Whilst we are in this world, we must expect various winds, some sharp, some warm, some nipping, some refreshing, some with us, some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and unless we are prepared for all by an holy pliableness, we shall be injured by every one; Every strong wind, whether with us, or against us, will be ready to overturn us, if we want this ballast. There is no condition in this life so <hi>blessed,</hi> as to afford the perfection of content; and yet there is no estate in this life so wretched, but a Christian may be contented with it. If thou hast as much as thou wantest, thou hast as much as in reason thou desirest, and therefore hast cause to be contented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The way to true Riches,</hi> saith <hi>Plato, is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our heaps, but to diminish the covetousness of our hearts. It were well for the world,</hi> saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>if there were no Gold in it; but since its the Fountain whence all things flow, its to be desired, but onely as a pass to travail to our journeys end without begging.</hi> Every man is <hi>rich,</hi> or may be so, if he will equal his mind to his estate, and be but <hi>poor</hi> in his desires; He that hath most, wants somthing, as <hi>Haman,</hi> when he had the commander of one hundred and twenty Provinces at command; He that hath least, wants nothing, if he want not a contented spirit.</p>
            <p>He that can bring his heart to an even poize in all providences, will avoid many temptations,
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:63388:430"/>
and escape many snares in which others are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. The want of this renders many a mans life as unserviceable to God, as uncomfortable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

            <p>It hinders <hi>examining our selves</hi>; Though <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>calm</hi> waters will like a <hi>glass,</hi> if we look into it, shew us the image and likeness of our selves, yet troubled and muddy waters will make no such representation. Though the heart when calm and contented,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 27.

               <item>1. That <hi>Infinite wisdom ordaineth whatsoever befalleth me,</hi> and the present condition that I am in, is ever best for me. If a greater portion of outward good things, had been good for me, I had had it; my Father is not so careless of his Children, as to deny them any thing that is good for them, and if it be not good for me, why should I defire it? He acteth without reason, as well as without religion, who craveth what is hurtful to him. If my condition were cut out by the will of malicious men, I might have some ground of grumbling; but when its cut out by the infinite wisdom of a gracious God, I have not the least cause of discontent. I take it ill if my <hi>Children</hi> be not satisfied with what food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I think fitten for them; and may not God much more take it ill at my hands, if I sit not down quietly with his allowance, be it more or less?</item>

bad as I know it might have been; Beggars must not be chusers; They who have nothing but of charity and almes, must be satisfied with a bare allowance, and contentedly be at anothers dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal; <hi>Why doth living man complain</hi>?

               <item>3. <hi>That be our estate as low as it will, it is better then we brought with us into the world.</hi> Some give us this reason, why man (when none besides of the visible creatures) is born naked, weeping, helpless, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to teach him contentedness. Have I any <hi>food</hi>? I brought none with me; Is my <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> course and thin? I was born naked; Am I blest with any comforts? I came into the World without any; <hi>Naked came I into the world, and naked shall I go out of the world; The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>That a better condition might and would make me worse</hi>; If I were mounted high in the world, I should be like the <hi>Flag</hi> at the top of the Mast, more liable to storms and winds. The full purse invites the Theif, and perhaps may occasion a stab; when the empty pocket is secure, and the poor man may travail the road without any such danger. Low shrubs escape many a cold blast, with which tall trees are assaulted; <hi>They have no changes, therefore they fear not God,</hi> Psa. 55. 7. <hi>Atalanta</hi> lost the wager she ran for, by gathering up the <hi>Golden Apples</hi> which <hi>Hippomenes</hi> for that purpose had thrown in her way.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="815" facs="tcp:63388:431"/>5. <hi>That others who are better then I and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are worse for this world, and suffer more hardships.</hi> In <hi>spiritual</hi> things look on those <hi>above</hi> thee, that by an honest emulation thou mayst reform and amend; but in <hi>temporal</hi> things look on those <hi>below</hi> thee, that thou mayst not complain or murmur. How many are in fetters, wandring up and down from house and home, set upon the wrack of diseases, and have an ounce of misery for every dram which thou hast? stay Sirs, said the wise Hary in the Fable, let our estate content us, for as we run from some; so others run from us.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>That all shall work for my good.</hi> The Saint is sure to thrive by his sufferiugs; When Children meet with Nuts, or Apples, or Primroses in their way, those are oftimes occasions to make them loyter in their errands, incur their Parents anger, and sometime their late return finds the door shut against them; when such as meet with danger make the more haste, and their speed procureth them the greater welcome. They who meet with pleasures are apt to loyter; they who meet with miseries make the more haste, and shall find the better chear. The Christian hath a promise, and the very Godhead of the Almighty engaged for its performance: <hi>We know that all things shall work together for good to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpose,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. Why should not the Christian with an holy resolution hold a steady course in all weathers, and though he be forced with cross winds to shift his sails and catch at side winds, yet wisely steer and keep on his course by the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> when he may be certain that
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:63388:432"/>
every wind that bloweth shall help him forward to his eternal joyful Haven. Though we cannot see how some passages of Gods providence, as persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, opprossion, loss of relations or estates, sickness or disgrace, should do otherwise then hurt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us; and are ready to <hi>darken counsel by words without knowledge,</hi> and to say as <hi>Iacob,</hi> Joseph <hi>is not, and</hi> Simeon <hi>is not, all these are against me. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not, Honours are not, Riches are not, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not; All these are against me.</hi> But Christ may say to us of such severe dispensations, as once to <hi>Peter; What I do thou knowest not now, but shalt know hereafter.</hi> The <hi>issue</hi> will prove a truth in Gods promises, and the <hi>conclusion</hi> will speak what was in the womb of the promises. I am confident when God sendeth afflictions, they are at that season more fit for me then outward mercies; and though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I am ready to <hi>blaspheme,</hi> yet when I find the fruit of them in being thereby partaker of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness I bless him for them. A <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when <hi>Sparta</hi> had got the day in a battel, could not onely submit but rejoyce though her five Sons were slain in the fight. If I get the victory over one sin, I have cause to rejoyce, though it cost me some outward comforts.</item>
               <item>7. <hi>That the more I repine the worse I make my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> A discontented man like one in a barrel of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which way soever he turns he finds some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that pricks, he is best at ease when he <hi>lieth</hi> still.

                  <p>Many Heathen who were ignorant of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodness, and faithfullness of God, yet upon principles of morality were constant and even in their behaviours, not changing their countenances with the change of their fortunes and conditions, but bringing their mind to their estates, when they could not bring their estates to their minds. <hi>Xantippe</hi> said of <hi>Socrates</hi> that she always found him <hi>returning home</hi> (though he often met with affronts and abusive language abroad) <hi>with the same face and carriage with which</hi> he went out. <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> was <hi>ever like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> neither by obtaining the dictatourship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with arrogancy, nor being banished his Country fick with melancholy.

            <p>The smallness of thy temporal, may increase thy spiritual estate. If God recompence thy want of earthly, with a supply of heavenly riches, thou art no loser. <hi>Nicepsorus</hi> tells us of one <hi>Cyrus</hi> a Courtier, in the time of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger, who through the envious occupation of some favourites being spoiled of his goods, of a Pagan became a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and of a Christian a Minister of Christ. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia</hi> the daughter of a Philosopher in <hi>Athens,</hi> being cast out of her Fathers house by unkind bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to beseech <hi>Theodosius</hi> to right a poor Orphan, found such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in his eyes, that he made her his Queen.

As if a man would have his trees to thrive, he must not onely open the earth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and mind its watering, but also lop off su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous branches; and as a Gardiner if he would have his hearbs and flowers to flourish, must be sure to keep his Banks and Beds well weeded, as well as dunged or watered; so if thou wouldst thrive and flourish in godliness, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Motives inciting Christians to exercise themselves to Godliness. The Vanity of other exercises; The brevity of mans life; The Patterns of others.</head>
            <p>THirdly, I shall annex some Motives to quicken thee to exercise thy self to godliness, and then conclude the Treatise.</p>
            <p>First, Consider, <hi>The vanity of all other exercises
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:63388:436"/>
and labours</hi>; The wise man begins his Ecclesiastes with <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity</hi>; and after a large and exact demonstration thereof makes this use, and ends his book with, <hi>Hear the conclusion of the whole matter, fear God and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> It may be Reader, thou takest much pains, and spendest much time, thou risest early, and sittest up late, and wastest thy body, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est out thy strength, and toylest, and moylest about the things of this life; but alass, to what purpose? to what profit? The foot of all thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, when at the end of thy life the total comes to be summed up, will be onely <hi>Ciphers,</hi> and signifie nothing; Thou workest all this while at the labour in vain; like the Disciples, thou fishest all night and catchest nothing; thou <hi>spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thy strength for what is not bread, and thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for what will not satisfie</hi>; If the word of truth, and the God for whom it is impossible to lye, may be beleived, all the things of this life separated from godliness, are <hi>lying vanities, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cisternes, ashes, lyes, wind, vanity of vanities, and things of naught,</hi> Joh. 2. 8. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 21. <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>and</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 13. It is <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> saying, that if he had been to Preach to all the world, and could so have spoken that all should have heard him, he would have chosen that Text; <hi>O mortal men, how long will ye love vanity, and follow after leasing! Demo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>critus</hi> gave that for the reason of his continual laughter, which occasioned his Country-men to look on him as distracted; That when he beheld
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:63388:436"/>
the labour and diligence, the running and riding, the sweating and painting; nay, the fighting and killing of men to get one above another, and to heap up a fading treasure, he could not but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride their folly.</p>
            <p>Indeed though the Heathen laughed at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculousness of such persons, the sensible Christian seeth great cause to weep at the emptiness and unprofitablenss of such actions, and the madness of the Agents. <hi>Cyprian</hi> advised his friend <hi>Donatus</hi> to suppose himself at the top of the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and thence to behold the tumults and chances of this wavering world, and told him that then he could not but either laugh at it, or pity it. Its no such wonder that brutish horses should leave good provender to feed on litter, as some Jades do; but that men who are indued with reasonable souls, that seeming Christians, who have a Table spread before them with hidden Manna, with Angels food, with meat indeed, and drink indeed, withal t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e dainties of Heaven, should neglect these and feed on ashes, may well be matter both of admiration and lamentation.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghost tells such, that they <hi>follow after vain things which cannot profit them,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 21. All outward things are like an <hi>olive</hi> or <hi>date</hi> stone hard to crack or cleave, but when with much labour they are opened, they are nothing worth.</p>
            <p>The Wise Moralist speaking of such laborious loyterers as work hard for nothing, compares them to such as spend many months to learn <hi>to write with their feet,</hi> and when they have learned it,
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:63388:437"/>
are never the <hi>Better</hi> for it. <hi>Caesar</hi> compares them to such as fish for gudgeons with a <hi>golden hook,</hi> hazard more then the fish when taken are worth. Life is precious, health, and strength, and time are precious; because all these have a relation to an eternal estate; now how foolish is he that wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them upon toys and trifles, and neglecteth provision for the other world? <hi>Surely every man walketh in a vain shew, surely they are disquieted in vain,</hi> Psal. 39. 6.</p>
            <p>Observe Rearder, how dearly men pay for their guilded nothings, for their earthen pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherds coverd with silver dross; they <hi>walk</hi> up and down, run hither and thither, <hi>disquiet</hi> themselves with cares and fears, and heart piercing frights and vexations for a <hi>vain shew; The people labour in the fire, and weary themselves for very vanity, Habbak.</hi> 2. 13. Their work is hot and hard, they labour <hi>in the fire,</hi> even to lassitude and weariness. But is it about the noble concerments of their immortal souls? Is it that their sins may be pardoned, the vitiosity of their natures healed, and that their souls may be fitted for the heavenly mansions? No, it is for <hi>very vanity.</hi> For that which will not afford them the least good, or make them in any respect better, or blessed. Alas, how much below, nay contrary to reason doth man act, to cast away <hi>pearls</hi> upon <hi>swine, gold</hi> upon <hi>dross, diamonds</hi> upon <hi>dirt,</hi> to throw away his time and seasons of grace, which are more worth then rubies, then all riches, upon that which is <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a worthy check, which <hi>Cineas</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour gave to the monstrous Ambition of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>;
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:63388:437"/>
When that King of <hi>Epyrus</hi> was solicited by the <hi>Tarentines</hi> and other people in <hi>Italy,</hi> to become the head of their league against the <hi>Romans</hi>; whilst he was musing upon that affair, his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Cineas</hi> came into his presence, and perceiving the King in a study, desires the knowledge of his thoughts; <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> courteously opens his heart to him, and asketh his advice whether he were best to accept of that honourable offer or no; but resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before to joyn with them, and promised him self success; The Oratour answerd him, That in case he should joyn with them and prevail, <hi>What would he then do? Pyrrhus</hi> told him, <hi>Then</hi> Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>and</hi> Sicily <hi>will be at my command. Cineas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and replied, <hi>What then will you do? Pyrrhus</hi> told him, <hi>Then</hi> Africa <hi>will soon be conquered. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> asked, <hi>What then will you do?</hi> Then said <hi>Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus,</hi> Grecia <hi>will yield to my victorious armes. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> continued, <hi>When</hi> Grecia <hi>is brought under what will you do next?</hi> The King perceiving the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his favourite, replied smiling, <hi>Then</hi> Cineas <hi>We will sit still rest our selves and be merry. That</hi> said <hi>Cineas you may do presently without any bloody fight</hi> or <hi>barbarous outragious acts, without tiresome marches, pinching quarters, tormenting fears of losing the day without any hazard or danger to your self or others.</hi>

            <p>Truly Reader, I may tell thee, if thou art one that busiest thy self about a throng of worldly businesses, and crowdest thy mind and heart with projects and designs, to increase thy heaps, and advance thy name, and provide for thy children, and procure thy self a comfortable subsistance for a few days, that after all thy care, and trouble,
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:63388:438"/>
and restlesness, and vexation, and hazards, and dangers, thou wilt be never the better: Thou wilt, but like them that spend their time, and money, and thoughts for the Phylosophers stone, reap thy labour for thy pains, and find all unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> is of opinion, that all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists are <hi>mad,</hi> in being so laborious for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Consider <hi>the brevity of thy life.</hi> He who hath but a little time, and a great task, must work hard, or his work will not be done. The Birds know their time, and improve it; in some Countries, the shorter the days are, the faster they flye. Heathen have been sensible of this. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus</hi> cryed out on his dying bed, <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis, Time was short, and not sufficient for humane arts and sciences. Seneca</hi> saith of himself, <hi>Nullus mihi per otium exiit dies, partem noctis studiis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vovi; I lose no day through idleness, but even devote part of the night to my studies.</hi> The very Devils fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their cursed trade with the greater diligence, knowing <hi>that their time is short,</hi> Rev. 12. 12.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, Consider how few thy days are; <hi>What is your life! even a vapour, a coming, and a going, a flood and an ebbe, and then thou art in the Ocean of eternity.</hi> I have read of one, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked, <hi>What life was</hi>; was answered answerless; for the party of whom the question was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, onely turned his back and went away. We come into the world and take a turn or two about in it, and God saith, <hi>Return ye Children of men</hi>; A little child may number the days of the oldest man; We project high things, and lay foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for an earthly eternity; but the longest life is less then a drop to that Ocean. Yet alas, the most are blown off in the spring, and few continue to fall off in Autumn. <hi>Plutarch</hi> compareth <hi>Galba,

            <p>This short time posteth away with speed; How soon do our days vanish? <hi>Iob</hi> tells us that his little time made great haste to be gone; <hi>My days are swifter then a Weavers shuttle,</hi> Job 7. 6. The <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers shuttle</hi> is an instrument of very swift motion, and so swift that it is used for a Proverb, for all things that are swift and speedy. <hi>Radius Textoris dictum Proverbiale; Radio velocius.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> express it by a beam of the Sun, or a word which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a ray, which is darted in a moment from one end of the Heavens to another; Such speed doth our life make to pass away.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> when he had a full prospect of the Sun going down, to perceive the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its motion, took a Psalter in his hand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had twice read over the 51. <hi>Psalm,</hi> the whole body of the Sun was set, whereby he concluded, the earth being twenty one thousand miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, the Sun must go seven thousand miles in half a quarter of an hour; However the Cardinal might be mistaken in his reckoning; <hi>Yet, Mans days are swifter then a post, they flee away, they see no good; They are passed away as the swift ships; as the
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:63388:444"/>
Eagle that hasteth to the prey,</hi> Job 9. 25, 26. Its our shame and misery that our days should be so swift, and we so slack; that our time should be as speedy as a post or ship, or Eagle, and our hearts as slow about our eternal concernments, as a Snail. Our negligence herein speaks us brutish, and void of common sense.

            <p>The Heathen Historian can agree with Scripture, in this; <hi>Vita nostra sicut fabula, non refert quam diu sed quam bene</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Liv.</hi> l. 15. c. 7.</note> Our life passeth away, as a tale that is told; it matters not much whether it be <hi>long</hi> or <hi>short,</hi> but whether it be <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely it concerneth thee Reader to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion thy business, and work the work of God, when thine everlasting happiness dependeth on it, and thy time is so short that thou hast to do it in. In the days of <hi>Ptolomeus Philopater,</hi> when the huge and great Anchor of the Ship <hi>Thalmegos</hi> was laid out upon the shore, the Children of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> did ride upon the stalk and crept through the ring of the Anchor, as if it had been made pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely for their <hi>pastime,</hi> whereas wise men knew it was appointed for better uses, namely, <hi>to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and make sure the great vessel in storms and tempests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, so do too many serve time, they play and toy, and trifle it away, as if God had given it to them for that end; when he who hath but half an eye, as we say, may see that it was given for better purposes, <hi>viz.</hi> to furnish his soul for his eternal voyage, and thereby to help to stablish

and fasten him when he shall lanch into the stormy Ocean. <hi>Protogenes</hi> made himself ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the judgement of all that are sober, for spending seven years in drawing <hi>Ialisus</hi> and his Dog; for though the most excellent Pictures are longest in drawing, yet to spend years about that which may be finished in days, argueth want of wisdom. But having spoken somewhat largely to this in the sixt Chap. I am the more brief in this.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider the <hi>examples of others,</hi> who have wrought hard at this heavenly Calling. <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, <hi>Nothing prevailes more with men then similitudes and examples</hi>; Indeed worthy patterns are of great power. <hi>Thucydides</hi> brake forth <hi>into tears</hi> out of love to learning, upon hearing <hi>Herodotus</hi> read an history <hi>that he had written. Themistocles</hi> tells us, <hi>The statue of</hi> Miltiades <hi>would not suffer him to sleep. Alexander</hi> was much provoked to vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant acts, by reading the prowess of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> in <hi>Homer.

            <p>O Reader, let Christ be the <hi>Copy</hi> after which thou wilt write, and the pattern which thou wilt follow, and be a follower of others as they are of Christ Jesus. Did Christ work so hard for thee? did he lose his food, and sleep, and wear out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that his strength was dried up like a <hi>potsherd,</hi> and his heart <hi>was melted like wax in the midst of his bowels</hi>? and wilt not thou spend and be spent for thy Saviour? I would say for thy own soul; for in serving him thou servest thy self. Think of it when thou art trifling away thy time, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting thy spiritual watch, and dull and dead in holy duties, how eager and earnest, how zealous and sedulous thy Lord Jesus was in working out thy salvation; he did not play, nor dally about the work of thy redemption, but made it his business, and did what he was called to with all his heart, and soul, and strength.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. The excellency of this Calling, and the Conclusion of the Treatise.</head>
            <p>FOurthly, Consider the excellency of this Calling. As it is said of God in respect of beings; <hi>Who is like thee O God! Among all the Gods none is to be compared to thee.</hi> So I may say of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in respect of Callings, <hi>What is like thee O Godliness! amongst all callings none is comparable to thee.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. It is the most <hi>honourable</hi> Calling. The <hi>Master</hi> that thou are bound to, is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> the Fountain of honour, and Lord of glory; One of whom the greatest Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the world hold their Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to whom they must kneel and do their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; One to whom the <hi>whole creation is lesse then nothing.</hi> The <hi>work</hi> that thou art imployed in, is not servile and mean, but high and noble; the worship of the great God, walking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with his blessed Majesty, subduing brutish lusts, living above this beggarly earth, a conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven, a conflict with, and conquest over this dreggy flesh and drossy world, and powers of hell, to which the greatest battels and victories of the most valiant warriours that ever drew the sword are worse then childrens play.

            <p>It is not <hi>earthly riches</hi> that make a man honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; we mistake in calling and counting rich men the <hi>best men</hi> in the Parish: Riches without godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are but a gold ring in a <hi>swines snout,</hi> for which the brute is nothing the better.

But that honour which is from
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:63388:447"/>
above is true and eternal. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us the <hi>Roman nobles,</hi> as a <hi>badge</hi> of their nobility, wore the picture of the Moon upon their <hi>shoes,</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their nobility did increase, so it would <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi> All priviledges, all prerogatives, all titles, all dignities without godliness, are vanishing sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.

            <p>The world looks on the Saint (possibly he is poor and mean in the world) as the Jews lookt on Christ; <hi>As a root out of a dry ground, and so saw no form nor comliness in him</hi>; but they who could pierce into the <hi>inside</hi> of Christ, could see that in him <hi>dwelt thee fullness of the godhead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi>; and they who can see into the inside of Christians, behold the <hi>Kings daughter all glorious within.</hi> As the precious stone <hi>Sandastra</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in outward appearance, but that which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>black,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So the Church of Christ is outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly black with affliction, but inwardly more bright and glorious then the Sun, with thriving vertues and celestial graces. The power of godliness in a mean Christian is a rich treasure in a mean Cabinet; but vice in robes, in scarlet, is poison in wine, the more deadly and dangerous.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Piety is a lasting pillar, that causeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be had in <hi>everlasting remembrance.</hi> Time shall not out-live the Saints honour; grace ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him more illustrious then ever the <hi>Mausolean</hi> mountan did that <hi>Carian.</hi> As the hairs of <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> are not to be pierced with any weapon; so the name of a Saint cannot be hurt by all the slanders and calumnies of the wicked.

<pb n="849" facs="tcp:63388:448"/>
of Men and Devils. The disgrace which the wicked cast on the righteous is at worst, but like the noise of some loud tongu'd gun, ceased as soon as heard; but the honour which God and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture put upon the godly, is a pillar which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to all eternity; such a monument as neither age, nor time, nor envy, can waste or wear out. <hi>Demetrius</hi> under all the obloq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sin is so base and beggarly, so loathsome and shameful a thing, that not onely the children of God, but even wicked men have been unwilling to own it, and ashamed to be taxed with it, or found out at the commission of it. When Godliness is so high and honourable, so noble and excellent a Mistress, that those who <hi>deny the power</hi> of it, will take upon them <hi>the form</hi> of it; they who hate its work, will wear its livery. There are hardly any jewels of grace, but for each of them vice hath counterfeit stones O! how noble a Mistris, how honourable a Lady is that, whom all pretend relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, and even those that hate her would not be thought her enemies, but blush to be taxed as strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to her.</p>

               </gap>. 1. 7. For the measure of it, its compared to <hi>the joy of harvest,</hi> to <hi>the joy of the bridegroom</hi> and <hi>bride</hi> on their Wedding day, <hi>Isa</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that Grace and Godliness are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, and set forth by those things which are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightful, and bring joy with them. As <hi>Musick,</hi> the joy and delight of the ears; a <hi>feast,</hi> the joy and delight of the taste; to <hi>light,</hi> the joy and delight of the eyes; <hi>life, wine,</hi> which rejoyceth the heart; <hi>perfumes,</hi> which delight the sent; <hi>good,</hi> the joy of the will; <hi>truth,</hi> the joy of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; godliness hath joy proper and sutable for every sense, whether outward or inward. As the higher the Sun is the greater its light is; so the holier, the Christian the greater his joy is. The more <hi>clear</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> burns, the more comfortable it is; smoak fetcheth tears from our eyes. When grace burns clear, its refreshing indeed; tis the smoak of <hi>sin</hi> that turns our houses into <hi>Bochims, places of weeping</hi>; when good men step awry not pondering their goings, then they wrench their feet, or put their bones out of joynt, and so put themselves to much pain.</p>
            <p>Indeed, wicked men who are ignorant of the mystery of godliness, becuase they see no sun-shine in the faces of godly men, judge it to be foul weather in their hearts; As the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, when they entered into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and saw no <hi>Images,</hi> presently reported the Jews to worship the <hi>Clouds</hi>; but a Christians joy is as far

out of wicked mens sight, to discern it as out of their power to remove it; <hi>A stranger intermedleth not with his joy; your hearts shall rejoyce, and your joy shall no man take from you.</hi> A wicked mans joy is most in his face; As a Black-a-more, he is <hi>white</hi> no where but in his <hi>Teeth. Seneca</hi> compares him to a <hi>Commander</hi> in a desperate <hi>battel,</hi> who least his Souldie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Godly mans joy is most in his heart, he is like that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh which hath a rough outside, but a pearl within. When there are storms without, there is musick within, peace of conscience, which passeth all understanding. A wicked man is as a book of Tragedies, bound extraordinary, gay and guilt on the out-side, but full of doleful, dreadful stories within, or as <hi>Alexander</hi> said of <hi>Antipater,</hi> he was white without, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within; his face may be white and smiling, but his conscience is red and fiery. But the godly mans inside is his best side, though his <hi>full sacks</hi> of joy and delight are not opened till he comes to his <hi>Fathers house,</hi> yet the blessed Jesus gives him, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> the Patriarchs, sufficient provision for the <hi>way.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> gave the first fruits of the earth to <hi>God</hi>; the <hi>Gospel</hi> gives the first fruits of <hi>Heaven</hi> to men, which are both an <hi>earnest</hi> and a <hi>taste</hi> of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and everlasting harvest.</p>
            <p>All sorrow proceeds from <hi>sin</hi>; As the shadow followeth the body, so doth grief follow guilt. Lust like rotten flesh or wood, will breed worms to
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:63388:450"/>
gnaw in the sinners bowels; Therefore its no wonder that <hi>Nabal, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> when their lusts flew in their faces, dyed, or were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye with horror. If a godly man sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and wound his soul, its no wonder if he feel the smart and pain of it. When <hi>David</hi> steps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry, and slips with his feet, and falls dangerously, he may well keep his bed, and water his couch, and cry out of his aches and broken bones; yet the very sorrow of a Saint for sin against his God, hath more real joy and delight in it, then all the skin-deep pleasures of gigling Gallants. <hi>Crates</hi> could dance and laugh in his thread-bare coat, and his wallet at his back, which was all his wealth.

All the comforts of this world to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son void of grace, are but as a sack of perfumes, and medicines, and cordial drugs to the back of a galled horse, which may vex and inrage his sores with their weight, but do not ease or abate his pain with their vertue. A Saints life, notwithstanding his greatest sufferings, whilst it is blessed with the smiles of his father, is an heaven upon earth; but the sinners life, notwithstanding his honours, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and riches, and relations, whilst under the wrath of an infinite God, and anguisht with the gripings of a guilty conscience, is little less then an earnest and taste of hell.

I am confident the true Christian hath more true pleasure in suffering for Christ, or one act of mortification, or victory over one lust, then the highest earthly Potentate hath in his largest dominions, in the multitude of his subjects, in the richness of his kingdoms, and in all the honour that is done him, or good things enjoyed by him all his days.</p>

            <p>O Reader, what an argument is here, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thee to piety, godliness is profitable in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in all relations, in both worlds! In pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, twill be a sun to direct thee, in adversity a shield to protect thee; in life twill be thy comfort, and which is infinitely more in death, that hour of need 'twill be thy enlivening cordial; The smell of Trefoil, is stronger in a cloudy dark season, then in fair weather.

Thou mightest call thy dying bed, as <hi>Iacob</hi> the place through which he travailed, <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> a <hi>Camp,</hi> for there <hi>Angels</hi> would meet thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey thee safe through the <hi>Air,</hi> the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (of which Satan is Lord and Prince) to thy <hi>Fathers houses,</hi> where thou shouldst be infinitely blessed in the vision and fruition of thy God and Saviour for ever.

Ah who would not work for God with the greatest diligence, and walk with God in the exactest obedience, and wait upon God with the greatest patience; when he is assured, that in the doing of his commands there is such great reward; and those that <hi>sow to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting</hi>!</p>

               <p>Reader, I have now ended this Treatise, but whether thou (if a stranger to this calling) wilt
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:63388:458"/>
put an end to thy carnal fleshly ways, and begin this high and heavenly work or no, I know not. If thou art <hi>ambitious,</hi> thou hast here encouragement sufficient; godliness will ennoble thee, and render thy blood not only honourable, but <hi>royal.</hi> If thou art <hi>voluptuous,</hi> here is a bait which may take thee; godliness will bring thee to a <hi>river of pleasures,</hi> to such dainties and delights as take the hearts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and glorious Angels. If thou art <hi>covetous,</hi> here is a golden weight to turn the scales of thy desires and endeavours; <hi>godliness is profitable unto all things, it hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come</hi>; when thy house, and lands, and honours, and neighbours, and wife, and children, and flesh, and heart faile thee and forsake thee; godliness would say to thee, (and stand to it also) as <hi>Peter</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What canst thou have to object against godliness, that sets thee at such a distance from it? Wilt thou believe a lying world, a deceitful flesh, a destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devil, or the God of truth? Who is thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

enemy, God or they? Who will do thee most good, God or they? If thou wilt be tryed by the confessions of the greatest enemies that godliness hath, even they in their hours of extremity, will tell thee grace is of infinite worth; godliness is the best of all. <hi>Ah how happy had we been at this hour, had we been as faithful servants to Religion, as we have been slaves to foolish lusts and pleasures!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Reason</hi> may be heard, thou wilt not defer one moment the entering thy name in this society, and binding thy self Apprentice to thy Saviour; thou mayst see plainly that it is thine <hi>interest</hi> as well as thy duty; and all thy happiness for this and the other world dependeth on it. If <hi>Scripture</hi> may be heard, thou wilt quickly set about thy general calling, and make Religion thy business; it calleth loudly to thee, to turn thy back upon earth, and face about for heaven; to forsake the flesh, before the flesh forsake thee. It telleth thee plainly under the hand of thy Maker; that <hi>if thou livest after the flesh, and sowest to the flesh, thou shalt dye eternally.</hi> If the <hi>Conscience</hi> within thee may be heard, thou wilt presently give a bill of divorce to thy carnal bruish delights, and strike an hearty Covenant wit Jesus Christ; It often <hi>warneth</hi> thee of thy duty and danger, and <hi>terrifieth</hi> thee with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thy <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>relations,</hi> who have any sense of a jealous God, and eternal estate may be heard; then thou wilt immediately hearken to the counsel I commend to thee from God, and exercise thy self unto godliness. They advise, and perswade, and intreat thee to turn over a new leaf, and lead
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:63388:459"/>
a new life, and to mind in thy day the things of thy peace. If the <hi>God</hi> upon whom thou livest, by whom thou movest, from whom thou hast thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be heard, thou wilt now wink on the world, crucifie the flesh, loath thy self for thy filth and folly, and devote thy heart and soul to his fear. He commandeth thee by his dominion over thee, and thy obligations to him; he threatneth, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, affrighteth, allureth, and all to make thee mind thy allegiance to him, and the work he hath given thee to do in this world. If thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> who humbled himself for thy sake, and took upon him the form of a servant, and in thy nature was buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, scourged and crucified, may be heard, then thou wilt immedately take the counsel that is given thee, and turn to the Lord with all thy heart, and loath thy self for all thine abominations. He pleads with thee most pathetically, presenteth to thee the stripes and wounds which sin caused in his blessed body; the blood which he shed, the ignominy he endured, the agony, the death he suffered, and all to satisfie for sin, to make himself <hi>Lord both of the dead and living</hi>; he tells thee, <hi>he gave himself for thee to redeem thee from all iniquity; and to purifie thee to himself a peculiar child zealous of good works.</hi> If the daily, and nightly, and hourly <hi>mercies</hi> that thou injoyest; if the sickness, or pain, or loss, or disgrace, or <hi>afflictions</hi> which sometimes thou suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, may be heard, there would not be so much ado to perswade a wretched creature to be blessed, and an ungodly person to be holy and happy. If the <hi>inanimate</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> creatures, the earth beneath thee, the heavens above thee, the beasts
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:63388:460"/>
and birds about thee might be heard; thou wouldst whilst its called to day, now after so long a time attend to the call and command of him, in whose hand is thy life and breath; and follow after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without which thou shalt never see the Lord. Shall a Centurions <hi>servant</hi> go, when he bids him go, and come when he bids him come? and wilt not thou go and come at the voice of God? Did <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams Ass</hi> speak at Gods command, and reprove the madness of the Prophet? Did <hi>Ravens</hi> at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand feed <hi>Élijah</hi>? Did <hi>Cater-pillars,</hi> and <hi>Locusts,</hi> and <hi>Frogs,</hi> and <hi>Lice</hi> execute Gods judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaoh</hi>? Do <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>hail,</hi> and <hi>snow,</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> and <hi>stormy winds</hi> fulfil his word? Doth the <hi>earth</hi> open, the <hi>rocks</hi> rend, the <hi>stars</hi> fight in their courses, <hi>waters</hi> stand up in heaps as a wall, the <hi>Moon</hi> stand still, the <hi>Sun</hi> go backward, <hi>wildernesses</hi> tremble, things cross the course of nature to obey, his pleasure, and wilt not thou obey him? O man, bethink thy self! wilt thou be worse then these ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational and inanimate creatures? are not thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to God infinitely above theirs? what wilt thou have to say for thy self, when every stone in the street, as well as star in the heavens; when every bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I must tell thee that a perillous time, a day of extremity, an hour of trouble and anguish is hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon thee; which thou canst no more escape or avoid, then thou canst flye from thy self; when the pleasures, and delights, and honey, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful countenances of those Scorpions, thy fleshly lusts will all be past and gone, but the sting remain
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:63388:460"/>
to pierce and torment thee, when those dreggy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in which thou bathest thy self now will all be dried up; when all thy possessions, and preferments, and friends, and relations will serve thee, as women their flowers when they are dead and withered, who throw them away; or as sinking floores that will fail men when their weight is on them. And then, O then what wilt thou do? Thou wilt wish that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had been thy business, and call, and cry to it as the Elders of <hi>Gilead</hi> to <hi>Iephthah,</hi> when the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon</hi> made war with them. <hi>Come thou and be our Captain, and save us from our enemies. Come thou and be my Captain, to save me from the curse of the law, the terrors of my guilty conscience, the wrath of the Infinite God, and the torments of the eternal fire.</hi> But godliness will answer thee as <hi>Iephthah</hi> did them; <hi>Did not ye hate me, and expell me out of my Fathers house? &amp; why are ye come unto me now ye are in distress? Didst not thou hate me, and expell me out of thy heart and house? didst thou not deride, and jeer, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute me, against all the commands, and threatnings, and promises, and intreaties of God, and his word? and why art thou come to me now thou art in distress?</hi> I must tell thee, thou wilt then weep, and howl, and lament to God, as the Israelites did in their extremity, <hi>Deliver us only we pray thee this day. Lord help me, Lord save me, Deliver me this day from the jaws of the roaring Lion; Lord, let not hell shut her mouth upon me. Who can dwell in everlasting burnings? who can abide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flames</hi>? But thou mayst expect the same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer which God gave them, <hi>Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen, let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. Go to the flesh, and the world;
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:63388:461"/>
Go to thy riches, and honours, and sinful delights, which thou hast chosen and preferred before me, and let them deliver thee in this time of thy tribulation. Where are those gods, the rocks in which thou trustedst? Let them rise up, and help thee, and be thy protection, Iudg.</hi> 11. 6, 7. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 15, 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 37. 38.</p>
               <p>A Saint can sing in such a day of trial, knowing that death is come to him as the Angel to <hi>Peter,</hi> strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his side, not to hurt but to awaken him, to beat off his fetters, and set him in the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
               <p>The Saint and the Sinner never differ so much, at least in open view, as in their ends. Sin in the bud is sweet, but in the fruit bitter; and holiness though at first draught seems not so pleasant, yet afterwards is all sweetness.</p>
               <p>Though the path of sin be smooth, and pleasing to thy flesh; yet thou wilt find it slippery, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to thy spirit: Its like an evening star to usher in a night of blackness, of darkness for ever. The way of holiness is more harsh to the body, but the onely Nectar of the soul; Ah Reader, if thou wilt but choose it, thou wilt find by experience, that twill be like <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s passage over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> a way which will require some pains, but twill lead thee into the heavenly Paradise, at that did him into the worlds garden, <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, Let me therefore bespeak thee, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God himself. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Turn unto me saith the Lord of Hosts, and I will turn unto thee, saith Lord of Hosts,</hi> Zach. 1. 3. After all thy neglect and contempt of God and his word, after all thy wandrings and wickedness, thou hast one call
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:63388:461"/>
more to turn and live; In which thy Maker doth three times pawn and interpose the authority of his name to confirm his word. The Lord of Hosts, three times he doth as it were bring his Angels, his Hosts with him, in this precept and promise (as once to <hi>Sinai</hi> at the delivery of the law.) 1. As witnesses of his truth. 2. As avengers of him on them that despise his call. 3. As rejoycers for those that turn unto him. O friend, Consider it, that God who might have turned thee into hell, commandeth thee now after all thy folly and lewdness to turn to him; yea, he promiseth that if thou dost come at his call, he will meet thee half way, and turn unto thee. It is not for his own sake that he is so earnest with thee, for he can be happy without thee; he hath no addition by thy salvation, he suffereth no diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by thy damnation; but he calleth on thee for thy good, that thou mightst be happy in his favour. It was the saying of <hi>Antigona</hi> that she ought to please them with whom she hoped to remain for ever. Ah doth it not concern thee to please that God upon whom tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Reader, I shall onely allude to it and conclude. Thou art if in thy natural estate, a rebel against God; thy heart is full of enmity, and thy life of treason against his blessed Majesty; thou art daily discharging whole vollies of shot against him; he hath sent me as his Embassadour to offer thee terms of peace, and to require thee in his name to throw down thine armes, and to submit to his mercy. I know, thou art ready to consult with thy seeming friends, but real enemies, the world and the flesh, what thou wert best to do in this case; but whilst thou art thus musing, <hi>I charge, and command thee in the name of God, and by his authority who sent me to thee, that before thou closest the book, thou returne to thy Maker in thy conscience thine answer, whether thou hadst rather have peace with him, whose wrath is infininety worse then death, and whose favour is better then life, or war?</hi> If considering the excellency, necessity, and profit of godliness, thou sayst, <hi>I will through the help of Christ do all that the Lord hath written, or thinketh fit to be done, in order to my recovery out of this estate of woe and misery</hi>; I shall inform thee that God is ready to receive thee, the Spirit to assist thee, thy Saviour to embrace thee, the rich and precious promises of the Gospel, containing pardon, love, peace, eternal life, are all ready to welcome thee: But if thou deniest thy God, thy real, able, and faithful friend,
