            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18173:8"/>
one, I meane an inuring of our People to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; By the other, an immunitie from all facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſturbance of the publike peace.</p>
            <p>It was the obſeruation of the learnedſt King that euer ſate hitherto in the Engliſh Throne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the cauſe of the miſ-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our People into Poperie, and other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, was, their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dednes in the points of Catechiſme; How
<pb facs="tcp:18173:8"/>
ſhould thoſe ſoules bee but carried about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie wind of Doctrine, that are not wel Ballaſted with ſolid informations: Whence it was that his ſaid late Maieſtie (of happie memorie) gaue publike order for beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the later part of Gods day in familiar Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing; then which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could bee deuiſed more neceſſarie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull to the Soules of men; It was the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Ill-diſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18173:9"/>
of ſome cauillers, that taxed this courſe, as preiudicial to Preachings Since, in truth, the moſt vſe-full of all Preaching is Catecheticall. This layes the grounds, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſeth the wals, and roofe; this informes the iudgement, that, ſtirres vp the affections: What good vſe is there of thoſe affections that runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement? Or of thoſe wals that want a foundation? For my part, I haue ſpent the
<pb facs="tcp:18173:9"/>
greater halfe of my life in this ſtation of our holy ſeruice: I thanke God, not vnpainefully, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably; But, there is no one thing, whereof I repent ſo much, as not to haue beſtowed more houres in this publike Exerciſe of Catechiſme; In regard whereof, I could quarrell my very Sermons, and wiſh that a great part of them had beene exchanged for this Preaching conference: Thoſe other Diuine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb facs="tcp:18173:10"/>
enrich the braine &amp; the tong; this ſettles the heart; thoſe other are but the deſcants to this plain-ſong; Contemne it not, my Brethren, for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie &amp; noted homelineſſe; The moſt excellent and beneficiall thinges are moſt familiar; What can bee more obuious then Light, Ayre, Fire, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Let him that can liue without theſe, deſpiſe their commonneſſe: Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we make ſo much more vſe of the Diuine
<pb facs="tcp:18173:10"/>
bountie in theſe ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie benefits, ſo let vs the more gladly improoue theſe ready &amp; facil helps to the ſaluation of many ſoules; the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of breedes inſtabilitie of iudgment, meſpriſion of neceſſarie truths, faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe of profeſsion, frothineſſe of diſcourſe, obnoxiouſneſſe to all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſeduction. And if any of our people loath this Manna, becauſe they may gather it from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Feete, let not
<pb facs="tcp:18173:11"/>
their palates be humourd ic this wanton nauſeati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They are worthy to faſt, that are wearie of the Bread of Angels: And if herein we bee curious to ſatisfie their rouing appetite, our fauour ſhall be no better then Iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: So wee haue ſeene an vndiſcreete Schoole-maſter, whiles he affects the thankes of an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening Parent, marre the progreſſe of a forward Child, by rayſing him to an higher forme, and
<pb facs="tcp:18173:11"/>
Author, ere he haue wel learned his firſt rules; whence followes an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie oſtentation, and a late diſappointment: Our fidelitie and care of profit muſt teach vs to driue at the moſt ſure, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall good, which ſhall vndoubtedly bee beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by theſe ſafe and needfull ground-workes.</p>
            <p>From theſe tender pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures let mee leade you, (and you, others) to the ſtill Waters; Zeale in the Soule is as naturall
<pb facs="tcp:18173:12"/>
heat in the body; there is no life of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; but as the kindlieſt heat, if it bee not tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a due equalitie of moyſture, waſts it ſelfe and the body; So doth zeale, if it be not modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with diſcretion, and charitable care of the common good; It is hard to bee too vehement in contending for maine and euident truthes; but litigious and immateriall verities may ſoone be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-ſtriuen for; in the
<pb facs="tcp:18173:12"/>
proſecution whereof, I haue oft lamented to ſee how heedleſſe too many haue beene of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like welfare; Whiles, in ſeeking for one ſcruple of truth, they haue not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpend a whole pound-weight of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Peace.</p>
            <p>The Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in whoſe mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood wee haue all iuſt cauſe to pride our ſelues, hath, in much wiſdome, and pietie, deliuered her iudgment concerning all neceſſary points of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18173:13"/>
in ſo compleat a body of Diuinitie, as all hearts may reſt in; Theſe wee read, theſe we write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as profeſsing not their truth onely, but their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie alſo. The voice of God our Father, in his Scriptures, and (out of theſe) the voyce of the Church our Mother in her Articles, is that, which muſt both guide and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is beſides theſe, is but either priuate, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie and vncertain:
<pb facs="tcp:18173:13"/>

Fire vpon the Hearth warmes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but if it be miſ-placed, burnes the houſe: My brethren, let vs bee zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for our God; Euery
<pb facs="tcp:18173:14"/>
heartie Chriſtian will powre Oyle, and not Water vpon this holy flame: But, let vs take heed leaſt a blind ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loue, ſtiffe preiudice, and factious partialitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vpon vs, in ſtead of the cauſes of God; Let vs be ſuſpicious of all New verities, and careleſſe of all vnprofitable; And let vs hate to thinke our ſelues either wiſer then the Church, or better then our ſuperiors: And if any man thinke that he

ſees further then his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, in theſe Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall proſpects, let his tongue keepe the counſel of his eyes; Leaſt, whiles he affects the fame of deeper learning, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle the Church, and rayſe his glory vpon the publike ruines.</p>
            <p>And ye worthy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians whoſe ſoules God hath entruſted with our ſpirituall Guardianſhip, be ye alike minded with your teachers; The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their tongues lyes

to ſaluation; Leaue al curious diſquiſitions to the Schooles, and ſay of thoſe problemes, as the Philoſopher did of the Athenian ſhops: How many things are here that we haue no need of. Take the neereſt cut yee can, yee ſhall finde it a ſide way to heauen, yee need not lengthen it with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due circuitions.

<pb facs="tcp:18173:16"/>
of profeſſed hoſtility, it is not for vs to ſqander our thoughts and houres vpon vſe-leſſe janglings; Wherewith if we ſuffer our ſelues to be ſtill taken vp, Satan ſhal deale with vs like ſome craftie chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who whiles he holds vs at gaze with trickes of iugling, pickes our poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
            <p>Deare brethren, what euer become of theſe worthleſſe driblets, bee ſure to looke well to the free-hold of your ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb facs="tcp:18173:16"/>
Errour is not more buſie then ſubtile, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition neuer wanted ſweet inſinuations: make ſure worke againſt theſe plauſible dangers, Suffer not your ſelues to bee drawne into the net by the common ſtale of the Church; Know that outward viſibilitie may too well ſtand with an vtter excluſion from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Saluation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in a formalitie of profeſsion, but in a ſound<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of beliefe. A true
<pb facs="tcp:18173:17"/>
body may be ful of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſeaſes: So is the Romane Church of this day; whom we haue long pitied, and laboured to cure in vaine; If ſhe will not bee healed by vs, let not vs be infected by her; Let vs bee no leſſe ielous of her Contagion, then ſhe is of our Remedies. Hold faſt that precious Truth, which hath been long taught you by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, confirmed by cleare euidences of Scriptures, euinced by

ſound reaſons, ſealed vp by the bloud of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyrs; So whiles no man takes away the Crowne of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, yee ſhall be our Crowne and reioycing in the day of the Lord Ieſus; To whoſe all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace I commend you al; and vow my ſelfe</p>

That common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men may be ſaued without them? that Heauen may bee attained, though there were no Traditions; Who will not now ſay, Let mee come to Heauen by Scripture, goe you whither you will by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

This Religion hath brought the World vnder the ſubiection of my Lawes; theſe ſacred Deuotions haue driuen <hi>Hannibal</hi> from our walles, from our Capitoll; Haue I beene preſerued for this, that in mine old age I ſhould be reproued?

To which that holy Father no leſſe wittily and elegantly anſwers, by way of retortion, bringing in Rome to ſpeake thus, rather. I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed in mine old age to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, with all the reſt of the World. It is ſurely true, that in no age it is too late to learne. Let that olde age bluſh that cannot mend it ſelfe; It is not the grauitie of yeares,<note place="margin">Nullus pudor eſt ad meliora tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ibid.</note> but of manners, that deſerues prayſe. It is no ſhame to goe to the better; And when <hi>Symmachus</hi> vrges <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorum ſeruandus est ritus)</hi> wee muſt obſerue the Rites of our forefathers; <hi>Dicant igitur,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) Let them as well ſay, that all things ſhould remayne in their owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Principles, that the World once ouer-couered with darkneſſe, offends in being ſhined vpon by the glorious brightneſſe of the Sunne; And how much more happie is it, to haue diſpelled the darkneſſe of the ſoule, then of the bodie; to bee
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18173:120"/>
ſhined vpon by the beames of Faith, then of the Sunne. Thus he; moſt aptly to the preſent occaſion; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to did that bleſſed Father now liue, he would doubtleſſe, no leſſe readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply it: <hi>Nec erubeſcas mutare ſententiam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi> to his <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> Neuer bluſh to change your minde;<note place="margin">Non es tantae authoritatis vt erraſſe te pude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, &amp;c.

But, ſince wee may not bee ſo happie, wee muſt ſit downe; and mourne for our deſolations, for our diuiſions. In the meane time wee waſh our hands in innocence. There are none of all theſe inſtanced parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars (beſides many more) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of Rome hath not ſenſibly erred in corrupt additions
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18173:121"/>
to the faith; ſo as herein wee may iuſtly (before heauen and earth) warrant our diſagreement of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her. The reſt is their act, and not ours; wee are meere pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in this ſchiſme; and therfore go, becauſe we are driuen; That we hold not communion with that Church, the fault is theirs; who both haue deſerued this ſtrangeneſſe by their errours, and made it by their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; Contrarie to that rule which <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> giues of vnpleaſing frendſhip, they haue not ript it in the ſeame, but torn it in the whole cloth.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, I ſhall ſeeme vnto ſome, to haue ſpoken too mildly, of the eſtate of that debauched Church: There are that ſtand vpon a meere nullitie of her being, not reſting in a bare deprauation; For mee, I dare not goe ſo farre: If ſhe be foule, if deadly diſeaſed (as ſhe is) theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities cannot vtterly take of her eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or our relations.</p>
               <p>Our Diuines indeed call vs out of Babylon, and wee run; ſo as here is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18173:121"/>
an actuall ſeparation, on our parts; True, but from the corruptions (wherein there is a true confuſion) not from the Church; Their verie charge implies their limitation; as it is Babylon, we muſt come out of it, as it is an outward viſible Church,<note place="margin">Fr. Ian. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia.</note> we neither did, nor would: This drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that hath ſo ſwolne vp the body, doth not make it ceaſe to bee a true body, but a ſound one. The true Principles of Chriſtianitie, which it maintaines, maintaine life in that Church; the errors which it holds,<note place="margin">Capitis autem male ſaniet deliri contagia vitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſunt, ne &amp; ipſi artus peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti humore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſierent. F. Pic. Mirand. Theor. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> together with thoſe Principles, ſtruggle with that life, and threaten an extinction: As it is a viſible Church then, we haue not detrected to hold communion with it (though the contemptuous repulſe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny admonitions haue deſerued our alienation) as Babylon, wee can haue nothing to doe with it. Like as in the courſe of our life; we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerſe with thoſe men in ciuill affaires, with whom we hate to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:18173:122"/>But will not this ſeeme to ſauour of too much indifferencie? What need wee ſo vehemently labour to draw from either part, and triumph in winning Proſelytes; and giue them for loſt, on either ſide, and brand them for Apoſtates that are won away; if (which way ſo euer we fall) wee cannot light out of a true viſible Church of Chriſt? What ſuch neceſſitie was there of Martyrdome, what ſuch danger of relapſes, if the Church bee with both.</p>
               <p>Let theſe Sophiſters know, that true charitie needs not abate any thing of zeale. If they bee acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the iuſt value of truth, they ſhall not enquire ſo much into the perſons, as into the cauſe. What euer the Church be, if the errours be damnable, our bloud is happily ſpent in their impugnation; and wee muſt rather chuſe to vndergoe a thouſand deaths, then offend the Maieſtie of God, in yeelding to a knowne falſhood in religion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

doth the outward viſibilitie of the Church abate ought of the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe of miſ-opinions, or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence of our oppoſitions.

Oh the glorious crownes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thoſe bleſſed Martyrs of ours, who rather gaue their bodies to bee burnt to aſhes, then they would betray any parcell of diuine truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:18173:123"/>Oh the wofull and dangerous condition of thoſe ſoules, which ſhutting their eyes againſt ſo cleere a light, either willingly ſit downe in palpable darkneſſe, or fall backe from the ſincerity of the Goſpel into theſe miſerable enormities both of practice and doctrine. It is not for me to iudge them; that, I leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that high and awfull Tribunall, before which I ſhall once appeare with them; but this I dare ſay, that if that righteous Iudge ſhall puniſh either their obſtinacie, or relapſes with eternall damnation, he cannot but bee iuſtified in his iudgements, whiles in the midſt of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ſhall bee forced to ſay, <hi>Thou,</hi>
