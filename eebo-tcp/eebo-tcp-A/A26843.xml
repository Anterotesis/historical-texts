            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Order from the Houſe of Commons for the ſuppreſsing of Pamphlets.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Parliament haveing maturely conſidered of the manifold lyes, and ementitious Pamphlets, that have beene publiſhed to the great ignominy and diſhonour of the State, did appoint a ſelect <hi>Committee</hi> for the reſtraint of all Libells: And ordered, that all lying Pamphlets ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and nothing Printed without Licence.</p>
            <p>The temporizing Poets have broached ſuch impudent ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, and ementitious Pamphlets out of the inexhauſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their roving fancies, that the whole City is embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with nothing but incredible lyes; that jars ſo much in the wearied eares of the World, that the ſcarce-breathing mandrake could not digeſt the ſame. Theſe Needy-braines to purchaſe ſome commodious vailes from the foamy vapour of a ſcurrilous humour, did ſtrive to ſet their unconcocted wits to the higheſt pin, that lying and Non-ſence were the two coincedant twins, that alway diſtilled from the naſty dregs of their Satyricall quills. One of theſe Poeticall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, though he was a <hi>Night-Walker,</hi> and in nocturnall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note n="*" place="margin">A Poet.</note> once eſcaped the Counter, and another time Newgate yet he was the Arch-conduct of their harſh-tuned Chorus: another did <hi>Bray</hi> like an Aſſe, and became his Secondary, and although he yeelded the precedency to the former (for he <note n="*" place="margin">Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.</note> was the moſt lying knave) yet he was not ſo nihilate a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, but that he challenged the ſecond place in an Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall <note n="*" place="margin">Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poet</note> order to himſelfe: Another <hi>Harberd</hi> his froathy Muſe

in the Rheumaticke exhalations of muddy taplaſh, which made his fancy ſo extreamly dull, that when he writ any thing, every <hi>What lack you Sir,</hi> or Stationers Apprentice could conceive it to be <hi>Harberts</hi> Lye. Thus theſe three, like Triple-headed <hi>Cerberus,</hi> nurſed their viperous muſes in <hi>Acharon,</hi> and fomented them in <hi>Stygian</hi> gall, greedily byting the fame of every Delinquent, whom they will not permit onely to ſuffer quietly Parliamentary Juſtice, but they alſo will nettle them afreſh with their gooſequil cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Since the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> death, there have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred lying Pamphlets printed to my credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enumeration.

Oh what a lamentable thing it is to ſuffer the ſentence of ſuch penurious, pennileſſe wits, who wholly reſolve their inke to gall, for a little mercenary gaine: or to purchaſe a paire of decayed Trouzes at the ſecond hand, to cover their nakedneſſe: whoſe lying Libels are woven up in braine-ſick fancies. Well! Poets draw ſubmiſſively nearer: and with an humble attentive eare attend the delivery of my definite advice unto you: Be Penitentiall, and give a ſerious recantation to the world for all your lying Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and confeſſe all your infamous abuſes to the State: yee had better I ſay confeſſe ſo, then at the Gall-houſe: this is my advice, which if you will embrace, I know it would give more ſatisfaction to the Spectacle of the World.</p>
