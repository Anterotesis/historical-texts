            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the ſupreme Authority the Parliament of the
Common-wealth of ENGLAND;
Some Conſiderations about the Exciſe of 4 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> per Barrell upon
SOPE, humbly offered by the <hi>Sope-makers</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who lately
preſented their Petition to your Honors.</head>
            <p>I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the laying Exciſe upon Sope, is a requiring Exciſe for the labor of their
hands, they having paid Exciſe before for their Potaſhes, Oyl and Tallow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the materials whereof they make their Soap, and it hath been always
reputed of ill conſequence to diſcourage Labour and induſtry by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the profit that the Labourer expects.</p>
            <p>II. That the Sope-makers pay Exciſe for a Contingency, a certain profit to the State out
of their probable hopes that they ſhall make ſome profit of their Labour; ſo that after they
have made their Sope, if the price of their Materials fall (as is ordinary) they then pay Exciſe
only becauſe they have taken pains; for they loſe by their Sope; and beſides, they run no
ſmall hazard in their Boyling their Sope, which makes their profit the more uncertain.</p>
            <p>III. The Sopemakers have harder meaſure (in paying Exciſe both for their Materials, and
their Sope) then moſt of the Tradeſmen of the Common-wealth: moſt that pay Exciſe for
their Materials, have the benefit to themſelves of their own Art and Induſtry, in changing
thoſe Materials into other forms: Now certainly, 'tis Juſtice and beſt Policy to lay the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
of charge upon the people, in ſuch a way, that all men may equally bear their proportion</p>
            <p>IV. 'Tis almoſt impoſſible to impoſe the Exciſe upon Sope equally upon all Sopemakers,
becauſe near half the Sope that's now made is boyled in Holes and Corners in ſmall Panns, for
which no Exciſe is paid; and ſo the burthen lies only upon the moſt viſible Traders, whoſe
places of Boyling are known and always open; and hereby thoſe Sopemakers that bear the
greateſt ſhare in other Publick payments, have their Trades ſpoiled by thoſe that pay little or
none. And this was thought a good ground to take off the greateſt part of the Exciſe of Gold
and Silver Wyer, for that it was drawn in holes, and little Exciſe paid for it by moſt.</p>
            <p>V. The Exciſe of 4 <hi>s. 8 d. per</hi> Barrell upon Sope, is a gain ſo great to thoſe that can Boyle
privately, and ſteal it, that 'tis worth the coſt to erect privat boyling Pans wherby they will
be more in uſe daily, and the Exciſe be no conſiderable advantage to the State, though a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to ſome that have faithfully ſerved them; and thus it appeared in the Caſe of the
Refiners of Gold and Silver, that two Thirds of the Exciſe of Gold and Silver Wyer being
taken off, there would be more money advanced by it to the State then was before.</p>
            <p>VI. That ſince the Exciſe of Sope was raiſed from 3 <hi>s. per</hi> Barrel unto 4 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> the Revenue
of it hath bin leſs then it was before; for now men will run more hazard to ſteal it, and now
the Trade of thoſe whoſe boyling is moſt viſible is decayed; and if this continue, will come to
nothing.</p>
            <p>VII. Sope is moſt neceſſary for all ſorts of people next to Victuals, and muſt be uſed by the
pooreſt people; and it hath been thought Juſtice and Policy to lay the burden of Exciſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch Commodities as the poor are leaſt neceſſitated to uſe, and not a double burthen
upon the moſt neceſſary Commodities.</p>
            <p>And though we deſire to preſerve the Trade of the Common-wealth and our ſelves, yet we
deſire not to diminiſh the Revenue of the Commonwealth in the Exciſe, and therefore
we humbly propoſe,</p>
            <p>That <hi>12d.</hi> per pound may be impoſed upon all the imported materials, whereof Sope is made;
whereby all that buy the materials, ſhall equally bear the burden, and thoſe whoſe names
are hereunto ſubſcribed wil ingage, that in caſe they or ſome of them, may be intruſted
to collect the Exciſe of thoſe imported materials, and have ſuch allowance per pound
therefore, as the Commiſſioners for Exciſe confeſs by their Certificate it coſts them, then
they will advance the Revenue of that Exciſe of the materials, to a value equal to what
hath bin advanced theſe two laſt years from the Exciſe, both of Sope &amp; the materials of it.</p>
            <p>Yet they begg not the Office, but humbly leave it to the wiſdome of the Commiſſioners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
therein, to imploy ſuch Officers as they think fit to Collect it, onely they propoſe
ſo to ingage to ſecure the Parliament, that they ſhall ſuffer no prejudice in their Revenue,
by condeſcending to their juſt deſires in taking off the Exciſe of Sope, which they humbly
crave may be ſpeedily done for the Reaſons offered.</p>
