            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The noble Character which you do now so worthily bear, together with the more last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:66109:3"/>
and inward Characters of Your Princely mind, did set me beyond doubting to whom this Address was to be made: For to whom is a vindication of the Authority and Laws of this Kingdom so due, as to <hi>Your Grace,</hi> to whom <hi>His Majesty</hi> hath by a Royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, committed the administration of Affairs among us; and under whose wise and happy conduct, we have enjoyed so long a tract of uninterrupted tranquillity? But it is not only Your illustrious quality that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles You to this Dedication. No, <hi>Great Prince,</hi> greater in Your mind, than by Your fortune; there is somewhat more inward to You, than the gifts of fortune; which, as it proues her not blind in this instance, so commands all the respect can be payed <hi>Your Grace,</hi> by such who are honoured with so much knowledg of You, as hath fallen to the happy share of Your poorest servant.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>My Lord,</hi> since all I can say either of the vast endowments of Your Mind, or of the particular engagements I lie under to honour You, must needs fall short of my
<pb facs="tcp:66109:3"/>
sense of both; and what is just to be said, is not fit for me to express; the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of flattery being as unpleasant to You, as unbecoming one of my Station: I must quit this Theme, which is too great for me to manage; and only add, that I know Your understanding, in such debates as are here managed, to be so profound, and your judgment so well balanced, that as You deservedly pass for a Master in all learning; so, if these Sheets be so happy as to be well accounted of by You, I shall the less value or apprehend the snarlings of all Censurers. I pretend not by prefixing so great a Name to these Conferences, to be secure from Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by <hi>Your Patrociny,</hi> since these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all Order and Authority (with whom I deal) will rather be provoked from that, to lash me with the more severity.</p>
            <p>I shall not to this add my poor thoughts of what this time and the tempers of those with whom we deal, seems to call for, since by so doing, I should become more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous than <hi>Phormio</hi> was, when he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

It is from <hi>Your Graces</hi> deep judgment and great experience, that we all expect and long for a happy settlement, wherein that success and blessings may attend Your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, shall be prayed for more earnestly by none alive, than by,</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW sad, but how full a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary doth the age we live in, give on these words of our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to send fire on the earth: suppose you that I am come to give peace on the earth; I tell you, nay; but rather division: for from henceforth there shall be five in one house di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi> Do we not see the Father divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Son, and the Son against the Father, and engaging into such angry heats and mortal feuds, upon colors of Religion, as if the seed of the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> like <hi>Cadmus</hi> teeth, had spawned a generation of cruel and bloud-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty men: But how surprizing is the Wonder, when Religion becomes the pretence, and seems to give the rise to these animosities, since the wisdom and goodness of <hi>GOD</hi> hath devised no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more proper and powerful for over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the secret passions of the mind, and for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb facs="tcp:66109:5"/>
of all boisterous disorders? The Doctrine delivered by our meek and lowly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, teacheth us the great Lessons of humility, of self-diffidence, and self-contempt, guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the undervaluing of others, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of our selves, gives check to wrath, anger, emulation and envy; hatred and malice, railing and censuring: And in a word, designs the moulding our natures into a conformity with its blessed Author: who when he was reviled, reviled not again; but practised without a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, those great Lessons he taught his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, of doing good for evil, loving his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and praying for such as despitefully used him. But how far have we fallen from that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pattern? And how is the serene and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able visage of Christianity transformed into a sour cankered and surly temper, as if that which obliged us to love all men, should engage us to look morose on all but a handful of a party: and that which should dilate our love to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is given for a ground of contracting it to a few as ill natured as our selves.</p>
            <p>Is there not a generation among us who high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly value themselves, and all of their own form? but whoso differs from them, is sure of their fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest spite, and bitterest Censures. Are the lives of such as differ from them vertuous, then they say they are good moral men: But, alas! they
<pb facs="tcp:66109:5"/>
know not what it is to be spiritual. Again, are they devout and grave, then they are called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick people, Juglers, or Papists. And if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be fastened on them, the charge of hypocrisie is the last shift of malice: Or if they have been guilty of any failings and mistakes, they are so far from covering or disguising of them; that on the contrary, the relating, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating, and the commenting on these, is the main subject of all their discourses. And if they go on a Visit, the first Civilities are scarce over, when these Stories (true or false, all is to one purpose) come to make up their conversation. Who can have the least tincture of the Christian Spirit, and look on without sad regrates, and see this bitter, fierce, and cruel venom poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the several <hi>Sects</hi> and divisions of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? The root and spring whereof is no other than a carnal, proud, and unmortified temper: for few are so Atheistical, but they desire to pass, both in their own account, and in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others, for good Christians: but when they find how hard a thing it is to be a Christian indeed, and that they must mortifie all their carnal appetites, their fierce passions, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of pride, despise the world, and be resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things to the Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> before they can deserve that noble Character, then they pursue another method more grateful to their
<pb facs="tcp:66109:6"/>
corrupt minds, which is to list themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a party, to cherish and value the Heads and Leaders of it, and to divide their kindness to all of their stamp: they stifly adhere to the forms, and maintain all the humors and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Party to which they have associated themselves, and they whet their Spirits and sharpen their Tongues against all of another mould, which some do with an undisguised fierceness: Other with a visage of more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, by which they give the deeper wounds. What sad effects flow from this Spirit is too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and I love not to play the Diviner, or to presage all the mischief it threatens: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that the great business of Religion lies under an universal neglect, while every one looks more abroad on his Neighbor, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly on himself; and all st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy more the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a Party, than the true interest of Religion.</p>
            <p>I deny not but zeal for <hi>GOD</hi> must appear, when we see indignities done to his holy Name, in a just indignation at these who so dishonour him; but what relation have little small diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about matters which have no tendency for advancing the Image of <hi>GOD</hi> in our Souls, to that; since both sides of the debate may be well maintained without the least indignity done to <hi>GOD,</hi> or his holy Gospel? What
<pb facs="tcp:66109:6"/>
opposition to the Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> or what harm to Souls can flow from so innocent a practice, as the fixing some Churchmen over others, for observing, directing, reproving, and coerc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rest, that this should occasion such endless brawlings, and such hot contentions? But supposing the grounds of our divisions, as great as any angry Disputer can imagine them, then certainly our zeal for them should be tempered, according to the Rules and Spirit of the Gospel. Is it a Christian temper that our spirits should boil with rage against all of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persuasion, so that we cannot think of them without secret commotions of anger and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, which breaks often out into four looks, ridiculous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When we see any endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Souls by erroneous Opinions, or bad practices, had we the divine Spirit in us, it would set us to our secret mournings for them: our hearts would melt in compassion towards them, and not burn in rage against them: and we would attempt for their recovery, and not contrive their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:66109:7"/>
which none can have interest, or union, but such as dwell and abide in Love: but the other bears on it the lively signature of him that was a murderer from the beginning: and all that is mischievous or cruel, is of that evil one, and tends to the subversion of mankind; as well as the ruin of true Religion.</p>
            <p>Another great Rule by which the Peace and Order of all human Societies is maintained and advanced, is obedience to the Laws, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Authority of these whom <hi>GOD</hi> hath set over us, to govern and defend us; to whose Commands if absolute Obedience be not payed, ever till they contradict the Laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> there can be neither peace nor order among men, as long as every one prefers his own humour or inclination to the Laws of the Society in which he lives. Now it cannot be denied to be one of the sins of the age we live in, that small regard is had to that authority <hi>GOD</hi> hath committed to his Vicegerents on earth: The evidence whereof is palpable, since the bending or slackening of the execution of Laws is made the measure of most mens Obedience, and not the conscience of that duty we owe the commands of our Rulers: for what is more servile and unbecoming a man, not to say a Christian, than to yield Obedience when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by force; and to leap from it when allured
<pb facs="tcp:66109:7"/>
by gentler methods? If Generosity were our principle, we should be sooner vanquished by the one, than cudgelled by the other: Or if Conscience acted us, the Obligation of the Law would equally bind, whether backed with a strict Execution, or slackened into more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Hence it appears how few there are who judg themselves bound to pay that reverence to the Persons, and that Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of these <hi>GOD</hi> hath vested with his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which the Laws of Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do exact. And the root of all this disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and contempt, can be no other, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and ungoverned pride, which disdains to submit to others, and exalts it self above these who are called Gods. The humble are tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obedient; but the self willed are stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and rebellious. Yet the height of many mens pride rests not in a bare disobedience, but designs the subverting of Thrones, and the shaking of Kingdoms, unless governed by their own measures.</p>
            <p>Among all the Heresies this age hath spawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is not one more contrary to the whole design of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more destructive of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than is that bloudy Opinion of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion by Arms, and of forcible resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the colour of preserving Religion. The wisdom of that Policy is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

and devillish, favoring of a carnal unmortified and impatient mind, that cannot bear the Cross, nor trust to the Providence of <hi>GOD:</hi> and yet with how much zeal is this doctrine maintained and propagated, as if on it hung both the Law and the Prophets? Neither is the zeal used for its defence only meant for the vindicating of what is past, but on purpose advanced for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the same Tragedies: which some late vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous attempts have too clearly discovered, some of these black Arts (tho written in white) being by a happy providence of <hi>GOD</hi> (by the intercepting of <hi>R.

            <p>Indeed the consideration of these evils should call on all to reflect on the sad posture wherein we are, and the evident signatures of the Divine displeasure under which we l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o turn to <hi>GOD</hi> with our whole hearts; every one repenting of the works of his hands, and contributing his prayers and endeavours for a more general Reformation. It is not by Political Arts, nor by the execution of penal Laws, that the power of Religion can be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb facs="tcp:66109:8"/>
from these decays, under which it hath so long suffered. No, no, we must consider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have provoked <hi>GOD</hi> to chastise us in this fashion, by letting loose among us a Spirit of uncharitableness, giddiness, cruelty and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And the progress of these and other great evils, we ought to charge on our own faultiness, who have provoked <hi>GOD</hi> to plead a Controversie with us in so severe a manner. This is the method we ought to follow, which if we did, we might sooner look for the Divine protection and assistance: and then we should experience it to be better to put our confidence in <hi>GOD,</hi> than to put our confidence in men.</p>
            <p>Indeed surh a Reformation of our lives and hearts, would more strongly plead our cause, and advance our interest, than the most learned Disputes, or the severest Laws, tho followed with a most vigorous execution: Let us not therefore repine at the contempt we lie under, or the hazard we are exposed to; nor complain of the non-execution of Laws; but let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine wherein we have walked contrary to the Laws of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in his Gospel, by which we have provoked <hi>GOD</hi> to render us base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible before the people. In a word, till we condemn our selves more, and others less, and think more of reforming our selves, and less of punishing others, we look not like proper

Objects of Mercy, or fit for a deliveranee.</p>
            <p>But I shall quit this purpose to give some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the following Conferences. Some years ago, a small <hi>Book of Dialogues betwixt the Conformist and Nonconformist</hi> was published, and received with the general applause and good liking of all, who were so far unprepossessed as to consider the plain and simple reasonings were there laid open; but presently all the mouths of the enraged Zealots were set a yelping and snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at it, and at its suspected Author: some laughed at it, others despised it, and all of them were angry: some threatned a speedy answer, others doubting of the performance, said, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served none. At length divers Pens were said to have undertaken the Task; but in end we had an answer from <hi>beyond Sea</hi> to it, which was received with an universal shout of victory and triumph: the Answerer acting his part with so much confidence, and edging his smatterings with so much bitterness, as if he had engaged with a compound of Ignorance and Atheism. At first reading I could not but pity one who triumphed so confidently with so little reason, and regrate the bitterness of his spirit, who belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up gall and wormwood upon every occasion. Yet in some matters of fact and History, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but his confidence made me imagine truth might be on his side; but when I examined
<pb facs="tcp:66109:9"/>
things from their Fountains, I know not wha verdict to pass on him, who fell in so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and stumbled at every step. Most of his errors I imputed to his second-hand reading, for he seems to have risen no higher in his learning than the reading of <hi>Pamphlets:</hi> and it is like, hath that quarrel with <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that there is not a forty year old Author in his Closet; and so much is he beholden to the labours of others, that if one unplume him of what is borrowed, nothing will remain but scoldings, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense. For when he meets with anything out of the <hi>Road,</hi> it is not unpleasant to see how brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illied he is; and so unequal in his stile, that sometimes he flies high on borrowed wings, and immediately he halts and crawls when on his own legs. I was not soon resolved whether such a <hi>Scribler</hi> deserved an Answer, since all he said that was material, had both been printed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered full often; yet the confidence of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the value which others, much about his own size of knowledg and modesty, did set on his labors, made me think it necessary to say a little more on these things, which were perhaps too overly glanced at by the <hi>Conformist</hi> in the <hi>Dialogues</hi>: and my interest in that Person secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me from apprehending his mistakes of my interposing in this quarrel; for indeed what he said was so far from being shaken by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:66109:10"/>
trifling Answer, that as a Person of great judgment and worth, said, <hi>No more pains was needful for refuting the Answer, but the reading over the Dialogues, whose strength remained en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire after all his attempts against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was doubtful what method to pursue in the following sheets, since I ever loathed the answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books by retail, as an endless and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less labor: for when should I have done, did I call him to account for all his incoherencies and impertinencies, and examine all his simpering distinctions, and whiffling answers? I resolved therefore at one dash to wave all that, and to examine the matters of greater and more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick concern, with that clearness of expression which befits such Subjects, and with so much brevity, as might not frighten away the more superficial Readers, nor surfeit the more labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Therefore I have not stayed to make good all the <hi>Conformists</hi> Opinions or arguments, hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these short <hi>Dialogues,</hi> but have left the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of them, and the Answers made to them, to the consideration of the unprejudged Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so have considered nothing of what he answers to the fifth and sixth <hi>Dialogues.</hi> To the fifth <hi>Dialogue,</hi> wherein set forms for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are pleaded for, he answers by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their lawfulness, arguing only against the imposing them; but this I meet with in my
<pb facs="tcp:66109:10"/>
second <hi>Conference,</hi> wherein I assert the binding Authority of Laws in all things lawful. And for his Answers to the sixth <hi>Dialogue,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me not, being made up of reflections: It is true, to shew his Common place reading, he gives a long discourse of Justification, but to very little purpose, since upon the matter the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist</hi> differs nothing from him: And for the justifying or condemning some phrases or modes of speech, they are not worth the while to debate about them: All my quarrel at these long winded Common places, being, that by a pretence of making matters clearer, they dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them with a multiplicity of words, and an intricacy of phrases. And as this is justly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable on every head about which it is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so it is more particularly in the matter of Justification, which being the ground of our hope and joy, should be so cleared, that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, nor nicety get into our conceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. What then can be clearer than that <hi>GOD</hi> in consideration of his Sons sufferings, offers free pardon to all sinners, on the terms of their forsaking their sins, their accepting his mercy through his Son, and their obedience to the rules of his Gospel, which whosoever do, are actually in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sense on that head, I leave it with all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what reason there was for making such ado about it, or for charging him with so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy imputations. But he shrouds himself under his own innocency, and will patiently bear all the insultings and ungodly rage of that Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, without recriminating or answering him in his own style and dialect.</p>
            <p>I pursue the method of a <hi>Conference,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both more suitable to the purposes here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassed, and more agreeable to the <hi>Dialogues,</hi> only I furnish the Scene with more persons; and I am much mistaken if the Answerer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall have ground to accuse me of not laying out the strength of his reasonings faithfully, since upon every occasion I put in <hi>Isotimus</hi> his mouth the substance of his arguings, as far as I could reach them. But to make this unpleasant peace of contention go the more easily off, I have subjoyned to it an account of the form and rules of Church Government, as I found them to have been received in the first and purest ages of the Church: But I add no more for Preface to that work, since in the end of the last <hi>Conference</hi> enough is said for introduction to it.</p>
            <p>I have divided my work in four parts and <hi>Conferences:</hi> The first examines the opinion of resisting lawful Magistrates upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of defending Religion. The second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
<pb facs="tcp:66109:11"/>
the Authority of Laws, and the obedience due to them, together with the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in matters Ecclesiastical. The third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines the spirit that acted during the late times and Wars, and continues yet to divide us by Schism and faction. And the fourth examines the lawfulness and usefulness of Episcopacy.</p>
            <p>I must now release my Reader from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay this <hi>Introduction</hi> may have occasioned him, without the usual formality of <hi>Apologies,</hi> for the defects the following papers are guilty of, since I know these generally prevail but little for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they desire: but shall only say, that this morose way of writing, by engaging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Controversies,</hi> is as contrary to my <hi>Genius</hi> as to any mans alive: For I know well how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle such writings prevail for convincing of any, and that by them the most part are rather har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened into more wilfulness, and exasperated into more bitterness: Yet for this once I was prevailed on to do violence to my own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by this <hi>Patrociny</hi> of the authority and laws of that Church and Kingdom wherein I live.</p>
            <p>I am so far from thinking my self concerned to make Apology for the slowness of this Piece its appearance in publick, that I encline rather to make excuses for its coming abroad too soon. That it was ready near a twelve-month ago, can be witnessed by many who then saw it. Yet I
<pb facs="tcp:66109:12"/>
was willing to let it lye some time by me, and my aversion from the motions of the Press, put it often under debate with me whether I should stifle it, or give it vent: at length I yielded to the frequent importunities of my friends who assaulted me from all hands, and told me how much it was longed for, and what insultings were made upon the delay of its publication.</p>
            <p>And by what is near the end of the third <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> it will appear that it was written before the discovery of these who had robbed and wounded the Ministers in the West of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I let what is there said continue as it was written, before the discovery, but shall add somewhat here. In <hi>September</hi> last, after a new robbery had been committed on another conformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, whose actors no search could discover; some few days had not passed over, when by a strange Providence one of them was catched on another account by a brave Soldier, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seized, such indications of his accession to the robbery were found about him, that he to prevent torture, confessed not only his own guilt, but discovered a great many more: most of them escaped, yet three were taken, and had Justice done on them, with him who had been their chief Leader: and who continued to cant it out highly after he got his Sentence, talking of his blood as innocently shed, and
<pb facs="tcp:66109:12"/>
railing against the Prelats and Curats; though before Sentence he was basely sordid, as any could be. One of his complices who died with more sense, acknowledged, when he spake his last words, that bitter zeal had prompted him to that villany, and not covetousness, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of robbing their goods. Yet I shall not conceal what I was a witness to, when a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Presbyterian perswasion being with them (for two of them would willingly admit of none that were Episcopal) after he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pains to convince the chief Robber of the atro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iousness of his crimes, which was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asie task, he charged him to discover if either Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, or Ministers, had prompted or cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in it, or been conscious to his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these robberies, he cleared all, except a few particular and mean persons who went sharers with him. And by this fair and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous procedure, the Reader may judge how far the Author is from a design of lodging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy on these who differ from him, when of his own accord he offers a testimony for their vindication. But I shall leave this purpose, and the further prefacing at once.</p>
            <p>If my poor labors be blessed with any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of success, I humbly offer up the praise of it to him f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om whom I derive all I have, and to whom I owe the praise of all I can do. But if
<pb facs="tcp:66109:13"/>
these attempts bring forth none of the wished<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for effects, I shall have this satisfaction, that I have sincerely and seriously studied the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passions, and the clearing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of these among whom I live: so that more lyes not on me, but to follow my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with my most earnest prayers, that the <hi>GOD</hi> of Peace may in this our day, cause us discern and consider these things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our Peace.</p>

            <p>THe first Conference examines the origine and power of Magistracy, and whether Subjects may by arms resist their Sovereigns on the account, or pretence of defending Religion against Tyranny, and unjust oppression? And whether the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> be a Sovereign Prince, or limited, so that he may be called to account, and coerced by force?</p>
            <p>The second examines the nature of humane Laws, and of the obedience due to them, and the Civil Magistrates Right of enacting Laws in matters Ecclesiastical.</p>

unconcerned in what befals the Church of GOD, as never to look after it: but you are much wronged, if notwithstanding all your seeming abstraction, you be not deeper in the knowledge of Affairs than any of us: however since you expect News from me, I was just now reading some Books lately printed at <hi>Holland,</hi> and particularly an accurate and learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of these virulent <hi>Dialogues</hi> you were wont to magnifie so much: and it doth my heart good to see how he baffles the writer of them on every occasion; for he hath answered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word of them so well, and so home, that I believe we shall not see a reply in haste.</p>

               <p>I suppose we have all seen the Book, but it is like you are singular in your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it: I shall not deny its Author his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served praises: he hath been faithful in setting down most of the Arguments used in the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> and no less careful to gather together all the vulgar answers to them, and truly hath said as much as can be said for his Cause. Neither writes he without art; for when he is pinched, he drives off the Reader with a great many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary things, to make him forget the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and to gain a more easie assent to what he asserts. I confess his Stile is rugged and harsh, so that it was not without pain I wrestled through it: but of all I have seen, he hath fallen on the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66109:15"/>
surest way to gain an Applause from the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; for he acts the greatest Confidence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and rails at his Adversary with so much contempt, and malice, that he is sure to be thought well of, by these who judge of a man more by his voice, and the impresses of earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness, and passion he discovers, than by the weight of what he saith.</p>

Indeed I am amazed to see so much indiscretion and bitterness fall from any mans Pen who hath read S. <hi>Paul,</hi> condemning <hi>rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, evil surmisings, and perverse disputings.</hi>

But to deal freely with you, there were some Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in these <hi>Dialogues</hi> with which I was not well satisfied; but the whole of them had such a visage of Serenity, that I wonder how they are so accused. It is true the <hi>Conformijt</hi> deals ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly, and yet ere we part, I can perhaps satisfie you: he said but a little of what he might have said: But withal, remember how severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that was meekness it self, treated the <hi>Scribes</hi> and the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and he having charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Followers to beware of their leaven, it is obedience to his Command to search out that leaven, that it may leaven us no more. And when any of a Party are so exalted in their own conceit, as to despise and disparage all others, the love, Ministers of the Gospel owe the Souls of their Flocks, obligeth them to unmask them. As to these poor simple Reproaches that are cast on the Person of that Author, as they are known to be false and unjust, so they are done in a strain that seems equally void of Wit and Goodness.

               <p>I like your method well, and that we may follow it, consider (<hi>see pag.</hi> 20. <hi>of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and Ius populi all over</hi>) if their can be any thing more evident from the <hi>Laws of Nature, than that men ought to defend themselves, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly assaulted?</hi> And since the Law of Nature teacheth men not to murder themselves, it by the same force binds them to hinder another to do it, since he that doth not hinder another from committing a Crime, when it is in his power so to do, becomes guilty of the crime committed; he is then a self-murderer who doth not defend himself from unjust force. Besides, what is the end of all Societies, but mutual Protection?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66109:18"/>
Did not the People at first choose Princes for their Protection? Or do you imagine it was to satisfie the Pride and Cruelty of individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? It was then the end of Societies, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Peace might be maintain'd: so when this is inverted, the Subjects are again to resume their own conditional surrender, and to coerce the Magistrate, who, forgetful of the ends of his Authority, doth so corrupt it. And since the great design of man should be <hi>to serve GOD, and to worship him in spirit and in truth,</hi> this is to be preferred to all things else, as being of the greatest Importance. If then Magistrates, whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13.) calls <hi>the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men,</hi> or humane Creatures, do force there Subjects from the true Worship of GOD, they ought to be restrained, and the Cause of GOD must be maintained, notwithstanding their unjust Laws or cruel Tyranny.</p>

               <p>You have indeed put such colours on your Opinion, that I should be much shaken from mine, were not my persuasion well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But to examine what you have said, you must distinguish well betwixt the <hi>Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>the Rights or permissions of Nature</hi>: the first are unalterable Obligations, by which all men are bound, which can be reversed by no positive Law, and transgressed by no Person, upon no occasion: for the Law of Nature is the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66109:18"/>
Image of GOD yet remaining in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees on the Souls of men, and is nothing else save certain notions of Truth, impressed by GOD on the Souls of all men that enjoy the exercise of Reason. Now self-defence cannot be a Law of Nature, otherwise it could never be dispensed with without a Sin; nay, were a man never so criminal: For as in no case a man may kill himself, were he never so guilty; so by that reasoning of yours, he ought not to suffer himself to be killed, neither should any Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor submit to the Sentence of the Judge, but stand to his defence by all the force he could raise. And it will not serve turn, to say, that for the good of the Society he ought to submit; for no man must violate the Laws of Nature, were it on never so good a design: and since the utmost standard of our love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, is to love them as our selves, no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the good of others can oblige one to yield up his Life, if bound by the Law of Nature to defend it.</p>

               <speaker>Bas.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you for your remark, which was pertinent. But next, consider there are some <hi>rights or permissions of Nature,</hi> which are allowed us, but not required of us, as <hi>propriety of goods, marriage,</hi> and other such like things, which whose doth not pretend to, he cannot be said to violate the Laws of Nature, only for some great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er consideration he forgoes these Priviledges it allows. And take men out of a Society, I acknowledge forcible Resistance of any violent Assailant, to be one of the rights of Nature, which every man may make use of without a Fault, or dispense with likewise at his pleasure: But Societies being Associations of People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Head, who hath the power of Life and Death, that sets it beyond doubt, that the Head must only judge, when the Subjects do justly fore-seal their Lives or not: which before I go about to evince, I must remove that vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, of a Magistrate's deriving his power from the surrender of the People. None can surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they have not: take then a multitude of People not yet associated, none of them hath power of his own Life, neither hath he power of his Neighbors, since no man out of a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may kill another, were his Crime never so
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66109:19"/>
great, much less be his own murderer; and a multitude of People not yet associated, are but so many individual Persons; therefore the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sword is not from the People, nor any of their Delegation, but is from GOD.</p>

               <p>You will pardon me to tell you, that the People must give the power, since GOD did it never by a Voice from Heaven, or by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets command, except in some Instances among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> where even that was not done, but upon the previous desire of the People. And for what you say of the Peoples having no right to kill themselves, they only consent to submit to the Magistrates Sentence, when guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <p>This will then infallibly prove, that forcible self-defence cannot be a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only a Right; otherwise we could not thus dispense with it. But if though guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ought not to kill my self, neither can I so much as consent that another do it: Hence it is, that the original of <hi>Magistracy</hi> must be from GOD, who only can invest the <hi>Prince</hi> with the power of the Sword.</p>

               <p>Nay, a greater authority is <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. who saith, <hi>That the powers that were then, were ordained of GOD:</hi> which on the way saith strongly, for asserting the right of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, after some prescription, since if either we consider the power of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> over the world, or of their Emperours over them, both will be found to have no better title than Conquest, and yet they were ordained of GOD, and not to be resisted, but submitted to, under the hazard of <hi>resisting the Ordinance of GOD,</hi> and <hi>receiving of damnation,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 2.) And it is like, the sacredness of the <hi>Magistrates power,</hi> was a part of the traditional Religion conveyed from <hi>Noah</hi> to his posterity, as was the practice of extraordinary Sacrifices.</p>

               <p>It is not to be denied but a people may chase their own form of Government, and the persons in whose hands it shall be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited: and the Sovereignty is in their hands, of whom they do thus freely make choice: so that if they expressly agree, that any Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the power, by what name soever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, Kings, Lords, or whatever else, shall be accountable to them; in that case, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty lies in the major part of the people, and these Administrators are subject to them, as to the Supreme. But when it is agreed in whose hands the Sovereign power lies, and that it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66109:20"/>
not with the people; then if the people pretend to the sword, they invade GODS right, and that which he hath devolved on his Vicegerent. And as in marriage either of the parties make a free choice, but the Marriage-bond is of GOD, neither is it free for them afterwards to refile upon pretence of injuries, till that which GOD hath declared to be a breach of the bond, be committed by either party: so though the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Sovereign may be of the people, yet the tie of subjection is of GOD, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be shaken off, without we have express warrant from him. And according to your reasoning, one that hath made a bad choice in his marriage, may argue that marriage was intended for a help and comfort to man, and for propagation; therefore when these things are missed in a marriage, that voluntary contract may be refiled from; and all this will conclude as well to unty an ill chosen marriage, as to shake off a Sovereign.</p>

               <speaker>Philarch.</speaker>
               <p>To this reasoning I shall add what seems from rational conjectures, and such hints as we can expect of things at so great a distance from us, to have been the rise of Magistracy. We find no warrant to kill, no not for murder before the Floud, as appears from the instances of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Lamech,</hi> so no Magistracy appears to have been then: Yet from what GOD said
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66109:21"/>
to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.7. we see, <hi>the elder brother was to rule over the younger.</hi> But the want of Magistracy before the <hi>Flood,</hi> was perhaps none of the least occasions of the wickedness <hi>which was great up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth</hi>; but to <hi>Noah</hi> was the Law first given of punishing murder by death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. and he was undoubtedly cloathed with that power. So his eldest Son coming in his place by the right of representation, and being by the right of primogeniture asserted before the <hi>Flood</hi> to be over his Brethren, was cloathed with the same power, and so it should have descended by the order of Nature still to the first-born. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Families divided, and went over the world to people it, whereby the single jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one Emperor, could not serve the end of Government, especially in that rude time, in which none of these ways of correspondence, which after Ages have invented, were fallen upon. These Families did then, or at least by that Law of GOD of the elder Brothers power, ought to have been subject to the eldest of their several Families.</p>
               <p>And another rise of <hi>Magistracy,</hi> was the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of many who sold themselves to others that were Richer, and were in all Nations sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ect to them, both they and their children: and this was very early begun, for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family consisted of 318. persons, and the many little
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66109:21"/>
Kings at that time seem to have risen out of these Families: for the posterity of these ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were likewise under the Masters Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and these servants were by their Masters pleasure to live or lie; nor had they any right to resist this unjust force: But afterwards emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation was used, some dominion being still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: and it is highly probable, that from these numerous Families, did most of the little Kingdoms then in the world spring up; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the more aspiring came to pretend over others, and so great Empires rose by their Conquests.</p>

               <p>I know it is strongly pretended, that the state of servitude, or such a surrender of ones life, or liberty, as subjects it to the tyranny of another, is not lawful: but this will be found groundless: for though <hi>even the Law of GOD counted the servants a Man's money, so that he was not to be punished, though he had smitten them with a rod, so that they died, provided they lived a day or two after it, Exod.</hi> 21.20, 21. Yet in that dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation it was not unlawful to be a servant; nay, nor unlawful to continue in that state for ever, and not accept of the emancipation which was provided to them in <hi>the year of Iubily.</hi> Neither is this state declared unlawful under the Gospel, since <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Art thou called being a servant, care not for it: but if thou mayst be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66109:22"/>
free, use it rather:</hi> By which we see the Gospel doth not emancipate servants, but placeth that state among things which may be lawfully submitted to, though liberty be preferable.</p>

               <speaker>Basil.</speaker>
               <p>From this it may be well inferred, that if a Society have so intirely surrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they are in no better case than were the servants among the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the thing is not unlawful; nor can they make it void, or resume the freedom without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent whose servants they are: and as <hi>S.

It is true, in case the Magistrate be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or desert his right, or expose his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to the fury of others, the Laws and Sense of all Nations agree, that the States of the Land are to be the Administrators of the power, till he recover himself: But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Nebuchadn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am much deceived if these Instances do conclude for your design, since the utmost they can prove, is, that some share of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power lay in the hands of the People among the <hi>Iews</hi>; but that proves nothing: where by Law and Practice it is clear the power is wholly in the hands of Superior unaccountable Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. But that the Law of the King, or of punishing Idolaters was delivered to the People, proves not that they must execute it: For the Law of Sacrifices, and all the Temple worship was also delivered to them: but I hope you will not from that infer, that the People were to judge in these matters, or to give Laws to their Priests; neither will the Law, because addressed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66109:24"/>
to the People, prove themselves to be the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of it; otherwise the <hi>Epistle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> addressed <hi>to all the Saints in Corinth,</hi> will prove the People the <hi>Iudges of Excommunication,</hi> and <hi>of the Rules of Church-worship,</hi> which are there delivered: so that though the Law was directed to all the People, yet that proves not that every precept of it concerned all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that the whole of the Law was addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the whole People, and the respective parts of it, to all the individuals, according to their several stations: And after all this, you are to consider that some things were allowed by that Law to private Persons, which ought never to be made precedents: for the Law allowed the Friends of one that was killed by chance, to avenge the Blood on the Person that slew him, if he kept not within the City of Refuge: but that being a particular provision of their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and Municipal Law, will be no warrant for such revenge in other States.</p>

               <p>As for your instances, consider that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are set down in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that are undoubted faults, and yet so far are they from being taxed, that they rather seem to be applauded: so it is in the case of the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives lie,</hi> not to mention the <hi>Polygamy of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>; therefore it not being clear to us by what special warrants they acted, a Practice of that Dispensation will be no precedent to us. But for that of <hi>Libnah,</hi> it may be justly doubted if the <hi>Libnah</hi> there mentioned, be that City which was assigned to the <hi>Priests:</hi> for <hi>Numbers</hi> 33.20. we meet with a <hi>Libnah</hi> in the journyings of <hi>Israel</hi>; and both the <hi>Syriack</hi> and the <hi>Arabick version,</hi> have understood the place of that City; for they render it, the <hi>Idumeans that dwelt at Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi> But whatever be in this, the particle <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi> doth not always import the design of the doer: which if you examine the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> will be very clear; and I shall name but one place to satisfie you, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Elies sons hearkned not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</hi> But, I doubt not, you will confess this was not their motive to such diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: so this will import no more, but that GOD in his Providence permitted that revolt for a Punishment of <hi>Iehoram</hi>'s Apostasie: neither will fair Pretences justifie bad Actions:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66109:25"/>
so the utmost that place can prove, is, that they made that their pretence. But that their revolt could not be without they had also revolted from GOD, will appear from this, that the Priests were bound to give attendance by turns at the Temple, so none of them could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the King without their rejecting of GOD'S Service, as long as the King was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whither no doubt they would not have come during their revolt.</p>
               <p>As for your instance of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> I confess it is plain dealing, and you disclose the <hi>Mystery of defensive Arms</hi> that it is but lamely maintain'd, till the Doctrine of murdering of Kings be also asserted: And indeed your Friend by this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of his, hath done that Cause a prejudice, of which many are sufficiently sensible; for this was a secret Doctrine to be instilled in corners, in the hearts of Disciples duly prepared for it, but not to be owned to the World: For if that place prove any thing, it will prove that when a King turns from following the LORD, his Subjects may conspire and slay him; how this would take among the <hi>Fifth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>Monarchy Men,</hi> I know not; but I am sure it will be abhorred by all <hi>Protestants:</hi> and particularly by these who made it an Article of their Confession of Faith, That infidelity or difference of Religion, doth not make void the Magistrates just power:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66109:25"/>
Therefore this being a direct Breach of both fifth and sixth Commands, though it be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marked as condemned, nor punished in that short account there given, yet it will never warrant the resisting the Ordinance of GOD, upon which GOD hath entailed Damnation. And whereas your Friend alledgeth the justice of this may be evinced from Scripture, it shews that in his Judgment, not only Tyranny, but the turning from following GOD, is a just cause for conspiring against, and killing of Kings: But I cannot see where he finds what the cause of this Conspiracy was, since the Text taxeth only the time, but not the cause of it.</p>
               <p>And for the instance of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> the Priests indeed withstood him, as they ought to have done, as the Ministers of the Gospel ought yet to do, if a King would go and consecrate the LORD'S Supper: but their withstanding of that, imports no violent Opposition; the strict signification of the word being only, that they <hi>placed themselves over against him,</hi> and so it is rendered by the <hi>LXX. Interpreters</hi>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>that S.</hi> Paul <hi>withstood S.</hi> Peter <hi>to his face, Gal.</hi> 2.11. Yet I do not apprehend you will suspect he used force. As for what follows, that the Priests <hi>did thrust him out,</hi> it will not prove they laid hands on him, that word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying only, <hi>that they made him haste out of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66109:26"/>
Temple</hi>: and is the same word which <hi>Esther</hi> 6.14. is rendered, <hi>hasted,</hi> where none will think that the Chamberlains laid violent hands on <hi>Haman:</hi> so all that the Priests did, was to charge <hi>Uzziah,</hi> when his Leprosie appeared, to get him quickly out of the Temple: and some Copies of the <hi>LXX.</hi> have it so rendered: and the following words shew there was no need of using force, since himself made haste. And for the word rendered <hi>valiant,</hi> or <hi>sons of valor,</hi> that word is not always taken for <hi>valor,</hi> but sometimes for <hi>activity</hi>; so <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.6. sometimes for <hi>riches,</hi> so <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.1. It is also rendered <hi>wealth, Gen.</hi> 34.29. so this will not prove that <hi>Azariah</hi> made choice of these men for the strength of their Body, but for the Resolution of their Mind, that they might stoutly contradict <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi>; and thus you have drawn a great deal more f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides any King that would murder his eldest Son and heir of his Crown upon so bare a pretence, after he had signalized his courage so notably, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did, may well be looked upon as one that is furious; and so the holding of his hands, is very far different from the case of defensive Arms.</p>

               <p>Many things meet in this instance to take away any colour of an argument might be drawn from it: for <hi>David</hi> was by GODS command designed successor to the Crown, and so was no ordinary Subject.

smote him when he cut off the hem of his garment,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4, 5. This was not like some you know of, who set Guards about their King (for the security of his Person forsooth) when he had trusted himself into their hands. And it is very doubtful if <hi>David</hi>'s gathering that force about him was lawful; for these who came to him were naughty Men, and discontented and broken with debt; whereas had that been a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable practice, it is like he should have had another kind of following. And his offering his service to the <hi>Philistins,</hi> who were Enemies to GOD, to fight for them against the people of GOD, is a thing which can admit of no excuse. But after all this, if the actions even of renowned Persons in the Old Dispensation be Precedents, you may adduce the instances of <hi>Ehud,</hi> to prove that we may secretly assassinate a Tyrant; and of <hi>Iael,</hi> to prove that after we have offered protection to one who upon that trusts to us, we may secretly murder him.</p>

               <p>If you will read the account of that action given by <hi>Moses,</hi> it will clear you of all your mistakes: since <hi>Phinehas</hi> had the warrant of the Magistrate for all he did; for <hi>Moses</hi> being then the Person in whose hands the Civil Power was committed by GOD, did say to the Judges of <hi>Israel, Numb.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Slay ye every one his men that were joyned to Baal Peor.</hi> Now that <hi>Phinehas</hi> was a Judg in <hi>Israel</hi> at that time, is not to be doubted; for <hi>Eleazer</hi> was then High Priest, and by that means exempted from that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which when his Father <hi>Aaron</hi> lived, was in his hand, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.32. and he being now in his Fathers place, there is no ground to doubt but <hi>Phinehas</hi> was also in his, and so as one of the Judges, he had received command from <hi>Moses</hi> to execute judgment on these impure Idolaters, which he did with so much noble zeal, that the Plague was stayed, and <hi>GOD'S</hi> wrath turned away. But if this conclude a Precedent, it will prove too much, both that a Church-man may execute judgment, and that a private person in the sight of a holy Magistrate, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66109:29"/>
for his Justice, may go and punish Crimes. From the instances adduced, it will appear how <hi>Zealots</hi> were ordinarily raised up in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation: But when two of CHRISTS Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples lay claim to that priviledg of praying for fire from heaven, he gives check to the fervor of their thundring zeal, and tells them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55, 56. <hi>You know not what spirit you are of</hi>: adding, that <hi>the Son of man was not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them:</hi> whereby he shews that tho in the Old Dispensation, <hi>GOD</hi> having by his own command given his people a title to invade the Nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and extirpate them, having also given them Political Laws for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice, and order among them, it was proper for that time that <hi>GOD</hi> should raise up Judges to work extraordinary deliverances to his People, whose Example we are not now to imitate: <hi>GOD</hi> also sent Prophets, who had it sometimes in Commission to execute Justice on Transgressors; yet in the New Dispensation, these things were not to take place, where we have no temporal <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor Judicial Laws given us; and consequently none are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily called in the Name of <hi>GOD,</hi> to inflict ordinary and corporal punishments.</p>
               <p>Having said all this, it will be no hard task to make it appear that <hi>Mattathias</hi> was a Person extraordinarily raised up by <hi>GOD,</hi> as were the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66109:29"/>
                  <hi>Iudges.</hi> And though no mention of that be made, neither by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> nor the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that is not to be stood upon; for we have many of the Judges of <hi>Israel,</hi> of whose call no account is given, and yet undoubtedly they were warranted to act as they did, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had been Invaders. But if that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Mattathias</hi> conclude any thing by way of Precedent, it will prove that Church-men may invade the Magistrates Office, and kill his Officers, and raise War against him.</p>

                  <hi>Ieroboam</hi> being by the same authority design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King over the ten Tribes by the mouth of <hi>Ahijab</hi> in the name of <hi>GOD,</hi> 1 Kings 11. <hi>Ch.</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 28. he derived his Title from that: and there was as good warrants for the people to reject <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and follow him, as was formerly to quite <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> and follow <hi>David.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66109:30"/>
sentenced to death, <hi>That evil might be put away from Israel, whereby the people might hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.</hi> This shews that absolute Submission was due to the Judges, under the pain of death; whereby all private mens judging of their Sentence is struck out. It is true the other Laws that prefer the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of GOD to the Laws of men, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily suppose the exception of unlawful Commands: but since no Law warrants the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting their Sentence, it will clearly follow that absolute Submission was due to these Judges.</p>

               <p>Truly these things as they seem to be well made out from Scripture, so they stand with Reason, since no order can be expected among men, unless there be an uncontrollable Tribunal on Earth. Our Consciences are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only within GOD'S Jurisdiction: but if there be not a Supreme Power to cognosce and determine about our Actions, there must follow endless Confusions, when any number of People can be got to mutiny against Laws: therefore there must be a Supreme Court. But the Laws and settled Practices of Kingdoms, must determine in whose Person this lies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a single Person, the Nobility, or the Major part of the People?

               <p>If you urge this too much, then must I answer, that by the same Consequence you may prove we must cast our selves on dangers, and not flee from them: since we find CHRIST going up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> though he knew what was abiding him there: neither did he fly, which yet himself allowed.

               <p>I must confess my self amazed at this Answer, when I find S. <hi>Peter</hi> saving expresly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>That CHRIST suffered, leaving us an example that we might follow his steps,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this to the very Case of suffering wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and that notwithstanding of that, you should study to pervert the Scripture so grosly besides: consider that CHRIST was <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all righteousness</hi>; if then the Laws of Nature exact our defence in case of unjust Persecution for Religion, he was bound to that Law as well as we; <hi>For he came not to destroy, but to fulfil the Law,</hi> both by his Example and Precepts.

               <p>You suppose a Case not like to fall out in haste; but were it real, that Invader having no Title to that peoples obedience, they may make use of the right of Nature which allows to one out of a Society forcible self-defence, if violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted: and therefore such hostile invasion, be it upon what pretence soever, may be as lawfully resisted, as one private Man may resist another in his own defence, if he threaten to kill
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66109:37"/>
him, unless he renounce GOD. If then one Man may resist another, so may more men resist a great force coming against them: for to us who live here, the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> is but a fellow of our nature, and hath no right over us, no more than one private person hath over his Neighbour. And if you do not acknowledg a great difference betwixt such an asserting of our Liberties, from one that hath no Title to them, and the resisting of a lawful Magistrate, though unjustly persecuting his Subjects, you must be set to your horned book again.</p>

               <p>But at least you will confess that private Men living in a settled Society, have no title to the Sword, according to your Principles; must we then yield out Throats to a Robber that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults us on the High way? Or to come nearer you, if one threaten to kill us. if we yield not to their Religion, must we give way to their fury?</p>

intire, so that a private person may claim it or not, as he will: and therefore in the case of such an Aggressor, the Laws of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do warrant me to use force when assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet if a greater consideration appear, and it be evident that my giving way to such unjust force will be more for the honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, if I resist, I do not sin, but do well; but if I resist not, certainly I do better.</p>

               <p>I have been a witness to this Discourse, not without much pleasure, and do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg my self fully convinced of the necessity of obedience, and submission to the Supreme Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, since without that be once established, as the foundation of Societies, I see not what peace or order can be looked for, but every one will take on him to judg the Law-giver: and if he have so much power or policy as to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will never want pretences, chiefly about Religion, considering in how many various opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the Christian world hath divided about it. And it is a poor Answer to say, it must be the true Religion that we should defend, since it is to be supposed every one judgeth the Religion he is of to be the true one: If then according to that Doctrine, Religion be to be defended; certainly though the Religion be wrong, yet every one oppressed in his Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

defend it; since even an erring conscience doth at least tie, if not oblige. For the common reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Casuists</hi> being that a Man under an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Conscience, is yet to follow its dictates, though he sin by so doing: then all parties that are oppressed, ought to vindicate what they judg to be the truth of GOD. And by this you may see to what a fair pass the peace of mankind is brought by these Opinions.</p>

               <p>Yet I need not add what hath been often said, that it is not the name of a King, or the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a Coronation, that cloaths one with the Sovereign Power; since I know there are, and have been titular Kings, who are indeed but the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66109:38"/>
first Persons of the State, and only Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Laws, the Sovereign Power lying in some Assembly of the Nobility, and States, to whom they are accountable. In which Case, that Court to whom these Kings must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is the Supreme Judicatory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the King is but a Subject.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Isot.</speaker>
               <p>But doth not the Coronation of a King, together with his Oath given, and the consent of the People demanded at it, prove him to have his Power upon the Conditions in that Oath? And these Oaths being mutually given, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath first, and the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance next, do shew it is a Compact; and in all mutual Agreements, the nature of Compacts is, that the one party breaking, the other is also free. Further, Kings who are tied up, so that they cannot make, nor repeal Laws, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Taxes without the consent of the States of their Kingdom, shew their Power to be limited, and that at least such Assemblies of the States share with them in the Sovereign Power, which is at large made out by <hi>Ius populi.</hi>

               <p>It is certain there cannot be two co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Powers in a Kingdom; for no man can serve two Masters: therefore such an Assembly of the States must either be Sovereign or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for a middle there is not. As for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of Princes, it is like enough that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

first it was the formal giving their Power to them; and the old Ceremonies yet observ'd in it, prove it hath been at first so among us: But it being a thing clear in our Law, that the King never dies, his Heir coming in his place the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment he expires, so that he is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his Coronation, as well as after; and that the Coronation is nothing but the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn inaugurating in the Authority which the King possessed from his Father's death, shews, that any Ceremonies may be used in it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the original of them may have been, do not subject his Title to the Crown to the Peoples consent. And therefore his Coronation Oath is not the condition upon which he gets his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, since he possess'd that before; nor is it upon that Title that he exacts the Oath of Alegiance, which he likewise exacted before his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This being the practice of a Kingdom passed all Prescription, proves the Coronation to be no compact betwixt the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And therefore he is indeed bound by his Coronation Oath to <hi>God,</hi> who will be aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, if he break it, so the matter of it were lawful: but the breaking of it cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a prior Right he had to the Peoples Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And as for the limitations Kings have consented to pass on their own Power, that they may act nothing but in such a form of Law, these
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66109:39"/>
being either the King's free Concessions to the People, or restraints arising from some Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, which extorted such Priviledges, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove the King a Subject to such a Court, unless by the clear Laws and Practices of that Kingdom, it be so provided, that if he do mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, he may be punished; which when made appear, proves that Court to have the Sovereign Power: and that never weakens my design, that Subjects ought not to resist their Sovereign.</p>

               <p>You have dwelt, methinks, too long on this, though considering the nature of the thing, it deserves indeed an exact discussion: yet this whole Doctrine appears so clear to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mind, that I cannot imagine whence all the mist is raised about it can spring, except from the corrupt Passions or Lusts of men, which are subtle enough to invent excuses, and fair colors, for the blackest of Crimes. And the smoak of the bottomless pit may have its share, in occasioning the darkness is raised about that, which by the help of the light of <hi>God,</hi> or of reason, stands so clear and obvious. But when I consider the instances of sufferings under both Dispensations, I cannot see how any should escape the force of so much evident proof as hangs about this opinion. And if it had been the Peoples duty to have reformed by the force of Arms under the Old Dispensation, so that it

was a base and servile Compliance with the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Idolatry of their Kings, not to have resisted their subverting of Religion, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Idolatry, where was then the fidelity of the Prophets, who were <hi>to lift up their voices as Trumpets, and to shew the house of Iacob their iniquities?</hi> And since the watch-man who gave not warning to the wicked from his wicked way, was guilty of his Blood, I see not what will exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know one hath pick'd out some Expressions, (<hi>See Answer to the Letter to the Author of Ius populi</hi>) which to his thoughts sound that way: but truly they are so remote from the sense he stretches them to, that I should wonder much at his Glosses, did I not know that the Bell seems often to ring the hearer's fancy. From these, let us pass to the instances of the first Christians, who endured the sharpest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions with the greatest patience.</p>

               <p>Here is a large Theme for much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, if I should adduce all might be said on this head. Indeed the Persecutions the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians groaned under for three hundred years, are such, that scarce can they be read without horror; the last especially, which continued for about twenty years under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and his Colleagues and Successors; and by the number that suffered, we may easily guess what the strength of the Christians was. But this can be doubted by none who have ever looked upon History. <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Ep.</hi> 97. writes to <hi>Trajan</hi> (which is reckoned to have been the 104. year of Christ) that in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>onsul, there were many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of all Ages, Ranks and Sexes: and that not only in the Cities, but through the Villages and Country Places: that the Temples were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desolate, the Sacrifices long intermitted,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:66109:41"/>
and that none almost were found to buy the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims. The number of the Christians being so early risen to that height, we may easily imagine to what it swelled before <hi>Constantine</hi>'s times: not long after that, we find a whole Legion of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> his Army to have been Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. And if we believe <hi>Tertullian,</hi> their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were formidable in his time; for after he had purged the Christians of his times from the designs of doing mischief to their Enemies by stealth, he adds, <hi>Apol. cap.</hi> 37. <hi>Should we carry towards you not as secret avengers, but as open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would we want the strength of numbers and armies? Are the</hi> Maurs, <hi>the</hi> Marcomans, <hi>or the</hi> Parthians <hi>themselves, or any Nations shut up within their own Country or bounds, more than the whole World? We are strangers to you, and yet we fill all your places, your Towns, your Islands, your Castles, your Villages, your Councils, your Camps, your Tribes, your Decuries, your Palaces, your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and your Market place: Only we come not to your Temples, but abandon those to you. To what War had we not been both fit and ready, even tho our Forces had been fewer, who are butcher'd so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, if our Discipline did not allow us rather to be killed than to kill?</hi> And he goes on, telling that <hi>such was the number of the Christians, that would they but change their dwellings, and leave the Roman Empire, it would have thereby become an amazing

Solitude, since almost all their Citizens were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> And the same writer saith elsewhere, <hi>ad Scap. cap.</hi> 2. That <hi>tho the Romans who were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, were found guilty of many Conspiracies against their Emperors, yet never were any Christians found guilty of these Practices.</hi> And adds, That <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian was no mans enemy, much less the Emperors; but knowing him to be constituted by God, he doth find himself bound to love, reverence, honor, and wish well to him, with the whole Roman Empire, as long as the World lasts.</hi> Therefore, saith he, <hi>We wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Emperor so as befits him, and is lawful for us, as a man next God, who hath obtained all he hath from GOD, and is inferior to none, but God only.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. he tells us of the numbers of the Christians, <hi>and how undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were at the Persecution; so that when one</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Antoninus <hi>in</hi> Asia, <hi>was persecuting the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the whole City ran to his Tribunal, declaring themselves Christians.</hi> And he adds, <hi>If the like were to be done at</hi> Carthage, <hi>what would become of all the thousands were there, of every Sex, Age and Rank?</hi> From this we may guess both of the strength and numbers of the Christians of that time, and yet there was not the least inclination among them to resistance. If any doubt the truth of what <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, as is <hi>p.</hi> 30. he must charge him with very much Impudence, who durst of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such writings to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in matters of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66109:42"/>
fact, which could not but be notoriously enough known: Neither do I adduce these places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I lay so much weight on <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this matter, but because he shews us what was the sense of the Christians of his time. A little after him <hi>Cyprian</hi> lived, who also tells us, <hi>ad Demetrianum, That none of the Christians when apprehended, struggled with those who seized on them, nor avenged themselves of that unjustice, though their number was great and copious: But their belief of the Vengeance sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

others were broken to pieces, others stretched all out of joint, others hanged up by the Thumbs and cut in slices, others hanged up by-the heels. And this was universal through the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and to such a degree, that it continued for many years; and in <hi>Egypt</hi> alone they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten killed by hundreds a day, as <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ebius</hi> tells, who was a witness to much of it. And <hi>Godean</hi> reckons, that in one month there were seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand Martyrs killed: and during that persecution in the Province of <hi>Egypt,</hi> there were an hundred fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed thousand who died through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of Banishment, or of the publick works, to which they were condemned. I had almost forgot one sort of persecution, which as it was the most dreaded, so hath in it that which could not but provoke all to the utmost of horror and despair, which was the prostituting of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, more dreaded than any death. But among all these vast numbers, none offered to resist with the Sword<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: and yet they were so marvellously assisted by God, that in their sufferings they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the greatest joy in God, by their Hymns and Psalms, and the most of mildness to their Persecutors. And dare you say, <hi>Isotimus,</hi> that these were a stupid self-murdering Crew? Or do you think that had they been guilty of such
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66109:43"/>
a Crime, as you seem to fasten on the Doctrine of absolute submission; God had appeared for them in such a signal manner, to the conviction and horror of their Persecutors?</p>
               <p>I confess there is no piece of Story I read with such pleasure as the accounts are given of these Martyrs; for methinks they leave a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor upon my mind, which I meet with in no study, that of the Scriptures being only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Say not then they were not able to have stood to their own defence, when it appears how great their numbers were: Or shall I here tell you the known Story of the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> which consisted of 6666. who being by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Herculeus, an.</hi> 287. pressed in the Oath they gave the Emperor to swear upon the Altars of the Idols, withdrew from the Camp eight miles off; and when he sent to invite them to come and swear as the others had done; they who commanded them answered in all their names, <hi>That they were ready to return and fight stoutly against the Barbarians; but that being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, they would never worship the Gods.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperor caused tith them, which they received with such joy, that every one desired the lot might fall on himself. And this prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing on them, he tithed them a second time; and that being also without effect, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to murder them all, to which they submitted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66109:43"/>
without resistance. And it is not to be denied, but such a number being driven to such despair, and having so much courage as to dare to die in cold bloud, might have stood to their defence a great while, and at least sold their lives at a dear rate, especially they having got off eight miles from the Army.</p>
               <p>Were it my design to back these instances with the great authorities of the most eminent Writers of the Church in these times, I should grow too tedious: but this is so far from being denied, that the only way to escape so strong an assault, is to study to detract from these holy Men by enquiring into any over-reachings, to which their fervor might have engaged them.</p>

               <p>All their practices are not binding upon us, for many of them did precipitate themselves into hazards, others were against flight, &amp; others against resisting of private assailants, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant came to murder them; therefore the Spirit that acted in them, tho it produced effects highly to the honour of the Gospel, is not to be imitated by us: yet on the other hand, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg we ought to be slow to judg them. One thing is observable, that <hi>Maximinus</hi> was resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Armenians,</hi> when he intended to set up Idolatry among them. <hi>Constantine</hi> also inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Licinius</hi> when he persecuted the Christians in the <hi>East</hi>: and the <hi>Persians,</hi> when persecuted

               <p>It is certain all Christians have one Law and Rule; and the Laws of Nature are eternal and irreversible: if then the Law of Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to self-defence, it laid the same ties on them: therefore except you turn <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> you must say, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for what you alledg about the resistance made by the <hi>Armenians</hi> to <hi>Maximinus,</hi> I wish your friend had vouched his Author for what he saith of them; for I am confident he is not so impudent as to prove a matter of fact done twelve Ages ago, by a Writer of this Age. All I can meet with about that, is from <hi>Euschius, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. who tells, <hi>That in these times the Tyrant made War against the</hi> Armenians (<hi>men that had been of old Friends and Auxiliaries to the</hi> Romans) <hi>whom because they were Christians, and were pious, and zealously studious about divine matters, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of GOD, intending to force to worship the false Gods and Devils, made to become Enemies instead of Friends, and Adversaries instead of Auxiliaries.</hi> And in the beginning of the next Chapter, he tells how in that War he and his Army received a great defeat. Now how you will infer from this, that Subjects may resist their Sovereign for Religion, I see not: for these <hi>Armenians</hi> were his Confederates, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his Subjects: and it is clear by the account <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives, that <hi>Armenia</hi> was not a Province, nor governed by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as were the Provinces. Besides, consider how <hi>Maximinus</hi> came in the fag-end of that great persecution begun by <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culius,</hi> continued by <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66109:45"/>
the Persecution, there was not so much as a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult: which makes it evident the Christians at that time understood not the Doctrine of Resistance. But the <hi>Armenians</hi> case varying from that of Subjects, it was free for them to resist an unjust Invader, who had no Title to their Obedience.</p>
               <p>For your Story of <hi>Licinius,</hi> the true account of it will clear mistakes best (<hi>as it is given by Eus.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.) <hi>Constantine</hi> after he turned Christian, being then Emperor of the <hi>West,</hi> called for <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> whom <hi>Galerius</hi> had made Emperor in the <hi>East,</hi> and they both from <hi>Millain</hi> gave out E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts in favour of the Christians, giving them absolute liberty, and discharging all persecution on that account, which is reckoned to have been in the year 313. afterwards he allied with <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and gave him his Sister in marriage, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him his Colleague in the Empire. But some years after that Wars arose betwixt them, which <hi>Zosimus</hi> and <hi>Eutropius</hi> impute to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s ambition, and impatience of a Rival: but if we believe the account <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives of it, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius</hi> provoked with envy at <hi>Constantine,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Laws of Nature, the bonds of Oaths, alliance and agreement, raised a pestiferous and cruel War against him, and laid many designs and sna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66109:45"/>
these were always by GOD's Providence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and so <hi>Constantine</hi> escaped all his design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mischief: At length <hi>Licinius</hi> finding his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Arts did not succeed, he openly made War against <hi>Constantine.</hi> And as he was preparing for it, he made War likewise against GOD, and persecuted the Christians, because he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they all prayed for <hi>Constantine,</hi> and wished him success; whereupon he made severe Laws against the Christians, forbidding the Bishops ever to meet among themselves, or to instruct any Women: afterwards he banished all that would not worship the Gods, and from that he went to an open Persecution; and not content with that, he by severe Laws discharged any to visit and relieve such as were in Prison for the Faith. Yet notwithstanding all this, none that were under his part of the Empire did resist him; nay, not so much as turn over to <hi>Constantine</hi> against him, for ought that appears: But upon these things a War followed betwixt <hi>Constantine</hi> and him, wherein <hi>Licinius</hi> was defeated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to submit to what conditions <hi>Constantine</hi> was pleased to give; who took from him <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and only left him <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the <hi>East.</hi> But <hi>Licinius</hi> returning to his old ways, and breaking all agreements, a second war followed, wherein <hi>Licinius</hi> was utterly defeated, and sent to lead a private life at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where he was

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66109:46"/>
fugitives: but the <hi>Romans</hi> refused to restore them, and not only gave them Sanctuary, but resolved by all their power to defend the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and rather make War with the <hi>Persians,</hi> than see the Christians so destroyed. Now it will be a pretty sleight of <hi>Logick,</hi> if from Subjects flying from a Persecution, and seeking shelter under another Prince, you will infer that they may resist their own King. And for <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> his War, we see other grounds assigned by the Historian: and the Politicks even of good Princes in their making of Wars, must not be a Rule to our Consciences: neither know I why this instance is adduced, except it be to justifie some who are said (during the Wars betwixt their own Sovereign and the Country where they lived) to have openly prayed for Victory against their Country, and to have correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in opposition to their native Sovereign.</p>
               <p>But I must next discuss that Catalogue of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in the fourth and fifth Century, which are brought as Precedents for the resisting of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and here I must mind you of the great change was in Christendom after <hi>Constantine</hi>'s days, before whom none were Christians, but such as were persuaded of the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and were ready to suffer for its profession; so that it being then a Doctrine objected to many Persecutions, few are to be supposed to have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66109:47"/>
entred into its discipline without some Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about it in their Consciences: but the case varied much after the Emperors became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; so that what by the severity of their Laws, what by the authority of their Example, almost all the World rendered themselves Christian; which did let in such a swarm of corrupt men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Christian Societies, that the face of them was quickly much changed, and both Clergy and Laity became very corrupt, as appears from the complaints of all the Writers of the fourth Century: what wonder then if a tumultuating Humor crept into such a mixed multitude? And indeed most of these instances which are alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they be adduced to prove the corruption of that time, they conclude but too well: But, alas! will they have the authority of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or can they be look'd upon as the sense of the Church at that time, since they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approved by Council or Church-Writer? And truly the Tumults in these times were too frequent upon various occasions; but upon none more than the popular elections of Bishops, of which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> gives divers instances, and for which they were taken from the People by the Council of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 13. It is also well enough known how these Tumults flowed more from the tumultuary temper of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than from any Doctrine their Teachers
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66109:47"/>
did infuse in them. And therefore <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. giving account of one of the Tumults of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (made use of by your Friends, as a Precedent) tells how that City was ever inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Tumults, which were never compesced without blood. And at that time differences falling in betwixt <hi>Orestes</hi> the Prefect, and <hi>Cyril</hi> the Bishop, who was the first that turned the Priesthood into a temporal Dominion, they had many debates: for <hi>Orestes</hi> hating the power of the Bishops, which he judged detracted from the Prefect's authority, did much oppose <hi>Cyril</hi>; and <hi>Cyril</hi> having raised a Tumult against the <hi>Iews,</hi> wherein some of them were killed, and the rest of them driven out of the City, <hi>Orestes</hi> was so displeased at that, that he refused to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with him; whereupon 500 Monks came down from <hi>Nitria</hi> to fight for their Bishop, who set on the Prefect, and one of them named <hi>Ammonius,</hi> wounded him in the head with a stone; but the People gathering, they all fled, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ammonius</hi> was taken, whom the Prefect tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured till he died; but <hi>Cyril</hi> buried him in the Church, and magnified his Fortitude to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reckoning him a Martyr, of which he was afterwards ashamed. And their being in <hi>Alexandria</hi> at that time a learned and famous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, called <hi>Hyppatia,</hi> whom the People suspected of inflaming the Prefect against the Bishop, they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66109:48"/>
led on by a Reader of the Church, set on her, and dragged her from her Chariot into a Church, and stript her naked, and most cruelly tore her body to pieces, which they burnt to ashes. And this, saith the Historian, <hi>brought no small Infamy, both on</hi> Cyril, <hi>and on the Church of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>since all who profess the Christian Religion, should be strangers to killing, fightings, and such like.</hi> Truly, Sir, he that will found the Doctrine of Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on such grounds, hath a mind on very easie terms to run himself upon Condemnation. And yet such like are the warrants your Friends bring from Church History. Therefore I see there is yet good ground to assert that Doctrine was unknown in the Christian Church, till the times wherein the Popes pretended to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power over Princes: all whose plea was managed upon the grounds of the great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Religion to be preferred to all human Interests, and that <hi>Christ</hi> had told his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>to buy a sword</hi>; and that Princes being the Ministers of <hi>God,</hi> were to be no longer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, than they observed that design for which they were set up. Only in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, less disorder may be apprehended from the pretensions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, than from these Maxims that put the power of judging and controuling the Magistrate in the Peoples hands, which opens a door to endless confusions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66109:48"/>
and indeed sets every private Person on the Throne, and introduceth an Anarchy, which will never admit of order or remedy; whereas these who had but one pretender over them, could more easily deal with him, and more vigorously resist him.</p>

               <p>You have said very many things from History, which I shall not at this time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to examine: but I am sure it hath been both the Practice and Doctrine of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, that in case of unjust Tyranny, the States of a Kingdom may put a stop to the fury of a King: and therefore where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was opposed by Cruelty, it was also defended by Arms. And let me add, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your great quarrel at this Doctrine, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the practice of it was so great a mean of preserving the Reformation, which though, in good manners, you must commend, yet I am afraid you hate it in your heart.</p>

               <p>Whether you or we be greater friends to the Reformation, let the world judge by this one Indication, that you study to draw all can be devised for the staining it with blood, which is the constant calumny of its adversaries, whereas we offer with the clearest evidences to evince its Innocence. But let me premise the distinction of Doctrine from Practices; and tho some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable Practices appear, these must never
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66109:49"/>
be charged on the Reformed Churches, unless it be made appear they were founded on their Doctrine. Besides, the Reformers coming out of the corruptions of Poper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, in which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice of Resistance upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Religion were triumphant, it will not be found strange tho some of that ill-tempered Zeal continued still to leaven them. But for their Doctrine, I take the Standart of it to be in the Confessions of the several Churches; all which being gathered in one harmony, we are in the right scent of their Opinions, when we search for them there. Now the Doctrine of resisting of Magistrates is by divers of their Confessions expressly condemned, but in none of them asserted.</p>
               <p>It is true, there were some ambiguous expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in our <hi>Scots</hi> Confession, registred in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Anno</hi> 1567, for <hi>Art.</hi> 14. among the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the second Table, they reckon to <hi>disobey or resist any that God hath placed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, while they pass not over the bounds of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>; which seems to imply the lawfulness of Resistance when they so transgress: but besides that it is not clearly asserted, and only infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this doth not determine what the <hi>bounds of the Magistrate's Office are:</hi> And if it be found that his Office is to coërce with the Sword, so as to be accountable to none but to <hi>God,</hi> then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66109:49"/>
no Resistance will follow from hence, except of a limited Magistrate who is accountable to others. The same Explication is to be given to that part of the 24. <hi>Art.</hi> where all such are condemned who <hi>resist the Supream Power, doing that thing which appertaineth to his charge.</hi> But in the same Article the Magistrate is called <hi>God's Lieutenant, in whose Sessions</hi> God <hi>himself doth sit and judge.</hi> But with this, it is to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when that Confession was ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even when no Sovereign was to look to the clearing of any ambiguities, which might have-been upon design by some, and through the neglect of others, let pass. The Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the other Churches are unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly plain, and without restriction in the point of subjection: For what seems like a Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>French</hi> Confession (<hi>that the yoke of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is willingly to be born, though the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates were Infidels, provided that</hi> God's <hi>Sovereign authority remain entire and uncorrupted</hi>) imports nothing, but that our subjection to them, which takes in both Obedience and Suffering, is not to strike out the great Dominion <hi>God</hi> hath over our Souls, whom we should obey rather than man. And even the Confession of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Divines, ratified by the <hi>Scots General Assembly,</hi> speaks of submission to Authority in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute terms, without the exception of Resistance
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66109:50"/>
in case of Tyranny, <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>It is the duty of People — to be subject to their authority for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake. Infidelity or difference in Religion, doth not make void the Magistrate's just and legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e the people from their due obedience to him.</hi> If then the Doctrine of Resistance be to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Law of Nature, and as a part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Freedom, how came it that it was not more expresly owned in this Confession, especially since it is known to have been the opinion of most of both these Assemblies? But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it seems condemned, and only the undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned reserves of <hi>just, legal,</hi> and <hi>due,</hi> are slip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly this seems not fair dealing, and such an asserting of Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at that time, looks either like the force of truth extorting it, or intimates them afraid, or ashamed to have owned that as their Doctrine to the World. And by this time, I suppose it is clear that the Reformed Churches ought not to be charged with the Doctrine of Resistance.</p>

               <p>Nay, nor the Reformed Writers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with whose words I could fill much Paper, and shew how they do all generally condemn the resistance of Subjects: and when any of them gives any Caveat to this, it is not in behalf of the People, but <hi>of the States of the Kingdom, who, they say, perhaps are impowered with authority to curb the tyranny of Kings, as the Ephori among
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66109:50"/>
the Lacedemonians, the Tribuns of the people, and the Demarchs in Rome and Athens.</hi> Now it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that if by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it be found that the King is accountable to the States, then their coercing of him is not the resistance of Subjects, but rather the managing of the Supreme Power which lies in their hands. If then you will stand to their decision in this Point, of the Peoples resisting of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, though Tyrants, the debate will not run long, they being so express. And this will be nothing shaken by any thing you may alledge in some corner of a <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons of less name; for as from the same Writers, other places may be brought to the contrary; so what can these serve to enervate so much evident proof? Besides, we are not to consider the Writings of some particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so much as what hath been the generally received opinion among the Protestant Writers, and most taught in their Pulpits and Schools. And whoever will attempt the contradicting that this hath been for absolute submission, it must be confessed to be hard to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ignorance be most to be pitied, or his confidence most wondered at. By these things all may guess, if there be not strong grounds to apprehend the Reformed Churches must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of that, which both their Confessions

guilty of accession to them. And the Kings Son, Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> coming with an Army after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, shews all to have been done by the Kings Command. And what is alledged from the Count of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> his being a Peer of <hi>France,</hi> by which he was a Vassal, and not a Subject, is to no purpose; since by the Feudal Law, Vassals are Subjects; and whatever authority they may have within their own Dominions, they are still Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Lord of the Feud. <hi>See p.</hi> 418.</p>

               <p>I shall not with big words blow away what you alledg; but shall examine it from the accounts are given of that War. It is true, the Writers of that time do so strangely misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent these Innocents, that little credit is due to most of the Histories about them: but thus much is clear, that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were every where persecuted, both in <hi>Dauphine, Provence, Piedmont, Calabria, Boheme,</hi> and other places, to which they scattered themselves, and fled for shelter: and notwithstanding all the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions they lay under, from the Inquisition in <hi>France,</hi> they never armed against the King's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. These about <hi>Alby</hi> embracing the same Doctrine with the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and called from the Country they lived in <hi>Albigenses,</hi> were thundered against by the Pope, and a <hi>Iacobin Monk</hi> being killed in their Country, <hi>Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> proclaimed a <hi>Crotsade,</hi> promising Paradise
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66109:52"/>
to all who came and fought against these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and avenged the blood of that Monk: and in particular suspecting <hi>Raymond</hi> Count of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> he Excommunicated him, and absolved his Subjects from their obedience, permitting any to pursue his Person, and possess his Lands; with which he wrote to all Christian Princes to come into his <hi>Croisade.</hi> But the King of <hi>France</hi> was imployed in Wars both with the <hi>Emperor</hi> and King of <hi>England,</hi> and so could not join in it, but gave way to his Barons to take the Cross: And here the King consenting to so cruel an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, did undoubtedly shake much of his right to these Provinces, since he thus exposed them to the fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of an unjust Invader; so that tho they had absolutely rejected his Authority, this had quadrated with the case of a Kings desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Subjects. However the War went on, all managed by the <hi>Legate,</hi> as the Popes war. But <hi>Raymond</hi> came and submitted himself to the Pope, yet the <hi>Legate</hi> went on against <hi>Beziers</hi> and <hi>Carcasson,</hi> who had a great deal of reason to resist such an unjust Aggressor. Afterwards the <hi>Legate</hi> gaping for the County of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> picked another quarrel with <hi>Raymond,</hi> and did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him of new, tho he had got the Popes absolution: whereupon he armed, with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> against the <hi>Legate,</hi> and his General <hi>Simon Montfort</hi>: but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66109:52"/>
afterwards the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> was defeated, yet all this while the King of <hi>France</hi> lay neutral, and would not permit his Son to go against the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> because he had promised to the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> to be neutral; but the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi> being dead, he gave way to it, and so his Son came to the Army: and this must be that which <hi>Gulielmus Brito</hi> confounds with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the War. This also is that Affair which the <hi>Centuriators</hi> say <hi>Philippus Augustus</hi> had with the <hi>Albigenses.</hi> But the <hi>Legate</hi> fearing the numbers Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> brought with him, and apprehending he might have possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the other places which belonged to the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> granted them all absolution, with the protection of the Church; and assumed the confidence to tell the Prince, that since he had taken the Cross, he was to depend on his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he representing the Pope, and not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in that Army as the Kings Son; reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, because his Father had given no assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the destruction of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> when there was need of it: but that after the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Victories had been obtained, he was now come to reap the Harvest of what was due to them who had hazarded their lives for the Church. And for all this, I refer you to the History of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> compiled by <hi>M. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12, &amp;c. But what if by an <hi>overplus</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:66109:53"/>
I should justifie the Count of <hi>Tolouse,</hi> tho he had armed against the King of <hi>France,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being a Peer of <hi>France,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted him from the condition of ordinary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of whom <hi>Pasquier Recherches de France, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8 saith. It was the vulgar Opinion, that they were constituted by <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have given them almost as much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as himself had, reserving only to himself the principal voice in the Chapter: but he refutes that vulgar Error, and shews how in the end of the <hi>Carolovingian</hi> Race, great confusions were in <hi>France,</hi> partly through the various Pretenders, but more through their folly: at which time, the Crown of <hi>France</hi> did likewise become Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: and he shews how <hi>Eude, Robert, Raoul, Lewis,</hi> surnamed <hi>beyond the Sea, Lot hair,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lewis,</hi> were chosen Kings of <hi>France</hi>; and the chief Persons who at that time were most active, were these Dukes, Counts, and Bishops, who afterwards were made Peers. <hi>Hugo Capet</hi> therefore taking possession of the Crown, for securing himself peaceably in it, did confirm those Peers in that great Authority they had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed; which if he had not done, they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him more trouble. And their constitution was, that if any difference arose, either betwixt the King, and any of the Peers, or among the Peers themselves, it should be decided by the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66109:53"/>
Council of the whole twelve Peers. And he proves from an old <hi>Placart,</hi> that they would not admit the <hi>Chancellor, Connestable,</hi> or any other great Officer of <hi>France</hi> to judg them; they being to be judged by none, but their fellow Peers. These were also to be the <hi>Electors</hi> of the King. But <hi>Hugo Capet</hi> apprehending the danger of a free Election, caused, for preventing it, Crown his Son in his own time, which was practised by four or five succeeding Kings. And <hi>Lewis the Gross</hi> not being crowned in his Fathers time, met with some difficulty at his entry to the Crown; which to guard against, he crowned his Son in his own time, and so that practice continued, till the pretence of electing the King was worn out by prescription. Yet some vestigies of it do still remain, since there must be at all Coronations of <hi>France</hi> twelve to represent the Peers: and by this time, I think it is well enough made out, that the Count of <hi>Tolouse</hi> was not an ordinary Subject. And as for your confounding of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Vassal, <hi>Bodinus lib. de Rep. cap.</hi> 9. will help you to find out a difference betwixt them, who reckons up many kinds of Vassals and Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dataries who are not Subjects: for a Vassal is he that holds Lands of a Superior Lord, upon such conditions as are agreed to by the nature of the Feud, and is bound to protect the Superior, but may quit the Feud, by which he is free of that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66109:54"/>
subjection: so that the dependence of Vassals on their Lord, must be determined by the Contract betwixt them, and not by the ordinary Laws of Subjects. And from this he concludes, that one may be a Subject and no Vassal, a Vassal and no Subject, and likewise both Vassal and Subject. The Peers of <hi>France</hi> did indeed give an Oath of homage, by which they became the Liege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with <hi>Sigismund</hi>; and in the same Kingdom fifty years ago, they not only resisted first <hi>Matthias,</hi> and then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> their King, but rejected his authority, and choosed a new King: and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this change, was, because he would not make good what <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Rodolph</hi> did grant about the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Remember what was laid down as a ground, that the Laws of a Society must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who is invested with the Sovereign Power, which doth not always follow the Title of a King: but if he be accountable to any other Court, he is but a Subject, and the Sovereign Power rests in that Court. If then it be made out that the States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> are the Sovereigns, and that the Kings are accountable to them, this instance will not advance the plea of defensive Arms by Subjects. That the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is elective, was indeed much contraverted; and was at length, and not without great likelihoods on both sides, of late debated in divers Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: but among all that were impartial, they prevailed who pleaded its being elective. Yet I acknowledge this alone will not prove it free for the People to resist, unless it be also apparent that the Supreme Power remained with the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66109:55"/>
States, which as it is almost always found to dwell with the People, when the King is elected by them. <hi>Bodin</hi> doth reckon the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> among these that are but Titular Kings: and the Provincial Constitutions of that Kingdom do evidently demonstrate, that the King is only the Administrator, but not the fountain of their Power: which is made out from many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by him who writes the <hi>Republick of Bohemia,</hi> who shews how these Kings are bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the pleasure and Counsel of their States: and in the year 1135, it was decreed, that the elected Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> should bind himself by his Coronation Oath to rules there set down; which if he broke, the States were to pay him no Tributes, nor to be tied to any further Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, till he amended. <hi>See Hagecus ad ann.</hi> 1135. And this Oath was taken by all the following Dukes and Kings of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; which is an evident proof that the States had authority over their Kings, and might judge them. To this also might be added divers instances of their deposing their Kings, upon which no censure ever passed. These being then the grounds on which the <hi>Bohemians</hi> walked, it is clear they never justified their Resistance, on the account of Subjects fighting for Religion, but on the liberties of a free State, asserting their Religion when invaded by a limited Prince.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66109:55"/>
The account of the first <hi>Bohemian</hi> War, is, that <hi>Iohn Huss</hi> and <hi>Ierome of Prague,</hi> being notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Emperors Safe-conduct burnt at <hi>Constance,</hi> the whole States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> met at <hi>Prague,</hi> and found that by the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Doctors, an injury was done to the whole Kingdom, which was thereby marked with the stain of Heresie: and they first expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulated with the Emperor and Counsel about the wrong done them; but no reparation being made, they resolved to seek it by force, and to defend the Religion had been preached by <hi>Huss</hi>; and did declare their design to <hi>Winceslaus</hi> their King (whom the States had before that time made prisoner twice for his maleversation) but at that very time he died in an Apoplexy, some say through grief at that. After his death, <hi>Sigismund</hi> his Brother pretended to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi>: but not being elected, was not their righteous King: so in the following Wars that were betwixt him and <hi>Zisca,</hi> the resistance was not made to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and therefore all that time was an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> and is so mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Historian, who tells, that the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> could not be induced to receive him to be their King: he indeed invaded the Kingdom, and crowned himself, but was not chosen by the States till fifteen years after that a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and he with great difficulty prevailed

upon the States to ratifie his Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by all this, I doubt not but you are convinced that the Wars of <hi>Zasca</hi> were not of the nature of Subjects resisting their Sovereign. And for the late <hi>Bohemian</hi> War, besides what was already alledged of the Power of the States, their War against <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the reason why by a solemn decree they rejected him, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he invaded the Crown without an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, contrary to the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom: hereupon they choosed the <hi>Prince Elector Palatine</hi> to be their King. It is true, they rose also in Arms while <hi>Matthias</hi> lived, though he did not long survive these Tumults: but in all their Apologies they founded their plea on the Liberties of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And yet though this say much for their defence, I am none of the Patrons of that War, which had very few defenders among the Protestants.</p>

nothing but private Revenge, and therefore hated by</hi> God. Adding, <hi>That the Seditions then stirring, were raised by the Devil, who stirred up these who professed the Gospel to them, that thereby the truth might be brought under hatred and reproach, as if that could not be of</hi> God <hi>which gave occasion to so great evils.</hi> Then he tells what means were to be used for advancing of the Gospel, <hi>That they were to repent of their sins, for which</hi> God <hi>had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that tyranny of the Church-men.</hi> Next, <hi>That they should pray for the Divine aid, and publickly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the truth of the Gospel, and discover the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the Popes.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That this had been his method, which had been much blessed of</hi> God.

               <p>But upon this the <hi>Beures</hi> published a Writing containing their Grievances: The first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, <hi>That they might have liberty to choose Ministers, who might preach the Word of</hi> God <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, without the mixture of mens devises.</hi> The other particulars related to their Civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:66109:57"/>
to consider what they did, <hi>lest they lost both Body and Soul in what they attempted. That they were neither to consider their own strength, nor the faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Adversaries, but the justice and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Cause; and to be careful not to believe all Mens preachings; for the Devil had raised up many Seditions and bloody Teachers at that time.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forbids them <hi>to take</hi> God'<hi>s Name in vain, and pretend that they desired in all things to follow his Laws:</hi> But minds them <hi>who threatned, that they who took the Sword, should perish by the Sword: and of the Apostle, who commands all to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Magistrates, charging on them, that though they pretended the Laws of</hi> God, <hi>yet they took the Sword, and resisted the Magistrate.</hi> But he adds, <hi>You say, the Magistrates become intolerable, for they take the Doctrine of the Gospel from us, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press us to the highest degree: But be it so, stars and seditions are not therefore to be raised, neither must every one coërce crimes, that belongs to him to whom the power of the Sword is given, as is express in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And besides, this is not only according to the Laws, but is by the light of Nature impressed on all mens minds: which shews, that no man can cognosce and judge in his own Cause, since all men are blinded with self-love: And it cannot be denied, but this Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Sedition of yours, is a private Revenge: But if you have any warrant for this from</hi> God, <hi>you must make it out by some signal Miracle. The

Magistrate indeed doth unjustly, but you much more so, who contemning the Command of</hi> God, <hi>invade anothers Iurisdiction.</hi> And he tells them, <hi>That if these things take place, there will be no more Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, nor Courts of Iustice, if every man exercise private Revenge.

               <p>Before I examine that Affair, I must first clear the way by removing a mistake, which truly I judged none capable of that had ever read any thing of the Constitution of the <hi>German Empire,</hi> or of the Power of the <hi>Electors, Princes,</hi> and <hi>free Cities.</hi> I must therefore since I have to do with so much ignorance or perversness, shew that the Emperor is not Sovereign in <hi>Germany</hi>; though the thing is so plain, that I am almost ashamed to go about it. The <hi>German Empire</hi> was hereditary from the days of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> till <hi>Henry the Fowler,</hi> and then it begun to be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: and as is usual in all such cases, they who had the right of Election, got by degrees the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority transferred upon themselves: but the particular time when this begun, is not so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined by the <hi>German</hi> Writers. It is true, the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> is not like the League of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66109:59"/>
the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> or of the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> where the Authority remains with the several States and <hi>Cantons,</hi> and they only meet for Counsel: but the <hi>Diet</hi> hath the supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, both of deposing of Emperors, as was practised in the case of <hi>Adolphus</hi> and <hi>Wenceslaus,</hi> and of fining, banishing, and forfeiting, either Princes or Cities. And the Princes declare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emperor is Crowned, that they are the Vassals of the Empire, and not of the Emperor. and when the <hi>Diet</hi> sits not, all things are judged by the <hi>Imperial Chamber,</hi> whose President must be a Prince of the Empire, who hath six Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors from the Emperor, seven from the seven <hi>Electors,</hi> twenty from the ten Circles, two from each of them; and by them all the differences among the Princes or Members of the Empire are decided. Upon greater occasions, the <hi>Diet</hi> is called, which <hi>Thuan</hi> compares to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>Amphictyons</hi> in Greece, that was made up of Princes, who had no dependence one upon another. The <hi>Diet</hi> is not called by the Emperor, but by the Decree of a former <hi>Diet:</hi> or if the Emperor call one, the Princes are not bound to come to it. And so the Princes refused to come <hi>Anno</hi> 1554. and <hi>An.</hi> 1506.

I might here add much from the way of the Emperors treating with the Princes, by sending and receiving of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that go betwixt them, by the state in which he receives Visits from them, and returns them to them, by the Princes treating and being treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, by all forein Princes, who write to them <hi>Brother,</hi> and not <hi>Cousin,</hi> by their making of Peace and War among themselves: and should indeed run out into a long dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ession, if I adduced all might be alledged for proving the Princes of the Empire to be none of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Subjects: but I have no mind to engage in a vain shew of reading upon so plain a Subject. One thing I shall only add, that by the 12. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Bulla Aurea,</hi> it is expresly provided,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66109:60"/>
that the Electors shall meet together yearly in the four weeks that follow <hi>Easter,</hi> for consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Affairs of the Empire: and this is thus explained in the 4th Article of the <hi>Cesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean Capitulation, That it shall be free for the six Electors by the vigor of the Bulla Aurea, to meet together as often as they please, for consulting about the Commonwealth, and that the Emperour shall make no hinderance to it, nor take it in ill part.</hi> And hence it is that these who give account of the state of the Empire, laugh at their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, who through a childish mistake ascribe the Sovereign Power to the Emperor. The same may be added of the free Cities united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a League at least 500 years old, called the <hi>Hanse-towns,</hi> who came under the protection of the Master of the <hi>Teut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>tor to themselves. And one of the Conditions on which any City might be of this League, was, that they were free Towns: and therefore it was that some Towns in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> being of this League,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66109:61"/>
their Princes were by Oath to confirm their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, otherwise they could not be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within that League; the end whereof was to defend one another in any necessity they might fall in. Let these things then declare whether <hi>Germany</hi> be a Monarchy or not, and it will never prove the Emperor to be the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, because the Empire is feudal, and the Emperor gives the Investitures to the Princes; for they are not the Feudato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And most of the Princes of <hi>Itair</hi> receive still their Investiture from the Emperor, but are far from concluding themselves his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon that account. And who thinks the King of <hi>Naples</hi> the Popes Subject, tho he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Investiture in that Crown from him? These things being thus cleared, it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Wars betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> V. and the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> will never be a Precedent for Subjects resisting their Sovereign. And having said so much, it will be to no purpose to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the rise and progress of the <hi>Smalcal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

League and War, only thus much is clear, that the leaguing of the Princes and Cities together among themselves, or with other Princes, was not held contrary to the Laws of the Empire: for after the <hi>Smalcaldic</hi> League, both the Emperor and other Kings, as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> treated with them, and sent Embassadors to them: Yea, the Pope sent a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxe,</hi> and <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> at <hi>Smalcald,</hi> and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were they accused by the Emperor for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that League of mutual defence: which shews it was not judged contrary to the duty of these Princes to associate among themselves, or with others. And the City of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and after them the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> made a League with the <hi>Switzer Cantons</hi> that received the Reformation, for mutual defence against any Invasion upon the account of Religion. At <hi>Ausburg</hi> the Emperor did on the 11. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1530. declare, that since the Protestants did reject the Decree made about Religion, he had entred in an agreement with the rest of the <hi>Diet,</hi> not to offend any, but to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if any force were used against these who owned that Religion. And in the following <hi>December</hi> the Protestant Princes met at <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cald,</hi> and made an agreement among themselves in the same strain: neither were they ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for so doing, but continued in a good
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:66109:62"/>
correspondence with the Emperor many years after that, till being invaded by the Duke of <hi>Brunswick</hi> the War took its rise, which is all along proved to have been according to the Laws and Liberties of the Empire. And thus this Case doth vary exceedingly from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Debates.</p>

               <p>If I may glean after your Harvest, I could add, that the Divines of <hi>Germany</hi> were notwithstanding of all the immunity of the Princes, and injuries they met with, very much against all warlike preparations. Many vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of this appear through <hi>Melanclon</hi>'s Letters, particularly in his 71. Letter to <hi>Camerarius an.</hi> 1528. where he gives account of the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many had to War, and with how much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he had studied to divert them from it, though great injuries had been done them; and that it was believed that many of the Princes had signed a conspiracy against them. And <hi>Scultet Exer.

years, and his ill Counsellors were well served for their advice, <hi>Grumbachius</hi> was quartered, and <hi>Ionas</hi> was beheaded. Thus you see how that war is censured by one of the best of the late <hi>German</hi> Divines. By this time, I think no scruples can dwell with any about the <hi>German</hi> War, and that it agrees with the case of a Prince defending his Religion and Subjects, against the unjust invasion of another Prince, to whom he owes neither obedience nor subjection: and this will easily satisfie all that know either Law or History, whether the Author of the <hi>Dialogues</hi> deserved to be treated as his <hi>Answerer</hi> doth: But it is no new thing to find ignorants full of confidence, and cowards full of boastings.</p>

               <p>The design of the <hi>Conformist</hi> was to prove that the first Reformers did not teach the doctrine of Subjects their resistance upon the account of Religion; but he meant not to make good all that followed after that: therefore left the more inconsiderat when they heard of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

might have mistaken that, as he knows some have done, and confounded it with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, he gave the true account of that Affair as it was: and it being seventy years after the Reformation was first brought thither, cannot be fastened on the Reformation. Besides the whole Tract of the <hi>Swedish</hi> History proves, that the Estates, as they elected, so also coerced, and frequently deposed their Kings: and therefore <hi>Bodin</hi> reckons <hi>Sweden</hi> among these divided States, where the Supreme Power lay betwixt the King and the Nobility: and tells how in his own time <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his own hand, one that presented a petition to him, the States forced him to quit the Kingdom to his Brother: and that he had been for seventeen years a prisoner when he wrote his Books <hi>de Republica:</hi> It being thus frequent in <hi>Sweden</hi> upon malversation, not only to resist, but to depose their Kings, it was no wonder if when <hi>Sigismund</hi> came against them with an army of <hi>Polanders,</hi> whose Sovereign he was not, (for none are so ignorant to think the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a Sovereign) they resisted him: since that was a subjecting of <hi>Sweden</hi> to foreign force, and so did totally overturn the whole Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kingdom. But after all this, I may add, that <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for the War among the <hi>Cantons,</hi> it is undeniable that it was not of Subjects against their Sovereigns, since the Cities of <hi>Helvetia</hi> have no dependence one upon another; nor can any one City be tied to the opinion or decree of the rest, without their own consent: which shews that every <hi>Canton</hi> is a free State within it self, and therefore their warrings among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, makes nothing for subjects resisting of their Sovereigns. And what is alledged from the tumult of <hi>Basel,</hi> is as little to our purpose: for these free Cities being Democratical, it was no wonder if the people off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66109:64"/>
but for vindicating of their own liberty. And in the end of the Story it appears what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, for they made the Senat receive 260. out of the Companies of the Citizens, whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel should be carried along in the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, that might be either for GOD's Glory, or the Good of the Commonwealth. But if you lay claim to this Story as a Precedent, you must acknowledge that a Reformation may be not only maintained by force, but that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats may be removed from their Office, if they go not along with it; and that the people may in their own Authority, without waiting for the Magistrats concurrence, go by violence and break down Images, and throw out an establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Religion. But this belongs not to the case of Subjects, since in these free Cities the power is certainly with the people, and so they are not S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for <hi>Geneve,</hi> it is so fully proved, that it was a free Imperial City, that I need add nothing to make it out One instance will abundantly suffice to prevail upon the belief of any who can doubt whether the Bishop of <hi>Geneve</hi> was their Prince, which is, that the Bishops of <hi>Geneve</hi> did frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Burgesses in it: In particular, <hi>Peter de Baul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as for the Reformation of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neve,</hi> it is true <hi>Sleydan</hi> hints as if the Bishop and Clergy had left the City, being angry at the Reformation: but in that he was mistaken, for their Bishop left the City <hi>an.</hi> 1528. and made war against it upon some disputes were betwixt him and them about their privileges: for though he was not Lord of the City, yet the Countrey about it belonged to him. But <hi>an.</hi> 1533. he returned to the City, and left it in the <hi>Iuly</hi> of the same year, fearing some seditious Tumults, which he had the more reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, because of his Transactions with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whereby he made over to him his interest in the City. And it was two years after this before the Reformation was received by that City. For after he left them, they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Decree for preserving the old Religion, and discharging of the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and banished two of the Ministers of that Religion. And on the first of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1534. after the Bishop was gone, his Vicar published an Edict, discharging all Assemblies f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One error runs through all your smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings, which is, that you never distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a State governed by a Monarch, where subjection is due to him by the constitution of the State, and a limited Prince, who by the Laws of that Society is accountable to, and censurable by the Nobility and people; which states so great a difference, that he must be very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind who doth not observe it; And therefore I will first shew you, that the Prince of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> was but a precarious Prince, governing a free people at their pleasure and precariously, as <hi>Heuterus</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Ant.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66109:65"/>
many instances are reckoned by <hi>Grotius,</hi> and therefore he compares their Princes to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> Kings, upon whom the <hi>Ephori</hi> and the Senat might have cognosced. The <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantins</hi> had indeed looked better to their liberty than the rest, and so had guarded against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their Princes (who might have broken their Laws upon the pretence of a publick good) by an express agreement, that if their Prince should violate the Laws, they should not be tied to obedience nor fidelity to him, till their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were removed: and this was confirmed by the examples of their Ancestors, <hi>Gr. An. lib.</hi> 2. And a little after, he adds, That the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in <hi>Belgium,</hi> had by practice that same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, and that the rather, that being all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Brabant,</hi> by <hi>Maximilian,</hi> they were to enjoy the same privileges with them. The <hi>Brabantins</hi> had also a privilege of chusing a Conservator in any great hazard, called <hi>Ruart, Strada tom.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. whose power was equal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Dictators: this they had by the privileges of the <hi>Laetus introitus.</hi> And upon this they chused the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> their <hi>Ruart, anno</hi> 1577. And to run no further for proofs of this, when <hi>Philip</hi> was inaugurated their Prince, he expresly provided, that if he broke their privileges, they should be free from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and fidelity to him: and this was the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66109:66"/>
ground on which they deposed him, as appears by their Decree, <hi>St. tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. By these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications it is apparent, that the Prince of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> was not Sovereign of these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, since they could cognosce upon him, and shake off his authority. But I shall next make out, that <hi>Religion</hi> was not the ground upon which these Wars were raised: The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came unto the Provinces in <hi>Charles</hi> the V. his time, who cruelly persecuted all who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, so that these who were butchered in his time, are reckoned not to be under 100000. <hi>Gr.

               <p>All this will perhaps be answered in due time: but from this let me lead you to <hi>France,</hi> where we find a long Tract of Civil Wars upon the account of Religion, and here you cannot pretend the King is a limited Sovereign; neither was this War managed by the whole States of <hi>France,</hi> but by the Princes of the Blood, with the Nobility of some of the Provinces; and these began under <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, then about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age, so that he was not under Non-age: and tho they were prosecuted under the Minority of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, yet the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was Regent, and so bore the King's Authority, was resisted: and after <hi>Charles</hi> was of age, the Wars continued, both during his Reign, and much of his Brother's, and did again break out in the last King's Reign. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants were also owned and assisted in these Wars, not only by the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> but by the three last Princes who reigned in <hi>Britain.</hi> So here we have an undeniable instance of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects defending Religion by Arms.

               <p>I must again put my self and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to a new penance by this ill understood piece of History, which you have alledged: and tell you how upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's death, <hi>Francis</hi> his Son, was under age by the <hi>French</hi> Law, (for which see <hi>Thuan. lib.</hi> 16.) which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Regents power to continue till the King was 22 years of age at least, as had been done in the case of <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. which yet the History of that time saith, was a rare privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, granted him because of his Gracefulness, and the love was generally born him, whereas the year wherein the Kings were judged ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Government was 25. But <hi>Francis,</hi> tho under age, being every way a Child, did for away both the Princes of the Blood, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and the Admiral from the Government, which he committed to his Mother, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> Upon this the Princes of the Blood met, and sent the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who was the first Prince of the Blood, to the King, to complain of their ill usage: but tho he was much neglected at Court, yet his simplicity was such, that he was easily whedled out of his pretensions. Upon this the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having a greater spirit, and being poor, thought upon other Courses, and as it is related by <hi>Davila, lib.</hi> 1. gathered a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Ferté,</hi> where he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>posed the injury

done the Princes of the Blood, who in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their King were now excluded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: which, contrary to the <hi>Salick</hi> law, was put in a womans hand, and trusted to Strangers: wherefore he moved that (according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of other Princes of the Blood, in the like Cases, which he adduced) they might by arms make good their right, and assume the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Kings minority. But the Admiral considering well the hardiness of the enterprise, said, that another way must be taken to make it succeed, which was, that since <hi>France</hi> was full of the followers of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions they had lain under, were now almost desperat, and had a particular hatred at the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Lorrain</hi> as their chief enemies, therefore it was fit to cherish them, and make a party of them, by which means assistance might be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hoped for from the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>England</hi>: and to this advice all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent did yield. Upon this, saith <hi>Thuan, lib.</hi> 16. many Writings were published, proving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Kingdom in the King's mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to belong to the Princes of the Blood, and that by the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> the Regents power was not absolute, but to be regulated by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the States, wherein many instances of the <hi>French</hi> Law were adduced: and whereas it was alledged that the King was major at 15.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66109:69"/>
which was proved from an Edict of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, this was fully refuted; and it was shewed that notwithstanding of the Edict of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, his Son was not admitted to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till he was full 22 years of age, and that in his minority the Kingdom was governed by a Council of the Princes and Nobility, which was established by an Assembly of the States. I shall not meddle further in the debate which was on both hands about the year of the King's majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the Power of the Princes of the Blood in his minority, but shall refer the Reader to the sixth Book of the voluminous History of <hi>France,</hi> for that time, whose Author hath suppressed his Name, where a full abstract of all the writings that passed on both sides about these matters is set down: but this shews how little your Friends understand the History of that time, who take it for granted that <hi>Francis</hi> the Second was then Major, since it was the great matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.

After this the Edict was every where violated, and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> united with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> for the ruin of the Protestants: upon which the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as the next Prince of the Blood, asserted the Edicts, so that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was the Regents power absolute or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign: and the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> in his <hi>Manifesto</hi> declared, he had armed to free the King from that captivity these stranger Princes kept him in, and that his design was only to assert the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the late Edict, which others were violating. Upon this the Wars began, and ere the year was ended, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was killed: after which the Regency did undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> And thus you see upon what grounds these Wars began: and if they were after that continued during the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that same King, and his Successors, their Case in that was more to be pitied, than imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for it is known that Wars once beginning, and Jealousies growing strong, and deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are not easily setled.</p>
               <p>And to this I shall add what a late Writer of that Church <hi>Sieur d'Ormegrigny</hi> hath said for them, in his reflections on the Third <hi>Chapter of the Politicks of France:</hi> wherein he justifies the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> from these Imputations. What was done that way, he doth not justifie, but chargeth it on <hi>the despair of a lesser Party among them, which was disavowed by the greater part.</hi> And shews how the first Tumults in <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> II. his time, were carried mainly on by <hi>Renaudy</hi> a Papist, who had Associates of both Religions. He vindicates what followed from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66109:71"/>
the Interest the Princes of the Blood had in the Government in the minority of the Kings. And what followed in <hi>Henry</hi> III. his time, he shews, was in defence of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous heir of the Crown, whom those of the League designed to seclude from his right. But after that <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had setled <hi>France,</hi> he not only granted the Protestants free Exercise of their Religion, but gave them some Towns for their security, to be kept by them for twenty years: at the end whereof, the late King remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the Protestants were instant to keep them longer, to which he yielded for three or four years: in the end, <hi>he wisely determined</hi> (saith that Gentleman) <hi>to take them out of their hands.</hi> Upon which they met in an Assembly at <hi>Rochel</hi>; and <hi>most imprudently,</hi> he adds, <hi>and against their duty, both to</hi> God <hi>and the King, they resolved to keep them still by force.</hi> But at that time there was a <hi>National Synod at Alais,</hi> where M. <hi>du Moulin</hi> presided, who searching into the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Affairs in that Country, where many of these places of strength lay, he found the greater and better part inclined to yield them up to the King: upon which he wrote an excellent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Assembly at Rochel,</hi> disswading them from pursuing the Courses they were ingaging in: where he shews, it was <hi>the general desire of their Churches, that it might please</hi> God <hi>to continue
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66109:71"/>
peace by their giving Obedience to the King: and since his Majesty was resolved to have these Places in his own hands, that they would not on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ingage in a War. But that if Persecution was intended against them, all who feared</hi> God <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it might be for the Profession of the Gospel, and so be truly the cross of</hi> Christ: <hi>and therefore assured them the greater and better part of their Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired they would dissolve their meeting, if it could be with security to their Persons.</hi> And presses their parting from that Assembly, with many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obviates what might be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: And craves pardon to tell them, <hi>They would not find inclinations in those of the Religion to obey their resolutions, which many of the best quality, and greatest capacity avowedly condemned, judging that to suffer on that account, was not to suffer for the Cause of</hi> God. And therefore exhorts them to depend on <hi>God,</hi> and not precipitate themselves into Ruin by their Impatience. And he ends his Letter with the warmest and serventest lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage imaginable for gaining them into his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is true, his Letter wrought not the desired Effect, yet many upon it deserted the meeting. Upon the which that Gentleman shews, that what was then done, ought not to be charged on the Protestant Churches of <hi>France,</hi> since it was condemned by the <hi>National Synod of their Divines,</hi> and three parts of four who were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:66109:72"/>
of the Religion continued in their dutiful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King, without ingaging in Arms with those of their Party. <hi>Amirald</hi> also in his incomparable <hi>Apology</hi> for those of the <hi>Reformed Religion, Sect.</hi> 2. vindicates them from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of disloyalty to their Prince: and after he hath asserted his own opinion, that Prayers and Tears ought to be the only weapons of the Church, as agreeing best with the nature of the Gospel, and the practice of the first Christians, he adds his regrates, that their Fathers did not crown their other Virtues with invincible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in suffering all the Cruelty of their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors without resistance, after the Example of the Primitive Church, by which all color of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Reformation had been removed. Yet he shews how they held out during the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. and <hi>Henry</hi> II. notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Cruelty of the Persecution, though their Numbers were great. What fell out after that, he justifies, or rather excuses (<hi>for he saith, he cannot praise, but blame it</hi>) on the Grounds we have already mentioned, of the minority of their Kings, and of the Interest of the Princes of the Blood. And for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Renaudy</hi> in <hi>Francis</hi> II. his time, he tells how <hi>Calvin</hi> disapproved it: and observes from <hi>Thuan,</hi> that he who first discovered it was of the Reformed Religion, and did it purely from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66109:72"/>
the Dictate of his Conscience. He also shews that the Protestants never made War with a common Consent, till they had the Edicts on their side, so that they defended the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which others were violating. But adds withal, that the true cause of the Wars, was reason of State, and a Faction betwixt the Houses of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi>: and the defence of the Protestants was pretended, to draw them into it. And for the late Wars, he charges the blame of them on the ambition of some of their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, and the factious Inclinations of the Town of <hi>Rochel.</hi> And vindicates the rest of their Church from accession to them, whatever good wishes the common Interest of their Religion might have drawn from them, for these whose danger they so much apprehended. And for the Affaus of our <hi>Britain,</hi> which was then in a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion, for which the Protestants were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally blamed, as if the Genius of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion led to an opposition of Monarchy, he saith, strangers could not well judge of matters so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more from them; but if the King of <hi>England</hi> was by the constitutions of that Kingdom a Sovereign Prince (which is a thing in which he cannot well offer a dicision) then he simply condemns their raising a War against him, even though that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which was so much spread of his design to change the Reformed Religion settled there,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66109:73"/>

Neither are these opinions of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> to be look'd on as his private thoughts; but that Apology being published by the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these appointed to license the Books of the Religion, is to be received as the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received Doctrine of that Church.</p>
               <p>And what ever approbation or assistance the neighboring Princes might have given the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in the latter or former Wars, it will not infer their allowing the Precedent of Subjects resisting their Sovereign, though persecuted by him, since it is not to be imagined many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could be guilty of that. But the Maxims of Princes running too commonly upon grounds very different from the Rules of Conscience, and tending chiefly to strengthen themselves, and weaken their Neighbors, we are not to make any great account of their approving or abetting of these Wars. And thus far you have drawn from me a great deal of Discourse for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying the <hi>Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A little time may produce an Answer to all this, which I will not now attempt, but study these accounts more accurately. But let us now come home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and examine whether the King be an accountable Prince, or not? You
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66109:73"/>
know well enough how <hi>Fergus</hi> was first called over by the <hi>Scots,</hi> how many instances there are of the States their coercing the King, how the King must swear at his Coronation to observe the Laws of the Kingdom, upon which Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is sworn to him, so that if he break his part, why are not the Subjects also free, since the Compact seems mutual? I need not add to this, that the King can neither make nor abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Laws, without the consent of the Estates of Parliament, that he can impose no Tax with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. And from these things it appears that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is a limited King, who as he originally derived his Power from their choice, so is still limited by them, and liable to them. All which is at large made out by the Author of <hi>Ius populi.</hi>

               <speaker>Basil.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are on a rational Point, which I acknowledge deserves to be well discussed, for if by the Laws of <hi>Scotland</hi> the King be liable to his People, then their coercing him will be no Rebellion. But this point is to be determined not from old Stories, about which we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Record, nor clear account for giving light how to direct our belief, nor from some tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Practices, but from the Laws and Records of the Kingdom: and here the first word of our Laws gives a shrewd Indication that the King's Power is not from the People, (which is <hi>anno</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:66109:74"/>
1004, according to Sir <hi>Iohn Skeen</hi>'s Collection of them:) <hi>King</hi> Malcome <hi>gave and distributed all his Lands of the Realm of</hi> Scotland <hi>among his men, and reserved nothing in property to himself but the Royal Dignity, and the</hi> Mure-hill <hi>in the Town of</hi> Scone.</p>
               <p>Now I dare appeal to any Person whether this be not the Stile of a Sovereign, and if this prove not the King's Title to the Crown to be of another nature, than that of a voluntary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact? The next vestige is to be found in the Books of <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> held to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by King <hi>David</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1124, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared authentical by following Parliaments, where the third Verse of the Preface is, <hi>That our most glorious King having the Government of the Realm, may happily live both in the time of Peace and of warfare, and may ride the Realm commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by</hi> God, <hi>who hath no Superior but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth, ruler over all things,</hi> &amp;c. And let the plain sense of these words tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath his power from the People, and whether he be accountable to any but to <hi>God</hi>? It is also clear that all were bound to follow the King to the Wars, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was decreed against those who refused it, see the Laws of <hi>Alexander</hi> II. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. and <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Iac.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>Cap.</hi> 57. And this shews they were far from allowing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66109:74"/>
War against the King. The Parliaments were also originally the Kings Courts, at which all his Vassals were bound to appear personally, and give him Counsel, which proving a burden to the small Barons, they were dispenced with for their appearance in Parliament, 1. <hi>Iac. Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 101. which shews that the coming to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was looked on in these days rather as an homage due to the King, than a priviledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Subjects, otherwise they had been loth to have parted with it so easily. And 2. <hi>Fac.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>It is ordained that none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against the King</hi>'s <hi>person nor his Authority, and whoso makes such Rebellion is to be punished after the quality and quantity of such Rebellion by the advice of the three Estates. And if it happens any within the Realm openly or notoriously to rebel against the King, or make war against the King</hi>'s <hi>Laeges, against his forbidding; in that case the King is to go upon them with assistance of the whole Lands, and to punish them after the quantity of the trespass.</hi> Here see who hath the Sovereign power, and whether any may take Arms against the King's command: and the 25. <hi>Ch.</hi> of that same Parl. defines the points of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. It is true by that Act those who assault Castles, or Houses where the King's person was, without the consent of the three Estates, are to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Traytors: From which one may infer that the Estates may besiege the King; but it is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66109:75"/>
clear that was only a provision against these who in the minority of the Kings used to seize upon their Persons, and so assumed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore it was very reasonable that in such a case provision should be made, that it were not Treason for the Estates to come and besiege a place where the Kings Person were for recovering him from such as treasonably seized on him. And this did clearly take its rise from the confusions were in that King's minority, whom sometimes the Governor, sometimes the Chancellor got into their keeping, and so carried things as they pleased having the young King in their hands. The King is also declared to have full Jurisdiction and free Empire within his Realm, 3. <hi>Fac. Parl.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. And all along it is to be observed that in asserting his Majesties <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> the phrases of <hi>asserting</hi> and <hi>acknowledging,</hi> but never of <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>granting,</hi> are used, so that no part of the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is granted him by the Estates, and <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 129. his Majesties Royal Power and Authority over all Estates, as well spiritual as temporal, within the Realm, is ratified, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and perpetually confirmed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the King's Majesty his Heirs and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. And in the 15. <hi>Parl.</hi> of that same King, <hi>Chap.</hi> 251. these words are, <hi>Albert it cannot be denied, but his Majesty is a free Prince,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66109:75"/>
of a Sovereign Power, having as great liberties and Prerogatives by the Laws of this Realm and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Crown, and Diadem, as any other King, Prince, or Potentate whatsoever.</hi> And in the 18. <hi>Parl.</hi> of the same <hi>King,</hi> Act. 1. <hi>The Estates and whole body of that present Parliament, all in one va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, faithful and united heart, mind and consent, did truly acknowledge his Majesties Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Princely Power, Royal Prerogative, and priviledg of his Crown over all Estates, Persons and Causes within his said Kingdom</hi> By this time I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is past debate, that by the Tract of the whole Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Majesty is a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign unaccountable Prince, since nothing can be devised more express than are the Acts I have cited. For what you objected from the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath, remember what was said a great while ago, that if by the Coronation the King got his Power, so that the Coronation Oath, and Oath of Allegiance were of the nature of a mutual stipulation, then you might with some reason infer that a failing of the one side, did free the other; but nothing of that can be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, where the King hath his Authority, how soon the breath of his Father goes out, and acts with full Regal power before he be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so that the Coronation is only a solemn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration in that which is already his right. Next, let me tell you, that the King's swearing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:66109:76"/>
at his Coronation, is but a late practice; and so the Title of the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Crown, is not upon the swearing of that Oath: And here I shall tell you all that I can find in our Laws of the King's swearing or promising. The first instance that meets me is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of King <hi>Robert</hi> the Second, where these words are, <hi>For fulfilling and observing of all the premises, the King so far as concerns him in his Parliament, hath obliged himself in the word of a Prince, and his Son the Earl of Carrict</hi> (afterwards <hi>Robert</hi> the third) <hi>being constituted by the King for fulfilling of the premises, so far as touches him, gave and made his Oath, the holy Evangils being touched by him, and then the States of Parliament did also swear to maintain the Earl of Carrict,</hi> made then Lieutenant under the King. Now the reason why these mutual Oaths were then given, is well known, since the King's S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was so doubtful. But after that, no Oath seems to have been given: and tho King <hi>Iames</hi> the Second his Coronation be set down in the Records of Parliament, there is not a word of an Oath given by any in his Name. It is true in the 11. <hi>Parl.</hi> of that King, <hi>cap</hi> 41. for securing of the Crown-lands from being alienated, it is appointed, <hi>That the King who then was, should be sworn; and in like manner all his Successors, Kings of Scotland into their Coronation, to the keeping of that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66109:76"/>
Statute, and all the points thereof.</hi> But this is not such an Oath as you alledg. Likewise in King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fourth his Reign, 2. <hi>Parl. Ch.</hi> 12. where the Council was sworn, it is added, <hi>And our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord hath humbled his Highness to promit and grant in Parliament, to abide and remain at their Counsels while the next Parliament.</hi> But it is to be observed, the King was then but 17 years old, and so not of full age: this promise was also a temporary provision. Besides, the very stile of it shews, that it was below his Majesty to be so bound. But the first Act for a Coronation Oath I can meet with, is <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. of the 1. <hi>Parl.</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth, <hi>An.</hi> 1567. where the stile wherein the Act runs, shews it was a new thing, it bearing no narrative of any such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Custom: the words of the Act are, <hi>Item, because that the increase of Vertue and suppressing of Idolatry craves, that the Prince and the people be of one perfect Religion, which of GOD'S mercy is now presently professed within this Realm; Therefore it is statute and ordained by our Sovereign Lord, my Lord Regent, and the three Estates of this present Parliament, that all Kings and Princes, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, holding their place, which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may happen to Reign, and bear Rule over this Realm, at the time of their Coronation, and receipt of their Princely authority, make their faithful promise by Oath,</hi> &amp;c. Now you see the beginning of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66109:77"/>
Coronation Oath, and I need not here reflect on the time when that Act passed, it being so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every one. But I suppose it is made out, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have not their Authority from any stipulation used at their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation. The next thing you alledg to prove the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> a limited Prince, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he must govern by Laws, which cannot be enacted without the Authority of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in Parliament: But this will not serve turn, unless you prove that the Estates can cognosce on the King, and coerce him if he transgress: for which there is not a tittle in our Laws. I acknowledg the Constitution of Parliaments to be both a rational and excellent Model, and that the King becomes a Tyrant when he violates their Priviledges, and governs without Law: But tho his Ministers who serve him in such ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical ways are liable to punishment by the Law, yet himself is subject to none but <hi>GOD.</hi> And from our Kings their Justice and goodness in governing legally by the Councils of their Parliaments, you have no reason to argue against their absolute Authority; for their binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such Rules, and being tied to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of Laws enacted by themselves, will never overthrow their Authority, but rather commend it, as having such a temperature of Sovereignty, Justice, and Goodness in it.</p>

               <p>I shall not engage far in the Story of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Third, which even as it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by <hi>Buchanan, lib.</hi> 11. (no friend to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy) is very far from being justifiable on the side of those who fought against him: nor was it the least part of their guilt, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Son, being then but fifteen years old, to own their Rebellion: And what wonder was it, that they who had killed the Father, and kept his Son in their power, passed such an Act in their own favors? But King <hi>Iames</hi> the Fourth quickly discovered what a sincere Penitent he was for his Accession to that Rebellion, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the Iron Belt he wore all his life, as a penance for this sin: yet the meekness of his Spirit, and the power of that Faction, made that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66109:78"/>
things continued in the posture they formerly were in. It is true, that Act was not expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, which perhaps was not safe at that time to have attempted: but it was really done by his Revocation ratified in his 6. <hi>Parl. cap.</hi> 100. wherein with consent of the three Estates, <hi>He annuls and revokes all Statutes and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had enacted in his former years, that tended either to the prejudice of the Catholic Church, his Soul, or of the Crown, declaring them to have no force, but to be deleted, and cancell'd out of the Books.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but in this he had an eye to that former Act: but for your Act assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of Parliament, look but what immediately precedes it, and you will find the King's Authority and Supremacy fully esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished: and I acknowledg, that whosoever impugns the Authority of Parliament, as the King's Great Council, doth incur a very high punishment; but this will never prove an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the States to coerce and resist the King. One thing I must mind you of from that Act, which is, <hi>That none of the Lieges must presume to impugn the dignity and Authority of the said three Estates, or to seek or procure the innovation, or diminution of the Power and Authority of the same three Estates, or any of them in time coming, under the pain of Treason.</hi> And can you be so ignorant of our Laws, as not to know that the Church
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66109:78"/>
was one of these Estates: for the small Barons which some called the Third Estate, came not in till three years after? <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 113. And now from all these premises, I think we may fairly infer with Sir <hi>Iohn Sheen, Title</hi> 8. of the heads of our Laws drawn up by him, <hi>That all Iurisdiction stands and consists in the King's Person by reason of his Royal Authority and Crown, and is competent to no Subject, but flows and proceeds from the King, having Supreme Iurisdiction, and is given and committed by him to such Subjects as he pleases.</hi>

excuse our disobedience: neither can it be said, that he sins not who is content to submit to the punishment, since by the same method of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing you may prove that such horrid Atheists, as say they are content to be damned, do not sin against <hi>God,</hi> since they are willing to submit to the threatned punishment. The right of exacting our Obedience is therefore to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the power of punishing our faults. And as we have already considered how far the latter is to be acquiesced in, it remains to be examined what is due to the former. But here I lay down for a Principle, <hi>That whatever is determined by the Law of</hi> God, <hi>cannot be revers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor countermanded by any humane Law:</hi> For the Powers that are, being ordained of <hi>God,</hi> and they being his Ministers, do act as his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties: and the tie which lies on us to obey <hi>God,</hi> being the foundation of our subjection to them, it cannot bind us to that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws it self: Therefore it is certain <hi>God</hi> is first to be obeyed; and all the Laws of men which contradict his Authority or Commands, are null, and void of all obligation on our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: but I must add, it is one of the arts of <hi>you know whom,</hi> to fasten Tenets on men who judge these Tenets worthy of the highest <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi> For if it be maintained, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate can bind obligations on our Consciences,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:66109:81"/>
then it will be told in every Conventicle, that here a new Tyranny is brought upon Souls, which are <hi>God</hi>'s Prerogative, though this be nothing more than to say we ought <hi>to be subject for Conscience sake.</hi> If again it be proved that the determining of the externals of Government or Worship, falls within the Magistrate's Sphere, then comes in a new Complaint, and it is told, that here Religion is given up to the Lusts and Pleasure of men, though it be an hundred times repeated, that command what the King will in prejudice of the Divine Law, no Obedience is due. If again it be proved that Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, in what notions soever, are subjects, as well as others, and no less tied to obedience than others; upon this come in vehement out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, as if the Throne and Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> were overturned and betrayed, with other such like Expressions in their harsh Stile.

he hath not burthened our Consciences: what tyranny is it to bind <hi>a yoak upon us which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not able to bear?</hi> Whereby as our Christian liberty is invaded, so innumerable Schisms and Scandals spring from no other thing so much, as from these oppressions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which are so much the more unjust, that the imposers acknowledging their indifferency, and the refusers scrupling their lawfulness, the peace of the Church is sacrificed to what is acknowledged indifferent: neither can any bounds be fixed to those impositions; for if one particular may be added, why not more and more still, till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And besides all these general considerations, there is one particular against significant Rites, which is, that the instituting of them in order to a particular signification of any Grace, makes them Sacraments, according to the vulgar definition of Sacraments, that they are the outward signs of an inward Grace: but the instituting of Sacraments, is by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66109:83"/>
signs of it. Upon all these accounts, I plead the Rule of Scripture to be that which ought to determine about all divine matters, and that no binding Laws ought to be made in divine things wherein we are left at liberty by <hi>GOD,</hi> who is the only Master of our Consciences. <hi>See from pag.</hi> 172. <hi>to pag.</hi> 180.</p>

               <p>You have now given me a full Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, after which I doubt not but you triumph as if you had shattered me all to pieces: but I am afraid you shall find this Volley of chained Ball hath quite missed me, and that I be aboard of you ere you be aware. No man can with more hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness acknowledg the compleatness of Scripture than my self: and one part of it is, that all things which tend to Order, Edification and Peace be done, and the Scene of the World alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, that what now tends to advance Order, Edification, and Peace, may afterwards occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion disorder; destruction and contention, the Scripture had not been compleat, if in these things there were not an Authority on Earth, to make and unmake Laws in things indifferent. I acknowledg the <hi>adding of new pieces of worship,</hi> hath so many inconveniences hanging about it, that I should not much patronize it: but the determining of what may be done, either in this or that fashion to any particular Rule, is not of that nature: Therefore, since Worship must be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66109:83"/>
in a certain posture, a certain habit, in a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate place, and on such times, all these being of one kind; Laws made about them upon the accounts of order, edification, or peace, do not pretend to prejudg the perfection of Scripture, by any additions to what it prescribes; since no new thing is introduced: Indeed did humane Law-givers pretend that by their Laws these things became of their own nature more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to <hi>GOD,</hi> they should invade <hi>GOD</hi>'s Prerogative; but when they are prescribed only upon the account of Decency and Order, it is intolerable peevishness to call a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent of its nature, unlawful, because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: For the Christian liberty consists in the exemption of our Consciences from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane yoak, but not of our actions, which are still in the power of our Superiors, till they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join what is sinful, and then a greater than they is to be obeyed. I acknowledg, the simplicity of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is one of its chief Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nothing being enjoined in it but what is most properly fitted for advancing the Souls of men towards that wherein their blessedness doth consist: And therefore I never reflect without wonder, on that Censure <hi>Ammian Marcellin,</hi> a Heathen Writer, gives of <hi>Constantius, That he confounded the Christian Religion, which was of it self pure and simple, with doating superstitions</hi>:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66109:84"/>
So I freely acknowledg that whosoever intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new parts of Worship, as if they could commend us to <hi>GOD,</hi> do highly encroach on <hi>GOD</hi>'s Authority, and man's Liberty. But as for the determining of things that may be done in a variety of ways into one particular form, such as the prescribing a set form for Worship, the ordering the posture in Sacraments, the habit in Worship, determinate times for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating great mercies, the time how long a Sinner must declare his penitence, ere he be admitted to the use of the Sacraments, and the like (which is all in question among us) they are quite of another nature. And it is a strange piece of nicety, if in these things, because Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours command what seems most proper for expressing the inward sense we ought to have of things, that therefore these injunctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come criminal, and not to be obeyed. For the significancy alledged to be in them, is only a dumb way of expressing our inward thoughts; and as we agree to express them by word, so some outward signs may be also used: as by sackcloth the penitent expresseth his sorrow, and by a Surplice a Church man expresseth his purity; so those habits are only a silent way of speaking out the sense of the heart. Only here on the way, if you have a mind to ease your spleen a little, read what that late Pamphlet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66109:84"/>
saith, to prove a distinction betwixt these two Ceremonies, <hi>pag.</hi> 111. That vulgar Sophism of making Sacraments, is the poorest Cavil imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: for a Sacrament is a federate Rite of stipulating with <hi>GOD,</hi> wherein as we plight our faith to <hi>GOD,</hi> so he visibly makes offer of his Gospel to us, which he accompanies with the gracious effusions of his Spirit: and indeed to institute any such Rite, were the highest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on the divine Authority: But what Sophistry will fasten a pretension to this on the institution of a Right, which shall only signifie that Duty a creature ows his Maker and Redeemer, tending both to quicken the person that performs it to a sence of it, as also to work upon Spectators by such a grave solemn Rite? To say Men can institute means of conveying the divine Grace, is justly to be condemned; but how far differs it from that, to use signs, as well as words, for expressing our duty to <hi>GOD?</hi> Thus you see how ill founded that pompou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Gospel, a Contention did early rise about the observation of <hi>Moses Law,</hi> the stipulation whereto was given in Circumcision; the <hi>Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> pleaded its continuance, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> asserted the <hi>Christian Liberty:</hi> the <hi>Iudaizers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a divine Obligation from <hi>Moses his Law</hi>; the <hi>Apostles</hi> proved that was now vacated by the death of CHRIST, which freed all from that Yoak, and that therefore to be circumcised, as a stipulation to <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> was to continue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that Yoak, and so to deny the <hi>Messias</hi> was yet come, by which CHRIST should profit them nothing. But the authority of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> not being great enough to settle that Question, they were sent from <hi>Antioch</hi> to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined against the necessity of Circumcision, and consequently of the observation of the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> and appointed that these who were proselyted from <hi>Gentilism</hi> to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> should be received, not as <hi>Proselytes of Iustice,</hi> but as <hi>Proselytes of the Gates,</hi> who were only bound to obey the seven Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi>; which I stand not to make out, it being sufficiently cleared already by others. Here then the <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> was stated in an exemption from <hi>the Law of Moses.</hi> But for all this, we see into what compliances the <hi>Apostles</hi> consented, for gaining upon the <hi>Iews</hi> by that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:66109:85"/>
condescension, they Circumcise, they Purifie (which was done by sprinkling with the ashes of the red Cow) they take the Vows of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarism,</hi> they keep the Feasts at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (which I wonder how that Pamphleteer could deny, <hi>pag.</hi> 301. it being mentioned expresly, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.21.) and upon the whole matter Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives the following Rules and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions.</p>
               <p>The first was, that these things did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Man to <hi>GOD: For the Kingdom of GOD consisted not in meat and drink,</hi> (which clearly relates to the <hi>Mosaical</hi> differencing of Meats, clean and unclean) <hi>that neither Circumcision nor uncircumcision availed any thing.</hi> And if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of that Controversie did of its own nature commend men to <hi>GOD</hi>; what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may we pass on our trifling wranglings? Whence we may infer, that we ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct all <hi>Christians in the Faith,</hi> but not in these doubtful Disputations.</p>
               <p>The next Assertion is, That even in these matters men might be acceptable to GOD, on which side soever they were, so they judged what they did was done to GOD. He that made distinction of Days, or Meats, <hi>made it to the LORD, and he that regarded them not to the LORD, he regarded them not.</hi> So that GOD may be acceptably served by several
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66109:86"/>
men doing things contrary one to another.</p>
               <p>Another Rule is, That in these things every Man must be fully persuaded in his own mind, and proceed out of a clear conviction in his Conscience.</p>
               <p>A fourth Rule is, That in these matters none ought to prescribe or dictate to another: such as had a liberty in them, were not to despise the scrupulous, as unreasonable; neither were these who scrupled at them, to judg such as acted in a higher Sphere of Liberty, as profane or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious: so that all were to be remitted to <hi>GOD's Iudgment Seat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Rule is, That for <hi>the Peace of the Church,</hi> many things which are otherwise sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to great inconveniencies, may be done for the gaining our Brethren: but if such compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance harden people in their imperious humor, what was formerly to be done for gaining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, becomes unfit when so abused by them; and therefore if after we have complied with the weak exceptions of others, in matters indifferent, they become so hardy as to presume upon our goodness to invade our Liberty, by enjoying such things as necessary, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an authority over us; <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The last Rule is, That in matters of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we are to postpone our own inclination, or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:66109:86"/>
desires, when the hazard of our brother's stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or of the Peace of the Church lies in our way.</p>
               <p>All these are so clearly asserted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and withal are so opposite to our present Heats, that I wish they were more minded by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of our <hi>Israel,</hi> and they would certainly give a speedy decision to these Feuds about doubtful disputations, which have so long prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Peace of the Church.</hi>

               <p>And I am sure if so great a Compliance may be given to the weakness of our brethren, much more is due to the commands of our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors; except you say, we are more subject to equals than to Superiors, or that the weakness of a Brother should weigh more than the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Father: And in fine, that the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Charity</hi> should be more prevalent than those of <hi>Iustice; Obedience</hi> being a debt we owe, whereas <hi>Compliance</hi> is a Benevolence given.

I also acknowledge, that great abuse hath followed upon the innovating and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in <hi>Divine matters,</hi> and that nothing hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned more <hi>divisions among Christians,</hi> than the overstraining an <hi>Uniformity.</hi> But if because of abuses you overturn all <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in matters sacred, nothing that is humane shall scape your fury, since every thing is subject to abuse. And nothing will curb ones Career till he turn <hi>Quaker,</hi> that follows these Maxims. But one thing is still forgotten, that the <hi>dictates of Reason</hi> are in their kind the <hi>Voice of God</hi>; Reason being nothing, save an impress of the Image of <hi>God</hi> on the Soul of man; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause much obliterated by the Fall, was to be supplied by Revelation: but wherein it remains clear, its directions not contradicting any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or revealed Law, are still to be followed as the Laws of <hi>God.</hi>

               <p>For proving all this, I shall not run so far back as to examine the nature of the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and Sacrifices were before</hi> Moses, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether these flow'd from a <hi>Revelation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by <hi>Tradition,</hi> or from the <hi>dictates of Reason?</hi> But after <hi>Moses his Law</hi> was given, wherein all was modelled by <hi>Divine prescript,</hi> yet what a vast heap of <hi>additions</hi> did flow upon that worship before our Saviour's days, all that have written on the Temple service do abundantly discover.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66109:87"/>
Here is a Field spacious enough for any that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed a vain shew of much reading; but a view of <hi>Doctor Lightfoot's Temple-Service</hi> will quickly convince any, that the whole Service of the Temple was interpalated by many Additions, whose first Author cannot be traced. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so used <hi>Baptism</hi> to all who were proselyted from <hi>Gentilism.</hi> And in the <hi>Paschal Festivity</hi> alone, how many new Rites do we find? Every School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy may know that they had a Dish, called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raseth,</hi> which was a thick Sawce of Dates, Figs, Almonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pounded together, which looked like Clay, to mind them of the Clay in which their Fathers wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was a significative Ceremony; and was the Dish wherein they dipped their hand, which we find was not wanting in our <hi>Lord</hi>'s Passover; which proves significant Rites, tho of humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, cannot be criminal. And if to this I should add the several Cups of Wine, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers removes of the Table, and covering it of new, the frequent washing of their hands, and divers other things, I should grow tedious. But our <hi>Lord</hi> never reproves these things; nay, on the contrary he symbolized with them. It is true, when their Zeal for their <hi>Traditions</hi> made them break the <hi>Commandments of</hi> God, or adhere so stifly to them, as to judge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of such as did not comply with them in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:66109:88"/>
the use of them, then he checks their Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and accuses them, not for the use of these things, but because they placed all Religion in them, and imposed the Precepts of men as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. To this I might add the whole frame of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> both as to <hi>Government, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Worship</hi>: for whatsoever scraps may be brought which may seem to prove there were <hi>Synagogues</hi> before the Captivity, which yet is much controverted; yet the form of <hi>Government</hi> in them, the rules of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, together with their <hi>Philacteries,</hi> and set <hi>forms of Worship,</hi> will never be <hi>proved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> Now since the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was no less perfect in the <hi>Old Dispensation,</hi> than the <hi>Gospel</hi> is now, it will follow that <hi>Additions</hi> in things purely external and ritual, do no way detract from the Word of <hi>God:</hi> For nothing can be brought to prove the <hi>New Testament</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Rule for <hi>Christians,</hi> which will not plead the same full authority to the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> during that <hi>Dispensation</hi>; since though the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi> was imperfect, yet the Revelation of <hi>God</hi> to them was <hi>able to make them perfect and throughly furnished foe every good work:</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>were able to make wise to salvation,</hi> can be no other than the <hi>Old Testament writings.</hi> For besides that by <hi>Scriptures</hi> nothing else is understood in the <hi>New
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66109:88"/>
Testament,</hi> there could be no other <hi>Scripture</hi> known to <hi>Timothy</hi> of a Child, but these of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> If then they trespass upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and its blessed Author, who assert a Power to determine about Rituals in Worship, or other matters of <hi>Religion</hi>; they committed the same Crime who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add to what <hi>Moses</hi> prescribed, since he was also <hi>faithful in all his house.</hi> Or if any plead a Divine Warrant for these Institutions which were traditionally conveyed, this will open a door for all the pretences of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> since the Expressions that cancel <hi>Traditions,</hi> are as full in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> as in the <hi>New.</hi> And thus far I think I have evinced, that there were great additions in Rituals made by the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that these were not unlawful, since com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with by him who never did amiss, and yet these could have no higher o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iginal than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority. I go on to the <hi>New Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wherein I doubt not to evince, that as for rituals, most of these they found in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> were retained, without any other change than what that <hi>Dispensation</hi> drew after it, and that they took both the Rules of Government, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Discipline from the <hi>Synagogue.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Epistles</hi> do not, when treating of these matters, speak in their Stile, who are institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new things; but of those who are giving
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:66109:89"/>
directions about what was already received and known: For if new Rules had been to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Institution had been express, either in the <hi>Gospels, Acts,</hi> or <hi>Epistles.</hi> Now if any will read these without prejudice, no such thing will appear: of which manner of Stile, no account can be given; but that things, as to Rituals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as they were, the use of the Sacraments being only instituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> where the Language of an Institution is express.</p>
               <p>About two hundred years after <hi>Christ,</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Penitence was brought into the Church, and scandalous Persons were, according to the nature of Scandals, debarred from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a long space, and were by degrees, and according to the heighth of their Penitence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the Communion of the Church, but not after some years had passed in outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Penitence: and the modelling of this became after that, the chief Care of <hi>Synods</hi> for divers Centuries. Now if one will argue, that though it be true a scandalous Person should be excommunicated; yet since <hi>God</hi> hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at whatsoever time a Sinner repents, so should the Church (which only judgeth of the Profession) forgive at whasoever time one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth Penitence. It will not be easie in your Principles to answer this: and see how you will clear this practice of Discipline from Tyranny,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66109:89"/>
since to debar men from the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> is a greater dominion over Consciences than the determining about Rituals.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer home, there was a certain Society you have heard of <hi>ycleped the Kirk,</hi> which had divers Books of Discipline containing rules for that, and a Directory for Worship, which had no few rules neither: they had also a frame of Government, the Supreme Judicatory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was composed of three Ministers, and one ruling Elder from each Presbytery, a ruling Elder beside from each Burrough, two being allowed the Metropolis, and a Commissioner was sent from each University; and in this High Court the King came in with the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of a Burgh: for though the Metropolis had two, he was allowed to send but one with a single Suffrage to represent him; and this Court pretended to an Authority from <hi>Christ,</hi> and their Authority was Sacred with no less certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, than <hi>he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi> Now how a Power can be committed to dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates without any Commission for it from the Superior, will not be easily made out. And they will search long ere they find a Divine Warrant for this Court, unless they vouch <hi>Mary Mitchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Testimony</hi> for it, whose hysterical Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were given out for Prophesies. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are so tender of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> that no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66109:90"/>
Law must pass about the Rituals of Religion, yet their Books of Discipline and Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not only setled by Law, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sworn to be maintained in the Covenant, wherein they swore <hi>the Preservation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in</hi> Scotland, <hi>in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government.</hi> These were the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences that could not hear of any Law in <hi>matters indifferent,</hi> and yet would have all swear to their Forms, many of which they could not but know were indifferent: which was a making them necessary at another rate, than is done by a Law which the Legislator can repeal when he will: and never were any in the world more addicted to their own Forms than they were. An instance of this I will give, which I dare say will surprise you: When some designers for popularity in the <hi>Western</hi> parts of that Kirk, did begin to disuse the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> in Worship, and the singing the <hi>Conclusion or Doxology</hi> after the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and <hi>the Minister's kneeling for private Devotion</hi> when he entred the Pulpit, the <hi>General <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ssembly</hi> took this in very ill part, and in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they wrote to the Presbyteries, complained sadly, <hi>Of a Spirit of Innovation was beginning to get into the Kirk, and to throw these laudible practices out of it, mentioning the three I named, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be still practised; and such as refused obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are appointed to be conferr'd with in order to the

giving of them satisfaction: and if they continu'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, the Presbyteries were to proceed against them, as they should be answerable to the next general Assembly.</hi> This Letter I can produce authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally attested. But is it not strange, that some who were then zealous to condemn these Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, should now be carried with the herd to be guilty of them? I am become hoarse with speaking so long, and so I must break off, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I suppose, given many great Precedents from History for the using of <hi>Rites in divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> without an express Warrant, and for <hi>passing Laws</hi> upon these, and have cleared the one of Superstition, and the other of Tyranny.</p>

               <p>In order to a clear progress in this matter, I shall first discuss the <hi>nature and power of the Church,</hi> by which a step shall be made to <hi>the Power the Magistrate</hi> may pretend to in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Sacred. The Apostles being sent by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> did every where promulgate the Gospel, and required such as received it, to meet often together for joint Worship, and the free profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Faith, wherein they were particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to the use of the Sacraments. The Apostles, and after them, all Church-men, were also endued with a double Power: The one was declarative for promulgating the Gospel: the other was directive, which properly is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and by this they were to advise in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein they had no warrant to command: So S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote sometimes his own sense, which he did by <hi>permission,</hi> and not by <hi>commandment,</hi> only he advised, <hi>as one that had obtained mercy to be faithful.</hi> But because <hi>Christ</hi> was to be <hi>in his Church to the end of the World,</hi> the things they had heard were to be committed to <hi>faithful men, that they might be able to teach others.</hi> All Church men being thus the Successors of the Apostles, they are vested with a <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> for solemn publishing the Gospel; but with this odds from the Apostles, <hi>That whereas they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66109:92"/>
were infallible, their Successors are subject to error.</hi> And the power of Church-men consists formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, that they are <hi>Heralds of the Gospel</hi>: and by their preaching it, a solemn offer of it is made to all their hearers, which to despise, is to <hi>despise him that sent them.</hi> But in this power they are bound up to the Commission they have from God, so that what they say beyond that, is none of the divine Message. Yet because many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars may fall in, about which it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Rules could be given, they have a directive Authority, which if it be managed as <hi>S. Paul</hi> did, we need fear no tyrannical imposition from it. And therefore in these matters their definitions are not binding Laws, but Rules of advice: for in matters wherein we are left at liberty by God, if Church-men pretend to a Dominion over our Souls, they make us the servants of Men. And indeed it is the most incoherent thing imaginable, for these who lay no claim to Infallibility, to pretend to absolute obedience. It is true, the Laws of peace and order bind us to an association, if we be Christians: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to yield in many things for peace: but since we are all a <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> why Church-men should pretend to Authority or Jurisdiction, except in that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly in their Commission, wherein they are purely Heralds, I do not see. It is true, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66109:93"/>
ought to assemble for Worship, but for the associations of Churches in Judicatories, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine in what corner of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> that shall be found: In which I am the more confirmed, since all the labor of that Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer from <hi>p.</hi> 126. <hi>to</hi> 144. could not find it out. For it is a strange Method to prove a divine Warrant, because some reasons are brought to prove it must be so: to have cited the words, where a shorter and clearer method of proof; since to prove that such a thing must be, and yet not to shew that it is, is only to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Scripture, for being defective in that which it ought to have contained. But if the phrase of <hi>one body</hi> conclude a proof for Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then since the Body includes all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, the whole faithful must meet together in Councils. For where have you a difference in that betwixt the Clergy, and the faithful Laicks? But here yielding your Laick Elders of divine Institution, and to have from <hi>GOD</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Ruling, as well as the Ministers have, then why do they not all come to Presbyteries? And why but one deputed from them? Was not this an Encroachment on them? For if they have from CHRIST a power to Rule, as well as Ministers, why should not all the Elders meet in Presbyteries and Synods, as well as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters? And why but one Elder from every
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66109:93"/>
Presbytery, when three Ministers go to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod? For it is folly to say, because Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters have a power of teaching, therefore in Presbyteries and Synods the Elders must only equal their number, and in National Synods be near half their number: for that will only say that in matters of doctrine the Elders should be quite silent, but in matters of discipline, why all should not come if any have a right from Christ, will not be proved. And is not this to <hi>Lord it over your Brethren?</hi> And do not your Ministers thus tyrannize over their Elders? But the reason of it was visible, lest the Elders had thereby got the power in their hands, had they been the plurality in the Judicatories: which was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough foreseen and guarded against by your Clergy, who though they were willing to serve themselves of them for a while, yet had no mind to part with their beloved Authority. But for Synods, if the obligation to them be from the unity of the Body, then nothing under an OE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical one will answer this, which yet is simply unpracticable. Now as for your National Synods, it is visible they are and must be framed, according to the divisions of the World in the several Kingdoms: for according to the Rules are pretended from Scripture <hi>(tell the Church, the binding and loosing of sins,</hi> or the like) it follows that Parochial Congregations, and the Pastors
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66109:94"/>
in them, are vested with an authoritative power: now why they should be made to resign this to the plurality of the Church-men of that Kingdom, will be a great Atchievement to prove in your Principles. For why shall not a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Church make Laws within it self? And why must it renounce its priviledg to such a number of Church-men cast in such a Classis by a humane power? As likewise, where find you a divine Warrant for your delegating Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to Synods? For either they are Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, or such as go upon a restricted depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but so as their Votes beyond their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission shall signifie nothing, till they return and be approved by those who sent them; if they go with a full power, assign a Warrant for such a delegation, or that many Church-men may commissionate one in their name, and that what shall be agreed to by the major part of these delegates, shall be a binding obligation on Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: and yet I know you will think the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> carry the Cause, if it be said that the appointments of these superiour Courts have no authority till ratified by the inferiour, which will resolve the Power into the inferiour Courts. By all which I think it is clear abundantly, that the associations of Churches into Synods, cannot be by a divine Warrant. But I must call in some relief, for I grow weary of speaking too long.</p>

               <p>I suppose none will deny the associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches to be an excellent mean for preserving unity and peace: but to assert a divine original for them, methinks, is a hard task; and truly to assert the divine Authority of the major part which must be done according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Presbytery, is a thing fuller of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over Consciences, than any thing can be feared from Episcopacy; since the greater part of mankind being evil, which holds true of no sort of people more, than of Church-men, what mischief may be expected if the plurality must decide all matters; And to speak plainly, I look on a potion of Physick as the best cure for him, who can think a National Synod, according to the model of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> is the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> on Earth, or that Court to which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Authority, for he seems beyond the power or conviction of Reason.</p>

               <p>The Scripture clearly holds forth an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among Church-men, but visibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted to their Commission, which truly is not properly a power residing among them, for they only declare what the Rule of the Gospel is; wherein if they keep close to it, they are only Publishers of the Laws of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> and if they err from it, they are not to be regarded: It is true, the administration of Sacraments is appropriated to them, yet he that will argue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66109:95"/>
this to have proceeded more from the general rules of Order, the constant practice of the Church, and the fitness of the thing, which is truly sutable to the dictates of Nature, and the Laws of Nations; than from an express positive Command, needs much Logick to make good his attempt. It is true, the ordaining of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in their Office belongs undoubtedly to them, and in trying them, Rules are expresly given out in Scripture, to which they ought to adhere and follow them: but as for other things, they are either decisions of opinions, or rules for practice. In the former their authority is purely to declare, and in that they act but as Men, and we find whole Schools of them have been abused; and in the other, they only give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and directions; but have no Jurisdiction. It is true, much noise is made about the Council of <hi>Ierusalem, p.</hi> 106, as if that were a warrant for Synods to meet together. But first, it is clear no command is there given, so at most that will prove Synods to be lawful, but that gives them no authority, except you produce a clear Command for them, and obedience to them. Next, what strange wresting of Scripture is it, from that place to prove the subordination of Church Judicatories? for if that Council was not an OEcumenical Council, nor a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial one, which must be yielded, since we see
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66109:95"/>
nothing like a Convocation; then either <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were sent from <hi>Antioch,</hi> as from one sister Church to ask advice of another; and if so, it proves nothing for the authority of Synods, since advices are not Laws: or <hi>Antioch</hi> sent to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> as to a Superior Church by its constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot be imagined: for what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> pretend over <hi>Antioch</hi>? And indeed had that been true, some vestige of it had remained in History; which is so far to the contrary, that the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was subordinate to the Church of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> which was Metropolitan in <hi>Palestine,</hi> was subject to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> the third Patriarchal Sea. It will therefore remain that this was only a reference to the other Apostles, who besides their extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and inspiration, were acknowledged by all to be men of great eminency and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: and therefore the authority of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> not being at that time so universally acknowledged, they were sent to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where S. <hi>Iames</hi> was resident, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally present. Now the Authority of the Decree must be drawn from their infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; otherwise it will prove too much, that one Church may give out decrees to another. But will the Apostles mutual consulting or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together, prove the National constitution, and authority of Synods or Assemblies?</p>

               <p>All that hath been said illustrates clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the practice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> among whom as the High-Priest was possessed with a Prophetical Spirit, which sometimes fell on him by illapses, as apears from what is said of <hi>Caiaphas</hi>; and sometimes from the shining of the Stones in the Pectoral, called the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>; so the <hi>Priests and Levites</hi> being the chief Trustees and Depositaries of the Law, <hi>Their lips were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve knowledg, and the Law was to be sought at their mouth,</hi> yet they had no Legislative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: they had indeed a Court among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, called the <hi>Parhedrim,</hi> made up of the heads of the Orders, and of the Families; but that Court did not pretend to Jurisdiction, but only to explain things that concerned the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-worship: nay, the High-Priest was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted to the <hi>King and Sanbedrim,</hi> that he might not consult the Oracle without he had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to do it by them: neither do we ever hear of any Laws given out, all the <hi>Old Testament</hi> over, in the name of the Priests. And in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> the Power (it seems) was to be managed by the body of the faithful, as well as by Church-men. It is true, the Apostles were clothed with an extraordinary power of <hi>binding and loosing of sins</hi>; but no proofs are brought to justifie the pretences to Jurisdiction that are found among their Successors. For in the <hi>Epistle</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:66109:96"/>
to <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Rules there laid down, are addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to <hi>all the Saints that were called to be faithful:</hi> so also is the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> where he tells them to <hi>note such as walked disorderly, and have no fellowship with them</hi>; which are shrewd grounds to believe that at first all things were managed Parochially, where the faithful were also admitted to determine about what occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but for Synods, we find not the least vestige of them before the end of the second Century, that Synods were gathered about the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie concerning the day of <hi>Easter</hi>; and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Associations of Churches, shew clearly, that they took their model from the division of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and so according as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces were divided, the Churches in them did associate to the Metropolitans, and became sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to them, and these were subordinate to the Patriarchs; by which means it was that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had the precedency, not from any imaginary derivation from <hi>St. Peter:</hi> for had they gone on such Rules, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> where our Lord himself was, had undoubtedly carried it of all the World: but <hi>Rome</hi> being the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> it was the See of the greatest Authority. And no sooner did <hi>Bizantium</hi> creep into the dignity of being the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> but the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was made second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and in all things equal to the Bishop of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66109:97"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> the precedency only excepted. Much might be here said for proving that these Synods did not pretend to a divine Original, though afterwards they claimed a high Authority, yet their appointments were never called Laws, but only Canons and Rules, which could not pretend to a Jurisdiction.</p>

               <p>But that I may not seem to rob the Church of all her Power, I acknowledg that by the Laws of Nature it follows, that these who unite in the service of <hi>GOD,</hi> must be warranted to associate in Meetings to agree on generals Rules, and to use means for preserving purity and order among themselves, and that all Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ought to subject themselves to their Rules. But as for that brave distinction of the Churches Authority, being derived from CHRIST as Mediator, whereas the Regal Authority is from him as <hi>GOD,</hi> well doth it become its inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and much good may it do them. For me, I think, that CHRIST's asserting, that <hi>all power in heaven and in earth was given unto him</hi>; and his being called, <hi>The KING of Kings, and LORD of Lords,</hi> make it as clear as the Sun, that the whole OEconomy of this World is committed to him as Mediator: and as they who died before him, were saved by him, who was <hi>slam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Covenant, by which mankind was preserved from infallible ruin, which otherwise it had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by <hi>Adams</hi> fall. But leaving any further enquiry after such a foolish nicety, I go now to examine what the <hi>Magistrates Power</hi> is in matters of Religion: And first, I lay down for a Maxim, <hi>That the externals of Worship, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not of such importance, as are the Rules of Iustice and Peace, wherein formally the Image of GOD consists.</hi> For CHRIST came to bring us to <hi>GOD:</hi> and the great end of his Gospel, is, the assimilation of us to <hi>GOD,</hi> of which, justice, righteousness, mercy and peace make a great part. Now what sacredness shall be in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Worship and Government, that these must not be medled with by his hands; and what unhallowedness is in the other, that they may fall within his Jurisdiction, my weakness cannot reach. As for instance, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate allows <hi>ten per cent</hi> of in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s to be just or unjust by his Laws: now why he shall not have such a power about outward matters of Worship, or of the Government of the Church, judg you; since the one both in it self, and as it tends to commend us to God, is much more important than the other. It is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66109:98"/>
true, he cannot meddle with the holy things himself; for the Scripture rule is express, that men be <hi>separated for the work of the Ministery:</hi> And without that separation, he invades the Altar of <hi>GOD,</hi> that <hi>taketh that honor upon him, without he be called to it.</hi> But as for giving Laws in the externals of <hi>Religion,</hi> I see not why he may not do it, as well as in matters <hi>Civil.</hi> It is true, if he contradict the divine Law by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>GOD is to be obeyed rather than man.</hi> But this holds in <hi>things Civil,</hi> as well as <hi>Sacred.</hi> For if he command murder, or theft, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be disobeyed, as well as when he commands amiss in matters of <hi>Religion.</hi> In a word, all Subjects are bound to obey him in every lawful command. Except therefore you prove that Church-men constituted in a Synod are not Subjects, they are bound to obedience, as well as others: Neither doth this Authority of the Magistrate any way prejudge the power <hi>Christ</hi> hath committed to his Church: For a Father hath power over his Children, and that by a <hi>divine Precept,</hi> tho the Supreme Authority have power over him, and them both: so the Churches authority is no way inconsistent with the Kings Supremacy. As for their <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Power,</hi> it is not at all subject to him, only the exercise of it, to this or that person, may be suspended: For since the Magistrate can banish
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66109:98"/>
his Subjects, he may well silence them: Yet I acknowledg if he do this, out of a design to drive the Gospel out of his Dominions, they ought to continue in their duty, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such prohibition; <hi>for GOD must be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather than man.</hi> And this was the case of the <hi>Primitive Bishops,</hi> who rather than give over the feeding their Flocks, laid themselves open to Martyrdom. But this will not hold for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting turbulent persons, who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magistrates continuing all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements for the publick Worship of <hi>GOD,</hi> chuse rather than concur in it (tho not one of an hundred of them hath the confidence to call that unlawful) to gather separated Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby the flocks are scattered.</p>

               <p>Nay, since you are on that Subject, let me freely lay open the mischief of it: It is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect breach of the Laws of the Gospel, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our solemn assembling together, which must ever bind all Christians, till there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the very constitutions of these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that renders our meeting in them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: which few pretend in our case. Next, the Magistrates commanding these publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, is certainly a clear and superadded ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which must bind all under sin, till they can prove these our Meetings for Worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. And as these separated Conventicles
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:66109:99"/>
are of their own nature evil, so their effects are yet worse, and such as indeed all the ignorance and profanity in the Land is to be charged on them: for as they dissolve the union of the Church, which must needs draw mischief after it, so the vulgar are taught to despise their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and the publick Worship, and thus get loose from the yoak. And their dependence on these separated Meetings, being but preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as they break away from the order of the Church, so they are not tied to their own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and thus betwixt hands, the vulgar lose all sense of Piety, and of the Worship of <hi>GOD.</hi> Next, in these separated Meetings, nothing is to be had but a long preachment, so that the knowledg and manners of the people not being look'd after, and they taught to revolt from the setled <hi>Discipline,</hi> and to disdain to be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Truly, what you have laid out is so well known to us all, that I am confident <hi>Isotimus</hi> himself must with much sorrow acknowledg what wicked Arts these are that some use to dislocate the Body of Christ, and to sacrifice the interests of <hi>Religion</hi> to their vanity, humor, or perhaps their secular interests. But I hold on my design, and add, that if the Magistrate encroach on God's Prerogative, by <hi>contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abrogating divine Laws,</hi> all he doth that way, falls on himself. But as for the Churches <hi>Directive Power,</hi> since the exercise of that is not of obligation, he may command a surcease in it. It is true, he may sin in so doing; yet cases may be wherein he will do right to discharge all Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of Judicatories, if a Church be in such commotion, that these Synods would but add to the flame: but certainly he forbidding such Synods; they are not to be gone about, there being no positive command for them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and therefore a discharge of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts no Law of <hi>God,</hi> and so cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed without sin: and when the Magistrate allows of Synods, he is to judg on whether side
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:66109:100"/>
in case of differences, he will pass his Law: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the decision of these Synods obligatory in prejudice of his authority; for there can be but one Supream; and two Coordinate Powers are a <hi>Chymaera.</hi> Therefore in case a Synod and the Magistrate contradict one another in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters undetermined by <hi>GOD,</hi> it is certain a Synod sins if it offer to countermand the <hi>Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> since all must be subject to the Powers that are, of which number the Synod is a part; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are subject as well as others. And if they be bound to obey the Magistrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they cannot have a power to warrant the subjects in their disobedience, since they cannot secure themselves from sin by such disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And in the case of such countermands, it is indisputable the Subjects are to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Magistrates Laws, by which only the Rules of Synods are Laws, or bind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences formally; since without they be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by him, they cannot be Laws; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve two Masters, nor be subject to two Legislators. And thus, methinks, enough is said for clearing the Title of the <hi>Magistrate in exacting our obedience to his Laws in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

               <p>Indeed, the congesting of all the <hi>Old Testament</hi> offers, for proving the Civil Powers their authority in things sacred, were a task of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:66109:100"/>
time: And first of all, that the High Priest might not consult the Oracle, but when either desired by the King, or in a business that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the whole Congregation, is a great step to prove what the Civil Authority was in those matters. Next, we find the Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> give out many Laws about matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: I shall wave the instances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> which are so express, that no evasion can serve the turn, but to say they acted by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Commission, and were inspired of GOD. It is indeed true, that they had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction from GOD. But it is as clear, that they enacted these Laws upon their own Authority, as Kings, and not on a Prophetical Power.</p>
               <p>But we find <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 7. send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Princes to teach in the Cities of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> with whom also he sent <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> and they went about and taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There you see secular men appointed by the King to teach the people: he also, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 5. set up in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Court made up of <hi>Levites, Priests, and the chief of the Fathers of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, for the judgment of the LORD, and for the controversies among the people</hi>; and names two Presidents, <hi>Amariah the chief Priest to be over them in the matters of the LORD, and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badiah for all the Kings matters.</hi> And he that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66109:101"/>
will consider these words, either as they lie in themselves, or as they relate to the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of that Court of seventy by <hi>Moses,</hi> where no mention is made but by one Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or to the Commentary of the whole Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and Histories of the <hi>Iews,</hi> shall be set beyond dispute, that here was but one Court to judg both of sacred and secular matters. It is true, the <hi>Priests</hi> had a Court already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it was no Judicatory, and medled only with the Rituals of the Temple. The <hi>Levites</hi> had also, as the other Tribes, a Court of twenty three for their Tribe, which have occasioned the mistakes of some places among the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writings: but this is so clear from their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that a very overly knowledg of them will satisfie an impartial Observer. And it is yet more certain, that from the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> to the destruction of the Temple, there was but one Court, that determined of all matters both Sacred and Civil; who particularly tried the Priests, if free of the blemishes which might cast one from the service, and could cognosce on the High Priest, and whip him when he failed in his duty. Now this commixtion of these matters in one Judicatory, if it had been so criminal, whence is it that our <hi>LORD</hi> not only never reproved so great a disorder, but when convened before them, did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:66109:101"/>
their constitution, and answered to the High Priest when adjured by him? Likewise, when his Apostles were arraigned before them, they never declined that Judicatory, but plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own innocence, without accusing the constitution of the Court, though challenged upon a matter of doctrine. But they, <hi>good men,</hi> thought only of catching Souls into the Net of the Gospel, and were utterly unacquainted with these new coined distinctions. Neither did they refuse obedience, pretending the Court had no Jurisdiction in these matters, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was better to obey <hi>GOD</hi> than Man; which saith, They judged Obedience to that Court due, if it had not countermanded <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> we find him constituting these Courts, and choosing the persons and empowering them for their work, <hi>for he constituted them for Iudgment and for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie</hi>; so that though it were yielded, as it will never be proved, that two Courts were here instituted, yet it cannot be denied, but here is a Church Judicatory constituted by a King, the persons named by him, a President appointed over them, and a trust committed to them. And very little Logick will serve to draw from this, as much as the Acts among us, asserting the King's Supremacy yield to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:66109:102"/>
Next, We have a clear instance of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. with the <hi>Counsel of his Princes, and of the whole Congregation,</hi> made a <hi>decree for keeping the Passover,</hi> that year <hi>on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Month,</hi> whereas the Law of <hi>GOD</hi> had affixed it to the <hi>first Month,</hi> leaving only an exception, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>for the unclean,</hi> or such <hi>as were on a journey,</hi> to keep it on the second Month. Npon which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> and people, appoints the Passover to be entirely cast over to the second Month for that Year. Where a very great point of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (for the distinction of days was no small matter to the <hi>Iews</hi>) was determined by the King, without asking the advice of the Priests upon it. But that you may not think this was peculiar to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> I shall urge you with other instances: When <hi>Ezra</hi> came from <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> he brings a Commission from him, <hi>Ezra ch.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. impowering him <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wisdom of his GOD, that was in his hand, to set up Magistrates and Iudges, who might judg them that knew the Laws of his GOD, and teach them that knew them not:</hi> and a severe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate is passed upon the disobedient; and one of the branches of their punishment, which is by the Translators rendered <hi>banishment,</hi> being in the <hi>Chaldaick, rooting out,</hi> is by some judged to be <hi>Excommunication</hi>; which is the more probable,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:66109:102"/>
because afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he threatens on these who came not upon his Proclamation, is, <hi>forfeiture of goods, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Congregation.</hi> Here then it seems a Heathen King gives authority to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: but be in that what will, <hi>Ezra</hi> upon his return acted in a <hi>high Character,</hi> he makes the <hi>Priests, Levites,</hi> and all <hi>Israel,</hi> to swear to put away their strange Wives: he convenes all the people under the Certificate of separation from the Congregation, and enjoyns Confession of their sins and amendment: and we find both him and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> acting in a <hi>high Character</hi> about the ordering of divine matters, which could only flow from the King's Commission, for neither of them were Prophets, nor was <hi>Ezra</hi> the High Priest but his Brother, and so no more than an ordinary Priest. <hi>Mordecai</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise instituted the feast of <hi>Purim,</hi> for which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could warrant him, but the King's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, committed to him, who gave him his Ring for sealing such Orders, since he was neither King, Priest nor Prophet. And on the way, let me observe what occurs from that History, for proving what was yesterday pleaded for, <hi>The Subjects ought not to resist, no not the tyranny of their Superiours,</hi> since a Writing was procured from <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> for warranting the <hi>Iews</hi> to avenge themselves, and to stand for their lives,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:66109:103"/>
and to destroy and slay all that would assault them, which saith they might not have done this before that writing was given out, and yet their killing of 74000 of their Enemies shews, what their strength was. But all I have said will prove that the Civil Powers under the Old Testament did formally judg about matters of Religion; and that that priviledg belongs to Kings by vertue of their Regal dignity, and not as they are in Covenant with <hi>GOD,</hi> since even Heathen Kings give out Orders about divine matters.</p>

               <p>If from Sacred you descend to humane practices, nothing was more used than that the Emperors judged in matters of Religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this yielded to them only after they became Christians, but <hi>Eusebius, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. tells, how they made application to <hi>Aurelian</hi> a Heathen Emperor, for turning <hi>Samosatenus</hi> out of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who decreed that the Houses of the Church should be given to those Bishops, whom the Christians of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops should recommend to them. <hi>Constantine</hi> also, when not baptized, did all his life formally judg in matters both of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline: and for the Laws they made about Church matters, they abound so much, that, as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>One needs not read them, but look on them to be satisfied about this.</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:66109:103"/>
And indeed I know not how to express my wonder at the affrontedness of that Pamphleter, who denies this, <hi>pag.</hi> 483. Pray ask him, was the determining about the age, the qualifications, the Election, the duties of Church-men, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring for what things they should be deposed, or excommunicated, a formal passing of Laws in Church matters, or only the adding Sanctions to the Church determinations? And yet who will but with his Eye run through either the first six <hi>Titles</hi> of the <hi>Code,</hi> or the 123. <hi>Novel,</hi> besides many other places, all these, and many more Laws about Church matters will meet him. But should I take a full Career here, I am sure I should be tedious, and <hi>Grotius</hi> hath congested so many instances of this, that I refer the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reader to him for full satisfaction. The Elections of Bishops which had been formerly in the hands of the people and Clergy, with the Provincial Synods that judged of them, became so tumultuary, that popular Elections were discharged by the Council of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 13. and the Emperors did either formally name, as <hi>Theodosius</hi> did <hi>Nectarius,</hi> or reserve the ratifying their Election to themselves. And I must confess, it is a pretty piece of History, to say the Bishops consented to this, either as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their Office, or out of ambition. <hi>See p.</hi> 485. Tell your Friends that they must either
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:66109:104"/>
learn more knowledg, or pretend to less; for can they produce the least vestige for the one branch of this alternative, that the Bishops their allowing the Emperor such an interest in their Elections, flowed from a distrust of their Office? Let them give but one scrap of proof for this, and let them triumph as much as they will. Is it not a pretty thing to see one talk so superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liously of things he knows not?</p>

               <p>But all you have brought will never prove that a King may at one stroke subvert a Government established in the Church, and turn out all who adhere to it, and set up another in its place; neither will this conclude that the King may enact all things about Ecclesiastical matters, and Persons, by his own bare authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is a surrender of our consciences to him: certainly, this is to put him in <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s stead, and what mischievous effects may follow upon this, if all matters of Religion be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, by the pleasure of secular and carnal men, who consider their interests and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites more than <hi>God</hi>'s glory, or the good of the Church and of Souls: Truly my heart trembles to think on the effects this both hath produced, and still may bring forth. <hi>See pag.</hi> 483.</p>

               <p>It is charity to ease your Lungs some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by taking a turn in the Discourse, though you need none of my help. But what you say,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:66109:104"/>
                  <hi>Isotimus,</hi> doth no way overturn what hath been asserted: for either the change that was made was necessary, sinful, or indifferent: the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer shall not be at this time debated, but shall be afterwards discussed: but if it be indifferent, then the Kings Laws do oblige us to obedience, and the mischief hath followed on the change falls to their share, who do not obey the King's Laws, when the matter of them is lawful. And as for the thrusting out Church-men when they are guilty, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s precedent is convincing, who thrust out <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>athar</hi> from the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; neither can the least hint be given to prove that he acted as inspired, and not as a King: and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tho but commissionated by <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> thrust one out from the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for marrying a strange Woman.</p>
               <p>For your prying into Acts of Parliament, truly neither you nor I need be so much conversant in them. Neither were it any strange matter, if some expressions in them would not bear a strict Examen. But that you now challenge about the <hi>King's enacting of all matters,</hi> will never infer a surrender of conscience to him; for certainly that must relate to what goeth before, of the <hi>outward Government and Policy of the Church.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, none will quarrel the phrase of the <hi>Kings authority</hi> in all things that are <hi>Civil</hi>; yet that will not infer that he can enact the lawfulness of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:66109:105"/>
murther and theft. So these expressions must carry with them <hi>a tacite exception.</hi> Yea, even without that allowance, the phrase may be well justified, since it only imports that the Kings enacting any thing in these matters, makes them legal, which differs much from lawful; and saith only that such Orders issued forth by the King, are <hi>de facto</hi> Laws, which will not conclude they must be obeyed; but only that his authority is to be acknowledged, either by obedience, if the command be just, or by suffering, if unjust. As for the effects this may produce, I am sure they cannot prove worse than these which have followed upon the pretences of the Churches <hi>absolute authority, and intrinsick Sovereign Power.</hi> And indeed since there is so much corruption among men, nothing that falls into the hands of men, can scape the mixtures of abuse at long run. But I must add, that the passions and pride of many Church-men in all Ages have been such, that the decision of the plurality of Church-men, seems the model of the World that is fullest of danger.</p>

               <p>Three things yet remain to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: The one is, if obedience be due to the Laws, when they command things contrary to our consciences? For sure you cannot pretend in that case, to give a preference to humane Laws beyond conscience, which is the voice of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66109:105"/>
                  <hi>GOD.</hi> The next is, when the Magistrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands things just of themselves, but upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just motives and narratives, whether my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience doth not homologate his bad designs? And finally, where the commands of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate are manifestly unlawful, how far should the Church, and Church men, oppose and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them? For a bare non-obedience seems not to be all we are bound to, in that case. When I am satisfied in these things, I will quit this purpose.</p>

               <p>To engage in a particular discussion of what is now moved by you, would draw on more discourse than our present leisure will allow of; yet I shall attempt the saying of what may satisfie a clear and unprejudged mind. And to the first, I shall not fall on any longer enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the nature and obligation of conscience, than to tell that <hi>conscience is a conviction of our rational faculties, that such or such things are sutable to the nature and Will of God.</hi> Now all Religion is bound upon us, on this account, that there is such evidence offered for its truth, which may and ought to satisfie the strictest Examen of Reason. And all certainty is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, that our rational faculties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of the objects that he before us: which conviction when applied to divine matters, is called <hi>Conscience.</hi> But there may be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:66109:106"/>
great mistakes in this Conviction: for either the prejudices that lie on our minds from our senses, the prepossessions of Education, interest, or humors, the want of a due application of our faculties to their objects, or chiefly the dulness and lesion of our Organs, the corruption of our minds through sin and lust, occasion many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: so that often without good reason, oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, we take up persuasions, to which we stifly adhere, and count such convictions evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Will of <hi>GOD.</hi> I acknowledg, when a Man lies under a persuasion of the Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> he ought not to go cross to it: for this opens a door to Atheism, when that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of which we are convinced. But if this persuasion be false, it cannot secure a Man from sinning in following of it. For it is a Man's own fault that he is thus imposed upon, since if his rational faculties were duly applied, and well purified, they should prove unerring touchstones of truth. If therefore through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wilfulness, rashness, or any other byass of the mind, it be carried to wrong measures, a Man is to blame himself, and thus his errour ought to aggravate, and not lessen his guilt. If then a Man's conscience dictate to him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of what <hi>GOD</hi> commands, in that case, he is in a visible hazard: for his error can never t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, and so his wrong
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66109:106"/>
informed conscience doth not secure him from guilt, if he be disobedient. On the other hand, nothing in Scripture can bind a Man to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the convictions of conscience, since we are bound to believe the Scriptures, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the evidence of their authority to our rational faculties: If then our belief of the Scriptures rest on that foundation, no part of Scripture can bind us to walk contrary to that evidence, for then it should destroy that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple on which our Obligation to believe it self is founded, which is the evidence of reason; and so in that case, a Man sins whatever he do. Neither is this to be accountd strange, since that <hi>erroneous conscience</hi> is from man's own fault. And that which some alledg to escape this, that in such cases a Man ought to forbear from acting, will not serve turn, to excuse a Man from sin: For in these Precepts which exact a positive obedience, such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orbearance and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing from action, is a sin.</p>
               <p>Upon these Evidences then it will follow, that if the conviction of our conscience run contrary to the Magistrates commands, these <hi>convictions</hi> are either well grounded, or ill: If the former, then the Magistrates command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the nature and Will of <hi>GOD,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e not to be obeyed: If ill grounded, then that mistaken persuasion cannot secure us from sin,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:66109:107"/>
no more than <hi>in the case of conscience</hi> contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Law of <hi>GOD:</hi> for the Laws of the Magistrates in things lawful, are the Laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> being the application of his general Laws unto particular instances, by one cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with authority from him. Therefore tho I do not say the Laws of the Magistrate can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant our counteracting an <hi>erroneous conscience</hi>; yet on the contrary, a <hi>misinformed conscience</hi> will not secure us when we disobey the Magistrates lawful commands. And thus I think your first Question is clearly answered.</p>

on what grounds they refuse <hi>obedience to the Laws,</hi> that so they be not found following their own designs and interests, under a colour of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering firmly to <hi>their consciences.</hi> They must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themselves from all prepossessions, and narrowly examine all things, ere they adventure on refusing <hi>obedience to the Laws.</hi> But now consider if an unjust motive or narrative in a Law, deliver <hi>tender consciences</hi> from an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey it, or not?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Basil.</speaker>
               <p>If the Magistrate do couple his motive and narrative with our obedience, so that we cannot do the one without a seeming consent to the other, then certainly we are not to obey: For actions being often signs of the thoughts, an action how indifferent soever, if declared a sign of concurring in a sinful design, makes us guilty, in so far as we express our concurrence by a sign enjoyned for that end. But if the motive or narrative be simply an account of the Magistrates own thoughts, without expressing that <hi>obedience</hi> is to be understood as a <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in such intentions, then we are to obey a lawful command, tho enacted upon a bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign: For we must obey these in Authority, ever till they stand in competition with <hi>GOD.</hi> If then their Laws contradict not <hi>GOD</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, neither in their natural nor intended si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This calls me to mind of two Stories not impertinent to this purpose: The one is of <hi>Iulian the Apostate,</hi> who to entangle the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that never scrupled the bowing to the Emperors Statue, as a thing lawful, caused to set up his with the Images of some of the Gods about it, that such as bowed to it, might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as (likewise) bowing to the Images: which abused some of the simpler: but the more discerning refused to bow at all to those Statues, because he intended to expound that innocent bowing to his Statue, as an adoration of the Gods about it. A Christian likewise being brought to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> did according to the Law bow before him; but when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that to be exacted as a divine Honor to the King, he refused it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Eud.</speaker>
               <p>This is clear enough that all actions are as they are understood, and accordingly to be performed, or surceased from. But it seems more difficult to determine what is to be done in case a Magistrate enact wicked Laws: Are not both his Subjects bound to refuse obedience; and the Heads of the Church, and the watchmen of Souls likewise to witness against it? And may they not declare openly their dislike of such
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66109:108"/>
Laws or practices, and proceed against him with the censures of the Church? since as to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, we see no reason why they should be dispensed with <hi>respect of persons,</hi> which S. <hi>Iames</hi> condemns in all Church Judicatories.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Basil.</speaker>
               <p>I shall not need to repeat what hath been so often said, that <hi>we must obey GOD rather than man:</hi> if then the Magistrates enjoyn what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the <hi>divine Law,</hi> all are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse obedience, and watchmen ought to warn their Flocks against such hazards; and such as can have admittance to their Princes, or who have the charge of their Consciences, ought with a great deal of sincere freedom, as well as humble duty, represent the evil and sinfulness of such Laws: but for any <hi>Synodical Convention,</hi> or any Declaration against them, no warrant for that doth appear; and therefore if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate shall simply discharge all Synods, I cannot see how they can meet without sin. But for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial meetings of Christians for a solemn acknowledgment of <hi>GOD,</hi> such Assemblings for divine Worship, being enjoined both by the Laws of Nature, and Nations, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly commanded in the Gospel, no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can free Christians from their Obligation, thus to assemble for Worship: if then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate should discharge these or any part of them, such as Prayer, Prais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66109:109"/>
Scriptures, preaching the Gospel, or the use of the Sacraments, they are notwithstanding all that to be continued in. But for the consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or directive Government of the Church, till a divine Command be produced for Synods or Discipline, it cannot lawfully be gone about without or against his authority.</p>

               <p>For refusing obedience to an unjust command, of surceasing visible Worship, the instance of <hi>Daniel</hi> is signal: who not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his adorations to <hi>GOD,</hi> for all <hi>Darius</hi> his Law; but did it openly, and avowedly, that so he might own his subjection to <hi>GOD.</hi> But for reproving Kings, we see what caution was to be observed in it; since <hi>GOD</hi> sent Prophets with express Commissions for it in the Old Testament: and <hi>Samuel</hi> notwithstanding this severe message to <hi>Saul, yet honored him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his people.</hi> It is true, there should be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons in Christian Judicatories: but that is only to be understood of these who are subject to them: and how it can agree to the King who is Supream, to be a Subject, is not easily to be comprehended. Since then honor and obedience is by divine precept due to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, nothing that invades that honor, or detracts from that obedience, can be lawfully attempted against them: such as is any Church-censure or excommunication. And therefore I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:66109:109"/>
cannot see how that practice of <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon <hi>Theodosius,</hi> or other later instances of some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome,</hi> can be reconciled to that, <hi>Render fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor is due.</hi>

               <p>WE are again as good as our word in keeping this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and I hope we shall be no less exact in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Rule we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded last night of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering our passions; only I must guard you against the mistaking my zeal I may express for passion: remember who said, <hi>The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up, who also scourged the buyers and sellers out of the Temple.</hi>

               <p>I confess, I want not my fears of some heat and excess in this days Discourse: but I will crave leave to check it on what side soever it appear, I know there is a holy zeal for <hi>GOD,</hi> which will inflame a devout mind. But its fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> mild and gentle, free of blustering and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and that rage which is in many, for some Parties or Opinions, and against others, being
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66109:111"/>
as void of knowledg as of Charity, ought not to pretend to Christ's Example, unless they be likewise acted by his Spirit. A diligent search will quickly discover, if our motives and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims have a tincture of his lowly meek and self-denying spirit in them. And certainly if our zeal be for <hi>GOD,</hi> it will take its degrees from the proportion of its Objects. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Pharisaical</hi> pretence to own a zeal for some smaller matters, which have scarce been thought upon by the whole series of Christians in all Ages, till of late, when we are so cold in the defence of Peace, Charity, obedience to those over us, and the Unity of the Church: which are great, certain, and indispensible Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. That zeal likewise which transports a man unto unjustifiable heats of railing against parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, and appears in a bitter humor of dull jeering, and bold detraction, hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shroud it self under the Example of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s holy zeal; who tho in the spirit of a Zealot, having proved his divine Mission and authority by Miracles, he whipped the defilers of the Temple out of it; yet that dispensation wherein such practices were not unusual from extraordinary persons, being now changed into the new one, whose distinguishing Character is <hi>Charity,</hi> we are to bridle all the motions of distempered heat, left the effects
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:66109:112"/>
of it be as unjustifiable as it self is. For it is to be considered, that the proper characters of the Gospel Spirit, are not devotion towards <hi>GOD,</hi> or zeal for his truths, which were common both with the Religion traditionally conveyed from <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to <hi>Moses</hi>; but that which <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath made the cognisance of his Disciples, is, <hi>That they love one another,</hi> whereby all must know them to be such. And therefore all these who discover a spirit of hatred, rage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice at these, of whom they cannot deny but they may be <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples, prove themselves to be void of his Spirit. Now, <hi>Isotimus,</hi> what endless complaints could I here make of some you know of, who are perpetually trafficking to make all who differ from them odious, who catch up every Tattle they hear that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame them, and are sure to spread it as far as either their Tongue or Pen can reach: nor are they Niggards of their additions to them, to make them swell bigger. With what marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous joy do they suck in an ill report? and tho it be but dubiously related, they will be sure to vent it as the greatest truth in the World. And when the stock of Reports fails them, then they break in upon their Magazins of Forgeries: and here is an endless Trade. Sometimes they will piece up things as incoherent as the Rags
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:66109:112"/>
of a Beggars Cloak, and shew either their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>intelligence,</hi> or profound <hi>sagacity,</hi> to smell out bad <hi>intentions.</hi> If they can fix no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on their <hi>Adversary,</hi> then that he is an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or a <hi>Dissembler,</hi> comes well to serve all purposes, and to defeat the best <hi>intentions:</hi> And, oh! but the jealousies of Popery and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical practices, work wonders on their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief! Indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> I must tell you freely, I see a Spirit stirring among us, which I look upon as tinctured with the deepest dye of <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism,</hi> and so void of the common impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of good nature and civility; but much more of his Image, who will have us <hi>learn of him, in that he is meek and lowly,</hi> that really a Man had as well live among <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> as among such Wasps and Vipers.

               <p>I beseech you, wrest not my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my design, and their meaning. I charge not the whole Party with these Arts: yet that there is too great compliance given to them, and too little freedom used against them, by too many, may without unjustice, or breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be averred: but the disclosing of these is so far from <hi>injuring Religion,</hi> that I know nothing so proper for recovering the World from the jealousies these Arts have occasioned at it, as the unmasking of that Spirit; that so the amiable and lovely visage of <hi>true Religion</hi> may appear in its own lustre, and free of these false Colors some unjust pretenders to it, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the former, I have no quarrel: for knowing how subject my self is to mistakes, I censure and judg none for their Opinions, till they strike at the <hi>foundations of Faith,</hi> or a <hi>good life:</hi> And so do not only not charge all your Party with these imputations, but know a great many of them who are very free of them: but that many are too guilty of them, is what your self dares not deny. And how much of that temper appears in the late Pamphlets, I leave with every rational <hi>Reader</hi> to conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how guilty are most of you in this which you here blame me unjustly for, which is the charging a Party with the escapes, how great or signal soever, of some individuals. For to undertake the Patrociny of every man in every Party, is that which none in his right wits will do: To deal therefore equally with you, I neither think your Party nor ours, culpable for the faults of some particular persons.

as these secret and more easily palliated errors. Consider therefore a little what was the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and what was their leaven, and search for it; left it <hi>yet leaven you,</hi> and <hi>lest your righteousness exceed not theirs.</hi> The <hi>Pharisees</hi> prayed often, and long, both in the Synagogues, streets, and widows houses: they studied the Law exactly, and had a great reverence for <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and much zeal against <hi>blasphemers, false teachers and hereticks</hi>: They were strict observers of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and were careful to prepare for their <hi>Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer solemnities</hi>: They had great respect for the <hi>opinions of their Ancestors</hi>: They looked <hi>grave and solemn</hi>: They <hi>fasted often, and gave tythes of all they had</hi>: Their outward deportment was not only clean, but beautiful: They were zealous to gain <hi>Proselytes,</hi> and expressed a tenderness of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> even in the smallest matters: They were careful to avoid all converse with profane or wicked persons. In a word, they had many things, which to a vulgar and less discerning eye, made a fair show in the flesh. But with all this, they were proud, and exalted in their own conceits, so that they despised all other persons: They were Magisterial, and desired to prescribe to every body: They were full of empty boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, and assumed to themselves big and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Titles: and all their opinions they obtruded
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66109:115"/>
as Oracles. <hi>They did all to be seen of men, and loved salutations in the market places, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost rooms at feasts.</hi> They envied any they saw outstrip them in true worth; and hated and contemned all that followed these. They stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to calumniate and revile every person that opposed them, with the most unjust and cruel reproaches, excommunicating all who adhered to them: Neither would they yield to the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest evidences were offered for their conviction: and nothing but the blood of the most innocent could satisfie their revenge. They were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and <hi>devoured widows houses,</hi> with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of devotion. They were false and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolous, studying to ensnare others in their spee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, or wrest what they said to a contrary and mischievous sense. They were traytors to these in Authority, though when it might serve their ends, they spared not to pretend much zeal for them: and the fervor of their zeal made them often attempt the murde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Truly, when I reflect on the late times, and the spirit which did then act in the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories both of Church and State, I wonder much how any can be guilty of the error of thinking it was the cause of GOD was then fought for. I deny not but a great many, yea, I am willing to hope the greater part, were misled and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and did imagine it was <hi>Religion and Liberties</hi> they fought for; and so went out as they were called, in the simplicity of their heart, and knew not any thing of the secret designs of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: As in the case of <hi>Absoloms</hi> rebellion, two hundred went from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with him, which might well a little excuse their fault, but could not alleviate the guilt of that unnatural rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: so whatever may be said for excusing the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:66109:116"/>
multitudes, who, I doubt not, meant well, yet that will never serve for vindicating the course was followed. I confess, if I saw any remorse or shame for by-past miscarriages; if I found these people we speak of, either humbled for them before GOD, or ashamed of them among men, I should be the last on earth who would upbraid them with them: and that the rather, that <hi>His Majesty</hi> hath buried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them by a gracious oblivion. But when they continue so insolent, as still to bear up so high in their pretentions, as if GOD had been visibly with them: and when they think it an injury to their innocency to tell them of an indemnity, who would not be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take them to task, and examine all their vain boastings, and empty pretences? to which I am both provoked from their arrogance, and invited from the evident proofs of all I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which I can lay before you from authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Papers and Registers: and I shall freely tell you, that if any of these Pamphleteers had but the half to say of these who yield a complyance to the present Establishment, which I can say of them, the world would ring with it.

But I come now to satisfie your desire, and doubt not to convince you, that the late wars were an invasion of the Kings Authority, and of the established Laws, and were not for defence of any part of the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Religion and Liberties.</p>
               <p>In the year 1938. His <hi>Majesty</hi> having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the authorizing of the Service-Book, and Book of Canons, and the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the High-Commission-Courts were il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal; did upon the representation of those grievances, not only retract what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done, but in the fullest manner dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, and though the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Perth</hi> stood setled by Law, yet upon their petitions, who counted them grievances, he warranted
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:66109:117"/>
their disuse: and for securing the fears of his Subjects of the change of Religion, (with which some factious spirits had poysoned them;) he appointed the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> as King <hi>Iames</hi> had signed it, to be taken by all his Subjects with a bond of mutual defence and adherence to it: He also summoned an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and Parliament, for satisfying all the just demands and grievances of his Subjects. But did this satisfie the zeal of that party? No, for when all colors of grounds were removed from those malicious imputations, with which his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> actions were aspersed; then did they flee to their safe and sure refuge of jealousies and fears, out of which there was never any storming of them, as if all had been only offered to trepan and deceive them.

one knot; and so when it was voted what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should be chosen, they who were listed, being at least six, were set to the door, and thus the Elders who stayed within, carried the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as they pleased.

And thus it was, that the secular men did intirely choose the members of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Glasgow.</hi> But before they went to it, a written citation of the Bishops was ordered to be read through all the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi>; wherein they were cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

(And you may judge how consonant this was to that Royal Law of charity, <hi>which covers a multitude of sins</hi>) nor was the Kings Authority any whit regarded all this while. Was ever greater contempt put on the largest offers of grace and favor? And when at <hi>Glasgow His Majesty</hi> offered by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, to consent to the limiting of Bishops, nothing would satisfie their zeal without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the order, as unlawful and abjured. But when many illegalities of the constitution and procedure of that Assembly were discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66109:118"/>
their partiality appeared, for being both Judg and Party, they justified all their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. Upon which <hi>His Majesties</hi> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner was forced to discharge their further sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or procedure, under pain of Treason: but withal published <hi>His Majesties</hi> Royal intentions to them, for satisfying all their legal desires, and securing their fears. But their stomachs were too great to yield obedience, and so they sate still, pretending their authority was from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and condemned Episcopacy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Bishops, with a great many other illegal and unjustifiable Acts. And when <hi>His Majesty</hi> came with an Army to do himself right by the Sword <hi>GOD</hi> had put in his hands, they took the start of him, and seised on his Castles, and on the houses and persons of his good Subjects, and went in a great body against him. Now in this <hi>His Majesty</hi> had the Law clearly of his side: For Episcopacy stood esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Act of Parliament. And if this was a cause of Religion, or a defence of it, much less such as deserved all that bloud and confusion which it drew on, let all the World judg.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>His Majesty</hi> was willing to settle things, and receive them again into his grace, and upon the matter granted all their desires: but they were unsatisfiable; upon which they again armed. But of this I shall not recount the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:66109:119"/>
particulars, because I hope to see a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byassed narration of these things ere long. Only one Villany I will not conceal, at the pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Berwick,</hi> seven Articles of Treaty were signed; But the Covenanters got a paper among them, which passed for the conditions of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement; though neither signed by his <hi>Majesty,</hi> nor attested by Secretary or Clerk: and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where spread, his <hi>Majesty</hi> challenged it as a Forgery: and all the <hi>English</hi> Lords who were of the Treaty, having declared upon Oath, that no such paper was agreed on, it was burnt at <hi>London</hi> by the hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as a scandalous paper. But this was from the Pulpits in <hi>Scotland,</hi> represented as a violation of the Treaty, and that the Articles of it were burnt. These and such were the Arts the men of that time used to inflame that blessed King's native Subjects against him.</p>
               <p>But all these were small matters to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invasion of <hi>England, An.</hi> 1643. For his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> did <hi>An.</hi> 1641. come to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give them full satisfaction to all, even their most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable demands; which he consented to pass into Acts of Parliaments. But upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England,</hi> the woful rupture betwixt him and the two Houses following; was our Church-party satisfied with the trouble they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned him? No, they were not: for they did
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:66109:119"/>
all they could to cherish and foment the Houses in their insolent Demands, chiefly about <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> and were as forward in pressing <hi>England</hi>'s uniformity with <hi>Scotland,</hi> as they were formerly in condemning the design of bringing <hi>Scotland</hi> to an uniformity with <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall not engage further in the differences betwixt the King and the two Houses, than to shew that His <hi>Majesty</hi> had the Law clearly of his side, since he not only consented to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of all grievances, for which the least color of Law was alledged; but had also yielded to larger concessions for securing the fears of his Subjects than had been granted by all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> since the <hi>Conquest.</hi> Yet their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were unsatisfiable without His <hi>Majesty</hi> had consented to the abolishing of Episcopacy, and discharge of the Liturgy, which neither his Conscience, nor the Laws of <hi>England</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: so that the following War cannot be said to have gone on the principles of defending <hi>Religion</hi>; since His <hi>Majesty</hi> was invading no part of the established <hi>Religion.</hi> And thus you see, that the War in <hi>England</hi> was for advancing a pretence of <hi>Religion.</hi> And for <hi>Scotlands</hi> part in it, no Sophistry will prove it defensive: for His <hi>Majesty</hi> had setled all matters to their hearts desire, and by many frequent and solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, declared his resolutions of observing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:66109:120"/>
inviolably that agreement: neither did he so much as require their assistance in that just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Authority, and the Laws, invaded by the two Houses: though in the explication of the Covenant, <hi>An.</hi> 1039. it was agreed to, and sworn, <hi>That they should in quiet manner, or in Arms, defend His Majesties Authority, within or without the Kingdom, as they should be required by His Majesty, or any having his Authority.</hi> But all the King desired was, that <hi>Scotland</hi> might lie neutral in the quarrel, enjoying their happy tranquillity: yet this was not enough for your Churches zeal, but they remonstrated that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy was the great Mountain stood in the way of Reformation, which must be removed, and they sent their Commissioners to the King with these desires, which <hi>His Majesty</hi> answered by a Writing yet extant under his own Royal hand, shewing, <hi>That the present settlement of the Church of</hi> England <hi>was so rooted in the Law, that he could not consent to a change, till a new form were agreed to, and presented to him</hi>: to which these at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> had no mind: but he offered <hi>all ease to tender Consciences, and to call a Synod to judg of these differences, to which he was willing to call some Divines from Scotland, for bearing their opinions and reasons.</hi> At that time, Petitions came in from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the <hi>Conservators of the Peace,</hi> inciting them to own the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:66109:120"/>
quarrel: upon which many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and others, signed a <hi>Cross Petition,</hi> which had no other design, but the diverting these Lords from interrupting the <hi>Peace of Scotland,</hi> by medling in the <hi>English</hi> quarrel: upon which Thunders were given out against these <hi>Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> both from the Pulpits, and the <hi>Remonstrances</hi> of the <hi>Commission</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly</hi>; and they led Processes against all who subscribed it. But <hi>His Majesty</hi> still desired a neutrality from <hi>Scotland</hi>; and tho highly provoked by them, yet continued to bear, with more than humane pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the affronts were put on his Authority. Yet for animating the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> into the designed War, the Leaders of that Party did every where study to poison the people with damnable jealousies of the <hi>King's inclination to Popery,</hi> of his accession to the <hi>Massacre of Ireland,</hi> and of his designs to subvert by force the late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with <hi>Scotland,</hi> if his Armies were bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with success in <hi>England.</hi> It were an endless work to tell all the ways were used for rooting these wicked jealousies in the peoples hearts: neither were all <hi>His Majesties</hi> protestations able to overcome them: yet in end, when <hi>His Majesty</hi> finding what their <hi>inclinations</hi> were, did refuse to admit the Commissioners from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to mediate betwixt himself and the Houses, they returned home; and immediately upon
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:66109:121"/>
that, contrary to all the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a great meeting of <hi>Counsellors, Conservators, and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners for the publick burdens,</hi> ordained a <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Estates</hi> to be summoned, which was never before done without the King's command, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the minority of the Kings: neither did they so much as wait for the King's pleasure, but only signified their resolution to him, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>His Commands</hi> against the day prefixed. Here was an invasion of the King's <hi>Prerogative,</hi> which deserved a high Censure: yet so far did <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s clemency, and love to his native Kingdom lead him, that he dispensed with this transgression, and allowed their sitting in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> provided they meddled not in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>England,</hi> nor raised an Army in order to it: But notwithstanding this, they voted themselves <hi>a free Convention,</hi> and not restricted to the bounds prescribed in the King's Letter, which they refused to registrate.

               <p>Truly, you have given in a high charge against the proceedings of the late times, which as I ought not to believe upon your assertion, so I cannot well answer; those being matters of fact, and done most of them before I was capable

of observing things: And therefore when I see men of great experience, I shall ask after the truth of what you have told me.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:66109:125"/>
with us, is that the Rulers of our Church and State did engage the ignorant multitude, under the colors of <hi>Religion,</hi> to despise the <hi>LORDS anointed, and his Authority,</hi> and by Arms to shake off his yoak, and afterwards abandon his Person, disown his interest, refuse to engage for his rescue, and in the end look on tamely, and see him murdered. Do you think it a small crime that nothing could satisfie the Leaders in that time, without they got the poor people entangled into things which they knew the vulgar did not, and could not understand, or judge of, and must implicitly rely upon the Glosses of their Teachers? For whatever the <hi>General Assembly</hi> declared, was a duty following upon the <hi>Covenant</hi> (which was an easie thing for the leading men to carry as they pleased) then all the Ministers must either have preached and published that to their people, with all their zeal, otherwise they were sure to be turned out. The people being thus provoked from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, they were indeed to be pitied, who being engaged in an oath (many of them, no doubt in singleness of heart, having the fear of an oath upon their consciences) and not being able to examine th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, and the guilt of this, as it was great in those who without due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:66109:126"/>
engaged in those oaths, so it was most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in them; who against the clear <hi>convictions of conscience,</hi> were prevailed upon by the thunders of the Church, or the threats of the State, to swear what they judged sinful. I confess, their crime was of a high and crying nature, who did thus for the love of this present world, not only make <hi>shipwreck of a good conscience,</hi> but persisted long in a tract of dissembling with <hi>GOD,</hi> and juggling with men. But the wickedness of this comes mainly to their door, who tempted them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication by their severities against all refused a concurrence in these courses. And the sin of all this was the greater, that it was carried on with such pretences, as if it had been the cause and work of <hi>GOD,</hi> with fasting, prayers, tears, and shews of devotion. For these things the Land mourns, and <hi>GOD</hi> continues his controversie against us. To which I must add the great impenitence of those who being once engaged in that course of <hi>Rebellion,</hi> have not yet repented of the works of their hands. For even such as own a <hi>conviction</hi> for it, do not express that horror and remorse at their by-past crimes which become penitents: But think if by rioting, drinking and swearing, they declare themselves now of another mind than formerly they were of, that they are washed free of that defilement. In a word, none seem deeply humbled in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:66109:126"/>
presence of <hi>GOD,</hi> for the sinfulness of these practices, into which they entered themselves, and engaged others. And till I see an ingenuous spirit of <hi>confessing and repenting</hi> for these great evils, for all that rebellion, that bloud, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vastation which these courses drew on, I shall never expect a <hi>National pardon,</hi> for that <hi>National guilt.</hi> For when on the one hand, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are still justifying these black Arts, and not humbled for them, nor owning their penitence as openly as they committed their sins: And on the other hand, these who confess the faultiness of their courses, do it in a spirit of traducing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of railing, and reviling, perhaps not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Atheistical scoffings at <hi>true Religion</hi>; but not in a spirit of ingenuous horror, and sorror for their own accession to these courses, it appears we are still hardened, either into a judicial blindness of the one hand, or of obduration of heart on the other. That profanity doth much abound, I must with sorrow confess it, in the presence of my <hi>GOD</hi>: And I know there are many who roll themselves in the dust daily before <hi>GOD,</hi> and mourn bitterly for it: But when I enter in a deeper inquiry what may be the true causes of it, those that occur to me are, first, a judicial stroke from <hi>GOD</hi> upon us, for our by-past abominations: and chiefly for our hypocritical mocking of <hi>GOD,</hi> fastning the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:66109:127"/>
designs or humors of a Party on him, as if they had been his Ordinances, interests, and truths. And therefore because <hi>we held the truth of GOD in unrighteousness,</hi> his wrath hath been revealed against us. Next, the frequent involving the Land in reiterated Oaths, subscriptions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of repentance, under severe Censures, which prevailed with many to swallow them over implicitly, and made others yield to them against their Conscience, hath so debauched and prostituted the Souls of people, that it is no wonder, they be now, as seared with a hot Iron, and incapable of reproofs or convictions. Besides, is it any wonder that these whose hearts naturally led them to Atheism, when they see what juggling was used about some pretences of Religion, and how the whole Land was invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in so much bloud, about such trifling mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, come thereupon to have a jealousie of Preachers and preaching, as if all they said, was but to maintain and advance their own interests and greatness, and thereupon turn Scoffers at all Religion, because of the base and irreligious practices of some, who yet vouched <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> for all they did? And on remark I shall offer on the way, that the sin of your Church was legible in your judgment: their sin was the animating the people to Rebellion, upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of Religion; and their judgment was, not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:66109:127"/>
only to be subdued, and oppressed by another rebellious Army, who were not wanting to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend highly to the cause of <hi>GOD</hi> in all their actings: but that they brake in pieces among themselves about a decision, who might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to serve in the Army, which at first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed, and afterwards destroyed your Church: and the schism is still among us, which is like to eat up the power of Religion, is but the dreg and genuin effect of these courses, and so all the prejudice it produceth to Religion, and the true interests of Souls is to be charged upon that same score.</p>

               <p>Really, I am much scandalized with this Discourse, which if it were heard abroad, I know would much offend the hearts of the <hi>LORD</hi>'s people.

               <p>GOD is my witness, how little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure I have in this severe Discourse, into which the petulancy of these Writers hath engaged me: but examine what I said from <hi>Religion</hi> and Reason, and you will perhaps change your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of it. For my part, I say none of these things in a corner, neither do I expect that they shall not fly abroad, and if they do, I will look for all the severities which the censures and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of many can amount to. But I will chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear that cross, and will be content to be yet more vile, for declaring freely what I judg to be <hi>GOD</hi>'s Controversie with the Land I live in. If for this love to Souls, many be my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, I will betake my self to prayer: and shall only add this, that few who know me sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my temper guilty either of flattery or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness. And the searcher of hearts knows, that I neither design by this freedom, to commend my self to any, nor to disgrace others, but meerly to propose things as they are. If this produce any good effect, I have my design; if not, I have discharged my conscience, and leave the issue of it with <hi>GOD,</hi> who can out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, ordain strength and perfect praise.</p>
               <p>As for any obligation you may suppose the Covenant brings upon us to oppose Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I shall discuss it with all the clearness I am
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:66109:128"/>
master of. I shall not tell you, how much many who took that Covenant, and do still plead its obligation have said (from the words of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article, and the explication given in it to Prelacy) for reconciling as much of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as is setled among us, to it, according to the declared meaning of its first imposers, when they took it, and authorized it. But leaving you and them to contend about this, upon the whole matter consider, that Episcopacy is either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, unlawful, or indifferent: if the first be true, then you will without much ado confess that no Oath in prejudice of a necessary duty, can bind any tie upon our conscience. If it be unlawful, I shall freely acknowledg that from the oaths of the Covenants, there is a superveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tie lying on us for its extirpation. But if it be indifferent, then I say it was a very great sin for a Nation, so far to bind up their Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as by Oath to determine themselves to that to which <hi>GOD</hi> had not obliged them: for the circumstances of things indifferent, may so far vary, that what is of it self indifferent, may by the change of these become necessary, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. Therefore, in these matters, it is a great invasion of our Christian liberty, to fetter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences with Oaths. And though the Rulers and chief Magistrates of a Society, have either rashly or out of fear, or upon other unjustifiable
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:66109:129"/>
accounts, sworn an Oath, about indifferent things, which afterwards becomes highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the <hi>Society,</hi> then they must consider that the <hi>Government</hi> of that <hi>State</hi> is put in their hands by <hi>GOD,</hi> to whom they must answer for their administration. Theeefore they stand bound by the <hi>Laws of Nature, of Religion, and of all Societies,</hi> to do every thing that may tend most for the good of the <hi>Society.</hi> And if a Case fall in where a thing tends much to the good and peace of a Land, but the Prince stands bound some way or other by Oath against it, he did indeed sin by so swearing; but should sin much more, if by reason of that Oath he judged himself limited from doing what might prove for the good of the <hi>Society.</hi> Indeed when an Oath concerns only a man's private rights, it ties him to performance, <hi>tho to his hurt</hi>; but the <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Government</hi> is none of these rights a Magistrate may dispose of at pleasure; For he must conduct himself so, as he shall be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>God,</hi> whose Vicegerent he is: and when these two Obligations interfere, the one of procuring the good of the <hi>Society,</hi> the other of adhering to an Oath, so that they stand in terms of direct opposition, then certainly the greater must swallow up the lesser. It is therefore to be under consideration, whether the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of procuring the good of the <hi>Society,</hi> or that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:66109:129"/>
of the Magistrates Oath be the greater? But this must be soon decided, if it be considered that the former is an Obligation lying on him by <hi>GOD,</hi> who for that end raised him up to his power, and is indeed the very end of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: whereas the other is a voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath taken on himself, and can never be equal to that which was antecedent to it, much less justle it out. But if it contradict the other, the Magistrate is indeed bound to repent for his rash swearing; but cannot be imagined from that to be bound to go against the good of the <hi>Society,</hi> for the procuring whereof, he hath the Sword and power put in his hands by <hi>GOD.</hi> And so much of the tie can lie upon a Magistrate by his Oath about things indifferent, in ordering or governing the State that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him: in which he must proceed as he shall answer to <hi>GOD</hi> in the great day of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: and ought not to be censured or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for what he doth by his Subjects.</p>
               <p>But he enacting Laws in matters indifferent, they become necessary Obligations on his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which no private oath of theirs can make void. Indeed the late Writer his arguing against this, is so subtil, that I cannot comprehend it so far as to find sense in it; for he confesseth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 232. <hi>That the Magistrate is vested with a power proportional to the ends of Government, so that no
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:66109:130"/>
Subject may decline his lawful commands, or bind himself by any such Oath, as may interfere with a supervenient rational command.</hi> All this is sound, and indeed all I pleaded; only his explication of <hi>rational,</hi> I cannot allow of: For tho a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may proceed to unreasonable commands, yet I see no limits set to our obedience, but from the unlawfulness of them. But in the next <hi>page,</hi> he eats all this up by telling, <hi>That there are many things still left to our selves, and our own free dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, wherein we may freely vow: and having vowed, must not break our word.</hi> And for instance, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth <hi>a mans devoting the tenth of his substance to the</hi> Lord, <hi>from which no countermand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates can excuse.</hi> But still he concludes, <hi>Page</hi> 334. <hi>That the Magistrates Power may make void such vows as are directly, or designedly made to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate its right or to suspend the execution of others, in so far as they do eventually cross its lawful exercise.</hi> This last yields to me all I pretend in this case: For the <hi>Covenant</hi> being made on purpose to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> though at that time setled by Law: if <hi>Episcopacy</hi> be not unlawful, but lawful, which I now suppose, then the King's authority enjoining it, and it being a great part likewise of the <hi>Government</hi> of the Subjects, it is to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, notwithstanding the Oath made against it. So that your Friend yields without consideration, that which he thinks he denies:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:66109:130"/>
and therefore the reasoning in the <hi>Dialogues</hi> holds good, that the Oath of a Subject in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indifferent, cannot free him from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience he owes the Laws. It is true, his <hi>private vows</hi> in matters of his own concern, are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, and so not within the compass of this Debate, which is only about <hi>the obedience we owe the Laws,</hi> supposing their matter lawful, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our Compacts made in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them: and therefore I shall not discourse of them, but stick close to the purpose in hand. But my next undertaking must be to free Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from any tie may be imagined to lie on them from the Fathers Oath: which was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so clear to my thinking, that I wonder what can be said against it.</p>

               <p>Indeed here your Friend the <hi>Conformist</hi> bewrayed his ignorance notably, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority Parents have over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by <hi>divine command,</hi> which dies not with them; their commands being obligatory even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death: for <hi>God</hi> commends the <hi>Rechabites</hi> for obeying <hi>Ionadabs</hi> command some ages after his death: Therefore Parents adjuring Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they are obliged by it, as the people of <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Saul</hi>'s adjuring them not to eat food till the evening, were obliged to obedience. And such adjurations may not only bind the Children adjured, but all their posterity after them: as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:66109:131"/>
did the Oath for carrying <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s bones out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And further, a <hi>Society</hi> continuing still under the same notion, is bound through all ages to make good the compacts of their <hi>Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> they continuing to be the same <hi>Society.</hi> And this is not only the ground on which the obligation of all alliances among Kingdoms is founded; but is also the <hi>basis</hi> on which our tie to the <hi>Allegiance due to our Sovereign</hi> is grounded. Therefore as we find <hi>GOD</hi> in Scripture cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Men, and their posterity, as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s case, and Fathers likewise engaging to <hi>GOD</hi> for themselves and their Children, as did <hi>Ioshua</hi> for himself and his House; so our <hi>Covenants</hi> being unanimously sworn by almost the whole Nation, and confirmed by all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it, must have a perpetual obligation on all the subsequent Generations. <hi>See from pag.</hi> 205. <hi>to pag.</hi> 219.</p>

               <p>I suppose, if it hold good that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> binds not these who took it, to oppose or extirpate <hi>Episcopacy</hi> when setled by Law, all this reasoning will of it self evanish in smoak: But to give your Discourse all advantage, and to yield its obligation on these who took it, what you infer will never be made out; since it is foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next error of your <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> is, that the Parents commands can bind the <hi>Childrens confidence,</hi> in prejudice of the Magistrates authority: for you
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:66109:132"/>
must either suppose this, otherwise your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to no purpose, since the King's authority is in this case interposed, and therefore all our Fathers commands must yield to it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none deny, I shall not stand to evince. For if my Father be bound to obey the King, as well as I am; both he sins, if he enjoin me disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and I am likewise guilty, if upon that I disobey. For he that hath no warrant for his own disobedience, can be imagined to have none for securing me in mine. And in end, you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Parents command or authority can bind the Conscience after his death: which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly absurd; for certainly his authority must die with himself. It is true, a piety and reverence is due to the memory of our Parents: and so much reverence should be payed to their ashes, that without a very good reason, the things they enjoyned should be religiously observed: but this is not a necessary Obligation: for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances may so vary things, that we may be assured, that as our Parents enjoyned such a thing, so had they seen the inconveniencies of it, they had not done it. Now while a Father lives, a Child hath this liberty to argue with him: where it is not to be doubted, but the affection of a Parent, together with the reasons adduced would make him change his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: but indeed did their Commands tie us
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:66109:132"/>
after their death, we should be more in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our Parents, when dead, than we were when they lived: which goeth against the sense of all mankind. And what equality is there in such mens reasons, who will deny absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Magistrates, tho we be allowed to petition, and represent the grievances their Laws bring upon us, and yet will assert an absolute and blind obedience due to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Parents, tho dead? Your instance of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> makes against you, for their Progenitors had appointed them to dwell in Tents, yet the fear of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and consider if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring our lawful Sovereigns displeasure, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the hazard such obedience may draw after it, be not a juster ground of excusing our selves from obedience to any such Command, suppose it were real. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> did indeed abstain from Wine, upon <hi>Ionadab</hi>'s command, for which they are commended, and blessed; and so I acknowledg it a piece of piety to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the commands even of a dead Father; yet in that place, it is not asserted, that that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand tied their Conscience; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the blessing passed upon their obedience, seems rather to imply that it was voluntary, though generous and dutiful. The same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is to be made to <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s adjuring the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:66109:133"/>
of <hi>Israel</hi> to carry up his bones; which ought to have obliged even the Children of these that were so adjured, out of the gratitude due to the memory of so great a Man, especially no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intervening that rendered obedience to it, either unexpedient or unlawful.</p>
               <p>But in general, consider that when a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is made, either of an <hi>Association</hi> under a form and line of Magistracy, or of alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two States, and confirmed by Oath; there is an obligation of Justice that ariseth from the Compact, whereby such rights were translated unto the person compacted with: and thereby he and his posterity according to the Compact, are to enjoy these Rights, because translated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his person by the Compact: but being once legally his, with a provision that they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to his Heirs, then his Heirs have a right to them formally in their persons after his death, to which they have a title in justice, and not by the fidelity to which the posterity of the first compacters are bound by their Fathers deed, but because the right is now theirs: so that though the first Compacters were bound by promise and Oath, their Successors are only bound by the rules of justice, of giving to every man that which is his right: therefore whatever our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors</hi> may be supposed to have compacted with the <hi>King's Progenitors,</hi> or whatever by Treaty
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:66109:133"/>
one State yields over to another, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Donation and Oath</hi> is indeed the ground on which the Kings right may be supposed to have been first founded. But now his Title to our Obedience proceeds upon the rules of Justice, (of giving him what is his, by an immemorial Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, passed all prescription, so many ages ago, that the first vestiges of it cannot be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from <hi>Records,</hi> or certain <hi>Histories</hi>) and not of fidelity of observing the promises of our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors</hi> to him, though I do not deny a pious Veneration to be due to the Promises and Oaths of Parents, when they contain in them adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on their Childern. And thus the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> having a right to their lives, confirmed to them by the Compact of the Princes of <hi>Israel:</hi> they and their Posterity had a good title in Justice to their lives, which was basely invaded by <hi>Saul,</hi> and had this aggravation, that the compact made with them was confirmed by oath, for which their posterity should have had a just venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But though that Oath did at first found their title to their Lives, and their Exemption from the forfeiture all the <hi>Amorites</hi> lay under; yet afterwards their title was preserved upon the <hi>rules of Iustice,</hi> and the Laws <hi>of Nature,</hi> which forbid the invading the lives of our Neighbors, when by no Injury they forfeit them.

But from all this, you see how ill founded that reasoning of the <hi>Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Dialogues is,</hi> for proving the posterity of these who took the <hi>Covenant,</hi> tied by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oath, which yet at first view, promised as fair colors of reason, as any part of his Book, had he not intermixed it with shameful insultings and railings at the <hi>Conformist:</hi> which I suppose do now appear as ill grounded, as they are cruel and base. But I am not so much in love with that stile, as to recriminate: nor shall I tell you of his errors that way of which I am in good earnest ashamed upon his account: For it is a strange thing, if a man cannot answer a discourse without he fall a fleering and railing. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this whole purpose, I am mistaken, if much doubting will remain with an ingenuous and unprejudged Reader, if either we or our posterity lye under any obligation from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, to contradict or counteract the Laws of the Land, supposing the matter of them lawful: which being a large Subject, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a discourse apart. But I will next examine some practices among us, and chiefly that of Schism and separation from the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>GOD</hi>; to which both the unity of the Spirit, which we ought to preserve in the bond
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:66109:134"/>
of peace, and the lawful commands of these in authority, do so bind us, that I will be glad to hear what can be alledged for it.</p>

               <p>A great difference is to be made betwixt separation and non-compliance: the one is a withdrawing from what was once owned to be the Church: the other is a with-holding our concurrence from what we judg brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, against both Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and any thing you can draw from <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s practice or precept, in acknowledging the <hi>High Priests,</hi> or commanding the people to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what the <hi>Pharisees</hi> taught them, is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to this purpose: For first, these were Civil Magistrates, as well as Ecclesiasticks, and Doctors of the Civil and Judicial Law, which is different from the Case of Churchmen with us. Further; the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church was still in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the privileges given them from <hi>GOD,</hi> and so till <hi>CHRIST</hi> erected his Church, they were the Church of <hi>GOD:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be acknowledged, and joined with in Worship.

               <p>You have given a short account of the large reasonings of the late Book on this head, only he is so browilled in it, that there are whole pages in his Discourse, which I confess my weakness cannot reach. But to clear the way
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:66109:135"/>
for your satisfaction in this matter, which I look upon as that of greatest concernment, next to the Doctrine of Non-resistance, of any thing is debated among us; since it dissolves the unity of the Church; and opens a patent door to all disorder, Ignorance and Profanity. I shall consider what the unity of the Church is, and in what manner we are bound to maintain and preserve it.</p>
               <p>All Christians are commanded to love one another, and to live in peace together: and in order to this, they must also unite, and concur in joint Prayers, Adorations, and other acts of Worship, to express the harmony of their love in Divine matters: Sacraments were also instituted for uniting the body together; being solemn and federal stipulations, made with <hi>God,</hi> in the hands of some who are his Ambassadors and Representatives upon Earth: by whose mouths the Worship is chiefly offered up to <hi>God,</hi> and who must be solemnly called and separated for their Imployment. Now these Assemblings of the Saints are not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, till there be such a Corruption in the Constitution of them, or in some part of the Worship, that we cannot escape the guilt of that, without we sepa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate our selves from these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean things. Wherefore the warning is given, <hi>Come out of Babylon, that we be not partakers of her
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:66109:135"/>
sins, and so receive not of her plagues.</hi> But though there be very great and visible corruptions in a Church; yet as long as our joining in Worship in the solemn Assemblies, doth not necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us into a Consent or Concurrence with these; we ought never to withdraw, nor rent the unity of the body, whereof CHRIST is the head. Consider, <hi>how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> And our Saviour sheweth of what importance he judged it to his Church, since so great a part of his last and most ravishing Prayer, is, <hi>That they might be one</hi>: And this he five times repeats, comparing the unity he prayed for, to the <hi>undivided Unity was betwixt him and his Father.</hi> How shall these words rise up in Judgment, against those who have broken these <hi>bonds of perfection</hi> upon slight grounds! With the same earnestness do we find the Apostles pressing the <hi>Unity of the Body, and Charity</hi> among all the members of it: which is no where more amply done than in the <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom the Apostle calls, <hi>the Churches of GOD</hi>; and yet there were among them false Teachers, who studied to prey upon them, and to strike out the <hi>Apostles authority:</hi> Some among them denied the <hi>resurrection,</hi> there were Contentions and Disorders among them in their meetings: such confusions were from the <hi>strange Tongues</hi> some spake, that had one unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:66109:136"/>
with them, come in upon them, he had judged them mad: some were drunk when they did receive the <hi>LORD</hi>'s Supper: they had an incestuous Person in their <hi>Society</hi>; and it seems he was of quality, and much accounted of, since they were puffed up with him: they were also a scandal to the Gospel with their litigious Law sutes. These were great evils, and I hope beyond what you can charge on us: and yet though the Apostle commands them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, and rectified, doth he ever allow of these in <hi>Corinth,</hi> who were pure and holy, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the <hi>solemn Assemblies,</hi> till these things were amended? Or doth he not highly commend <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> to them? Next, consider what Teachers these were who <hi>preached CHRIST of envy and strife, out of contention, and not sincerely, that they might add affliction to the Apostles bonds:</hi> And yet of these S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is, <hi>What then? notwithstanding every way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pretence, or in truth, CHRIST is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</hi> Now if he rejoiced that <hi>Christ</hi> was preached at any rate, what Spirit have they, who because they suppose some preach out of Envy, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to add to their affliction, do thereupon study to blast their <hi>reputation,</hi> and to withdraw first the Hearts, and then the Ears of all from them? Certainly, this is not the Spirit of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:66109:136"/>
CHRIST, or of his Apostles. And though we see what corruptions had crept into the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> yet in the <hi>Epistles</hi> to them in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> they are still call'd the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>GOD,</hi> in the midst of whom the Son of <hi>GOD</hi> walked. They are indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to reform any corruptions were among them; but such as <hi>had not that doctrine, and knew not the depths of Satan, but had kept their garments clean,</hi> are not commanded to separate from the rest; on the contrary, <hi>no other burden is laid upon them</hi>; nor are they charged for not separating from the rest. From which premises I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that as long as the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> may be kept in, without our being polluted in some piece of sinful concurrence, all are bound to it, under the hazard of tearing <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body to pieces. And this stands also with the closest Reason; for since <hi>Unity</hi> is that which holds all the body firm, whereas <hi>division</hi> dislocates and weakens it; nothing doth more defeat the ends of <hi>Religion,</hi> and overturn the power of <hi>Godliness,</hi> than <hi>Scisms</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi>; which give the greatest offence to the little ones, and the fullest advantages to the common enemy imaginable. If therefore the Worship of <hi>GOD</hi> among us continue undefiled, even in the confession of all; if the Sacraments be administred as before; if the Persons that officiate be Ministers of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66109:137"/>
Gospel, then certainly such as separate from our publick Meetings, do <hi>forsake the Assemblies of the Saints, and so break the unity of the Spirit, and the bond of Peace.</hi> And what you said of a non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance as distinct from separation, hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this purpose, where nothing of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance is in the case, but only a joining with the <hi>Saints in solemn Worship.</hi> And doth the change of the <hi>Government of the Church,</hi> in so small a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as the fixing a constant President, with some <hi>additions</hi> of power over your <hi>Synods,</hi> in stead of your <hi>ambulatory Moderators,</hi> derive a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into our Worship, so that without a Sin it cannot be joined in? Indeed if a Concurrence of Worship required an owning of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the Constitution of the Church, a man must go to the <hi>New Atlantis</hi> to seek a <hi>Society</hi> he shall join with, since few of clear unprepossessed minds will find such <hi>Societies</hi> in the known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the World, against all whose Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have not some just exceptions: and the World shall have as many parties as persons, if this be not fixed as the <hi>rule of Unity,</hi> that we cleave to it, ever till we be driven to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which with a good Conscience we cannot yield to. And even in that case, except the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be great and deep, a bare withdrawing, without a direct opposition, is all we are bound to. You are therefore guilty of a direct separation
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66109:137"/>
who forsake the <hi>Assemblies of the Saints,</hi> they continuing in their former purity, unchanged and unmixed, even in your own Principles.</p>

               <p>But one thing is not considered by you, which is a main point, that we had our Church setled, according to CHRIST'S appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ratified by Law. And a change of that being made, all our faithful Ministers were turned out by the tyranny of the present Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who in stead thereof, have set up a new form of <hi>Government,</hi> of none of CHRIST'S appointment: and to maintain it, have thrust in upon the <hi>LORD</hi>'s People, a company of weak, ignorant, scandalous and godless Men, called <hi>Curates</hi>; who instead of edifying, study to destroy the flock: of whom I could say much, had I a little of your virulent temper: But their own actions have so painted them out to the world, that I may well spare my labor of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them better known, it being as unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as it is unpleasant. Now if the true seekers of <hi>GOD</hi> do still stick to their old Teachers, and seek wholsome food from them in corners, and are afraid of your false Teachers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s command, of being aware of such men; call you this a <hi>separation?</hi> which is rather an adherence to the true Church, and the <hi>keeping of our Garments clean</hi> from the contagion of these men. And indeed these who
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66109:138"/>
do join with your <hi>Curates,</hi> do profit so little by their Ministry, that no wonder others have no heart to it. And I have known some whose <hi>consciences</hi> are so tender in this matter, that their having at sometimes joined with these <hi>Curates</hi> in Worship, hath been matter of mourning to them, even to their graves. And this may serve to clear us of the guilt of <hi>Schism</hi> in this matter, when our withdrawing is only a <hi>non-compliance</hi> with your corruption.</p>

               <p>All this saith nothing for justifying your <hi>separation.</hi> As for the turning out of your <hi>Ministers,</hi> if the Laws to which their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was required were just (which shall be next considered) then their <hi>prejudices, misinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed consciences, or peevis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mess,</hi> and not the tyranny of the Rulers, must bear the blame of it. And for these set in their places, if upon so great a desertion of the Church by so many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all their charges could not be of a sudden supplied with men so well qualified, or of such gifts and worth as was to be desired; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what might have been expected upon such an occasion. And for your revilings, they well become the spirit which appears too visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the rest of your actings; but we still study to bear these base and cruel reflections, with the patience becoming the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> and of these who study to learn of him, <hi>who when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66109:138"/>
he was reviled, reviled not again</hi>; but stood silent at those unjust Tribunals, when he was falsly and blasphemously reproached by his enemies; and therefore I shall leave answering of these fearful imputations you charge on our Clergy, to the great day of reckoning, wherein <hi>judgment shall return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</hi> And in the mean while shall study <hi>to bless when you curse, and pray for you who do thus despitefully use us.</hi> We trust our witness is on high, that whatever defects cleave to us, and though, may be, we have not wanted a corrupt mixture (as you know among whom there was a son of Perdition) yet we are free of these things you charge on us promiscuously, and that these imputations you charge us with, are as false as they are base. But all this will not serve the turn of many of your dividers, whose Ministers continue with them as formerly, and meerly because they hold themselves bound in <hi>Conscience</hi> to obey the Laws they are separated from. Truly if you can clear this of <hi>separation,</hi> you are a Master at subtil reasoning. For you know it is not the third part of this Church which was abandoned by the former Ministers upon the late change, and yet the humor of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating</hi> is universal. And though some few of your own Ministers have had the honest zeal to witness against this <hi>separation,</hi> yet how have
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66109:139"/>
they being pelted for it by the censures and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of other <hi>Schismaticks?</hi> which have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much upon the fear or prudence of others, that whatever mislike they had of these <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting practices,</hi> yet they were willing either to comply in practice, or to be silent <hi>spectators</hi> of so great an evil. But if <hi>separation</hi> be a Sin, it must have a guilt of a high nature, and such as all who would be thought zealous watch-men, ought to warn their people of. And what shall be said of these (even Church-men) who at a time when the Laws are sharply looked to, do join in our Worship; but if there be an unbending in these, they not only withdraw, and become thereby a scandal to others, but draw about them divided Meetings; are not these time-servers? For if concurrence in our Worship be lawful, and to be done at any time, it must be a duty which should be done at all times: and therefore such <hi>Masters of Conscience</hi> ought to express an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their ways, and that they make the rules of their <hi>concurrence in worship,</hi> to be the Laws of <hi>GOD,</hi> and not the fear of civil punishments. Finally, such as think it lawful to join in our Worship, and yet that they may not displease the people, do withdraw, shew they prefer the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of men to the pleasing of GOD: and that they make more account of the one than of the other. For if it be lawful to <hi>concur in our worship,</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:66109:139"/>
what was formerly said, proves it a duty: Are not these then the servants of men, who to please them, dispense with what by their own concession must be a duty? Besides, such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons withdrawing, gives a great and real scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the vulgar, who are led by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and so a humor of <hi>separating</hi> comes to be derived into all: whereby every one thinks it a piece of Religion, and that which will be sure to make him considerable, and bring customers to him, if he be a Merchant or Trades-man, that he despise the solemn Worship, and rail at his Minister: and if he but go to Conventicles, and be concern'd in all the humors of the Party, he is sure of a good name, be he as to other things what he will.</p>

I know the poor <hi>Curates</hi> bear the blame of all, and all of them must be equally condemned, if a few of them have miscarried; for which when ever it was proved, they were censured condignly: In end, you charge their gifts, and that their People are not edified by them: But I pray you, see whether the prejudices you make them drink in

Read but the complaints of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and you will confess a Churchmans not being profitable to his People, will be no good argument to prove him not sent of <hi>GOD,</hi> And when I consider, that even the Apostles call for the help of the Churches Prayers, <hi>that utterance might be given to them,</hi> yea and <hi>desire them to strive together in their Prayers for them</hi>; I must crave leave to tell you, that the defect of that utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and power in preaching you charge on the present Preachers, may be well imputed to the want of the concurrence of the Peoples Prayers, whom prepossessions have kept from striving together with them in Prayer, that they might come among them <hi>with the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel.</hi> And if there be any of such tender and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, you cannot say, that a Minister is by a Divine right placed over any particular flock. If then it be humane, it with all other things of that nature, is within
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:66109:140"/>
the Magistrates cognizance; so that when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves one, and leaves a legal way patent for bringing in another, upon which there comes one to be placed over that flock, what injustice soever you can fancy in such dealing, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, it will never free that Parish from the tie of associating in the publick Worship, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments from the hands of that Minister, whom they cannot deny to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospel: and therefore no irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the way of his entry, though as great as can be imagined, will warrant the peoples sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from him. Neither can they pretend that the first Incumbent is still their Minister, for his relation to them being founded meerly on the Laws of the Church, it is (as was proved in the Second Conference) subject to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates authority, and so lasts no longer than he shall dissolve it by his commands: unless it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he designs the overthrow of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; in which case, I confess Pastors are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the practice of the first Ages of the Church, to continue at the hazard of all perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and feed their flocks. But this is not applicable to our Case, where all that concerns Religion continues as formerly: only some combinations made in prejudice of the Supreme Authority are broken: and order is restored to the Church, instead of the confusions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:66109:141"/>
were formerly in it. And if this change have occasioned greater disorders, wherever the defect of Policy or Prudence may be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet certainly, if the change that is made, be found of its own nature both lawful and good, the confusions have followed upon it, are their guilt, who with so little reason, and so much eagerness, have not only refused obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience themselves, but hindered such as were willing to have yielded it.</p>

                  </gap>iness who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate, or for the errors are supposed to be in the way of their entry, doth so contradict the whole series of the Sacred Rule, that nothing can be more expresly condemned in it. The Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> made the People abhor the offering, and they defiled the Tabernacle of <hi>GOD</hi>; yet for all that, the people continued to come and offer their Sacrifices. The Prophets do also tell us what kind of People the Priests in their times were, and yet never a word of the peoples withdrawing from the Worship. Now this must by the parity of reason, hold good under the <hi>New Dispensation</hi>; except you say, we are not so much obliged to worship <hi>GOD</hi> in the unity of the Spirit, as they were; the contrary whereof will be found true. Next, the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> being entailed on the line of <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:66109:141"/>
was certainly to descend (as all other rights did among the <hi>Iews</hi>) by the right of representation and primogeniture; and so did <hi>Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebas</hi> follow in a line from <hi>Aaron.</hi> It is true, the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> was afterwards in <hi>Ithamar</hi>'s line, but it doth not appear by what conveyance it went to them, which certainly must have been Divine, if lawful: And none can limit <hi>GOD</hi> from dispensing with his own positive Laws. But the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> was again set in its own channel by <hi>David,</hi> and so continued downward, till after the second Temple, it becoming the chief Secular Power, was exposed to sale: and this appears from a passage cited by <hi>Doctor Lightfoot</hi> out of the <hi>Talmud</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem, in the first Temple the High Priests still served, the Son suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Father, and they were</hi> 18 <hi>in number: but in the second Temple they got the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by money. And some say, they destroyed one another by witchcraft: so that some say, there were</hi> 80 <hi>Priests in that space; some</hi> 81, <hi>some</hi> 82, <hi>some</hi> 83, <hi>some</hi> 84, <hi>and some</hi> 85. And that Learned <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> reckons 53 in order, till he brings the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession down to the time of the Wars, after which it was so confused, that he pursues it no further. And in the beginning of the 3 <hi>chap. of his Temple-service,</hi> he proves the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to have descended to the first-born, as the Priesthood, before the Law, belonged to the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:66109:142"/>
first-born of every Family. And therefore it was that when <hi>Simeon the Iust</hi> would have put <hi>Onias</hi> his second Son in the Priesthood, he could not do it. But <hi>Simeon</hi> the eldest Brother obtained his right, and <hi>Onias</hi> was put to fly to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he built a famous Temple. This will prove that the High Priests in our Saviour's time had no just title to their office; and yet our Saviour, being by his humiliation in the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a private Person, never questioned it, no not when he was upbraided, as if he had answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>GOD</hi>'s High Priest irreverently, which looks like a case of Confession. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> did the same. Now as to what is said of the High Priests being a Civil Magistrate, it will not serve to deliver you; for his title to the Civil Power flowed from his office: therefore the owning him in that, did also acknowledge his office, since he had no other right to the Civil Power, but because he was High Priest, and yet subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was given him by our <hi>LORD,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the High Priest. Did he not also continue in the Temple Worship, and go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on their festivities? where you know he must have offered Sacrifices by the hands of these Priests: and yet we know well enough what a sort of People they were. If then we are no less bound under the Gospel to the rules of Order and Unity, than they were under the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:66109:142"/>
Law, it will follow that no personal corruption of Church-men, can warrant a separation from Worship, even though their Opinions were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, and their practices naughty: for the impertinency of the distinction of <hi>Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> was already proved. But next to the Temple-worship, was the service of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> which was for the most part in the hands of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Law to the people: And <hi>Christ</hi>'s commanding the people <hi>to observe what they taught,</hi> shews clearly his pleasure was, that they should not forsake the <hi>Synagogues</hi> where they taught: And his own going to the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> in which it is not to be doubted but he concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> proves abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that their Worship was not to be separated from. As for your Friends involved discourse, about the declining of Churches, <hi>Pag.</hi> 193. I must let it alone, till I can make sense of it: For if he intend to compare our <hi>Lord</hi> and his Apostles, their joining in the <hi>Iewish Worship,</hi> with the misguided, though sincere devotion, of some holy Souls who worshipped <hi>God</hi> with all the corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> I hope he will repent the blasphemy of such a mistake. And as for what is alledged, <hi>Pag.</hi> 198. that the <hi>Iewish Dispensation</hi> being mixed, and their Law made up of <hi>matters Political,</hi> as well as
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:66109:143"/>
                  <hi>Spiritual,</hi> therefore these <hi>Scribes</hi> were the Oracles of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and so to be gone to, it is as weak as the rest: For the Law being to be <hi>sought from the Priests lips,</hi> as to all the parts of it, any power the Priests had of pronouncing about the questions of the Law, was because they were Priests, or as they were men separated for offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating in the <hi>Synagogues:</hi> so the receiving their decisions in <hi>matters judicial,</hi> did acknowledg their Office, which was purely <hi>Ecclesiastical and sacred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this I may infer, that as long as any <hi>Society</hi> continues to be the Church and people of <hi>GOD,</hi> and hath the service and worship of <hi>GOD</hi> performed in it by men solemnly sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, according to <hi>GOD</hi>'s appointment, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever irregularities be either in their entry to such charges, or of their opinions or practices, these should indeed be cognosced upon, and censured by the <hi>Supreme Powers in the Society</hi>; but will never warrant private persons to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Worship, unless it be so vitiated in any part of it, that without sin they cannot concur in it: in which case, they are indeed to keep themselves clean, and to withdraw, but not to divide until the Worship be so corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ends of publick Worship can no more be answered by such <hi>Assemblies.</hi>

               <p>I know it is thought a piece of noble
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:66109:143"/>
gallantry among our new modelled people, to despise the sentiments of the <hi>Ancient Church</hi>; and therefore whatever I could adduce from them, would prevail little for their conviction: otherwise many things could be brought to this purpose from these two great Assertors of the Unity of the Church against Schisms and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin:</hi> the latter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, who by many large Treatises studied the conviction of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who maintained their separation from the Church, much upon the same grounds which are by your Friends as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. But I shall dismiss this point with one Sentence of S. <hi>Augustin, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Parmen. Quisquis ergo vel quod potest arguendo corrigit; vel quod corrigere non potest, salvo pacis vinculo exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, vel quod salvo pacis vinculo excludere non potest, aequitate improbat, firmitate supportat, hic est paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficus.</hi> And let me freely tell you, that when I consider the temper, the untractableness, the peevish complainings, the railings, the high cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which are set down by him, and others, I am sometimes made to think I am reading things that are now among our selves, and not what passed twelve Ages ago. And indeed some late practices make the parallel run more exactly betwixt our modern Zealots and the <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> who were a Sect of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that was acted by a black and a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:66109:144"/>
most desperate spirit. For St. <hi>Augustin</hi> tells us, how they fell on these who adhered to the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church,</hi> beating some with Cudgels, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the Eyes of others, and invading the lives of some, particularly of <hi>Maximinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hagaia,</hi> whom they left several times for dead. And what instances of this nature these few years have produced, all the Nation knows. How many of the Ministers have been invaded in their Houses, their Houses rifled, their goods carried away, themselves cruelly beaten and wounded, and often made to swear to abandon their Churches, and that they should not so much as complain of such bad usage to these in Authority: their Wives also scaped not the fury of these accursed Zealots, but were beaten and wounded, some of them being scarce recovered out of their labor in Child-birth. Believe me, these barbarous outrages have been such, that worse could not have been apprehended from <hi>Heathens.</hi> And if after these, I should recount the Railings, Scoffings and floutings which the <hi>Conformable Ministers</hi> meet with to their Faces, even on streets, and publick High-ways, not to mention the contempt is poured on them more privately, I would be looked on as a forger of extravagant Stories. But it is well I am talking to men who know them as well as my self. From these things I may well assume that the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:66109:144"/>
lies mainly on the <hi>Conformists</hi> side, who for their Obedience to the Laws, lie thus open to the fury of their Enemies.</p>

For you have often heard our honest Ministers express their horror at such practices; do not therefore <hi>sin against the generation of the Lord's Children</hi> so far, as to charge the guilt of some murdering Rogues, upon these who would be very glad to see Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done upon such Villains.</p>

               <p>You say very fair, and I am glad to hear you condemning these Crimes so directly: and I am as desirous as any living can be, to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with clear evidences of believing as much good as is possible of all mankind. But let me tell you plainly, that the constant concealing of these murderers, whom no search which those in Authority have caused to make, could discover, tho the Robbers carried with them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a great deal of furniture, and other goods, which must have been conveyed to some adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Houses, but could never be found out, after so many repeated facts of that nature, forceth upon the most charitable, a suspicion which I
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:66109:145"/>
love not to name. Next, let me tell you that these things are very justifiable from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples your Friends go upon: for if we be by Oath bound to discover all Malignants or evil instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may be brought to condign punishment; and if our <hi>Conformity</hi> be so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a wickedness, and such a plain breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in the punishment whereof the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is supine and backward, then let every one compare the doctrine of the late Pamphlets, <hi>from p.</hi> 282. <hi>to p.</hi> 408. <hi>chiefly</hi> 404. <hi>and</hi> 405. and declare whether by the Rules laid down in them, any private persons upon heroical excitations may not execute vengeance on these who are so guilty of gross and notorious backsliding and defection: and what may not be expected of this nature from him <hi>who hesitates to call the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading of the Bishop with a Pistol, an accursed act</hi>; and will only condemn it, <hi>as rash, precipitant; and of evil example:</hi> and that not simply neither, <hi>but all circumstances being considered, and their exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces duly ballanced?</hi> Which makes me apprehend his greatest quarrel with that deed was; that it misled the designed effect, and so was done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertently, or too publickly, or upon some such particular ground, which may have occasioned its miscarriage. But to deal roundly with you, I shall freely acknowledg, if the Doctrine of Resistance by private Subjects against these in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:66109:145"/>
Authority be lawful, I see no ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn such practices: For if we may rise in Arms against those in Authority over us, and coerce and punish them; why not much rather against our fellow Subjects, and those to whom we owe no obedience, especially when we judg them to have transgressed so signally, and to have injured us to a high degree? which is the case, as most of you state it, with the Ministers that are conformable. And from this, let me take the freedom to tell you, that the whole <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Iesuitism</hi> doth not discover a principle more destructive of the peace and order of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than this doctrine of the lawfulness of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons executing vengeance on gross of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, where the transgression is judged signal, the Magistrate is judged remiss, and the actors pretend an heroick excitation. This puts a Sword in a mad mans hands, and arms the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and is worse than theirs, who will have such deeds warranted by some supreme <hi>Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:66109:148"/>
different accounts: For I must tell you freely, that after I have with all the application of mind, and freedom of thoughts imaginable, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what could engage so many in this <hi>Island,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so much zeal and rage against the Order, I am not able to satisfie my self about it. That vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Order having such a native tendency for advancing of true Religion, Peace, Order, and every thing that is excellent: that the aversion and prejudices so many have drunk in against it, seem as unjust, as unconquerable, and look like a part of <hi>GOD</hi>'s controversie with us; whereby we are blindly carried into so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable zeal against that, which if well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, might prove an excellent mean for reviving the power of Religion, that hath suffered so great decays. I shall not deny, but on our part there have been great failings, for which <hi>GOD</hi>'s anger hangs over our heads: and that he permits all this opposition we meet with for punishing us for our sins, which have justly provoked <hi>GOD</hi> to make us <hi>base and contemptible in the sight of the people.</hi> And this I hope shall be an effectual mean of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us, and of purging us from our dross: whereby this holy Order being again managed with the ancient Spirit, may appear into the World in its <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:66109:149"/>
wonder and conviction of all men. But let me add, the opposition some firy spirits have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the establishment of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> deserves much of the blame of its being so little succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the great work of the Gospel: for always <hi>bitter envy and strife</hi> produce <hi>confusion and every evil work:</hi> therefore when you are to view <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy</hi> in its amiable and lovely colors, let me send you back to that <hi>cloud of witnesses,</hi> who for the <hi>testimony of IESUS</hi> endured all manner of torments, were torn by beasts, slain by the sword, burnt in the fire; and in a word, who preached the everlasting Gospel through the World. How many Churches did these Bishops found with their labors in preaching, and water not only with their tears, but their blood? how sublime was their piety? how frevent were their Sermons? how constant were their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors? how strict was their discipline? how zealous were they against heresies? and how watchful against vice? In a word, read but the Histories and Writings of those <hi>great Worthies,</hi> who were by the confession of all men, <hi>Bishops,</hi> and had more absolute Authority over the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy,</hi> than is pretended to among us? and then tell me, if you have not changed your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of that order.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:66109:149"/>
Basil, Nazianzen, Martin, Ambrose, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, Augustin, and a thousand more?</hi> These were, after the Apostles, the greatest glories of the Christian Church: and were <hi>burning and shining lights.</hi> It is in their lives, writings and decrees, that I desire you to view Episcopacy: and if it have any way fallen from that first and fair Original, direct your thoughts and zeal to contrive and carry on its recovery to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purity and servor: but take it not at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, as it may have suffered any thing from the corruptions of men, in a succession of so many ages; for you know the Sacraments, the Ministery, and all the parts of Religion have been soiled, and stained of their first beauty by their corrupt hands, to whose care they were committed. But he were very much to blame, who would thereupon quarrel these things. I shall therefore intreat you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that Order, either in it self, or as it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the first ages of the Church, and not as prejudices or particular escapes may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented it to you.</p>

               <p>Since <hi>Philarcheus</hi> hath appealed to the ancient Church, for the true pattern of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> I shall faithfully represent to you, what the office and power of their Bishops was, and how it took its first rise and growth among them; and then I shall leave it to be discussed, how lawful or allowable it is of it self. The <hi>Iews</hi> had among them, beside the <hi>Temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which was <hi>Typical,</hi> their <hi>Synagogues,</hi> not only over the land, but through all the corners of the World into which they were dispersed; which were called their <hi>Prosenchae</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Thither did they meet for the dayly worship of <hi>GOD</hi>; there did they likewise meet on their Sabbaths, and recited their <hi>Philacteries,</hi> or <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and heard a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law read: which was divided in so many Sections, that it might be yearly read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: there was also a word of exhortation used, after the Law was read: and there were in these Synagogues, Office-Bearers separated for that work, who were to order the Worship, and the reading of the Law, and were to censure sins, by several degrees of <hi>Excommunications,</hi> casting them out of the <hi>Synagogue:</hi> they were likewise to see to the supplying the necessities of the Poor. Now if we consider the practice of our
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:66109:150"/>
Saviour, and his Apostles, we shall find them stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to comply with the forms received among the <hi>Iews,</hi> as much as was possible, or consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the new Dispensation; which might be instanced in many particulars, as in both Sacraments, the forms of Worship, the practice of Excommunication, and these might be branched out into many instances. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed since we find the Apostles yielding so far in compliance with the <hi>Iews</hi> about the <hi>Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rites,</hi> which were purely typical, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently antiquated by the death of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> we have a great deal of more reason to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend they complied with their forms in things that were not typical, but rather moral, such as was the order of their Worship: these things only excepted, wherein the Christian Religion required a change to be made: And this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wherever they went promulgating the Gospel, the first offer of it was made to the <hi>Iews</hi>; many of whom believed, but were still <hi>zealous of the Traditions of their Fathers.</hi> And so it is not like, that they who could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to part with the <hi>Mosaical Rites,</hi> for all the reasons were offered against them, were so easily content to change their other forms, which were of themselves useful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Now since we see the Apostles retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and improved so many of their Rites and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:66109:151"/>
customs, why they should have innovated the Government of their Synagogues, will not be easily made clear: especially since they retained the names of <hi>Bishop, Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Deacon,</hi> which were in use among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and since they did bless and separate them by the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, which had been also practised among the <hi>Iews</hi>: and all this will appear with a clearer visage of reason, if we consider the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given in the <hi>Acts,</hi> or rules prescribed in the <hi>Epistles of the Apostles,</hi> about the framing and constituting their Churches. All which speak out nothing of a new Constitution, but tell only what rules they gave for regulating things; which from the stile they run in, seem to have been then constituted: and is very far either from <hi>Moses</hi>'s Language in the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi> or from the forms of the Institution of the Sacraments: And except the little we have of the Institution of Deacons, nothing like an Institution occurs in the <hi>New Testament</hi>; and yet that seems not the Institution of an Order, but a particular provision of men for serving the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llenists</hi> in an office already known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now let me here send you to the Masters of the <hi>Iewish</hi> learning, particularly to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently learned, and judicious <hi>Doctor Lightfoot,</hi> who will inform you, that in every Synagogue there was one peculiarly charged with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:66109:151"/>
called the <hi>Bishop of the Congregation, the Angel of the Church, or the Minister of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>: and besides him, there were three, who had the Civil Judicatory; who judged also about the receiving Proselytes, the imposition of hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there were other three, who gathered, and distributed the almes. Now the Christian Religion taking place, as the Gospel was planted in the Cities, where it was chiefly preached, these forms and orders were retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both name and thing: for we cannot think that the Apostles, whose chief work was the gaining of Souls from <hi>Gentilism</hi> or <hi>Iudaism,</hi> were very sollicitous about modes of Government; but took things as they found them. Only the Elder and greater Christians they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for Church Offices, and retained an inspection over them themselves. And ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from what was said about the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi> it is natural to think, that when the Apostles left them, and died, they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the more eminent to be Over-seers to the rest; which why not every where, as well as was done by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to be proved. But this is yet more rational from what was premised about the <hi>Synagogue</hi> Pattern; only they did not restrict themselves to that number, for the number of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> was indefinite; but the <hi>Deacons</hi> were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:66109:152"/>
to their first original, restricted to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber seven. Thus the first form was, that there was one whose charge it was to over-see, feed, and rule the flock: and where the number of the Christians was small, they met all in one place for Worship, and it was easie for the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> to overtake the charge. But for the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, he had about him a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the elder, and more eminent Christians, who were designed and ordained for diffusing the <hi>Gospel</hi> through the Cities, Villages, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces adjacent: and these <hi>Presbyters</hi> were as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Children educated, and formed by him, being in all they did, directed by him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to him, and were as Probationers for the Bishoprick: one of them being always cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to succeed in the seat when vacant through the Bishop's death. Now all these lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in a little <hi>College,</hi> and were maintained out of the charitable Oblations of the People, which were deposited in the Bishop's hands, and divided in four parts; one falling to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, another to the Clergy, a third to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, and other poor Persons, and a fourth to the building of edifices for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Thus the Churches were planted, and the <hi>Gospel</hi> was disseminated through the World. But at first every Bishop had but one Parish, yet afterwards when the numbers of the Christians
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:66109:152"/>
encreased, that they could not conveniently meet in one place; and when through the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Persecutions they durst not assemble in great multitudes, the Bishops divided their charges in lesser Parishes, and gave assignments to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of particular flocks, which was done first in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the beginning of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Century:</hi> and these Churches assigned to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as they received the Gospel from the Bishop, so they owned a dependence on him as their Father, who was also making frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions to them, and visiting the whole bounds of his Precinct. And things continued thus in a <hi>Parochial Government,</hi> till toward the end of the Second <hi>Century,</hi> the Bishop being chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the cure of Souls, a share whereof was also committed to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who were subject to him, and particularly were to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him; nor could any Ordination be without the Bishop; who in ordaining, was to carry along with him the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Century,</hi> the Churches were framed in another mould from the division of the <hi>Empire:</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Cities did, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral divisions of the <hi>Empire,</hi> associate in <hi>Synods</hi> with the chief <hi>Bishop</hi> of that <hi>Division</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> who was called the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> from the dignity of the City where he was <hi>Bishop.</hi> And hence sprang <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> and the <hi>Superiorities,</hi> and <hi>Precedencies</hi> of <hi>Bishopricks,</hi> which were rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as ancient <hi>Customs,</hi> they being at that time above an hundred years old. In the beginning of the Third <hi>Century,</hi> as the purity of Churchmen begun to abate, so new methods were devised for preparing them well to those sacred Functions, and therefore they were appointed to pass through several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees before they could be <hi>Deacons, Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Bishops.</hi> And the Orders of <hi>Porters, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Singers, Exorcists</hi> (or <hi>Catechists</hi>) <hi>Acolyths</hi> (who were to be the <hi>Bishops</hi> attendants) and <hi>Sub-deacons,</hi> were set up; of whom mention is made first by <hi>Cyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From what you have told us, I shall propose the notion I have of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> that the work of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as it is chiefly to feed the flock, so it is more particularly to form, educate, and try these who are to be admitted to <hi>Church Imployments</hi>; and to over-see, direct, admonish, and reprove these who are already setled in Church Offices: so that as the chief tryal of those who are to be ordained, is his work, the Ordinations ought to be performed by him; yet not so as to exclude the assistance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> both in the previous tryal, and in the Ordination it self. But on the other hand, no Ordination ought to be without the <hi>Bishop.</hi> And as for Jurisdiction, though the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath authority to over-see, reprove, and admonish the Clergy; yet in all acts of publick Jurisdiction, as he ought not to proceed without their concurrence, so neither ought they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge and allowance, determine about <hi>Ecclesiastical matters.</hi> As for the notion of the distinct Offices of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> I confess, it is not so clear to me: and therefore since I look upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> are you in earnest, when you tell me that for 140 years after <hi>CHRIST,</hi> there is no vestige of Prelacy on record? Will you not believe <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived at that time, though he wrote some years after, and reckons the succession of the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> from the days of the Apostles? Or if the Writings and Records of that time be lost, will you give no credit in a Historical matter to those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that time, and drew their accounts from Writings then extant, though now lost, such as <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> but especially <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who gives the succession of the Bishops, in the several great Sees, from the Apostles days? Certainly, he who was born but about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after the time you mark, would have had some knowledge of so great a change. But if there was no vestige of <hi>Prelacy</hi> before the year 140 in which it first appeared, what time will you allow for its spreading through the World? Or was it in an instant received

on the contrary? How came the Eclipse of the Church to a total Obscuration in one minute? What charm was there in <hi>Prelacy</hi> at that time, that the World was so inchanted with it; and that so soon after S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s death, when <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and many more of the Apostolical men did yet survive? And how came it, that all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es did so unanimously concur in the defection, and not so much as two witnesses appeared to fight against this Beast? Let me tell you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is not a ravery in <hi>Don Quixot's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,</hi> or <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> but is liker to prevail on my belief, than this <hi>Romance.</hi> But for <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, the hazard of the issue of the debate about them is very unequal: for if these Epistles be his, then he dying so near S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s days, the Cause of <hi>Presbytery</hi> will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. But though they be not his, the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Party sustain small prejudice: For from other traces of Antiquity, it can be made as clear, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was in the Church from the days of the Apostles, as any historical thing which is at so great distance from our time.

dissertation, he would have made a difference betwixt the old vulgar Edition of these Epistles, whose Interpolations that learned <hi>Doctor</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, and the late Edition of them by the learned <hi>Vossius,</hi> according to the <hi>Medicean Codex,</hi> whose authority he only voucheth. Now had he known this, would he have cited words out of them, which are not of the true Edition asserted by <hi>Doctor Hamond,</hi> but are of the old vulgar and rejected one? Certainly, had he read any thing of that debate, which hath been truly managed with much subtil critical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both sides, he could not have stumbled unto such a mistake. But his reading, it is like, riseth not above Pamphlets; and finding these words cited on the same design, before the late Editions of <hi>Ignatius</hi> came out; he, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, took them upon trust from second hand. But I shall not run out farther upon <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, than to recommend their perusal to you, and then I am confident you will discern such a native, simple, and sincerely pious, and devout strain in them, so unlike the swelled Stile, or purposes of interpolated Writings, that they will be their own testimony for convincing you of their genuineness: but the exceptions against them being so fully, and so lately, with an amazing diligence, answered by <hi>Doctor Pearson,</hi> I shall remit you to his Labors, if you

And in a word, these Canons do only allow of a precedency of Order, but not of your Prelatick power and superiority, that claims the sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction: <hi>See pag.</hi> 148.</p>

               <p>Truly, Sir, if the former exceptions did prove your Author a second hand writer, who voucheth Antiquity upon the testimony of others, this doth it much more. For I am sure had he but read over those Canons, which might be done in half an hour, he had argued this point at another rate: and had he seen the Edition of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> he had not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Conformist for citing that Canon, as the fortieth, since it is so in his division, who was their first publisher in the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, tho it be the thirty ninth in the <hi>Greek</hi> division. But
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:66109:157"/>
I will deal roundly in this matter, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that collection to be none of the Apostles nor <hi>Clement</hi>'s, since all that passed under <hi>Clement</hi>'s name was accounted spurious, except his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Nor was this a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the first two ages. For the silence of the Writers of those <hi>Centuries</hi> gives clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for their novelty: They not being cited for the decision of things then in controversie, wherein they are express, as in the matter of <hi>Easter,</hi> the <hi>rebaptizing Hereticks,</hi> and divers other particulars. Yet in the Fourth and Fifth <hi>Century,</hi> reference is after made to some Elders rules of the Church, which are to be found no where but in this Collection. The Apostolical Canons are also sometimes expresly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and this gives good ground to believe there were from the Third <hi>Century</hi> and forward, some rules general received in the Church, and held Apostolical, as being at first introduced by Apostolical men. This was at first learnedly made out by <hi>De Marca Concord. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and of late more fully by that most ingenious and accurate searcher into Antiquity <hi>Beveregius</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Annotations</hi> on these Canons. Yet I am apt to think, they were only preserv'd by an <hi>oral tradition:</hi> and that no collection of them was agreed on, and publish'd before the fifth <hi>Century.</hi> It is certain, the <hi>Latine Church</hi> in <hi>Pope
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:66109:158"/>
Innocent</hi>'s days acknowledged no Canons but those of <hi>Nice.</hi> And many of the Canons in this Collection, we find among Canons of other Councils, particularly in that of <hi>Antioch</hi>; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reference to a preceding authority that had enjoined them: which we can hardly think they had omitted, had they received the collection (I speak of) as Apostolical. And that of the <hi>triple immersion in Baptism,</hi> looks like a Rule, no elder than the <hi>Arrian Controversie.</hi> They began first to appear under the name of the Apostles Canons in the Fifth <hi>Century,</hi> which made <hi>Pope Gelasius</hi> with a Synod of seventy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops condemn them as Apocryphal; though I must add, that the authority of that pretended Council and Decree, though generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be on many accounts justly questionable: And yet by this we are only to understand, that he rejected that pretended authority of the Apostles prefixed to these Canons. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Sixth <hi>Century</hi> they were publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> who prefixed fifty of them to his translation of the <hi>Greek Canons</hi>; but he confesses they were much doubted by many. At the same time they were published in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> with the addition of thirty five more Canons, and were acknowledged ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. <hi>Iustinian</hi> cites them often in the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> and in the sixth <hi>Novel</hi> calls them, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:66109:158"/>
of the holy Apostles, kept and interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fathers. And the same authority was ascribed to them by the Council in <hi>Trullo.</hi> These things had been pertinently alledged if you had known them, but for your Friends nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at them, if you will but give your self the trouble of reading these Canons, you will be ashamed of his weakness, who manageth his advantage so ill. And to instance this but in one particular, had he read these Canons himself, could he have cited the eighty which is among the latter additions, and passed by the sixth, which is full to the same purpose? But for that impudent allegation, as if a bare precedency had been only ascribed to Bishops by these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, look but on the 14. the 30. 37. 40. 54. and 73. and then pass your verdict on your Friends ingenuity, or his knowledg. By the 14. <hi>No Churchman may pass from one Parish to another without his Bishop's sentence, otherwise he is suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Ecclesiastical Functions: and if he refuse to return, when required by his Bishop, he is to be accounted a Churchman no more.</hi> By the 30. <hi>A Presbyter, who in contempt of his Bishop gathers a Congregation apart, having nothing to condemn his Bishop of, either as being unholy or unjust, he is to be deposed, as one that is ambitious, and tyrannous; and such of the Clergy or Laity as join with them, are likewise to be censured.</hi> By the 37. <hi>The Bishop
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:66109:159"/>
hath the care of all Church matters, which he must administrate as in the sight of God.</hi> By the 39. <hi>The Bishop hath power over all the goods of the Church; and the reason given is, that since the precious souls of men are committed to him, it is much more just he have the charge of the goods of the Church.</hi> By the 54. <hi>If a Clergy-man reproach their Bishop, he is to be deposed, for it is written, Thou shalt not curse the Ruler of thy people.</hi> And by the 73. <hi>A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, when accused, is only to be judged of by other Bishops.</hi> Now from these hints, judg whether there be truth in that Assertion, that only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency is asserted in these Canons: and if all the power is now pleaded for, be not there held out; not to mention the Canon was cited by the <hi>Conformist,</hi> that Presbyters or Deacons might finish nothing without the Bishop's Sentence, since the Souls of the people are trusted to him. As for the sole power of Ordination and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I am sure none among us do claim it, but willingly allow the Presbyters a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in both these. And as to what your friend saith of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it is of a piece with the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ingenuity that runneth through the rest of his Discourse, <hi>from page</hi> 150 <hi>to page</hi> 160. where for divers pages he belabours his Reader with brave shews of Learning and high inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that no doubt he thinks he hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wonders, and fully satisfied every scruple

               <p>It hath been often repeated, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ever so sacred, as to escape that to which all things, when they fall in the hands of Mortals, are obnoxious. And may not one that quarrels a standing Ministery, argue on the same grounds, a Ministers authority over the people, gave the rise to the authority Bishops pretend over Ministers, and so the Ministery will be concluded the first step of the Beast's Throne? Or may not the authority your Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:66109:160"/>
pretend to be at the same rate struck out, since from lesser Synods sprung greater ones, from Provincial rose Generals, and from these Oecumenical ones with the pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility? But to come nearer you, that whole frame of <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs</hi> was taken from the division of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which made up but one great National Church: and so no wonder the Bishop of the Imperial City of that <hi>Empire,</hi> was the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of that Church: yet he was not all that neither, since he had no authority over his fellow <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> being only the first in order, which truly were the Bishops of that Church: what they were for the first four Ages, it was never judged an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity to grant to them still: tho the ruin of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and its division into so many Kingdoms, which are constituted in various National Churches, do alter the present frame of <hi>Europe</hi> so entirely, from what was then; that with very good reason what was then submitted to, on the account of the Unity of the <hi>Empire,</hi> may be now undone by reason of the several Kingdoms, which are National Churches within themselves; and need not to own so much as the acknowledgment of Primacy to any, but to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of their own Kingdom. And it seems the interest of Princes, as well as Churches, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert this. But for the pretence of the Pope's supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy

                  <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was so far from being judged a step to it, that the ruin of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and the granting them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions from the Jurisdiction of their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was the greatest advance the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> ever made in his tyrannical usurpation over Churches. I need not here tell so known a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is that of the <hi>exemption of the Regulars,</hi> who being subject to their own Superiors and Generals, and by them to the Pope, were sent through the World in swarms; and with great shews of piety, devotion, and poverty, carried away all the esteem and following from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergy; who were indeed become too secular, and these were the Pope's <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Emissaries,</hi> who brought the World to receive the <hi>mark of the Beast, and wonder at her.</hi> For before that time, the Popes found more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to carry on their pretensions, both from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes and Bishops: But these Regulars being warranted to preach and administer the Sacraments without the Bishop's license, or being subject and accountable to him; as they brought the Bishops under great contempt, so they were the Pope's chief confidents in all their treasonable plots against the Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> And when at the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Spain</hi> being weary of the insolencies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, and of the Papal yoak, designed to get
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:66109:161"/>
free from it. The great mean they proposed, was to get <hi>Episcopacy</hi> declared to be of <hi>divine Right,</hi> which would have struck out both the one and the other. But the Papal Party foresaw this well, and opposed it with all the Artifice imaginable: and <hi>Lainez</hi> the Jesuit, did at large discourse against it; and they carried it so, that it was not permitted to be declared of <hi>divine Right.</hi> And by this, judg if it be likely that the Papacy owes its rise to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it to be of <hi>divine Right,</hi> was judged one of the greatest blows the Papal Dominion could have received, as the abusing of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> authority, was the greatest step to its Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>Be in these things what may be, I am sure <hi>from the beginning it was not so,</hi> since <hi>Christ</hi> did so expresly prohibit all dominion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among his Disciples, when he said, <hi>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister,</hi> Luke 22.26.

               <p>I confess, the advantages some have drawn from these words of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> for deciding this question, have many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared strange to me, their purpose being so
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:66109:161"/>
visibly different from that to which they are applied. But if we examine the occasion that drew these words from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> it will furnish us with a key for understanding them aright: and that was the frequent contentions were among the Disciples about the precedency in the Kingdom of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> for they were in the vulgar <hi>Iudaical Error,</hi> who believed the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be a temporal Prince, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood all the pompous promises of the <hi>New Dispensation</hi> liberally, and thought that <hi>CHRIST</hi> should have restored <hi>Israel</hi> in the literal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore they began to contend who should be preferred in his Kingdom: and the Wife of <hi>Zebedee</hi> did early bespeak the chief preferments for her Sons. Yea, we find them sticking to this mistake even at <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, by the question then moved, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his restoring the Kingdom at that time to Israel.</hi> Now these Contentions, as they sprung from an error of their judgments, so also they took their rise from their proud ambition. And for a check to both, our Saviour answers them, by telling the difference was to be betwixt his Kingdom, and the Kingdoms of the Nations: these being exercised by Grandeur and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority, whereas his Kingdom was Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and allowed nothing of that; since Churchmen have not by <hi>CHRIST</hi> a Lordly or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:66109:162"/>
Despotick dominion over Christians commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, but a paternal and brotherly one; by which in commanding, they serve their Flock; so that it is both a <hi>Ministery</hi> and an <hi>Authority.</hi> Therefore the words of Christ, <hi>it shall not be so among you,</hi> relate nothing to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or ranks of Churchmen, but to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their power and jurisdiction over their flock, and not to their degrees among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which appears evidently from the whole contexture of the words. And that he is not speaking of any equality among Churchmen in their Church power, appears from the mention is made of the <hi>greatest,</hi> and <hi>the chief; He that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve:</hi> which shew he was not here designed to strike out the degrees of superiority, when he makes express mention of them; but to intimate that the higher the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Ecclesiastical Offices</hi> did raise them, they were thereby obliged to the more humility, and the greater labor. All which is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the instance he gives of himself, which shews still he is not meaning of Church power (since he had certainly the highest <hi>Ecclesiastical a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thority</hi>) but only of Civil dominion; nothing of which he would assume. And if this place be to be applied to Church power, then it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove too much, that there should be no
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:66109:162"/>
power at all among Churchmen over other Christians: For since the parallel runs betwixt the Disciples, and the Lords of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; it will run thus, that tho the Lords of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> bear rule over their people, yet you must not over yours: so that this must either be restricted to <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> or else it will quite strike out all <hi>Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction.</hi> But how this should be brought to prove that there may not be seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks in Church Offices, I cannot yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. And as it is not thought contrary to this, that a Minister is over your Lay-Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, why should it be more contrary to it, that a rank of Bishops be over Ministers? In a word, since we find the Apostles exercising this pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal authority over other Churchmen, it will clearly follow they understood not <hi>Christ,</hi> as hereby meaning to discharge the several ranks of Churchmen, with different degrees of power. But to tell you plainly what by these words of <hi>CHRIST</hi> is clearly forbidden, I acknowledg that chiefly the Pope's pretence to the <hi>Temporal Dominion</hi> over Christendom, whether directly or indirectly, as the Vicar of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly condemned. Next, all Churchmen under what notion, or in what Judicatory soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are condemned, who study upon a pretence of the Churches intrinsick power, to possess themselves of the authority, to determine
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:66109:163"/>
about obedience due to Kings or Parliaments, and who bring a tyranny on the Christians, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cure what by Arts, what by Power, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Arm to serve at their beck. Whether this was the practice of the late <hi>General Assemblies,</hi> or not, I leave it to all who are so old, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how squares went then; and if the leading Men at that time, had not really the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power ready to lacquay at their commands, so that they ruled in the <hi>spirit of the Lords of the Gentiles,</hi> whatever they might have pretended. And the following change of Government did fully prove, that the obedience which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally given to their commands, was only an appendage of the Civil Power, which was then directed by them: For no sooner was the power invaded by the <hi>Usurper,</hi> who regarded their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories little, but the Obedience payed to their Decrees evanished. Thus, I say, these who build all their pretences to parity on their mistakes of these words, did most signally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and neglect them in their true and real meaning. Now think not to retort this on any additions of <hi>Secular Power,</hi> which the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Princes may have annexed to the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal</hi> Office; for that is not at all condemned here: <hi>CHRIST</hi> speaking only of the power Churchmen, as such, derived from him their Head, which only bars all pretensions to <hi>Civil
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:66109:163"/>
Power</hi> on the title of their Functions; but doth not say that their Functions render them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving any <hi>Secular Power,</hi> by a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conveyance from the <hi>Civil Magistrate.</hi> And so far have I considered this great and pompous argument against precedency in the Church; and am mistaken if I have not satisfied you of the slender foundations it is built upon: all which is also applicable to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, of not <hi>Lording it over their flocks.</hi>

               <p>You are much mistaken, if you think that to be the great foundation of our belief of a parity among Churchmen, for I will give you another, (<hi>page</hi> 91.) which is this, that <hi>IESUS CHRIST</hi> the head of his Church, did institute a setled Ministery in his Church, to feed and over-see the Flock, to preach, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, to bind, loose, &amp;c. It is true, he gave the Apostles many singular things beyond their Successors, which were necessary for that time, and work, and were to expire with it: But as to their Ministerial Power which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, he made all equal. The Apostles also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Pastors of the Churches, their fellow-laborors, and Brethren. And the feeding and overseeing the Flock, are duties so compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated together, that it is evident none can be fitted for the one, without they have also au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the other. And therefore all who
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66109:164"/>
have a power to preach, must also have a right to govern, since Discipline is referable to preaching, as a mean to its end: preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great end of the Ministery. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who are sent upon that work, must not be limited in the other: neither do we ever find <hi>CHRIST</hi> instituting a Superiour Order over preaching <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which shews he judged it not necessary: And no more did the Apostles, though they with-held none of the Counsel of <hi>GOD</hi> from the flock. Therefore this Superior Order usurping the power from the preaching Elders, since it hath neither warrant, nor insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in Scripture, is to be rejected, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of the rights of the Church. In fine, the great advantage our Plea for parity hath, is, that it proves its self, till you prove a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For since you acknowledg it to be of <hi>divine Right,</hi> that there be Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s in the House of <hi>GOD,</hi> except you prove the institution of several Orders, an equality among them must be concluded. And upon these accounts it is that we cannot acknowledg the lawfulness of Prelacy.</p>

               <p>I am sure, if your Friends had now heard you, they would for ever absolve you from designing to betray their cause by a faint Patrociny; since you have in a few words laid out all their Forces: but if you call to mind what
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:66109:164"/>
hath heen already said, you will find most of what you have now pleaded, to be answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand. For I acknowledge <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> to be one and the same Office; and so I plead for no new Office-Bearers in the Church. Next, in our <hi>second Conference,</hi> the power given to Churchmen was proved to be double. The first branch of it, is their Authority to publish the Gospel, to manage the Worship, and to dispense the Sacraments. And this is all that is of <hi>divine right</hi> in the Ministery, in which <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are equal sharers, both being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with this power. But beside this, the Church claims a power of Jurisdiction, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rules for discipline, and of applying and executing the same; all which is indeed suitable to the common Laws of <hi>Societies,</hi> and to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules of Scripture, but hath no positive warrant from any Scripture precept. And all these Constitutions of Churches into Synods, and the Canons of discipline, taking their rise from the divisions of the World into the several Provinces, and beginning in the end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and beginning of the third <hi>Century,</hi> do clearly shew they can be derived from no divine Original; and so were, as to their particular form, but of humane Constitution: therefore as to the management of this Jurisdiction, it is in the Churches power to cast it in what mould
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:66109:165"/>
she will: and if so, then the constant practice of the Church for so many ages should determine us, unless we will pretend to understand the exigencies and conveniences of it better than they who were nearest the Apostolical time. But we ought to be much more determined by the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> which in all such matters have a power to bind our consciences to their obedience, till we prove the matter of them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Now discover where the guilt lyes of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one over a Tract of ground, who shall have the chief inspection of the <hi>Ministery,</hi> and the greatest Authority in matters of Jurisdiction, so that all within that Precinct be governed by him, with the concurring votes of the other <hi>Presbyters</hi>: if you say, that thereby the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may be restrained of many things, which otherwise the good of the Church requires to be done: I answer, these are either things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be done by divine precept, or not: if the former, then since no power on earth can cancel the Authority of the <hi>divine Law,</hi> such restraints are not to be considered. But if the things be not necessary, then the Unity and Peace of the Church is certainly preferable to them. I acknowledge a <hi>Bishop</hi> may be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and become a great burden to his <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>; but, pray, may not the same be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Synods? And remember your friends,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:66109:165"/>
how long it is, since they made the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against the Synods: and the hazard of an ill Bishop is neither so fixed, nor so lasting, as that of a bad Synod. For a Bishop may die, and a good one succeed: but when a Synod is corrupt, they who are the major part, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to bring in none, but such as are sure to their way; whereby they propagate their corruption more infallibly than a Bishop can do. And what if the Lay ruling Elders should bend up the same plea against the Ministers, who do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assume <hi>a Negative</hi> over them directly, or at least do what is equivalent, and carry every thing to the <hi>Presbytery, Synod,</hi> or <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> where they are sure to carry it against the Lay-Elders, they being both more in number, and more able with their learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to confound the others? But should a Lay-Elder plead thus against them, <hi>We are Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice-Bearers instituted by CHRIST, for ruling the flock, as well as you, and yet you take our power from us; for whereas in our Church Sessions, which are of CHRIST</hi>'s <hi>appointment, we are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number, being generally twelve to one; you Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters have got a device, to turn us out of the power: for you allow but one of us to come to your Synods, and Presbyteries, and but one of a whole Presbytery to go to a National Synod; whereby you strike the rest of us out of our power: and thus you assert a preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:66109:166"/>
over us, to carry matters as you please?</hi> Now <hi>Isotimus,</hi> when in your principles you answer this, I will undertake on all hazards to satisfie all you can say, even in your own principles. Next, may not one of the Congregational way, talk at the same rate, and say, <hi>CHRIST hath given his Office-Bearers full power to preach, feed, and oversee the flock; and yet for all that, their power of overseeing is taken from them; and put in the hands of a multitude, who being generally corrupt themselves, and lusting to envy, will suffer none to outstrip them: but are tyrannical over any they see minding the work of the Gospel more than themselves? And must this usurpation be endured and submitted to?</hi> And let me ask you freely, what imaginable device will be fallen upon, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Church from the tyranny of Synods, unless it be either by the Magistrates power, or by selecting some eminent Churchmen, who shall have some degrees of power beyond their brethren? In a word, I deny not, but as in <hi>Civil Governments,</hi> there is no form up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which great inconveniences may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; so the same is unavoidable in <hi>Ecclesiastical Government.</hi> But as you will not deny, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy to be the best of Governments, for all the hazards of tyranny from it; so I must crave leave to have the same impressions of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi>

                  <hi>Isotimus</hi> his too positive asserting of parity from the <hi>New Testament</hi>; for except he find a precept for it, his Negative Authority will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conclude it: and can only prove a parity lawful, and that imparity is not necessary. I shall acknowledge that without Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, no new Offices may be instituted; but without that, in order to Peace, Unity, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and Edification, several ranks and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in the same Office, might well have been introduced: whereby some were to be empo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered either by the Churches choice, or the Kings Authority, as Overseers, or inspectors of the rest: who might be able to restrain them in the exercise of some parts of their functions, which are not immediatly commanded by <hi>GOD.</hi> And you can never prove it unlawful, that any should oversee, direct, and govern Churchmen, without you prove the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical function unlawful: for what is unlawful, and contrary to the rules of the Gospel, can upon no occasion, and at no time become law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: since then both the Apostles, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists exercised Authority over <hi>Presbyters</hi>; it cannot be contrary to the Gospel rules, that some should do it. To pretend that this superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was for that exigent, and to die with that age, is a mere allegation without ground from Scripture: for if by our <hi>LORD</hi>'s words, <hi>it
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:66109:167"/>
shall not be so among you,</hi> all superiority among Churchmen was forbid, how will you clear the Apostles from being the first transgressors of it? And further, if upon that exigent such superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was lawful, then upon a great exigent of the Church, a superiority may be still lawful. Besides, it is asserted, not proved, that such an authority as S. <hi>Paul</hi> left with <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> was to die with that age: for where the reason of an appointment continues, it will follow, that the Law should also be coeval with the ground on which it was first enacted: if then there be a necessity that Churchmen be kept in order, as well as other Christians; and if the more exalted their office be, they become the more subject to corruption, and corruptions among them be both more visible, and more dangerous than they are in other persons; the same parity of reason that enjoyns a Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be granted to Churchmen over the faithful, will likewise determine the fitness of granting some excrescing power to the more venerable and approved of the Clergy over others; neither is this a new Office in the House of <hi>GOD,</hi> but an eminent rank of the same Office.</p>

                  </gap>ands in the Bishops person. And though I do hold it schismatical to ordain without a Bishop, where he may be had, yet I am not to annul these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations that pass from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> where no <hi>Bishop</hi> can be had: and this lays no claim to a new Office, but only to a higher degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection in the same Office; whereby the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of some acts of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> are restrained to such a method; and this may be done either by the Churches free consent, or by the King's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. As for the consecration of <hi>Bishops</hi> by a new imposition of hands, it doth not prove
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:66109:168"/>
them a distinct Office: being only a solemn benediction and separation of them for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that inspection committed to them: and so we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they preached the Gospel, yet when they were sent on a particular Commission to preach to the gentiles) were blessed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. which was the usual Ceremony of benediction. Therefore you have no reason to quarrel this, unless you apprehend their managing this oversight the worse, that they are blessed in order to it: nor can you quarrel the Office in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> if you do not think they will manage their power the worse, if they receive a new effusion of the holy Ghost.

I confess, things among us are not come to any such settlement, as might give a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against this: But devise me one like a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi> who shall not confer Orders to any, before either himself, or some other select and excellent persons, on whom he may with confidence devolve that trust, be well satisfied not only about the learning and abilities, but about the temper, the piety, the humility, the gravity, and discretion of such as pretend to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders: And that some longer tryal be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them by the <hi>probationership</hi> of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious degree. Indeed the poverty of the Church, which is not able to maintain Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Colledges of such <hi>Probationers,</hi> renders this design almost impracticable. But stretch your thoughts as far as your invention can send
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:66109:169"/>
them, and see if you can provide such an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the reforming of so visible an abuse, as were the Bishop's plenary authority to decide in this matter. For if it lie in the hands of a Plurality, the major part of these, as of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, being acted by lower measures, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of Kinred, alliance, friendship, or powerful recommendations, will always carry through persons, be they what they will, as to their abilities and other qualifications: And a multitude of Churchmen is less concerned in the shame can follow an unworthy promotion; which every individual of such a company will be ready to bear off himself, and fasten on the Plurality. But if there were one to whom this were peculiarly committed, who had authority to stop it, till he were clearly convinced that the person to be ordained, was one from whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors good might be expected to the Church, he could act more roundly in the matter: and it may be presupposed that his condition setting him above these low conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as for these in Office, can any thing be more rational than that the inspection into their labors, their deportment, their conversation, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:66109:169"/>
their dexterity in Preaching and Catechising, be not done mutually by themselves in a pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein it is to be imagined, that as they degenerate, they will be very gentle to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? And when any inspection is managed by an equal, it opens a door to faction, envy, and emulation: neither are the private rebukes of an equal, so well received, nor will it be easie for one of a modest temper to admonish his fellow-Presbyter freely. And yet how many things are there, of which Churchmen have need to be admonished, in the discharge of all the parts of their function, especially when they set out first, being often equally void of experience and discretion? But what a remedy for all this, may be expected from an excellent Bishop: who shall either, if his health and strength allow it, be making excursions through his Diocese, and himself observe the temper, the labors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of his Clergy? or at least trust this to such as he hath reason to confide most in, that so he may understand what admonitions, directions, and reproofs are to be given, which might obviate a great many indiscretions, and scandals that flow from Churchmen. And the authority of such a person, as it would more recommend the reproofs to these for whom they were meant, so it could prevail to make them effectual, by a following Censure if

If the confusion some keep matters in, have hindered us for coming at a desired settlement, the Office of Episcopacy is not to be blamed, whose native tendency I have laid out before you, and in a fair <hi>idea,</hi> but in what was both the rule and practice of the ancient Church, and wants not latter instances fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, I must tell you, I am so far from apprehending danger to the Church, from Bishops having too much power, that I shall fear rather its slow recovery, because they have too little: which might be managed with all the meekness and humility imaginable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ought to be always accompanied with the advice and concurrence of the worthiest persons among the inferior Clergy.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:66109:171"/>
which our divisions occasioned among us, and when I read the large offers S. <hi>Augustin</hi> made on the like occasion to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> I judged all possible attempts even with the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est condescentions for an accommodation, a worthy and pious design, well becoming the gravity and moderation of a Bishop to offer, and the nobleness of these in authority to second with their warmest endeavors: for if it was blessed with success, the effect was great, even the setling of a broken and divided corner of the Church: if it took not, as it fully exonered the Church of the evils of the Schism; so it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the enemies of Peace and Unity the more unexcusable.

and two Presbyters had with about thirty of the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> at <hi>Pasley,</hi> on the 14th of <hi>December</hi> in the year 1670. When the Bishop had in a long Discourse recommended Unity and Peace to them, on the terms were offered; he withal said much to the advantage of Episcopacy as he stated it, from the rules and practices of the ancient Church: offering to turn their Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And with other things, he desired to know whether they would have joined in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (to carry them no higher) or not? for if they refused that, he added he would have less heartiness to desire communion with them, since of these he might say, <hi>Let my soul be with theirs.</hi> But to that, a general answer was made by one, who said, He hoped they were not looked upon, as either so weak, or so wilful, as to determine in so great a matter, but upon good grounds: which were the same, that the asserters of Presbyterian Government had built on, which they judged to be conform both to Scripture and Primitive Antiquity. But for Scripture, neither he nor any of the meeting offered to bring a Title: only he alledged some differences betwixt the anci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this was more fully enlarged by one who is believed to be among the most learned of the Party: whose words with the answer given them, I shall read to you, as I take both from a Journal was drawn of that affair, by one whose exactness and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it, can be attested by some worthy specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who read what he wrote after the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ended, and Judged it not only faithful, but often verbal: And that he was so careful to evite the appearances of partiality, that he seemed rather studious to be more copious in proposing what was said by these who differed from his opinion, whereas he contracted much of what was said by these he favored.

               <p>Upon this discourse, the Bishop being weary of speaking much, looked to one of his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom that Pamphlet in derision, calls, <hi>a worthy Doctor:</hi> who said, <hi>He found the ancient writings were so clear for a disparity among Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so full of it, that he was assured none could doubt it, after he had looked but overly upon them: But as to what was alledged, he first assumed the five particulars, and spoke to them in order. To the first, he said, It was true, the term</hi> Archbishop, <hi>was not used in the first Centuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the Council of</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For the second particular, it is true, Bishops were in many places very thick set; for in</hi> S. Augustin'<hi>s time it appears from the journals of a Conference he had with the</hi> Donati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to prove this, the Canons of</hi> Ancyra <hi>make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Presbyters of the Country from those of the City: and over the former there was a</hi> Chorepiscopus; <hi>which sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ws that the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese was not within the City. But this was not much to our purpose, since the</hi> more or the less did not
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:66109:173"/>
vary the kind. <hi>And if a Bishop might be over the Ministers of the City, it cannot be unlawful that he be likewise set over more in the Country: which can be no more essential to this matter, than it is, whether a Parish be great or small. So that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may well make the one unexpedient, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful it cannot be, if the other be lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the third particular, there was a Canon of the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>that there might be</hi> but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in a City. <hi>And he was amazed to hear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of S.</hi> Augustin <hi>alledged, who was indeed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Coadjutor to</hi> Valerius; <hi>but himself in his</hi> I 10. Epist. <hi>condemns that, telling that he did it ignorantly, not knowing it to be contrary to the</hi> Nicene Rules: <hi>And therefore he tells how he designed</hi> Eradius <hi>to be his Successor, but would not ordain him in his own time, because of that Canon. Other instances of more Bishops in one City, might have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

have succeeded him at</hi> Antioch: <hi>But for this, none assert that both succeeded to</hi> S. Peter; <hi>some being for one, and some for another: and so in a historical matter, the testimonies of these who lived nearest that time should decide the question. But the</hi> Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>of</hi> Clemens <hi>offer a solution to this, that at first there were in some Cities two Churches, one for those of the</hi> Circumcision, <hi>and another for those of the</hi> Uncircumcision: <hi>and after the destruction of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, <hi>this distinction was swallowed up. This is rational, and not without ground in Scripture: besides, that that Book, though none of</hi> Clements, <hi>yet is ancient. And from all this it was clear, that there might be but one Bishop in a City.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>As for the fourth particular, it is true, the ancient elections of</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Presbyters <hi>were partly by</hi> Synods, <hi>partly by</hi> Presbyters, <hi>and partly popular. But as none would say it made any essential alteration of the</hi> Constitution <hi>of a Church, if instead of these elections,</hi> Patrons <hi>had now a right of presenting to Churches; so though instead of these elections the King were</hi> Patron <hi>of all the Bishopricks, it did not alter the nature of</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>much less justifie a Schism against it.

                  <hi>And for the fifth particular, he desired they might give one instance in all Antiquity, where a Bishop was censured by Presbyters: it being clear that they could finish nothing without the Bishops sentence,</hi>

Yet even this exception could be no ground for separating, no more than in their principles Lay Elders had to separate from their Ministers, who were their fixed President, and yet did not judge themselves censurable by these Lay Elders; tho as to the power of ruling, they held them to be equal.</hi> With this he ended, saying, <hi>He had now proposed what occurred of a sudden to his tho

And by this account (of the truth whereof I am willing all there present bear witness) let the company judge of the ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of these Writers.

               <p>I am sure it hath left this conviction on all our Consciences, that that Party is obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed to their own humors, without the least color of reason. But now, I think, enough is said for justifying both the lawfulness and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Episcopacy, and that there is nothing in it contrary either to the nature or rules of the Gospel, or of right Reason. And for any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional evils may have risen from the restitution of this Government, they are with no justice to be fastened on it. I know, many accuse their revenues and honors, thus <hi>the spirit that is in us lusteth to 'envy:</hi> and the eyes of many are evil, because the eyes of our pious Progenitors were good. But indeed the ravenous Appetites of some <hi>Ostriches</hi> among us, have swallowed down so much of the Churches Patrimony, that what remains of it, can scarce provoke envy. And truly Churchmen bestowing their Revenues well, for Alms-deeds, relieving the Widows and Orphans, and such modest hospitality and decency, as may preserve them from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem of the vulgar, who measure their value of men much from these externals, there were no ground of quarrelling at them were their riches seven-fold increased. I am far from the thoughts of patronizing the <hi>German</hi> Bishops, on whom I look as the disgrace of that Order, who live in all things like other Princes, making Wars, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:66109:175"/>
leading out Armies: nor do they once consider their Dioceses, or what they owe them as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, being wholly immersed in secular affairs. But for all this, I cannot see cause for blaming Churchmen, their being either upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Councils of the Kingdom in Parliaments, or on His Majesties Secret Councils, and that both because Ecclesiastical matters are often in agitation, both in the one, and the other, in which none are so properly to be advised with as Churchmen. Occasion may also be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given to those who should be presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to understand the rules of equity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science best, to lay them before others, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know them not, or mind them too little. And finally, they are Subjects, as well as others, and by the clearness is to be expected in their Judgments, and the calmness of their minds, together with their abstracted and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive manner of life, they may upon occasions be very prudent Counsellors: And why a Prince shall be deprived of the Councils of that which should be the wisest and best part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no reason can be given. But for all this, I acknowledge there is great hazard from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Infirmity, lest by such medling they be too much intangled in matters extrinsick to them, whereby their thoughts may be drawn out from that inward, serene, and abstracted temper
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:66109:176"/>
wherein their minds should be preserved; both for more spiritual Contemplation, and for a more close pursuing the work of the Gospel, which ought still to be their chief labor. But I must touch this string no more, lest you say that <hi>the Fox preacheth,</hi> and methinks our discourse is now near its period.</p>

               <p>A great many things do yet remain which are untouched, and deserve to be better considered: for these crude Dialogues poured out a great deal of stuff, which it is like the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never examined: And in these, you who are his friends, must either vindicate him, or leave him to the mercy of every severe censurer.</p>

               <p>His temper is well enough known to us, that he is very little sollicitous about the esteem or censures of men: and therefore, if all the particulars in his Book, cannot maintain themselves to the judgments of rational and unprepossessed Readers, he thinks them not worthy of his Patrociny. And for that little trifling way of writing, by tracing every word in a Book, or of making good all a man hath said, it is a task equally mean, unpleasant, and laborious: and looks like one contending for victory more than truth. Were it a worthy thing for us to go and reckon how often <hi>and</hi> comes about in any of that Pamphleteers long periods, or how often he writes false Grammar,

               <p>This is the genuine Spirit of the party which you now express to the life; but when ever the Author of the Dialogues undergoes the penance of examining what you desire, it will perhaps appear, you have as little ground for this as for your other boasting. But I am sure no scruple sticks with me about these great heads we have examined, so that upon a narrow survey of these matters, it appears he had more reason for what he asserted, than he then vented:

this design as much as my leisure and other avocations could allow of. But as I was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what method to follow in digesting my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, the Canons vulgarly called Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, offered themselves to my thoughts: I thereupon resolved to follow their tract, and to compile such hints as I could gather on my way for giving a clear view of the state of the Church in the first ages. As for the opinions of the ancient Fathers, these have been so copious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined by the Writers of Controversies, that scarce any thing can be added to those who went before us: bet few have been at such pains for searching into their practices, and rules for Discipline, and Worship, wherein their excellency and strength lay. In this inquiry I have now made good advances, but at present I will only send you my Observations on the two first Canons: and as you shall find this task hath suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor can they be called the work of <hi>Clemens Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> though they were vented under his name. For <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis,</hi> reckons the work of <hi>Clemens Apocryphal.</hi> And <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us that nothing ascribed to <hi>Clement</hi> was held ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, but his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> But the first Publishers of these who lived, it is like in the Third <hi>Century,</hi> have called them Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, as containing the earliest rules which the Apostolical men had introduced in the Church. And afterwards others to conciliate more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for them, cal
