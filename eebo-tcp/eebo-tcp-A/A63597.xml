            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

anſwer it. Three weeks after, ſhe miſſes her
Gold, and ſpeaks to the ſaid other Gentleman to
tell the now Priſoner of it, being in the Country,
who reſolutely denies it. But that which ſeem'd
to have moſt weight, was, that amongſt this

            <p>The note was the eminent Tryal of <hi>Charles Pampliu</hi> for
Murdering Lieutenant <hi>Charles Daliſon,</hi> in which a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

which 'twas proved the Priſoner had borrowed that morning.
'Twas proved the day before he coming into a mans Chamber
while he was aſleep, took away a very long Sword and left
his own in the room of it; which long Sword compared now
with Mr. <hi>Daliſons,</hi> exceeded it a quarter of a yard in length.
'Twas alſo proved, the Priſoner had declared, Mr. <hi>Daliſon</hi> had
affronted him, and that he would be reveng'd; and that very
morning he told one, he reſolv'd to cudgel one that had abuſed
him, and about ten or eleven a clock at night (juſt about the
time <hi>Daliſon</hi> was kill'd) he paſt by the ſame perſon in haſt, and
looking amazedly, ſaid onely, <hi>He had met with him.</hi> That

Lieutenant, and at his taking in <hi>Jewen</hi> ſtreet he endeavour'd
to flie, and ſaid, <hi>He was a dead man.</hi> Upon all which, and
divers other moſt violent Circumſtances, being able to alleadge

Then three luſty young fellows were tryed for two ſeveral
Robberies on the Highway, but of that baſer kind called the
Foot pad. One was on a perſon paſſing on foot through
King <hi>Harries</hi> Walk, whom they ſet upon, beat, took from him
about five ſmillings, all that he had about him, and then flung
him into a Ditch and bound him. The other was on a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

a Tree, and endeavoured to turn his horſe, but before he
could get back, was beſet; whereupon he alighted and run
for it, and they after: In the mean time the Wife rides away
to get help; but they overtaking him, take from him three
pounds, binde him, and get away, but were all taken, one at
<hi>London,</hi> and two at <hi>Newington,</hi> the next morning: and now
both the perſons ſwore directly and poſitively againſt them
all three; whereupon they were Condemned. 'Tis obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Coach; ſo little did the ſad ſight of their Fellow-Criminals

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they
went immediately from that Spectacle to act the ſame or like
Crimes as had brought the others thereunto.</p>
            <p>A young Lad that was in but the laſt Seſſions, was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
for ſtealing 140 <hi>l.</hi> on the 27th of <hi>April</hi> laſt out of a
Goldſmiths ſhop in <hi>Lumbard</hi> ſtreet. He watcht his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
when there was no body in the ſhop but a Maid-ſervant,
and ſtepping behinde the Counter, ſnatches up two bags of
money: The Maid ſeeing him go out with them, concluded
him ſome Merchants man that came for ſome Money he had
left there; but when they came to count over their Caſh, they
one bag of 80 <hi>l.</hi> and another of 60 <hi>l.</hi> miſſing. Upon further
inquiry there was a Porter ſaw him go forth alſo with the
bags: ſo that being able to give a deſcription, one of the
Marſhals men took him the next day; but the Money was not
to be found. The Gentleman that loſt it, to draw him to a
diſcovery, put 20 <hi>l.</hi> more into his hands, which he was to have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106399:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he would help him to it again. The boy pretended 'twas
buried in a Field, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſpent between 20 and 30 <hi>s.</hi> of the
20 <hi>l.</hi> and now denied he knew any thing of the ſaid Robbery,
much leſs what was become of the 140 <hi>l.</hi> However, on the
aforeſaid Evidence, knowing him again, he was Convicted
and burnt in the hand.</p>
            <p>The little boy firſt mentioned, was next day tryed again,
and found guilty of ſtealing from a Goldſmith in <hi>Holborn</hi>
eight ſilver Spoons valued at 4 <hi>l.</hi> ſix ſilver Forks ſilver Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers;

               </gap>alers were Convicted on ſeveral
Indictments, being both joyntly found guilty of ſtealing two
Horſes from <hi>Bednal green;</hi> one of which was taken at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
the other ſold into <hi>Suſſex.</hi> They were likewiſe found

and one of them likewiſe by himſelf, Convicted on two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Indictments on the like kind: For which they received
Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>A woman was Convicted of ſtealing a ſilver Trencher-plate
of his Excellencies the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſadors, whoſe Arms
ſhe had ſcratcht out; but bringing it to ſell, the honeſt Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith
ſtop: it on ſuſpition, and after wards by patting it in the
fire, or ſome ſuch Art he uſed, as did notwithſtanding make
moſt part of the Arms conſpicuous, he thereby diſcovered the
Owner, and ſeized the Thief; who was now Convicted,
but reprieved before Judgment.</p>
            <p>Two perſons were here in queſtion about falſe and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Guinnies. One of them not long ſince was Convicted at
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> as he now confeſt in Court, forth: Cheat of putting
off ſuch falſe Guinnies; and now it was proved he had put
off no leſs than three, one at a Tavern in <hi>Moore-fields,</hi> which
was produced in Court; another at <hi>Hackney,</hi> where he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and offered 10 <hi>l.</hi> to evade Proſecution, but the party
was a better friend to Juſtice than to accept it; a third at another
place. There was an Indictment againſt themfor High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106399:5"/>
but there was not ſufficient Evidence to prove that they
counterfeited them: But on the other Indictment for miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
in cheating and defrauding the Kings Subjects, 'twas
apparent they were guilty.</p>
            <p>There were in all Ten perſons that received Sentence of
Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Seven men, one for Murder, three notorious High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men
