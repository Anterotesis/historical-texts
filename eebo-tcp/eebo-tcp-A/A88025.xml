            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He very much unexpected, undeſerved, and <hi>Illegal</hi> uſage which we lately found from the hands of ſome <hi>Officers</hi> and
<hi>Souldiers,</hi> (they declaring for juſt liberty) hath enforced us to make this <hi>application</hi> to your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> as the <hi>Patron</hi> of
this City, from whom we hope we may juſtly expect <hi>common freedom</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> with other the Citizens thereof:
In order whereunto we crave leave to acquaint your Lordſhip, That the other night about <hi>midnight,</hi> ſeveral parties
of <hi>ſoldiers</hi> came to our <hi>dwellings,</hi> who (without any <hi>VVarrant</hi> from the Parliament, Council of State, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
the Magiſtrate of this City, or any other civil Authority, (A preſident not to be paralleld that we know of in
the City, in all our late ſad inteſtine wars) demanded admiſſion; And to the great <hi>affrightment</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> of our <hi>wives, children,</hi>
with other <hi>relations,</hi> apprehended our <hi>Prrſons,</hi> being <hi>quiet</hi> in our habitations, and ſome of us <hi>ſick in our beds,</hi> ſearched our houſes, carried,
and detained our perſons as <hi>Priſoners</hi> at the <hi>Guard</hi> at <hi>Pauls,</hi> till that day noon, and then no otherwiſe ſuffered us to be removed from
thence, but as being ſtill under <hi>confinement,</hi> and to return at their pleaſure, giving us to no account of the reaſon of this action, but ſaid
they had <hi>Order</hi> from General <hi>Monck,</hi> which they refuſed to let us <hi>read:</hi> we deſired to know our <hi>accuſers</hi> or <hi>accuſations,</hi> but could not
underſtand the leaſt <hi>crime</hi> laid to our charge. Being thus uſed as <hi>evil doers,</hi> expoſed to <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>reproach,</hi> hindred in our <hi>Callings,</hi> and
prejudiced in our Credits, We cannot be ſo injurious to our ſelves (with other Citizens) as to ſuffer this <hi>wrong,</hi> without endeavouring
our <hi>juſt vindication</hi> and reparation. We are not willing to <hi>conclude</hi> that this hath <hi>befallen us</hi> in reference to our <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>practiſe,</hi>
in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> which we are not aſhamed to own, as being agreeable to the mind of God revealed in the holy Scriptures; as alſo
within the <hi>liberty</hi> that the <hi>General</hi> himſelf hath <hi>held forth to be enjoyed by us, equally with other perſons, truly fearing God,</hi> Why then ſhould
we thus ſuffer, having to our utmoſt in all our capacities, endeavoured the <hi>common peace</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of this <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi>
to the contrary? Surely my Lord, as the <hi>Preſident</hi> it ſelf is of moſt <hi>dangerous conſequence</hi> to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of this place, ſo will it <hi>ſound</hi>
very <hi>harſh</hi> in the <hi>ears</hi> of other <hi>people</hi> in the <hi>Nation,</hi> who may reckon themſelves expoſed to the like uſage, if this and ſuch like <hi>actions</hi>
paſs without <hi>due obſervation;</hi> and therefore for their ſakes (as our own) we cannot be altogether ſilent; Beſides that even now when
moſt men are ſeeking for <hi>ſettlement,</hi> ſuch <hi>undertakings,</hi> how <hi>greatly</hi> they <hi>tend</hi> to <hi>diſſettle</hi> mens minds, and fill the Land with <hi>diſturbances</hi>
and <hi>diſtractions,</hi> we leave to your Lordſhip to judge. My Lord, We ſue to your Lordſhip for nothing, but that <hi>right</hi> may be <hi>done</hi> us;
If we have done any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> or the <hi>City,</hi> we refuſe not, but ſeek a <hi>legal tryal;</hi> But if otherwiſe (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we are not conſcious to our ſelves, that we have (in the leaſt) offended againſt this City or our Rulers) We do <hi>claim our right,</hi> and
humbly conceive your Lordſhip engaged to <hi>endeavour</hi> that we may be ſet at <hi>liberty</hi> from our <hi>confinement;</hi> But if your Lordſhip ſhall
think it fit and requiſite, that <hi>application</hi> be in this caſe made to the <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>Council of State,</hi> we then humbly pray, That we, being
Members of this City, your Lordſhip will pleaſe to move for <hi>preſent redreſs</hi> in this our <hi>grievance,</hi> and future <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> (with
others our neighbours) in out <hi>habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, the day following they <hi>ſeached</hi> our houſes for <hi>Arms,</hi> there being <hi>reports</hi> of <hi>great numbers</hi> found there, which were no more
in all our houſes but as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lieuetenant Colonel <hi>Kiffen,</hi> 2 Drums, 1 Pattiſan, 5 old Pikes, and 6 Swords.</p>
            <p>Major <hi>Mallery,</hi> 3 Piſtols, 2 Swords, and his ſons Fouling piece.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Gosfright,</hi> 3 Drums, 1 Leading ſtaff, 1 Sword, and 3 Birding pieces belonging to a Dutch Merchant, and another friend.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Hewling,</hi> 7 Pikes, 12 Muskets, and 17 Swords, whoſe arms being gathered in by the States Order, to be returned into the
Tower. The ſaid Captain <hi>Hewling</hi> gave notice before to the Clerk of the Delivery, to cauſe them to be fetcht in accordingly, who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

            <p>Lieutenant <hi>Lomes,</hi> 3 Muskets, 3 Pikes, and 1 Sword.</p>
            <p>And whilſt we were writing this Letter to your Lordſhip, there was brought to our view a printed Libellous paper, this day publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
ſtiled <hi>A Serious Manifeſto and Declaration of the Anabaptiſts, and other Congregational Churches, touching the preſent tranſactions of
the affairs of this Commonwealth, both in Church and State.</hi> Touching which, although we doubt not but all <hi>ſober minded people</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be (as it is) <hi>forged, falſe and ſcandalous,</hi> and done by prophane and luxuriant <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> who makes <hi>lies</hi> their <hi>refuge,</hi> and under
<hi>falſehood</hi> hide themſelves, deſigning to foment <hi>diſtractions</hi> and <hi>confuſions</hi> in this <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> yet we think fit, without further,
troubling our ſelves therewith, to certifie your Lordſhip our <hi>diſowning</hi> and deteſting thereof, with our confidence and aſſurance of the
like diſowning by all thoſe upon whom its unworthily <hi>patroniſed,</hi> humbly deſiring, that ſuch <hi>Printers</hi> and <hi>Publiſhers</hi> being <hi>ſearcht out,</hi> may
be made <hi>exemplary,</hi> or at leaſt, that ſuch abuſive and <hi>ſcandalous papers,</hi> may be ſpeedily and effectually <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> according to <hi>Law,</hi> there
