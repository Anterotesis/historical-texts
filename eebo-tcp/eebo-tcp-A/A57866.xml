            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS very unaccountable, that whilst not a few Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
and Lying Pamphlets against the Present Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
in <hi>Scotland</hi> have come abroad, they should
be generally entertained with so profound a Silence,
as is usually the Concomitant of the greatest Guilt. And since it
can be plainly demonstrated, that it does not proceed from this, it
must be acknowledged, that 'tis owing to a Prodigious Stupidity and
Supineness in those Persons to suffer themselves to be thus <hi>impune</hi>
traduced: 'Tis too apparent, what Advantages their Restless and
Tyrannical Enemies reap thereby, who like that Arch-Tyrant their
Master <hi>Lucifer,</hi> are uncessantly pushing on their Mischievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
the Effects of which we have in part tasted already, and may
yet more, if a seasonable Diligence in exposing them to the
World do not prevent it. Let not therefore a Selfish, Timorous, nor
Slavish Principle, or a Prodigious Supineness, deter any from so
commendable a design as is the defending our Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
against those Men, who have been so <hi>Mighty Hunters</hi> after
them, and at last the Overthrowers thereof, and setting them forth
in their own Colours, that the Government nor Subjects, may be
no more imposed upon by so Spurious a Race of Mankind, whom,
should we judge of them by their Actions, we would rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
to be of Diabolical than Humane Extract.</p>
            <p>But lest, I should seem to lay heavy burthens on other Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and refuse to touch them with one of my Fingers, I shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, tho' in a total Diffidence of my Ability to engage so Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Adversary, as Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> was, make some Remarks
on his Vindication; and leaving the Law Part to Gentlemen of the
Long Robe, I shall content my Self with shewing the World with
what Ingenuity he represents those Persons, who were the Butt of
the Fury of that Government he undertakes the Vindication of:
And if I can Evince to the World, that they whom he represents as the
<hi>Refuse of Mankind,</hi> were but acted by the same Principles that the
Generality of Men are; and that what they are charged with is but
what the most pretendedly Loyal have, or would have under the
same Circumstances been guilty of, then I hope I shall appear to have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97829:3"/>
rendred useless our Gentlemans best Engine for vindicating that
Government.</p>
            <p>And, in the first place, it may seem strange that any Person
should undertake the Vindication of the Management of Affairs in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Charles II.</hi> Since no Body, that we know
of, has in Print undertaken that of the Management of Affairs then
even here, where things were not screwed up to the heighth they were
in that Kingdom: But above all it may be matter of highest admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that a Person who was as much Dipt, as any in those Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Proceedings, should aspire to impose thus far on the World,
and more, that any should be so credulous, as to receive as Truths,
what the Passion our Author discovers throughout the whole Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
plainly declares how unlikely he was to give a true Relation of.
But to be brief;</p>
            <p>He would have done well to have mentioned the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
wherewith those Malicious Authors he mentions
reproached the Government,<note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> and then refuted them by
plain Matter of Fact: This would have procured greater Credit
from all Judicious, Unbyast Persons, than a bare representing them
as it pleased him, and that Faction.</p>
            <p>This Author was too forward, when he asserted that
those that complained of Oppressions in Kings <hi>Charles II.</hi>
Reign,<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> were the first Aggressors in the Reign of King
<hi>Charles I.</hi> Since 'tis too obvious, that what they Acted then was
mostly defensive: It is sufficiently known what Infringments upon
their Liberties that King made. It would be thought no small En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
here to introduce a New Mode of Worship without its
being enacted by Parliament. How Passive-spirited soever we are
'tis hardly to be believed we would suffer it. And 'tis beyond all
denyal true, that King <hi>Charles I,</hi> attempted it there, and that that
alone did raise the Ferment of the Nation against him, and brought
upon him all the Miseries he suffered from thence.</p>
            <p>He concludes this Paragraph with saying, that what was done
against them, rather deserves rather the Name of <hi>Self-defence</hi> than
<hi>Persecution.</hi> But let's hear how, he makes good this Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For clearing this,</hi> he says, <hi>'tis necessary to represent that in
the Year,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 1637. <hi>We lived under the most Pious and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Prince of the Age, and yet a Rebellion was form'd
against him, as a Papist, and a Tyrant,</hi> &amp;c. But how Pious and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97829:3"/>
Orthodox soever this Prince was (as 'tis none of my business to
Question either) yet when so great Infringements were made upon
the Priviledges of the People, so Arbitrary Imprisonings, Finings,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are too Notorious for Impudence it self to deny) 'twas
no contemptible Sign, that the best that could be said of him was
that he was too much Influenced by Bad Counsel, which is at least a
<hi>Corruption:</hi> And 'tis a no less true than usual saying, <hi>Corruptio optimi
pessima,</hi> and if they took what course they thought conduced most
for their Security, 'tis but what may be Parallell'd in several Ages
past: And late times have informed us, that not a few of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who have condemned this Practice of theirs, against the Lords
Anointed, have been forced in Extremity to have recourse to a much
like Expedient: And therefore, I think, what he insinuates upon
this Head will have little Influence on any, save our present Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to aggravate their Crimes, wherein he
must needs be Guilty of the Highest Disingenuity,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or
Gross Ignorance of Matters of Fact (the latter of which
is hardly credible of a Man of his Industry and Learning) while he
says that Covenants were entred into by a Part of the Subjects, since
it is certain that the Covenant was made by the Body of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Earl of <hi>Montrose</hi> himself (who was afterwards so great
a Champion for them) concurring at first as vigorously as any; and
'tis sufficiently known, that it was upon a disgust, probably owing
to his aspiring Genius, (who like another <hi>Pompey non modo</hi> Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
<hi>sed nec</hi> Parem <hi>ferre valebat)</hi> that he became such a Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Arbitrary Cause. And supposing they had any just ground
for defending themselves, Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (As if when a King
takes upon him to alter the Settlement stablisht by Law be not, I
know not when it will be, and afterwards it may be too late) then
their entring into Leagues for that Effect against a Prince and those
Wicked Ministers under him, will not be so great a Bugbear as this
Gentleman would make it to appear. Since the Protestants in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> &amp;c. did the like; besides, notwithstanding
what our Authors says, <hi>p.</hi> 3. That we had neither formerly known
Oaths nor Burthens under our Gentle Kings, 'tis sufficiently known
that K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. (when the Earl of <hi>Traquair</hi> sate at the Helm
there) imposed on the Subjects on Oath commonly called the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
with great Severity generally over the Countrey, and 'tis not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97829:4"/>
improbable, that the Covenant was a Counter-Oath to that. But
that such Violence was used in imposing the Covenant as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
says (tho' I will not deny, but that it was imposed more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was fitting) is an Assertion, which he and his Party cannot
demonstrate.</p>
            <p>That the General Assembly refused to rise, when Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by the Kings Commissioner,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> was because they
were authorized so to do by the Parliament. That they
threw out the Bishops without the Authority of Parliament is false,
since they had their allowance for it. And tho' this Gentleman is
pleased to say, that the Bishops were always the first of the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of Parliament, yet 'tis not to be received as an undoubted
Truth, for setting aside that it has been urged by as strong, if not
stronger Arguments, than the contrary has either by him, or a
Learned Prelate, that at the first Propagation of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they had no Diocesan Bishops, but the Church
was governed by <hi>Culdees</hi> or <hi>Monks;</hi> yet this is certain, that for
several Parliaments next after the Reformation, and during King
<hi>James</hi>'s Residence there were no Bishops, and consequently none sate
there; and that in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1610. three of the nominated <hi>Scotch</hi> Bishops
came up to <hi>London</hi> to receive Consecration, that they might go down
and confer the Holy Ghost upon their Brethren. And it may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
from Histories by what Indirect means Bishops were establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
there, <hi>viz.</hi> by imprisoning and sending for to <hi>London</hi> the Leading
Men in the Assembly, bribing others that were at home, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
others, if they stood up for the Discipline of the Church: And
the Bishops themselves solemnly protested in the presence of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
that they would never exercise that Authority, as it was
in <hi>England,</hi> when all the while this was a meer trick to blind the Eyes
of the Assembly till such time as they were fully setled in the Saddle.
Besides, most of our first Bishops were Men very unfit for so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Charge as that is, as will appear by the following Verses made
upon their Vices, which because they may have come to the hands
of few here, for the Readers Satisfaction, I shall here insert.</p>

            <p>I might say much more of these Gentlemen but will not trouble
the Reader with it.</p>
            <p>Tis an Untruth <hi>that any were put to Death meerly for
defending their own Houses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> We do not hear any of
Note put to death save the Earl of <hi>Montrose.</hi> And how
<hi>Merciless</hi> that Nobleman was at <hi>Kilsythe</hi> and other Places, is too
well known, so that he rendred himself generally Odious. What he
says of borrowing vast Sums of Money signifies little to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
since 'tis sufficiently known that a War could not
be carried on without Money:<note place="margin">Ib.</note> But it is certain the
Gentlemen of his side stood not upon the Ceremonies of
borrowing, for they left neither Money nor Goods where they
came, and never questioned their Right to any thing could they
but lay their fingers on't.</p>
            <p>If this Gentleman had had the least Grain of Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
he would have acknowledged that the Presbyterians
were most Instrumental in bringing home King <hi>Charles</hi>
the II. and 'tis to be proved in Spite of him and his Party, that
the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> did behave themselves most Loyally
during the time of the Usurpation; and that, if we except two
or three, all that were advanced to be Bishops at that Kings Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had been the greatest Compliers with and Cajolers of the
Usurpation. Any that liv'd in those days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can inform us of their

on those Men, so as they could not go on in their
full carreer in sin, that conscientious Ministers were entertained
by them with the same Language that our Saviour was by the
Unclean Spirits; <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> And
the blessed Effect of this was clearly seen, for whereas before when
that Church was Maimed by having the Principal Order of her
Guides lopt off, 'twas lookt upon as odious if persons neglected

Which brings into my mind how Prophetical the Judicious <hi>Beza</hi>
was of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Prelates <hi>Kidney</hi> in a Letter of his to Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi>
part whereof I shall here set down. <q>But, <hi>(saith he speaking of</hi>
them,) I would have you, my dear <hi>Knox</hi> and the other Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
to remember that which is before your Eyes: As Bishops
brought forth the Papacy; so false Bishops the Relicks of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
will bring in Epicurism into the World: They that desire
the Churches good and safety, let them take heed of this Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and seeing that you have put that Plague to flight time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
I heartily pray you that you never admit it again; albeit
it seem plausible with the pretence or colour of keeping Unity,
which pretence deceived the Ancient Fathers, yea many even the
best of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentleman notoriously prevaricates in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
when he says.<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
               <q>That the Parliament found
that all the Disorders proceeded from the solemn League
and Covenant, and those that adher'd thereto; and that they
therefore endeavoured to persuade the Presbyterians to
disown it: but finding them Stubborn, to prevent acting the
same things over again, they restored Episcopacy.</q> But I would
know what these Disorders were: Why resisting the Lords Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not suffering him to tyranize at pleasure. It is sufficiently
known that both the Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> and that here in
<hi>England</hi> immediately after the Restauration, to shew their Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the former Parliaments Proceedings and their Zeal for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
Monarchy, took very unaccountable Measures, and
inconsiderately betrayed the Priviledges of the People, and did
what lay in them to Tempt Kings to become Tyrants: and so as
they repeal'd the Covenant, they made a Declaration which at last
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97829:5"/>
was as generally Imposed as it was, whereby they obliged Men
to declare upon Oath, <hi>That it was Unlawful upon any pretenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whatsoever to take up Arms against the King or any Commissioned by
him.</hi> And to this Oath and the Preaching the Joyful. Tidings of
of Passive Obedience, we owe all the Miseries we have suffered
since. It is certain that this Oath was made Principally as a Trap
for the Dissenters, as being the only Persons charged with the
Guilt of the War against King <hi>Charles I.</hi> (tho' it is sufficiently
known that in <hi>England</hi> at least the greatest part of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> (except we will restrict it to those few hundreds now that
have not bowed the Knee to that <hi>Baal</hi> of the Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ples, to use the
Jacobites canting expression, with some other of the Honest
Vicar of <hi>Brays</hi> Principles their Well-wishers) joyned with the
Parliament, if it be but considered that the Number of Dissenters
now is not the Third of the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> when it is
far greater than it was at the beginning of the Civil War.) But
behold the Justice of God! For he made this Oath which they
designed as a Whip to chastise others a Rod for their own Backs,
and suffered them to run on so far in their inconsideration, that
in the End they found themselves obliged to Justifie by their
Practice, what before they had by a Law condemned in those
Honest Patriots, both here and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that stood up for the
Liberties of the People. And this was not only the practice
of Laymen, but even some in the Highest of the Spiritual sphere,
did so far Justifie the Proceedings of both those Parliaments as to
take Arms against the Lords Anointed, with a <hi>Nolumus Leges
Angliae Mutari.</hi> Nor were there any that we know of that at
that time disapproved, or at least declared against Subjects joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his present Majesty against King <hi>James;</hi> and the
Scripture says, <hi>He that is not against us is for us:</hi> Nay, did not
even our Tender conscienc't scrupling Bishops, refuse to sign an
Abhorrence of his present Majesties Undertaking, and to declare that
it was Unlawful upon pain of Damnation (as was formerly sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from our Wooden Pulpits I had almost said by Wooden Priests)
for any of the Subjects to joyn with him against the late King
<hi>Iames,</hi> the then Lords Anointed? All which plainly indicates
to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how miserably the People had been bubbled out of their
Priviledge, by Gentlemen whom of all other it might have been
least expected from: So that had it not pleased God in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97829:6"/>
to make their Copy hold to be touched, we had been (for
ought can be seen to the contrary) precipitated into Irremediable
slavery. I shall not here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Trouble the Reader with a Parallel of
the two Kings Illegal Proceedings, it having been so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done already that Reason is fully satisfied in the point, It is
sufficient to remark that we were willing, to part with that
Doctrine we so much valued our selves upon, when a regulating
our Practice by it seem'd to threaten us with a storm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A plain
Indication that it was but a Bait to fish Benefices, and a Trap
to catch simple People in.</p>
            <p>What he says <hi>That that Parliament restored Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
so much the more because that 'Government had in
no Age nor Place forced its way into the state by the
Sword,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> is much of a Piece with the Rest, and there's scarce any will
believe that that was the Parliaments Motive. All that can be
said with respect to the Bishops not forcing their way into the
state, is only because they never had so strong a Party in that
Kingdom, and that all the Kings that set them up there, were grasping
after an Arbitrary Government, for all the reason King James
the I. there the VI. gave, for the Expediency of Bishops there, was,
that he had not sufficient strength on his side to ballance the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore that it was requisite there should be Bishops
to vote for him in Parliament. But whatever this Gentleman
subtly suggests, the World is not so simple now as to believe
that they would not use their Utmost Efforts either to Introduce
or support themselves. It is sufficiently known what they have
done to preserve themselves in that Countrey, and how much they
forwarded Arbitrary Government there (it plainly appearing that
the pretended Axiom which they cunningly invented, No <hi>Bishop
no King,</hi> as to the Scotch Bishops ought to be, <hi>No Arbitrary
King)</hi> is known to every Body that is any wise seen in affairs of
that Kingdom. And further it can be proved beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
that all the Persecutions and Oppressions that were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
in that Kingdom, are owing not so much to <hi>Lauderdale</hi>
or any Minister of State there (some of whom acted only that they
might not be turned out, tho' that will never Justifie them) as to
those Spiritual Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>

If the Presbyterians asserted their Government to be
<hi>Jure Divino,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 6.</note> tis no more than what not a few Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
do; and tho in true speaking both may be in the wrong,
yet if Churches be to be regulated as they were in the Apostolical
Age, tho' the Presbyterians cannot pretend to a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi>
yet they may lay claim to an <hi>Apostolical President,</hi> which was always
reckoned good Justification for any Practice in the Church: For
even St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for whose Authority over the rest the Roman
Catholicks so eagerly contend, calls himself a Fellow-Elder,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>The Elders that are among you I exhort who am</hi> a Co-elder, as that
word may be rendred. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> whom others pretend to
have been the Head Bishop, never calls himself otherwise than a
Minister, Apostle, Servant, or Preacher, and subscribes himself
every where the salutation of me <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> And 'tis observable
that the same St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 17. sent for (not the
<hi>Diocesane</hi> Bishop or Bishops as some would have it, but) the
Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and had there Been any

a <hi>Busie Body in other Mens matters,</hi> as that word is rendred,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. when he sent for the Elders without acquainting
the Bishop or Bishops: But it is most remarkable that when he
is exhorting them how to acquit themselves, <hi>v.</hi> 28. he says,

&amp;c. Where tho' they were Elders he was speaking
to, he says, <hi>Take heed therefore to your selves, and to all the Flock in</hi>

same Word is rendred by our Translators, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. and

the Church between a Bishop and a Presbyter, tis not to be

               <hi>The Elder
to the Elect Lady, the Elder to the Well-beloved Gaius:</hi> Not St.
<hi>Andrews, Glagow,</hi> &amp;c. which seems the assuming to themselves an
Authority after the Manner of the Kings of the Gentiles, <hi>i. e.</hi>
Princes, and Noblemen contrary to Christs Express Command,
<hi>Matt,</hi> 20, 25, 26. Since it cannot be denyed but Titles are

Badges of Authority, and wherever they are owned or given
Authority is thereby indicated. Nor will it much mend the
Matter to say that this Honour is conferred upon them by the
Prince, since it is obvious to reply that Christs Command seems
expresly to prohibit it, who best knew what Mischief those great
Titles and Authority would do in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman farther says, <hi>that as they taught
the People that their Government was</hi> Jure Divino,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <hi>so that People might thereby be obliged to defend them
and it under the Pain of Eternal Damnation, even (when Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
was established by Divine Law,)</hi> &amp;c. Where the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
is so eager in Exposing that People that he justly exposes
himself to the Laughter of any Understanding person, when his
saying that they <hi>might</hi> be obliged unto it, does not deny but
they might not: Had he said, they were <hi>bound</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to do it,
he had spoke to the purpose, and in that case he could have
accused them of nothing but what not a few of his own Party
have been guilty of.</p>
            <p>And that Conventicles were prohibited <hi>from a
just fear that the Old Humour would ferment into a
Rebellion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is only his assertion 'tis apparent enough
that those severe Acts were made principally to support the
Bishops, and for fear lest they should be turned out again (as
nothing but Force, joyned with the Debauchery and Irreligion
of the Generality of their Communion who only affected such
Church Governors as spared their Vices, ever kept them in that
Kingdom.)</p>
            <p>And how cunningly soever he insinuates <hi>that the
Rebellion at</hi> Pentland <hi>Hills</hi> in 1666 was the effect
of their Field Conventicles,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet 'tis certain that there
were but few Conventicles before that Insurrection: The
true Matter of fact in this point is, that Major <hi>Turner</hi> and
some others were sent <hi>into</hi> the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to suppress
the Presbyterians there, the Soldiers were quartered upon
FREE QUARTERS besides that they Forc'd the PEOPLE
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97829:7"/>
to pay them 6 <hi>d.</hi> a day, that many Families there were totally
Impoverisht; so that they were forced to give over their
Farms, and have recourse to the Charity of other honest Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for their Subsistance. That in some places when that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were not able to entertain the Soldiers, as they had at their
first coming, they fell a beating of 'em and abused them;
who with the Neighbourhood standing up in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
killed some of the Soldiers, whereupon partly through
fear of being executed, and partly thro' Bitterness of Spirit,
which their grievous Bondage had caused in them (since as
<hi>Solomon</hi> says, Oppression makes a Wise Man Mad) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themselves to Arms, and perswaded other People whose
Lives had been imbittered by several Years Oppression to do
the same.</p>
            <p>That the Indulgence after that Insurrection was
granted them out of any favour is a Notorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth:<note place="margin">P. 6.</note>
It is sufficiently known that it was a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
used on purpose to divide them, in so far as some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
were comprehended in it, and others very popular left
out: And it is no less certain that this fully answered their
design, for as the Gentleman cunningly upbraids
them afterwards,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> those that preached in the Fields
were too rigid Censurers of their Brethren of the
Indulgence, as <hi>vice versa</hi> those of the Indulgence were too
Uncharitable towards their Brethren that Preacht in the
Fields, which gave so great Advantage to their Enemies that
in a short time they were both reduced to a very low Pass:
Which shews how applicable that of our Saviour was to both
of them, <hi>The Children of this World are wiser in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
than the Children of Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho the Field-Meetings (as he truly says)
were declared <hi>to be the Rendevouzes of Rebellion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note>
yet 'tis certain the poor People had no other design
in going to them, than that they might hear the Word of
God, which they thought was more faithfully dispenst there
than in the Publick Churches: And it is no less certain that
it had great Effects on not a few who at first went thither only
out of Curiosity, so that while they were under their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they seemed to live quite new Lives from what they did
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97829:8"/>
formerly; and when those Field-Meetings were supprest those
poor Wretches made sad Complaints of their returning to
their Vomit, when they were again confined to the Ministry
of the Episcopal Clergy. Nor is this Gentleman Ingenuous
when he says, the State was necessitated to suppress them for
fear of being subverted; for the true cause was, because du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Preaching in the Fields, all the adjacent Parishes
frequented their Meetings: So that the pretended Orthodox
Clergy there had scarce all their own Family to hear them,
in few places more. It is false that they had any design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Government, and though some of them went
with Arms to those Meetings, yet 'tis certain they offered
Wrong to no Body, and disperst themselves peaceably after
the Sermon was over, unless they were disturbed by Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
in which case they had all the reason of the World to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves, for if their Minister was taken, he was sure
to be executed, and any of the rest were to expect no better
than Imprisonment, it may be for some years, if not sent
Slaves to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as not a few were who could not be
charged with any thing but going to Meetings. These
things considered no thinking Man will wonder at their taking
Arms along with them, especially since the Doctrine of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence
is not now lookt upon as so great a Bugbear as it was
represented to be by Gentlemen that had neither more Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor Honesty than they needed in those topping Years of
Loyalty, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86.</p>
            <p>It is notoriously false, as he asserts, That the
Generality of the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 7.</note> said
that the King had forfeited his Crown for Breaking
the Covenant, tho some did. Yet he having taken the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
as his Coronation Oath, and Sworn to maintain that
Government, and it being on a supposed belief of his Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
therein that they tendred him the Crown, 'tis not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
to be aggravated if some People said so: Let us but
imagine that as the King of <hi>England</hi> takes an Oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Church, and should afterwards destroy and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the whole Constitution thereof, and set up another:
That none of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would in this case say
that he had forfeited the Crown is more than any will now
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97829:8"/>
believe: And if so, then this Learned Author has mightily
exposed his Weakness, in so basely misrepresenting some Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
for that which some of other Communions would
have been guilty of under the same Circumstances.</p>
            <p>'Tis as false an Insinuation as ever proceeded from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lies, <hi>That the Army that was defeated at</hi> Bothwell-Bridge,
<hi>was gathered to defend the Murtherers of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of St.</hi> Andrews. It is sufficiently known that that rising
was occasioned by the late Martyr <hi>Dundee</hi> (as some of our
Orthodox Gentlemen reckon him) his going to seize the
Ministers and Hearers at a Meeting at <hi>Lowdon-Hill:</hi> That
those that were at the Meeting sent out some of their number
to entreat him to let them conclude their Work, and they
would dismiss themselves speedily and peaceably: That he
would give no audience to their Request, whereupon such
of them as had Arms (who were not above his Number)
drew out to meet him, received his Fire, and afterwards
gave this Orthodox <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Champion so warm Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
that he was glad to scamper, they pursued them
near to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> and the Kings Forces that were there, being
fitter to Fight against Naked Men and Women than against
such as had Arms, left the Place, so as they had Liberty to
enter, and afterwards invited all their Friends to come in
to their Assistance. And if any of the Archbishops Murderers
were there, that can no more militate against them than King
<hi>Davids</hi> admitting a great many Persons that were guilty of
several Crimes, could against the Lawfulness of his Design.
And tho some approved of their Fact, yet 'tis certain a far
greater number disapproved it.</p>
            <p>The Indemnity, he mentions, which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them after <hi>Bothwell-Bridge</hi> was very short lived,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
tho no other Provocation was given by them than
that our Orthodox Clergy could have few or no Hearers while
they were kept up. And our Gentleman <hi>non insanit sine ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>
while he says that the Parliament finding that those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
Preaching up Rebellion; had occasion'd all this danger
to King and People (tho 'tis true that there have been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that I believe would not be very unlike
to the Orthodox Lady <hi>H.</hi> who hearing a Ministers Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97829:9"/>
that preached at a Meeting, said, <hi>That the very words
of the Text were Treason)</hi> yet all the while nothing of this
was proved, tho it was an easie thing in those days to call any
thing Rebellion; however there was a specious pretence for
the Parliaments so doing, since they going away from those
Ministers who preached little else but Loyalty to the Prince;
a great part of some of whose Weekly Studies was to enure
themselves and train up their People in the Duties of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
<hi>viz.</hi> to Drink the Kings Good Health, and Confusion to
Whigs and Men of Republican Principles, and to those Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
who insisted mainly on that which is due to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
of Heaven and Earth (which amongst all the Honest
Heathen had always the good luck to be called Sedition and
Rebellion) they might well be jealous lest they should shrink
a little in their Loyalty.</p>
            <p>He next brings the Plot upon the Stage as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Effect of their Field-Preachings.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But since the
World has now discovered so much Cheat in that
part of it which was said to be managed here, which at least
was the most considerable, it sufficiently shews how little stress
is to be laid on what an <hi>Orthodox</hi> Scotchman (whether of the
Clergy or Laity) says, to some of whom it needs not be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but a Jesuite may give the Right Hand of Fellowship, for
their Excellent Improvements in those Noble Arts of speaking
above and besides the Truth, blackning their Adversaries,
and a feared Forehead (as well as Conscience) to advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that may but support their Cause.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing Narrative he draws this
Inference,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>That it is admired why the Government is
taxed with so much Cruelty, and the Acts themselves
reproacht as Diabolical:</hi> And to prove the Reasonableness of his
Inference, he first gives us to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>the Acts against
Field Conventicles are the same with the present Laws of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and less severe than those made against Dissenters in Queen</hi>
Elizabeth's <hi>time, or those against the Calvinisis in</hi> Sweden.
We might ask this Defender of the Orthodox Cause, if Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Ministers were ordered to be put to Death for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Meetings in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time? But to wave this,
we may with good Reason avouch that this Gentleman, how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97829:9"/>
good a Lawyer soever he was, is none of the best Casuists;
for we are not to take our Measures from what any Protestants
or Lutherans do, but from the Word of God, and according
to the Dictates of true Christianity, against which if a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
makes Acts (such as all those are that tend to Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
I do not see how they can be obeyed without Sin: <hi>For</hi>
to apply our Authors own Words, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <q>The Parliament
by their Authority <hi>cannot make that fit</hi> which is inconsistent
with Humane Nature,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And when he or any of his
Party can prove that such Laws are consistent with the Word
of God, or the Principles of Christianity then, and not till
then can he justifie Proceedings in that Point.</p>
            <p>He pretends that the Liberty of Preaching in Houses was
taken away because of their Rebellions. But were all the
Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> guilty of those Rebellions? Why
then ought not those that were Innocent, and lived Peaceably
under the Government allowed the Liberty of Worshipping
God according to their Consciences? Had this been done,
and those only prosecuted that were guilty of those Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then he might have had something to boast of; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like it was done, but if any Person tho never so Loyal,
yet scrupled to join with the present Ministry, no distinction
was made betwixt him and the most turbulent: Nay 'tis suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known that Women were not exempted from their
Cruelty (persons one would think that could never either by
their Policy or Strength undermine the Government, and a Sex
that might have expected at least some Protection from the
Severity of the Laws, from such a Prince as King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second was) but were Imprisoned, Fined, and some of them
Executed.</p>
            <p>His second Reason is, <q>Whatever might be
said against such Acts <hi>in Countreys where Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
never entred into a War,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> yet in <hi>this Isle,</hi>
where they overturned the Government and Laws, and
were upon every Occasion again attempting it, <hi>so small a
Caution</hi> cannot be accounted severe.</q> Where he maliciously
and falsly lays the War against K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. both in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> only to the Dissenters Charge, when it it Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
that the greatest part of the Parliament Army was at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97829:10"/>
first made up of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yea that of them few
save the <hi>Laudian</hi> Faction joined King <hi>Charles</hi> I. a great
part of whose Army (at least the Officers of it) were Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, and 'tis no less certain that the Body of the
Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon that Kings imposing the Service-Book
to be Read in one of the Churches of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a League to defend themselves from any further Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
or Tyranny that should be offered. But the Reader
may easily perceive by this what credit this Gentleman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
whose Prejudice has so far benighted his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as to avouch Lies so easily discoverable; 'tis a plain Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he will take a far greater Liberty in things less obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Mens Knowledge.</p>
            <p>His third Reason is; <hi>That this Caution was much more Just
in</hi> Scotland <hi>than in</hi> England, <hi>because Dissenters in</hi> Scotland
<hi>were more Bigotted to the Covenant, which is a Constant Fond
for Rebellion.</hi> But why the Covenant should be so (tho I am
no great stickler for it) I cannot understand, since among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things it binds the Takers thereof, <hi>to preserve and defend
the Kings Majesties Person and Authority, in the Preservation of
the true Religion</hi> (by which no doubt they mean governing
the Church by Presbyters, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And suppose this be an
Oath made by the Majority of People, as what is Ratified by
Parliament must always be judged to be, why should this be
more inclinable to Rebellion than an Oath made to maintain
Episcopacy and the Ceremonies? And suppose a King should
violate this latter Oath, and endeavour to introduce either
Popery or Presbytery, it needs not now be questioned (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
since our Loyal Gentlemen declared that the Reason
why those Honest Orthodox <hi>Highlanders</hi> raised their Rebellion
was because Presbytery was Establisht in <hi>Scotland;</hi> I might
say further, that it was none of the least Reasons of King
<hi>James</hi>'s Abdication, that he endeavoured to overturn the
Church) that he would not meet with much more favour
from their Hands than at the most Bigotted Covenanters.</p>
            <p>I remember I have Read that <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
where he restricts his Votaries to such a number
of Wives,<note place="margin">Hornbeck sum. Contr.</note> has yet a Reserve for himself: And
brings in God speaking thus, <hi>At tibi O Prophet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97829:10"/>
quot vis ducere &amp; cum iis concumbere, &amp;c.</hi> and so would
have his Laws tye up the People, but not himself: I do not see
those Gentlemen a whit more reasonable: If Dissenters stand
up in their own Defence against Tyranny, it is resisting the
Lords Anointed, a Sin that will undoubtedly Damn them;
but if they play the same Game, tho without the minutest
Provocation or least shew of Reason for it, (as in the Case of
the <hi>Highland</hi> Rebellion) 'tis no such matter, they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
their Church, Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fourth Reason is, <hi>That the Posterior Acts
made against Field Conventicles were the necessary
Product of new Accessional Degrees of Rebellion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> This
is manifestly false, since as above, that at <hi>Pentland</hi> Hills in
1666 was the Effect of the Oppression those poor People groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under, and that at <hi>Bothwell</hi>-Bridge was begun in defence of
their Ministers Life and Peoples Liberty, and when they had
once killed some Soldiers, there was no safety for them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
but what their Arms could purchase to them.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman says afterwards, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
can say that no Man in</hi> Scotland <hi>ever suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But what means the Bleating
of the Cattel then? Were not Major <hi>Turner</hi> and several others
sent to quarter upon those of the West on Free Quarters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they were forced to pay 6 <hi>d.</hi> a day, prior to any
Rebellion? If this was not Persecution for Religion, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
of <hi>France</hi> (to whom I dare say our Author bore no
small respect) has been basely traduced by Republican Spirits.
So that were this Gentlemans Paper strictly canvast, it might
be justly questioned whether there were more Lies or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in it.</p>
            <p>His Malicious Instance of <hi>Renwick</hi> shews the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracy
of his Hatred against the Presbyterians;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and
he might as well have forbore the mentioning of
it: For I have been credibly informed, that <hi>Renwick</hi> was
a Romish Priest, and spared on that account, 'tis not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he might weaken the Presbyterians by keeping up Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
among them: But that they insisted for his Life, when
we have it of a Person who is not wholly abandoned to his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and who will make Conscience of saying nothing but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97829:11"/>
what is Truth, we shall have some reason to give Credit
to it.</p>
            <p>He next endeavours to render them more odious
by shewing how little they had to pretend for the
justifying of their Dissent,<note place="margin">P. 9.</note> since there were no Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
enjoin'd in the Episcopal Church there. But our
Gentleman might have forbore the taking upon him the Office
of a Casuist, which he seems so ill qualified for: For all the
Publick Ministers there since the beginning of the Civil Wars,
till King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Restauration, had taken the Covenant, which
obliged them not to own Diocesan Episcopal Government:
And there is no doubt but any Honest Man would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound to disown it, till such time as he were convinced
that the Matter of the Oath was unlawful: Now they having,
or at least believing they had a dispensation from God to
Preach the Word, 'tis not to be supposed they would think
themselves discharged from that Office, because they were
prohibited to Preach by the Bishop: And 'tis easily suppose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
their Hearers had no great liking for the Bishops Curates,
especially since at the Restauration a very few excepted they
were guilty of Breach of Oath, the Matter whereof they
could never yet prove to be sinful: And if any Person be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Perjur'd, every Honest Man shuns any Commerce with
him: Much more if a Man be of so Sacred a Function as is a
Preacher of the Word, who that has any thing of Religion in
him will so much as Countenance him? Besides, since many of
the Laity did take the Covenant, and obliged themselves
to disown Episcopal Government, it needed not so much
have startled him (if he had any Conscience himself) that
those People would not hear the Publick Ministers, till such
time as they were satisfied of the unlawfulness of the Oath,
since hearing them duely and ordinarily might have
seemed to be a down-right Violation of it. Besides, 'tis
not improbable that those who are of Opinion that that Office
crept into the Church contrary to Christs Institution, might
more scruple at that than at any Ceremony whatsoever. But
the Gentleman by what he adds in the end of this Paragraph
contradicts himself as if he were in a Frenzy; for if the best
of their Ministers and almost all the People Communicated, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97829:11"/>
he says, Why is he at so hard Labour to shew the Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of their Dissent from the Publick Churches?</p>
            <p>As to what follows next that the King and
Three Estates should be acknowledged the best
Judges of what was <hi>Salus Populi</hi> (an Invidious and
Disloyal Word in all their Parties Ears;)<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> it is sufficiently
known (as has been hinted above) that we had no Three
Estates for a considerable time after the Reformation: But to
wave that, we are not always to take the Notion of <hi>Salus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli</hi>
from a Parliament (especially when those Members of it
that stood up for the Priviledges of the People were sure to
render themselves the Butt of great Persons Fury, which no
doubt made Men of Timorous and Pusillanimous Spirits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with whatever they pleased to impose on them, as it fell
out ever since his Royal Highnesseses Parliament there, and 'tis
not yet forgot that my Lord <hi>Belhaven</hi> for but contradicting
them in something they were promoting was sent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and if I remember right, ordered to be prosecuted,
which made Men of Principles to decline any such Trust)
But from the Law of God and Nature, as it has been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the best and wisest of all Ages. But 'tis no hard
task to demonstrate that most of our Three Estates had little
regard either to their own or the <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Council a full Power to do whatever they should
think convenient for the safety of the Government (as they
were pleased to express it, they should have added Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
who went so far that even they themselves were forced
to have recourse to a Pardon, as his Present Majesties Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for that Kingdom when he came to rescue that People
from those Tyrannous Men, expresses it, part whereof I shall
here insert to expose this Gentlemans Impudence in daring to
avouch that the Matters of Fact mentioned in his Majesties
Declaration were not true, as through his whole Book does
notoriously appear.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By the Direction of the same Councillors,<note place="margin">His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for <hi>Scotland</hi> p. 5.</note>
they have served themselves of an Exorbitant
Power, which imposeth Slaveries, and requires
Oaths of whole Shires, without being founded on
any Law, or Act of Parliament: As the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97829:12"/>
of Soldiers at their Discretion, who as they have
sufficient Pay for their Sustenance, so the Kingdom is at
double Charges, without any Reasons given for it; their
committing Gentlemen to Prison, without declaring the
Cause, but on the contrary, forcing them to accuse and
give Evidence against themselves, and Imposing Fines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Pleasure, causing some for fear to desert
their Countreys by Vertue of their Intercommunings,
founded on those evil Pretences: They have so generally
involved every one in this Danger, that the Councillors
themselves could not be secure without having recourse to
a Pardon, or procuring themselves to be excepted, whilst
in the mean while the Common People lay at their Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They gave Power to Officers and Private Soldiers to
commit upon many Subjects who lived in full Peace and
Quietness, the greatest of Barbarities, as to destroy them
by Hanging, Killing, Drowning, without any Form of
Process, and without any Respect had to Age or Sex; not
giving some so much time as to Pray to God, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other reason, save that they would not subscribe
or answer to their Questions which they proposed to them
without any Legal Authority, and against the Common
Right of Men, which leaves to every one a Liberty not to
reveal the Secrets of his Thoughts. Not to mention a
great many other Violences and Oppressions, which this
Distressed Nation has been exposed to, without any assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ever seeing an End of them, or being delivered
from them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The bare mentioning of this is enough to refute his whole
Vindication, since 'tis obvious that Infinite more credit is due
to his Majesties Declaration, who undoubtedly would take
care that he should not be imposed upon in representing the
Grievances of that Kingdom, which this Gentleman will have
to be none at all, than to a Person that had a great share in all
those Oppressions, who, with a great many more, should have
been made Victims to publick Justice (some of whom seem to
be too highly favoured) and owe their Lives perhaps to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97829:12"/>
He next endeavours to answer Objections, the
first whereof is,<note place="margin">P. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That the severe Laws against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
were yet more severely put in Execution by
Six</hi> James Turner, <hi>&amp;c. which occasion'd the Insurrection at</hi>
Pentland <hi>Hills,</hi> &amp;c. In answer to which the Gentleman
stands stisly by his Arbitrary Tack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, <hi>That all rising in Arms
upon any pretence what soever is declared Rebellion,</hi> and therefore
no body should question but that 'twas so. But his instance
he brings in is very wide of the Mark: For because Men will
not grudge Free Quarters to Soldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they save them
from a Race of Men that (how Orthodox or Loyal soever
they may seem to be in his Eyes and the Arbitrary Factions)
are really no better than Cormorants, and leave nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them save Marks of their Unhumane Cruelty, I mean the
BARBAROUS HIGHLANDERS; Does it therefore follow
that if the King sends Soldiers against a part of the Countrey
to oppress and impoverish them by all means, and in no wise
to defend them from an Enemy, and continue them among
them till they have eat up all, and then treat their Persons
with all manner of Cruelty; that they must patiently bear all;
and that in this Case God and Nature has left them no Power
to defend themselves? This were to turn the World
upside down, and make God the Author of all the Oppressions
that are committed in the World, since he neither will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them himself, nor suffer People to do any thing for their
own Deliverance, if what he says be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to sending away People to the Plantations,</hi> he
says,<note place="margin">P. 11.</note> 
               <hi>It is Answered that none were sent away, but
such as were taken at</hi> Bothwell Bridge, <hi>or in</hi> Argile's
<hi>Rebellion.</hi> Behold the Veracity of an Orthodox Gentleman
of the true Church of <hi>Scotland!</hi> For it is sufficiently known
that a considerable Number were sent away in the latter end
of the year 78, which was at least half a year before the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> twenty whereof were brought up here
to <hi>London</hi> in order to be Transported thither, as may be
proved by Hundreds in this City, but that through the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of some Worthy Merchants about the City of <hi>London,</hi>
the Master of the Ship that was to carry them over would not
receive them, when he understood that they were sent abroad
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97829:13"/>
for their Nonconformity. In the year 74 or 75, about Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them were sent over into <hi>France,</hi> and Charitable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Scotland</hi> were necessitated to raise a considerable Sum of
Money to redeem them from the Captains that had got the
Gift of them: Besides that many were sent into the <hi>West-Indies</hi>
towards the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign who
could be charged with nothing but refusing to hear the Parish
Curate. And when all these things were done this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was Kings Advocate, and so could neither be Ignorant of
the Crime for which, nor of the time when they were sent
away: But notwithstanding the Truth of this is so notorious
to any in that Kingdom, he had the Impudence to impose
those Lies to delude People here, being sufficiently convinced
of the truth of the Jesuitical Maxim, <hi>Fortiter calumniare ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
adhaerebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much soever Torture may be allowed by
the Law of our Nation,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet this much is certain,
that it never was so much put in practice in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for many Hundred years, as it was during the Mild Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of King <hi>Charles</hi> II.</p>
            <p>What he says in Defence of Imprisonments is so weak that
it deserves no Answer: For where does the Civil Law allow
to take Subjects up without any real ground, and on no Proof,
and keep them half a year, a year or more in Prison, as seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Gentlemen have been served there, not because they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from the Establisht Church, but meerly because they
opposed them in their designs of Enslaving the Nation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the bringing in the Highlanders on the Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and taking Free Quarter there,</hi> he
says, <hi>It is answered that many Thousands had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Field Conventicles with Arms for several years, and when
these Conventicles which met in several Places pleased to join in
one, they could form an Army; to prevent which, the Council,
&amp;c.</hi> Where this Author prevaricates after his Old way:
For in the first place, let him or any of the Party tell when
there was a Rebellion there, but what was either the Effects
of unparalled'd Oppression; (as there never was greater Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
any where in <hi>Europe</hi> than was there) as that at <hi>Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Hills, or in their own defence, as at <hi>Lowdon</hi> Hill, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97829:13"/>
was the beginning of that at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge.</hi> And tho some
of those that went to those Meetings took Arms along with
them, yet 'tis certain they carried Arms upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than to save themselves from being taken by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
It is sufficiently known that at first they could not safely
Preach in Houses, when they saw that, being resolved if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to enjoy what they thought the purest Dispensation of
the Gospel, they went to unfrequented Heathy Places in the
Fields without any Arms: But they had not long gone so to
those places but Soldiers were sent out against them, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them were taken and imprisoned, to prevent which
for the future, those took Arms that had any, with no design to
offend any person, but meerly that they might defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from being taken. So that his Accusations in this point
might have had some shew of Reason, had they but had a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
granted them till such time as they had abused it (which
at least King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was obliged to by Treaty at <hi>Breda)</hi>
but nothing like this, but all Condemned as Rebellious and
Seditious before they discovered any Acts of it, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their Severity extorted. It is a false Suggestion
that no less would satisfie them than abolishing Episcopacy:
It is sufficiently known that they would have been very well
satisfied with a Liberty, and have lived as Loyally, had it but
been granted as the greatest Pretenders thereto, a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof we have from their Behaviour from the time
that the late King granted an Indulgence, tho they were as
far from advancing a Popish Interest, as those who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Orthodox: Who tho they decryed and condemned the
Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet set up a Tyranny if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
it, at least that might compete with it. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
knows nothing of the Rudeness of those Highlanders,
you must know they are his Countrey-men and Orthodox Men,
and he had a Talent to lay out only in blackening the Whigs,
tho the whole Countrey there ecchoed with the Cries of their
Rapines, for they were so far from answering the Councils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of oppressing only Whigs, that they Pilfered and Robb'd
whatever they could come at; they made no distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Orthodoxism and Whiggism, but all were Phigs to
them, so that the Council, was e'en forc't to send them home
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97829:14"/>
again. I shall only take notice of this on this Subject, that
our Orthodox Gentlemen did cast a Copy to the <hi>French</hi> King,
to bring down his Heretick by the same Measures as our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Gentlemen brought down the Whiggish Subjects (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this Term be <hi>contradictio in adjecto,</hi> as all their Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
bore) so far are they from being such Novices as to
take Measures from the Order of the Name <hi>Jesus,</hi> that they
can prescribe them Methods of destroying, and bringing down:
And these Measures were effectually followed by the <hi>French</hi>
King, till in the end he quite ruined his Huguenot Subjects,
as may plainly appear from this, that these Measures were
first taken by King <hi>Charles</hi> and his most Loyal Subjects, the
Orthodox Church, and is not a little confirmed by a passage
that happened between a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman in <hi>France</hi> about
the beginning of the Dragooning, and one of that Kings Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours:
He finding the Governour to be a Gentleman of a
very good Temper, assumed the Boldness to shew him his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
that the <hi>French</hi> King should take such Barbarous
Measures to reduce the <hi>French</hi> Protestants; the other reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That it was matter of greater surprize to him that any of
the King of</hi> Britains <hi>Subjects should be so astonisht at his Masters
Measures, since he had taken the same which he used to reduce
the Western Shires of</hi> Scotland.</p>
            <p>How just soever he pretends the Capital Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to have been,<note place="margin">P. 17.</note> yet if we consider what simple
crazed People they were that were Executed, it is
little either to his or that Councils Credit; Persons that
might be really called distempered in their Brains, and under
deep Melancholy, through the Oppressions they underwent,
and the Intercommunings, whereby they were forced to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scond
all day, and at Night when others were at rest, seek
for that Refreshment which Nature required, whereby they
were deprived of all Civil Society: I shall only instance in
one of those People, by which you may easily conceive what
the rest were: He was so imprudent, that being present at
the Execution of one of them, could not forbear railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Hangman, calling him, <hi>Murdering Dog, &amp;c.</hi> This
Person was thereupon Seized by the Soldiers that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Execution, secured, and a little time after was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97829:14"/>
brought before the Council, where (according to their usual
way to ask questions, which if the Persons declined to answer
they were reputed Guilty) they asked him, If he had been
at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> his Answer was, <hi>Aye, that I was:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Query was put to him, Had you a Sword about you? He
answered, <hi>Aye, and Pistols too,</hi> (whereas a Child might have
heat this Champion, and taken all from him.) Hereupon
some of the Council who had some consideration of Humane
Frailty, said, Send him away, why do we trouble our selves
with such a Mad Fellow as this? But others of them that
were of our Authors stamp, said, No; But let us put some
other Questions to him, and thereupon questioned him about
the Kings Authority, and the poor Creuture denied all point
Blank, and was afterwards Executed for it; and most of
them that suffered there were of such distempered Brains as
this Creature was; and it was no unusual way with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to Execute those distrest People the same day they were
brought in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> sending them immediately from the
Council House to the Place of Execution; which was a certain
Indication that some of those Honourable Members, at least
those who were highest in Power, acted very differently from
what our Religion injoins us, and had very little of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Tenderness and Charity so much inculcated by it. And
if they found that a Person was fully resolved to Die at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them, to vex him they would keep him longer:
As it fell out to a certain Person in the beginning of King
<hi>James</hi>'s Reign (before our Gentleman was turned out, for
we could see no danger of Popery till such time as Dissenters
had Liberty) who appearing before the Council as brisk as
his Condition did allow him, expecting as others to be sent
straight to the Place of Execution. Some of the Council said,
What! You think to die to day, I warrant you; you shall
not have that favour, you shall be kept till <hi>Friday,</hi> (it being
<hi>Tuesday</hi> or <hi>Wednesday,</hi> I cannot now say positively whether,
but heard it for an undoubted Truth) and accordingly he was
Executed on <hi>Friday.</hi> And tho some of those People did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
strange Tenets about Authority, yet I doubt not but
their Deaths were precious in Gods sight, and will be required
at the hands of those Persons, if a seasonable Repentance
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97829:15"/>
(which it may be no less than a taking severe <hi>Vengeance upon
them for their Inventions,</hi> will ever extort from them) do not
prevent it. It had been more like a Christian to have sent
those People to a Mad-house, to try if there was any possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of rectifying their Brains, than to a Gibbet. And we know
what occasion was taken from the Imprudence of those Poor
People by some Spiritual Merchants, to traduce not only all
the Presbyterians there, but even all the Dissenters here, and
incense the Mob so against them, that it is owing to no less
than an Extraordinary restraining Power of God that they
were not knocked on the Head as they went along the Streets,
so great a Hatred had Men whom no Principles keep back from
perpetrating the Wickedest Action, thereby conceived against
them.</p>
            <p>But I shall briefly expose the Strange, and Unparallel'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of this Gentleman in vindicating the taking away those
poor Peoples Lives, by comparing them with our present <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites.</hi>
I think the most Bigotted Reader will grant that this
Author has given them as black a Character as is possible to be
done, which for the more clear Conviction of his Prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I shall say nothing against, only this, <hi>Dato, sed non Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesso</hi>
that it were so, it ought to be considered that King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. had promised to maintain that Government by
his Coronation Oath, had again promised them a Liberty (if
not more) at <hi>Breda,</hi> and notwithstanding, Prior to any Act
of Disloyalty on their side, had declared them to be Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
Enemies, till such times as they altered their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
(which 'tis not so easie a task for an Ingenuous Person to
perform as Men that have none do commonly believe) and
treated them as such, till at last he made not a few of them to
become Haters of his Government. On the other Hand 'tis
sufficiently known how the <hi>Jacobites</hi> have acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
here; their Carriage has been such to Their Present
Majesties that it needs not be questioned, but that of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that have been Seditious and Disaffected to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for many Ages, they have been and are the most Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate:
For it plainly appears that since Their Majesties Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown they have been continually Plotting to
Subvert the Government, so that the Jesuites themselves may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97829:15"/>
give them the Precedency; and even a Self-preservation
seems to have required that some severer Laws had been made
against them than as yet have: We may at the same time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that all this is without the least Provocation given them,
since Envy it self cannot with the least shew of Reason traduce
Their Majesties Government: Mildness having to a Prodigy
discovered it self in all their Actions; the Roman Catholicks
themselves might have promised <hi>to sit under their own Vines,
and eat of their own Fig-trees:</hi> And the Church of <hi>England</hi> was
never in a more hopeful way of being firmly establisht, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
recovering her former Splender, which had some time
been sullied: And notwithstanding this, some of her Members
have conceived so irreconcileable a Hatred against this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that no less than a Destruction of it would satisfie
them. Now if those severe Acts made against those Persons,
were so necessary for the supporting of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
Then I hope all Persons but themselves will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that they are no less necessary under this, since
'tis so plain that they have infinitely out-stript the others:
And tho they have not had the Courage to appear by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Arms, (which if they had we might been rid of them
long ere now) yet (which is infinitely more dangerous)
they have dealt with a Foreign Tyrant to send them Forces,
and have taken such Cruel Measures that Humanity it self
would abhor. But suppose such severe Acts had been emitted
here by the Council, that where-ever a <hi>Jacobite</hi> was taken Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or speaking Treasonable or Seditious Words, he should
be forthwith Executed for it, except he would own the Present
Government, or take the Oaths to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> or say God Bless them, and that without any Verdict
brought in by a Jury: Or that if Soldiers should meet with
any of those in the Fields, or them that were declared to be
such, they should immediately shoot them, I say had these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Measures been taken against <hi>Jacobites</hi> here (which yet
Reasons of Preserving the Government would infinitely more
justifie than the Proceedings against those simple Creatures in
<hi>Scotland)</hi> it would have given disgust to not a few Persons,
and I am sure this Author would have talkt very loudly against
it. In the Name of God then, how can a Man of Learning
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97829:16"/>
suffer Reason to be so far Eclipst in him, as to vindicate an
Action done against those Men, which he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
if executed on Persons that are Infinitely more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in a Kingdom, Villains in Grain, and Enemies to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
it self.</p>
            <p>He heaps up several Falshoods to Justifie the
granting the Soldiers Power to kill such as disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Kings Authority,<note place="margin">P. 14, 15.</note> for that was granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those two Men were killed at <hi>Swyne-Abby</hi> (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
but towards the end of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign) and it
cannot to this hour be certainly said who killed them, they
might as well have been Episcopal or Roman Catholicks, or
it may be some upon a private Pique, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not trouble the Reader any further with taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his fulsome stuff, except some particular Processes
which he mentions.</p>
            <p>And the first is that of Mr. <hi>James Mitchill,</hi> which of all
Men of the World, one would have thought he should have
forbore mentioning, since it is sufficiently known that he had
been <hi>Mitchills</hi> Advocate formerly, and defended him against
Sir <hi>John Nisbet,</hi> who was the Kings Advocate before him,
and who deserting his Diet in that Cause, that is to say, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he could not reach him by Law, desisted further Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For which and other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was judged not a fit
Tool for that Place, and so was preferr'd to another, which
was not of that consequence, and our Gentleman was thought
the fittest Tool, and advanced to it, of whom it may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
that he shed more Blood in the time he held that Place than
any Twelve Advocates that were there before, and might
(as to that point) have been called another <hi>Jefferies:</hi> He
quickly found the means to dispatch him that had formerly
been his Client in the same Cause. But notwithstanding all
that he says, <hi>Mitchill</hi> was Condemned upon an Extrajudicial
Confession, (that is, a Confession not made publickly, <hi>pro
Tripunati.</hi> but privately to the then Lord Chancellor, upon
promise of his Life, which the Scottish Law allows no Man to
be Condemn'd for.) And notwithstanding what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
says to the contrary, any that knew that Chancellor is
firmly perswaded that he would never make such a Promise
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97829:16"/>
without he had the Councils Order so to do: Besides it was
sufficiently known that such a Promise was past, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it was afterwards Generally denied, which occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Satyr upon most of the then Members of Council, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
whom the more, two reputed Atheists (tho no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Council) were brought in in the Close, speaking
thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Come must we Swear by him we don't believe?</l>
               <l>Yes, yes, we'll do it, and we'll laugh in our Sleeve.</l>
               <l>Is't any reason WE should think ought odd,</l>
               <l>When THESE point blank Swear, <hi>who profess a God?</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>A Plain Indication that what our Gentleman says was then
generally lookt upon as an Untruth, since had there no such
promise been made, 'tis not to be supposed the Council would
have been so Lampoon'd: And all sorts of Persons, even they
that understood the <hi>Scotch</hi> Law as well as the Kings Advocate,
said, That tho they believed really that <hi>Mitchill</hi> had been
guilty of that Assassination, yet that he was Condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such Proof as the Law requires in that point. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with a Notorious Lie, when he says, <hi>That</hi> Mitchill <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
glorying in his Crimes, and recommending to others the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such Assassinations.</hi> Since any that was present at
the Execution can justifie the Falshood of that, and that when
he began only to speak of the hardness of the Justice he was
served with, as having been Condemned upon an Extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Confession on promise of Life, the Drums were ordered
to Beat, to drown his Voice, after which he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to his Devotion.</p>
            <p>His second Instance is that of <hi>Lermonth,</hi> who, as
he says,<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> was Guilty of a Soldiers Death, in as
much as he commanded those who killed him as
an Officer: But we may easily see from what is above, that
all is not Gospel that proceeds from this Gentlemans Mouth:
For it was deposed by several Witnesses, that he was a Mile
from the Place when the Soldier was killed, and it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that he was killed by another Soldier firing at some
that were at the Meeting. And notwithstanding that three
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97829:17"/>
several Pannels (that is, Juries) acquitted him, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Condemned by the Council, and Executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>To conclude, our Orthodox Gentleman affixes to his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
Papers emitted by some of that Ignorant Frentick People
mentioned above, and Fathers them all upon the Presbyterians
of <hi>Scotland</hi> in general: Such fair dealing is to be expected
from Persons of his Kidney. But by our Authors Rule the
Villanies perpetrated by the <hi>Jacobites</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
might be imputed to the Church in general (which all
Men of any Consideration would Cry out against.) And it
might be as easie to shew that all the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Villanies are the
Natural Consequences of Absolute Non-resistance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it
is for him to prove that the Phrenzies of those Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were of the Solemn League and Covenant. Nay there is
this odds on the Presbyterians side, that whereas those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were espoused by not above two or three of their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and imbibed by none but the most Ignorant and lowest
of the Laity: 'Tis too well known that several of great
Learning of the Clergy, and Persons of all Ranks of the Laity
have been either Actors or Abettors of those Villanies, if not
both. It is likewise known, that they restrict the Name of
true Churchmen to themselves, as well as the others have
that of the only true Presbyterians. So that this Gentleman
has laid out his Talents in this Book only to render his Name
odious among the Sober part of Mankind. He has left his
Successors behind him, who are no less Industrious in misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Proceedings of the Assembly, and for ought I
see they are no readier to asperse than some credulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
of whom the contrary might have been expected,
are to give Credit to them. But the World may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
have an account how groundless the Calumnies of their
restless Enemies are.</p>
