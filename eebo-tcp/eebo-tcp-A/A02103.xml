            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N an Iland bounded with the Ocean. there was somtime a Cittie situated, made riche by Marchandize, and populous by long peace, the name is not mentioned in the Antiquarie, or els worne out by times An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, what it was it greatly skilles not, but therein thus it happened. An old new made Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman herein dwelt, of no small credit, exceeding wealth, and large conscience: hee had gathered from many to bestow vpon one, for though he had two sonnes he esteemed but one, that being as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, brought vp to be golds bondman, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore held heire apparant of his il gathered goods.</p>
            <p>The other was a Scholler, and maried to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Gentlewoman and therfore least regarded, for tis an old sayd saw: To learning &amp; law, thers no greater foe than they that nothing know: yet
<pb facs="tcp:18140:5"/>
was not the father altogether vnlettered, for he had good experience in a <hi>Nouerint,</hi> and by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall tearmes therein contained, had driuen many a yoong Gentleman to séeke vnknowen countries, wise he was, for he boare office in his parish and sat as formally in his foxfurd gowne, as if he had been a very vpright dealing Burges: he was religious too, neuer without a booke at his belt, and a bolt in his mouthe, readye to shoote through his sinfull neighbor.</p>
            <p>And Latin hee had some where learned, which though it were but little, yet was it profitable, for he had this Philosophye written in a ring, <hi>Tu tibi cura,</hi> which precept he curiously obserued, being in selfeloue so religious, as he held it no poynt of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to part with any thing, of whiche hee liuing might make vse.</p>
            <p>But as all mortall thinges are momentanie, and no certaintie can bee-found in this vncertaine world: so <hi>Gorinius,</hi> (for that shall bee this vsurers name) after manye a gowtie pang that had pincht his exterior partes, many a curse of the people that mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted into heuens presence, was at last with his last summons, by a deadly disease arrested, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against when hee had long contended, and was by Phisitions giuen ouer, he cald his two sonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: and willing to performe the old prouerb <hi>Qualis vita finis Ita,</hi> he thus prepard himselfe, and admonished them. My sonnes (for so your mother sayde ye were) and so I assure my selfe one of you is, and of the other I will make no doubt.</p>
            <p>You se the time is com, which I thought would
<pb facs="tcp:18140:5"/>
neuer haue aproched and we must now be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I feare neuer to meete againe. This sixteene yeares dayly haue I liude vexed with disease: and might I liue sixteene more, howe euer miserably, I should thinke it happye. But death is relentlesse, and will not be intreated witles: and knowes not what good my gold might doo him: senseles, &amp; hath no pleasure in the delightfull places I would offer him. In briefe, I thinke he hath with this foole my eldest sonne been brought vp in the vniuersitie, and therefore accounts that in riches is no vertue. But thou my son, (laying then his hand on the yongers head) haue thou another spirit: for without wealth, life is a death: what is gentry if welth be wanting, but bace seruile beggerie. Some comfort yet it is vnto me, to thinke how many Gallants sprunge of noble parents, haue croucht to <hi>Gorinius</hi> to haue sight of his gold: O gold, desired gold, admired gold? and haue lost their patrimonies to <hi>Gorinius,</hi> because they haue not returned by their day that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored creature? How manye Schollers haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rymes in <hi>Gorinius</hi> praise, and receiued (after long capping and reuerence) a sixpeny reward in signe of my superficial liberality. Breefly my yong <hi>Lucanio</hi> how I haue beene reurenst thou seest, when honester men I confesse haue been sett farre off: for to bee rich is to bee any thing, wise, honest, worshipful, or what not. I tel thee my sonne: when I came first to this Citie my whole wardrop was onely a sute of white sheepe skins, my wealth an old groat, my woonning, the wide world. At this instant (o greefe to part with it) I haue in ready
<pb facs="tcp:18140:6"/>
coine thréescore thousand pound, in plate and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels xv. thousand; in Bondes and specialties as much, in land nine hundred pound by the yeere: all which, <hi>Lucanio</hi> I bequeath to thee, only I reserue for <hi>Roberto</hi> thy wel red brother an old groat, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stocke I first began with (wherewith I wish him to buy a groats-worth of wit: for he in my life hath reprooud my manner of life, and therefore at my death, shall not be contaminated with corrupt gaine. Here by the way Gentlemen must I digresse to shewe the reason of <hi>Gorinius</hi> present speach: <hi>Roberto</hi> being come from the Academie, to visit his father, there was a great feast prouided: where for table talke, <hi>Roberto</hi> knowing his father and most of the company to be execrable vsurers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed mightely against that abhorred vice, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche that hee vrged teares from diuers of their eyes, and compunction in some of their harts. Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being past, he comes to his father, requesting him to take no offence at his liberall speach, seeing what he had vttred was truth. Angry sonne (said he) no by my honestie (and that is som what I may say to you) but vse it still, and if thou canst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any of my neighbours from lending vppon vsurie I shuld haue the more customers: to which when <hi>Roberto</hi> would haue replyde hee shut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into his studdy, and fell to tell ouer his mony.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Robertos</hi> offence: now returne, wee to sicke <hi>Gorinius,</hi> who after he had thus vnequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distributed his goods and possessions, began to aske his sonnes how they liked his bequestes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther séemed agréed, and <hi>Roberto</hi> vrged him with
<pb facs="tcp:18140:6"/>
nothing more than repentance of his sinnloke: to thine owne said he, fonde boy, &amp; come my <hi>Lucanio,</hi> let me giue thee good counsell before my death: as for you sir, your bookes are your counsellors, and therefore to them I bequeathe you. Ah <hi>Lucanio,</hi> my onely comfort, because I hope thou wilt as thy father be a gatherer, let me blesse thee before I dye. Multiply in welth my sonne by any meanes thou maist, onely flye Alchymie, for therein are more deceites than her beggerlye Artistes haue words, and yet are the wretches more talkatiue than women. But my meaning is, thou shouldest not stand on conscience in causes of profit, but heap treasure vpon treasure, for the time of néede: yet séem to be deuout, els shalt thou be held vyle, fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quent holy excercises graue companie, and aboue al vse the conuersation of yoong Gentlemen, who are so wedded to prodigalitie, that once in a quarter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitie knocks at their chamber doores: profer them kindnesse to relieue theirwants, but be sure of good assurance: giue faire wordes till dayes of paiment come, &amp; then vse my course, spare none: what though they tell of conscience (as a number will talke) looks but into the dealinges of the world, and thou shalt see it is but idle words. Seest thou not many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in the streetes, and fall to theft for néede: whom small succor woulde releeue, then where is consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and why art thou bound to vse it more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? Seest thou not daylie forgeries periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, oppressions, rackinges of the poore, raisinges of rents, inhauncing of duties euen by them that should be al conscience, if they ment as they speake:
<pb facs="tcp:18140:7"/>
but <hi>Lucanio</hi> if thou read well this booke (and with that hee reacht him <hi>Machiauels</hi> workes at large) thou shalt se, what tis to be so foole-holy as to make scruple of conscience where profit presents it selfe.</p>
            <p>Besides, thou hast an instance by the threed bare brother here, who willing to do no worng, hath lost his childes right: for who woulde wish any thinge to him, that knowes not how to vse it.</p>
            <p>So much <hi>Lucanio</hi> for conscience: &amp; yet I know not whats the reason, but some-what stinges mee inwardly when I speake of it. I father said <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> it is the worme of conscience, that vrges you at the last houre to remember your life, that eternall life may followe your repentance. Out foole (sayd this miserable father, I féele it now, it was onelye a stitch. I will forwarde with my exhortation to <hi>Lucanio.</hi> As I said my sonne, make spoyle of yoong Gallants, by insinuating thy selfe amongst them, &amp; be not mooued to thinke their Auncestors were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, but consider thine were obscure, and that thy father was the first Gentleman of the Name: <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio,</hi> thou art yet a Bacheler, and soe keepe thee till thou méete with one that is thy equal, I meane in wealth: regarde not beautie, it is but a bayte to entice thine neighbors eye: and the most faire are commonlye most fond, vse not too many familiars, for few prooue frendes, and as easie it is to weigh the wind, as to diue into the thoughtes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye glosers. I tell thee <hi>Lucanio,</hi> I haue seene four-scoore winters besides the od seuen, yet saw I neuer him, that I estéemed as my friend but gold, that desired creature, whom I haue so déerly loued,

and found so firme a frind, as nothing to me hauing it hath béene wanting. No man but may thinke déerly of a true frend, &amp; so do I of it laying it vnder sure locks, and lodging my heart there-with.</p>
            <p>But now (Ah my <hi>Lucanio</hi>) now must I leaue it, and to thée I leaue it with this lessen, loue none but thy selfe, if thou wilt liue estéemd. So turning him to his studdy, where his cheife treasure lay, he loud cryde out in the wise mans woords, <hi>O mors quam amara,</hi> O death how bitter is thy memory to him that hath al pleasures in this life, &amp; so with two or thrée lamentable grones hee left his life: and to make short worke, was by <hi>Lucanio</hi> his sonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd, as the custome is with some solemnitie: But leauing him that hath left the world to him that censureth of euery worldly man, passe wee to his sonnes: and se how his long laid vp store is by <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio</hi> lookyd into. The youth was of condition sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, shamfast, &amp; flexible to any counfaile, which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto</hi> perceiuing, and pondering howe little was lefte to him, grew into an inward contempt of his fathers vnequall legacie, and determinate resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to work <hi>Lucanio</hi> al possible iniurie, here vpon thus conuerting the swéetnes of his studdye to the sharpe thirst of reuenge, he (as Enuie is seldome idle) sought out fit companions to effect his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly resolution. Neither in such a case is ill company far to séek, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea hath scarce so ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as populous Citties haue deceiuing Syrens, whose eies are Adamants, whose words are witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes, whose doores lead downe to death. With one of these female serpents <hi>Roberto</hi> consorts, and
<pb facs="tcp:18140:8"/>
they conclude what euer they compassed equally to sharre to their contentes. This match made, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio</hi> was by his brother brought to the bush, where he had scarse pruned his winges, but hee was fast limd, and <hi>Roberto</hi> had what he expected. But that wee may keepe forme, you shall heare howe it fortuned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucanio</hi> being on a time verie pensiue, his brother brake with him in these termes. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Lucanio</hi> why you are disconsolate, that want not any thinge in the worlde that may worke your content. If wealth may delight a man, you are with that sufficently furnisht: if credit may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any comfort, your word I knowe well, is as well accepted as any mans obligation: in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are faire buildings and pleasant gardens, and cause of solace, of them I am assured you haue your choyce. Consider brother you are yoong, then plod not altogether in meditating on our fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: which howseuer they sauored of profit, were most vnsauerly to one of your yeares applied. You must not thinke but sundrye marchants of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie expect your company, sundry Gentlemen desire your familiaritie, &amp; by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersing with such, you wil be accounted a Gentleman: otherwise a pesant, if ye liue thus obscurely. Besides, which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgot and then had al the rest beene nothing, you are a man by nature furnished with all exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site proportion, worthy the loue of any courtly lady, be she neuer so amorous: you haue wealth to main taine her, of women not little longed for: wordes to court her you shall not want, for my selfe will be
<pb facs="tcp:18140:8"/>
your secretarie. Bréefely why stand I to distinguish abilitie in perticularities, when in one word it may be said which no man can gainsay, <hi>Lucanio</hi> lacketh nothing to delight a wife, nor any thing but a wife to delight him? My yoong maister being thus clawd, and pufft vp with his owne praise, made no longer delay, but hauing on his holidaie hose hee trickt himselfe vp and like a fellowe that meant good sooth, he clapt hys brother on the shoulder and said. Faith brother <hi>Roberto,</hi> and ye say the worde lets goe seeke a wife while tis hoat, both of vs together, Ile pay well, and I dare tourne you loose to say as well as any of them all, well Ile doo my best said <hi>Roberto</hi> and since ye are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde lets goe nowe and try your good fortune.</p>
            <p>With this foorth they walke, and <hi>Roberto</hi> went directly toward the house where <hi>Lamilia</hi> (for so wee call the Curtizan) kept her hospitall, which was in the suburbes of the Citie, pleasantly seated, and made more delectable by a pleasaunt garden wherin it was scituate. No soner come they within ken, but Mistris <hi>Lamilia</hi> like a cunning angler made readye her change of baytes that shee might effect <hi>Lucanios</hi> bane: and to begin she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouered from her window her beauteous enticing face, and taking a lute in her hand that shee might the rather allure, shee soung this sonnet with a delicious voyce,</p>

            <p>So their dores are euer open to entice youth to distruction.

Beleeue me Gentleman, I am very sorie that our rude entertainment is such, as no way may worke your content, for this I haue noted since your first entering that your countenance hath beene heauie, and the face being the glasse of the hart, assures me the same is not quiet: would ye wish any thing heere that might content you, say
<pb facs="tcp:18140:10"/>
but the word, and assure ye of present diligence to effect your full delight. <hi>Lucanio</hi> being so farre in loue, as he perswaded himselfe without her grant he could not liue, had a good meaninge to vtter his minde but wanting fit wordes, he stood like a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>want that lackt a prompter, or a plaier that being out of his part at his first entrance, is faine to haue the booke to speak what he should performe. Which <hi>Roberto</hi> perceiuing, replied thus in his behalfe: Madame the Sunnes brightnesse daisleth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders eies, the maiestie of Gods, amazeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane men, <hi>Tullie</hi> Prince of Orators once fainted though his cause were good, and hee that tamed monsters stoode amated at Beauties ornaments: Then blame not this yoong man though he replied not, for he is blinded with the beautie of your sunne darkening eies, made mute with the celestiall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane of your voyce, and feare of that rich ambush of amber colored dartes, whose poyntes are leueld against his hart.

Which she accepting with a lowe conge, returnd him a silke Riband for a fauour tyde with a true loues knot, which he fastened vnder a faire Iewel on his Beuer felt.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Diomedis &amp; Glauci permutatio,</hi> my yong master waxed crancke, and the musike conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, was very forward in dauncing, to shew his cunning: and so desiring them to play on a horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, laid on the pauement lustely with his leaden héeles, cornetting, like a stéede of <hi>Signor Roccoes</hi> teaching, &amp; wanted nothing but bels, to be a hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse in a morrice. Yet was he soothed in his folly, and what euer he did <hi>Lamilia</hi> counted excellent: her prayse made him proude, in so much that if hee had not beene intreated, hee would rather haue died in his daunce, then left off to shew his mistris delight. At last reasonably perswaded, séeing the table fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, hee was content to cease, and settle him to his victuals, on which (hauing before labored) hee fed lustely, especially of a Woodcocke pye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Lamilia</hi> his caruer, plentifully plied him. Full dishes hauing furnisht empty stomackes, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canio</hi> therby got leisure to talke, falles to discourse of his wealth, his landes, his bondes, his ability,
<pb facs="tcp:18140:11"/>
and how himselfe with all he had, was at madame <hi>Lamilias</hi> disposing: desiring her afore his brother to tell him simply what she meant. <hi>Lamilia</hi> replied My swéet <hi>Lucanio,</hi> how I estéeme of thée mine eies do witnes, that like handmaides, haue attended thy beauteous face, euer since I firste behelde thée: yet séeing loue that lasteth, gathereth by degrées his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: let this for that suffice, if I finde thée firme, <hi>Lamilia</hi> wilbe faithfull: if fléeting, shée must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be infortunate: that hauing neuer séene any whome before she could affect, she should be of him iniuriously forsaken.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the North partes there dwelt an olde Squier, that had a young daughter his heire; who had (as I knowe Madam <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia</hi> you haue had) many youthfull Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that long time sued to obtaine her loue. But she knowing her own perfections (as women are by nature proud) would not to any of them vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe fauour: insomuch that they perceiuing her relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, shewed themselues not altogether witlesse, but left her to her fortune, when they found her frowardnes. At last it fortuned among other strangers, a Farmers sonne visited her Fathers house: on whom at the first sight she was enamoured, he likewise on her. Tokens of loue past betweene them, either acquainted others parentes of their choise, and they kindly gaue their consent. Short tale to make, married they were, and great solempnitie was at the wedding feast. A yong Gentleman, that had beene long a suiter to her, vexing that the Sonne of a Farmer should bee so preferd, cast in his minde by what meanes (to marre their merriment) hee might steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Bride. Hereupon he confers with an olde Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, called Mother <hi>Gunby,</hi> dwelling thereby, whose counsell hauing taken, he fell to his practise, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thus. In the after noone, when dauncers were verie busie, he takes the Bride by the hande, and after a turne or two, tels her in her eare, he had a secret to impart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, appointing her in any wise in the euening to sind a time to confer with him: she promist she would, and so they parted. Then goes hee to the Bridegroome, &amp; with
<pb facs="tcp:18140:13"/>
protestations of entire affect, protests that the great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe hee takes at that which hee must vtter, wheron depended his especiall credit, if it were known the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by him should be discouered. After the Bridegrooms promise of secrecie, the gentleman tels him, that a frend of his receiued that morning from the Bride a Letter, wherein shee willed him with some sixteene horse to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait her comming at a Parke side, for that she detested him in her heart as a base countrey hynde, with whome her Father compeld her to marry. The Bridegroome almost out of his wits, began to bite his lip. Nay, sayth the Gentleman, if you will by me bee aduizde, you shall salue her credit, win her by kindnes, and yet preuent her wanton complot. As how said the Bridegroome: Mary thus saide the Gentleman: In the euening (for till the guests be gone, she intends not to gad) get you on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and seeme to bee of the companie that attendes her comming, I am appoynted to bring her from the house to the Parke, and from thence fetch a winding compasse of a mile about, but to turne vnto olde Mother <hi>Gunbyes</hi> house, where her Louer my friend abydes: when she alights, I will conduct her to a chamber farre from his lodging; but when the lights are out, and shee expects her adulterous copesmate, your selfe (as reason is) shall proue her bedfellow, where priuately you may reprooue her, and in the morning earely returne home without trouble. As for the Gentleman my friend, I will excuse her absence to him, by saying, she mockt me with her Mayde in steade of her selfe, whome when I knew at her alighting, I disdained to bring her vnto his presence. The Bridegroome gaue his hand eit shoulde be so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18140:13"/>Now by the way you must vnderstand, this Mother <hi>Gunby</hi> had a daughter, who all that day sate heauily at home with a willow garland, for that the Bridegroome (if hee had dealt faithfully) should haue wedded her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other. But men (<hi>Lamilia</hi>) are vnconstant, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney now a dayes makes the match, or else the match is marde.</p>
            <p>But to the matter: the Bridegroome and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman thus agreedh: e tooke his time, conferd with the Bride, perswaded her that her husband (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his faire shew at the marriage) had sworne to his olde sweet heart, their neighbour <hi>Gunbyes</hi> daughter, to bee that night her bedfellow: and if she would bring her Father, his Father, and other friendes to the house at midnight, they should find it so.</p>
            <p>At this the young Gentlewoman inwardly vext to bee by a peasant so abusde, promist if she saw likelyhood of his slipping away, that then she would doo according as he directed.</p>
            <p>All this thus sorting, the old womans daughter was trickly attyrde ready to furnish this pageant, for her old mother prouided all things necessary.</p>
            <p>Well, Supper past, dauncing ended, and the guests would home, and the Bridegroome pretending to bring some friend of his home, got his horse, and to the Parke side he rode, and staide with the horsemen that attended the Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Anon came <hi>Marian</hi> like mistris Bride, and mounted behind the Gentleman, away they post, fetch their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, &amp; at last alight at the olde wiues house, where so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly she is conuayd to her chamber, &amp; the bridegroome sent to kéép her company, wher he had scarse deuisd how
<pb facs="tcp:18140:14"/>
to begin his exhortation: but the Father of his Bryde knockt at the chamber doore. At which being somewhat amazed, yet thinking to turne it to a ieast, sith his Wife (as hee thought) was in bed with him, hee opened the doore, saying: Father, you are hartily welcome, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you found vs out heere; this deuise to remooue our selues, was with my wiues consent, that wee might rest quietly without the Maides and Batchelers distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing. But wheres your Wife said the Gentleman? why heere in bed saide hee. I thought (quoth the other) my daughter had beene your wife, for sure I am to day shee was giuen you in marriage. You are merrely disposed, said the Bridegroome, what thinke you I haue another wife: I thinke but as you speake quoth the Gentleman, for my daughter is below, and you say your wife is in the bed. Below (said he) you are a merry man, and with that casting on a night gowne, hee went downe, where when he saw his wife, the Gentleman his Father, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his friends assembled, hee was so confounded, that how to behaue himselfe he knew not; onely he cryde out that he was deceiued. At this the old woman arises, and making her selfe ignoraunt of all the whole matter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the cause of that sodayne tumult. When she was told the new Bridegroome was founde in bed with her daughter, she exclaimd against so great an iniurie. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was calde in quorum: shee iustified, it was by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement: he being condemnd by all their consents, was adiudged vnworthy to haue the Gentlewoman vnto his Wife, and compeld (for escaping of punishment) to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Marian: and the young Gentleman (for his care in discouering the Farmers sonnes lewdnes) was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penst with the Gentlewomans euer during loue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18140:14"/>Quoth <hi>Lamilia,</hi> and what of this? Nay nothing said <hi>Roberto,</hi> but that I haue told you the effects of sodaine loue: yet the best is, my brother is a maidenly Batchler; and for your selfe, you haue not beene troubled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suiters. The fewer the better, said <hi>Lucanio.</hi> But bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I con you little thanke for this tale, heereafter I pray you vse other table talke. Lets then end talk, quoth <hi>Lamilia,</hi> and you (signior <hi>Lucanio</hi>) and I will go to the Chesse. To Chesse, said he, what meane you by that? It is a game, said she, that the first daunger is but a checke, the worst, the giuing of a mate. Well, said <hi>Roberto,</hi> that game yee haue beene at already then, for you checkt him first with your beauty, &amp; gaue your selfe for mate to him by your bounty. Thats wel taken brother, said <hi>Lucanio,</hi> so haue we past our game at Chesse. Wil ye play at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles then, said she: I cannot, quoth hee, for I can goe no further with my game, if I be once taken. Will ye play then at cards. I said he, so it bee at one and thirtie. That fooles game, said she? Wele all to hazard, said <hi>Roberto,</hi> and brother you shall make one for an houre or two: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent quoth he. So to dice they went, and fortune so fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lucanio,</hi> that while they continued square play, hee was no looser. Anone coosenage came about, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels being double winged, flew clean from before him. <hi>Lamilia</hi> being the winner, preparde a banquet; which finished, <hi>Roberto</hi> aduisde his brother to departe home, and to furnish himselfe with more Crownes, least hee were outcrackt with new commers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucanio</hi> loath to be outcountenanst, followed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, desiring to attend his returue, which hee before had determined vnrequested: For as soone as his brothers backe was turned, <hi>Roberto</hi> begins to recken with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18140:15"/>
to bee a sharer as well in the money deceitfully wonne, as in the Diamond so wilfully giuen. But she, <hi>secundum mores meretricis,</hi> iested thus with the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Why <hi>Roberto,</hi> are you so well read, and yet shewe your selfe so shallow witted, to deeme women so weake of conceit, that they see not into mens demerites. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (to make you my stale to catch the woodcocke your brother) that my tongue ouer-running myne intent, I spake of liberall rewarde: but what I promist, theres the point; at least what I part with I will be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisde. It may be you will thus reason: Had not <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> traind <hi>Lucanio</hi> vnto <hi>Lamilias</hi> lure, <hi>Lucanio</hi> had not now beene <hi>Lamilias</hi> pray: therefore sith by <hi>Roberto</hi> she possesseth the prize, <hi>Roberto</hi> merites an equal part. Monstrous absurd if so you reason; as wel you may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thus: <hi>Lamilias</hi> dog hath kild her a Deere, therefore his Mistris must make him a pastie. No poore pennilesse Poet, thou art beguilde in mee, and yet I wonder how thou couldst, thou hast beene so often beguilde. But it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with licentious men, as with the chased Bore in the stream, who being greatly refresht with swimming, neuer feeleth anie smart vntill hee perish recurelessy wounded with his owne weapons. Reasonlesse <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> that hauing but a brokers place, askest a lenders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Faithles <hi>Roberto,</hi> that hast attempted to betray thy brother, irreligiously forsaken thy Wife, deseruedly been in thy fathers eie an abiect: thinkst thou <hi>Lamilia</hi> so loose, to consort with one so lewd. No hypocrite, the sweet Gentleman thy brother, I will till death loue, &amp; thee while I liue, loath. This share <hi>Lamilia</hi> giues thee, other getst thou none.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Roberto</hi> would haue replide, <hi>Lucanio</hi> approcht:
<pb facs="tcp:18140:15"/>
to whom <hi>Lamilia</hi> discourst the whole deceipt of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; neuer rested intimating malitious arguments, til <hi>Lucanio</hi> vtterly refusde <hi>Roberto</hi> for his brother, &amp; for euer forbad him his house. And when he would haue yeelded reasons, and formed excuse, <hi>Lucanios</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (vrgd by her importunate malice) forbad all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them that was reasonlesse, and so giuing him Iacke Drums intertainment, shut him out of doores: whom we will follow, &amp; leaue <hi>Lucanio</hi> to the mercie of <hi>Lamilia. Roberto</hi> in an extreme extasie, rent his haire, curst his destenie, blamd his trechery, but most of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimd against <hi>Lamilia:</hi> and in her against all enticing Curtizans, in these tearms.</p>

            <p>With this he laid his head on his hand, and leant his elbow on the earth, sighing out sadly,</p>
            <q>Heu patior telis vulner a factameis!</q>
            <p>On the other side of the hedge sate one that heard his sorrow: who getting ouer, came towards him, and
<pb facs="tcp:18140:16"/>
brake off his passion. When hee approached, hee saluted <hi>Roberto</hi> in this sort.</p>
            <p>Gentleman quoth hee (for so you seeme) I haue by chaunce heard you discourse some part of your greefe; which appeareth to be more than you will discouer, or I can conceipt. But if you vouchsafe such simple comforte as my abilitie may yeeld, assure your selfe, that I wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe the best, that either may procure you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, or bring you pleasure: the rather, for that I suppose you are a scholler, and pittie it is men of learning should liue in lacke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roberto</hi> wondring to heare such good wordes, for that this iron age affoordes few that esteeme of vertue; returnd him thankfull gratulations, and (vrgde by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie) vttered his present griefe, beseeching his aduise how he might be imployed. Why, easily quoth hee, and greatly to your benefite: for men of my profession gette by schollers their whole liuing. What is your professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, said <hi>Roberto?</hi> Truly sir, saide hee, I am a player. A player, quoth <hi>Roberto,</hi> I tooke you rather for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great liuing, for if by outward habit men should be censured, I tell you, you would bee taken for a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall man. So am I where I dwell (quoth the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) reputed able at my proper cost to build a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill. What though the world once went hard with me, when I was faine to carry my playing Fardle a foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe; <hi>Temporamutantur,</hi> I know you know the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it better than I, but I thus conster it, its other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise now; for my very share in playing apparell will not be sold for two hundred pounds. Truly (said <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>) tis straunge, that you should so prosper in that vayne practise, for that it seemes to mee your voice is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:18140:16"/>
gratious. Nay then, saide the Player, I mislike your iudgement: why, I am as famous for Delphrigus, &amp; the King of Fairies, as euer was any of my time. The twelue labors of Hercules haue I terribly thundred on the Stage, and plaid thrée Scenes of the Deuill in the High way to heauen. Haue ye so (saide <hi>Roberto?</hi>) then I pray you pardon me. Nay more (quoth the Player) I can serue to make a pretie speech, for I was a countrey Author, passing at a Morrall, for twas I that pende the Morrall of mans witte, the Dialogue of Diues, and for seuen yéers space was absolute Interpreter to the pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. But now my Almanacke is out of date:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The people make no estimation,</l>
               <l>Of Morrals teaching education.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Was not this prettie for a plaine rime extempore? if ye will ye shall haue more. Nay its enough, said <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto,</hi> but how meane you to vse mée? Why sir, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Playes, said the other, for which you shall be well paid, if you will take the paines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roberto</hi> perceiuing no remedie, thought best in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his present necessitie, to try his wit, &amp; went with him willingly: who lodgd him at the Townes end in a house of retayle, where what happened our Poet, you shall after heare. There by conuersing with bad compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he grew <hi>A malo in peius,</hi> falling from one vice to an other: and so hauing founde a vaine to finger crowns, he grew cranker than <hi>Lucanio,</hi> who by this time began to droope, béeing thus dealt with by <hi>Laminia.</hi> Shee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bewitched him with hir enticing wiles, caused him to consume in lesse than two yéeres that infinite treasure gathered by his father with so many a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s curse. His lands sold, his iewels pawnd, his money wasted, he
<pb facs="tcp:18140:17"/>
was casséerd by <hi>Lamilia,</hi> that had coossend him of all. Then walkt he like one of Duke <hi>Humfreys</hi> Squires, in a thread-bare cloake, his hose drawne out with his héeles, his shooes vnseamed, least his feete should sweate with heat: now (as witlesse as hee was) he remembred his Fathers words, his vnkindnes to his brother, his carelesnes of himselfe. In this sorrowhe sate down on pennilesse bench; where when <hi>Opus</hi> and <hi>Vsus</hi> told him by the chymes in his stomacke it was time to fall vnto meat, he was faine with the Camelion to féed vpon the aire, and make patience his best repast.</p>
            <p>While he was at this feast, <hi>Lamilia</hi> came flaunting by, garnished with the iewels wherof she beguiled him, which sight serued to close his stomacke after his cold cheare. <hi>Roberto</hi> hearing of his brothers beggery, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had little remorse of his miserable state, yet did séeke him out, to vse him as a propertie, whereby <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> was somewhat prouided for. But béeing of simple nature, hee serued but for a blocke to whet <hi>Robertoes</hi> wit on: which the poore foole perceiuing, he for sooke all other hopes of life, and fell to be a notorious Pandar, in which detested course he continued till death. But <hi>Roberto</hi> now famozed for an Arch-plaimaking-poet, his purse like the sea somtime sweld; anon like the same sea fell to a low ebbe; yet seldom he wanted, his labors were so well estéemed. Marry this rule he kept, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he fingerd afore hand, was the certaine meanes to vnbinde a bargaine, and being askt why hee so slightly dealt with them that did him good? It becoms me, saith hee, to bee contrary to the worlde; for commonly when vulgar men receiue earnest, they doo performe, when I am paid any thing afore-hand, I breake my promise.
<pb facs="tcp:18140:17"/>
He had shift of lodgings, where in euery place his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesse writ vp the wofull remembrance of him, his laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, and his boy; for they were euer his in houshold, beside retainers in sundry other places. His companie were lightly the lewdest persons in the land, apt for pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferie, periurie, forgerie, or any villainy. Of these hee knew the casts to cog at cards, coossen at Dice; by these he learnd the le gerdemaines of nips, foystes, connycat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, crosbyters, lifts, high Lawyers, and all the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that vncleane generation of vipers: and pithily could he paint out their whole courses of craft: So cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was in all craftes, as nothing rested in him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most but craftines. How often the Gentlewoman his Wife labored vainely to recall him, is lamentable to note: but as one giuen ouer to all lewdnes, he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated her sorrowfull lines among his loose truls, that iested at her bootlesse laments. If he could any way get credite on sc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res, he would then brag his creditors car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried stones, comparing euery round circle to a groning O procured by a painfull burden. The shamefull ende of sundry his consorts deseruedly punished for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, wrought no compunction in his heart: of which one, brother to a Brothell hee kept, was trust vnder a trée as round as a Ball.</p>
            <p>To some of his swearing companions thus it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: A crue of them sitting in a Tauerne carowsing, it fortuned an honest Gentleman and his friend, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their roome: some of them béeing acquainted with him, in their dominéering drunken vaine would haue no nay but downe hee must néedes sitte with them; bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed, no remedie there was, but he must needes keepe euen compasse with their vnseemely carowsing.
<pb facs="tcp:18140:18"/>
Which he refusing, they fell from high words to sound strokes, so that with much adoo the Gentleman saued his owne, and shifted from their company. Being gone one of these tiplers for sooth lackt a gold Ring, the other sware they sée the Gentleman take it from his hande. Upon this the Gentleman was indited before a Judge, these honest men are deposde: whose wisedome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of the braule, gaue light to the Jury, what power wine-washing poyson had, they according vnto conscience found the Gentleman not guiltie, and God released by that verdit the innocent.</p>
            <p>With his accusers thus it fared: One of them for murder was worthily executed: the other neuer since prospered: the third, sitting not long after vpon a lustie horse, the beast sodenly dyde vnder him, God amend the man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roberto</hi> euery day acquainted with these examples, was notwithstanding nothing bettered, bur rather har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in wickednesse. At last was that place iustified, God warnethmen by dreams and visions in the night, and by knowne examples in the day, but if hee returne not, hee comes vppon him with iudgement that shall bée felt. For now when the number of deceites caused <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto</hi> bee hatefull almost to all men, his immeasurable drinking had made him the perfect Image of the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and the loathsome scourge of Lust tyrannized in his bones: lying in extreame pouerty, and hauing nothing to pay but chalke, which now his Host accepted not for currant, this miserable man lay comfortlesly languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hauing but one groat left (the iust proportion of his Fathers Legacie) which looking on, he cryed: O now it is too late, too late to buy witte with thée: and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:18140:18"/>
will I sée if I can sell to carelesse youth what I negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently forgot to buy.</p>
            <p>Héere (Gentlemen) breake I off <hi>Robertoes</hi> speach; whose life in most parts agraéing with mine, found one selfe punishment as I haue doone. Héereafter suppose me the saide <hi>Roberto,</hi> and I will goe on with that hee promised: <hi>Greene</hi> will send you now his groats-worth of wit, that neuer shewed a mites-worth in his life: &amp; though no man now bee by to doo mée good: yet ere I die I will by my repentaunce indeuour to doo all men good.</p>

                  <p>IF wofull experience may moue you (Gentlemen) to beware, or vnheard of wretchednes intreate you to take héed: I doubt not but you wil looke backe with sorrow on your time past, and indeuour with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to spend that which is to come. Wonder not, (for with thée wil I first begin) thou famous gracer of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians, that <hi>Greene,</hi> who hath said with thée (like the foole in his heart) There is no God, shoulde now giue

glorie vnto his greatnes: for penetrating is his power, his hand lyes heauie vpon me, hee hath spoken vnto mee with a voice of thunder, and I haue felt he is a God that can punish enemies. Why should thy excellent wit, his gift, bee so blinded, that thou shouldst giue no glorie to the giuer: Is it pestilent Machiuilian pollicy that thou hast studied? O peeuish follie! What are his rules but meere confused mockeries, able to extirpate in small time the generation of mankind. For if <hi>Sic volo, sic iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo,</hi> hold in those that are able to commaund: and if it be lawfull <hi>Fas &amp; nefas</hi> to do any thing that is benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; onely Tyrants should possesse the earth, and they striuing to exceed in tyrannie, should each to other be a slaughter man; till the mightiest outliuing all, one stroke were lefte for Death, that in one age mans life should end. The brocher of this Diabolicall Atheisme is dead, and in his life had neuer the felicitie hee aymed at: but as he began in craft; liued in feare, and ended in despaire. <hi>Quàm inscrutabilia sunt Dei iudicia?</hi> This murderer of many brethren, had his conscience seared like <hi>Caine:</hi> this betrayer of him that gaue his life for him, inherited the portion of <hi>Iudas:</hi> this Apostata peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as ill as <hi>Iulian:</hi> and wilt thou my friend be his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple? Looke but to me, by him perswaded to that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and thou shalt find it an infernall bondage. I knowe the least of my demerits merit this miserable death, but wilfull striuing against knowne truth, exceedeth all the terrors of my soule. Defer not (with me) till this last point of extremitie; for litle knowst thou how in the end thou shalt be visited.</p>
                  <p>With thee I ioyne yong <hi>Iuuenall,</hi> that byting Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrist, that lastly with mee together writ a Comedie.
<pb facs="tcp:18140:21"/>
Sweet boy, might I aduise thee, be aduisde, and get not many enemies by bitter wordes: inueigh against vaine men, for thou canst do it, no man better, no man so well: thou hast a libertie to reprooue all, and name none; for one being spoken to, all are offended; none being blamed no man is iniured. Stop shallow water still running, it will rage, or tread on a worme and it will turne: then blame not Schollers vexed with sharpe lines, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thy too much liberty of reproofe.</p>
                  <p>And thou no lesse deseruing than the other two, in some things rarer, in nothing inferiour; driuen (as my selfe) to extreme shifts, a litle haue I to say to thee: and were it not an idolatrous oth, I would sweare by sweet S. George, thou art vnworthy better hap, sith thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendest on so meane a stay. Base minded men all three of you, if by my miserie you be not warnd: for vnto none of you (like mee) sought those burres to cleaue: those Puppets (I meane) that spake from our mouths, those Anticks garnisht in our colours. Is it not strange, that I, to whom they all haue beene beholding: is it not like that you, to whome they all haue beene beholding, shall (were yee in that case as I am now) bee both at once of them forsaken? Yes trust them not: for there is an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his <hi>Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde,</hi> supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and beeing an absolute <hi>Iohannes fac totum,</hi> is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey. O that I might intreat your rare wits to be imploied in more profitable courses: &amp; let those Apes imitate your past excellence, and neuer more acquaint them with your admired inuentions. I knowe the best husband of
<pb facs="tcp:18140:21"/>
you all will neuer proue an Usurer, and the kindest of them all will neuer proue a kind nurse: yet whilest you may, seeke you better Maisters; for it is pittie men of such rare wits, should be subiect to the pleasure of such rude groomes.</p>
                  <p>In this I might insert two more, that both haue writ against these buckram Gentlemen: but lette their owne workes serue to witnesse against their owne wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, if they perseuere to maintaine any more such peasants. For other new-commers, I leaue them to the mercie of these painted monsters, who (I doubt not) will driue the best minded to despise them: for the rest, it skils not though they make a ieast at them.</p>
                  <p>But now returne I againe to you three, knowing my miserie is to you no newes: and let mee hartily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to be warned by my harms. Delight not (as I haue done) in irreligious oathes; for from the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers house, a curse shall not depart. Despise drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which wasteth the wit, and maketh men all equall vnto beasts. Flie lust, as the deathsman of the soule, and defile not the Temple of the holy Ghost. Abhorre those Epicures, whose loose life hath made religion lothsome to your eares: and when they sooth you with tearms of Maistership, remember <hi>Robert Greene,</hi> whome they haue often so flattered, perishes now for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Remember Gentlemen, your liues are like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lighted Tapers, that are with care deliuered to all of you to maintaine: these with wind-puft wrath may be extinguisht, which drunkennes put out, which negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence let fall: for mans time is not of it selfe so short, but it is more shortned by sinne. The fire of my light is now at the last snuffe, and for want of wherewith to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
<pb facs="tcp:18140:22"/>
it, there is no substance lefte for life to feede on. Trust not then (I beseech ye) to such weake staies: for they are as changeable in minde, as in many attyres. Wel, my hand is tyrde, and I am forst to leaue where I would begin: for a whole booke cannot containe their wrongs, which I am forst to knit vp in some fewe lines of words.</p>

               <p>AN Ant and a Grashopper walking together on a Greene, the one carelesly skipping, the other care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prying what winters prouision was scattered in the way: the Grashopper scorning (as wantons will) this needlesse thrift (as hee tearmed it) reprooued him thus:</p>

               <p>To this the Ant perceiuing the Grashoppers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, quickly replyde:</p>

                  <l>The thriftie husband spares what vnthrift spends,</l>
                  <l>His thrift no theft, for dangers to prouide:</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:18140:22"/>In short time these two parted, the one to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the other to his labour. Anon Haruest grew on, and reft from the Grashopper his woonted moysture. Then weakly skipt hee to the medowes brinks: where till fell winter he abode. But storms continually pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hee went for succour to the Ant his olde acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to whom hee had scarce discouered his estate, but the waspish little worme made this reply.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Packe hence (quoth he) thou idle lazie worme,</l>

               <p>The Grashopper foodlesse, helplesse and strengthles, got into the next brooke, and in the yeelding sand digde for himselfe a pit: by which hee likewise ingrau'de this Epitaph.</p>
