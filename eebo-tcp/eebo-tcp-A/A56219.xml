            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>till refusing, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> demanded, <hi>Who and what they were, being all strangers to them? and by whose authority, or order they thus forcibly kept them out?</hi> They answered, <hi>they were Officers of the army, and had sufficient Authority to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, if they had not sate since</hi> 1648. <hi>till</hi> 1653.

Whiles he was standing in the Hall expecting those who promised to meet there, he was twice informed one after another, that there were no Guards at all at the House D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or, that any person might freely go into it without examination, there being but few Members within, and the Doors standing open. Whereupon he spake to 4 or 5 Members there met, to go along with him into the House, and if they were freely admitted, to give notice of it to the rest to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after if they pleased: Some of them were unwilling to go being formerly repulsed, thinking it better to make a Narrative of their former forcible seclusion on Saturday, and to signifie it by a Letter directed to the Speaker, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with their names, which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> conceived super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, since the Door now stood feeely open to all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Guards to seclude any, and that, as he apprehended, in pursute of Major General <hi>Lamberts</hi> promise to Mr. <hi>Knightly: And it would be idle to complain of that force by Letter, wherewith they might now acquaint those then fitting by their own mouthes, if there were cause.</hi> Vpon

which ground, M. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Annesly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi> about ten of the clock went to the House, where the doors of the <hi>Lebby</hi> &amp; <hi>House</hi> were at first knock opened to them by the ordinary Door-keepers, upon their telling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were <hi>Members,</hi> (there being no Guard at either door:) who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to each of them as Members, a printed Paper intitled, <hi>A Declaration of the Parliament assembled at Westminster, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> 7. <hi>May,</hi> 1659.

After this Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had conference with divers Members as they came in, who said they were glad to see him in health, and meet him there again. The House being thin, M. <hi>P.</hi> turned to the Statute of 17 <hi>Caroli,</hi> c. 7. reading it to himself; and after that to two other Members: telling them, it was a doubt, <hi>whether the old Parliament was not determined by the Kings death, notwithstanding that Act; which was fit to be first freely debated in a full House, before ought else was done.</hi> Upon which they demanded, <hi>Why he came amongst them, if he made a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or thought it to be dissolved?</hi> Who answered, <hi>to have it fully debated and resolved in a full and free House.</hi> After which Sir <hi>Arthur Hasterigge</hi> coming in, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> saluted and

As for their Charge and menaces, he was no way affrighted with them: It being as free and lawfull for him and other Members, to meet and advise together both as Members and Freemen of</hi> England, <hi>for preservation of themselves, the peoples Rights and Parliaments Privileges, when forcibly secluded, as they did on Saturday; as for themselves, or the Army Officers to meet privately and publickly both in and out of the House, to deprive them of their privileges, as they had oft times done of late: That these high menacing words, were a very ill performance of their New published Declaration, delivered him at the door</hi>: That they were resolved (by the gracious assistance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God) to apply themselves to the faithfull discharge of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61236:7"/>
their legal Trust; to assert, establish and secure, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Liberty of the People in reference unto all, both as Men and as Christians.) <hi>which if they should publikely vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, &amp; null by any unjust charge, or proceedings against him, who had suffered so much, both as an English Freeman, Christian, and Member too</hi> (by their 3 years close imprisonment of him without cause or hearing) <hi>under their new</hi> FREE-STATE, <hi>when first erected, and now again upon their very first reviving of it, though a Member, only for coming into the House and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with other Members, to claim their rights: It would highly reflect upon their intended new Free State, and make all out of love with it.</hi> After which, they going up with other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into the Committee Chamber, to consult how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of or get him out of the House, about half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they all came down into the House, where Mr. <hi>P.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued sitting: the Speaker being come in the interim, they first concluded to goe to prayers, then to sit as an House: whereupon all taking their places, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> took his place too where he usually sat before, resolving not to stirr thence: which Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> observing, after some whisperings with the Speaker and others next them; though the Cushion was laid, and order given to call in the Chaplain to pray, yet they countermanded it, telling the Speaker,
<q>It was now somewhat late, and they could dispatch little before dinner: therefore they would by agreement, without any adjournment, presently rise and go to dinner, and then sit in the afternoon about one a clock, and the Speaker in the mean time might dispatch a business he said he must needs doe.</q>
Vpon which they all rising, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> continued in the House till most of them (being about 42. with himself in his computation) were gone out, lest they should return and sit so soon as he was gone, his presence there, being the sole cause of their not fitting. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> then going out after them, found a guard of Souldiers with Halberts at the door, and a Troop of Horse in the Pallace Yard; which were purposely sent

When he came at the House door to enter, several Officers of the Army there placed (one of them sitting in a chair) told him, <hi>That he must not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they had special Order to keep him out of the House</hi>:

Yet notwithstanding all these brands they have publickly layd upon them, (which they and others never yet wiped of by any publick Answer as the formerly secluded Members had refuted those base as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions and calumnies the Army had falsely cast on them) they had now invited those very Members to return and fit again without secluding, any of them, and engaged to yield them their best protection, as the <hi>Assertors of the Good Old Cause,</hi> who had a special presence of God with them, and were <hi>signally blessed in the work</hi>: yea as the only Instruments for setling and securing the peace and freedom of this Common-wealth: Therefore they had far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason to invite &amp; call in him &amp; the other first secluded Members than thus forcibly to exclude and ascribe and give to them alone the Supreame Authority of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

After which one of the Army Officers told Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> he had deserted the <hi>Good Old Cause:</hi> To which he replyed, <hi>That the true Good Cause for which they were first raised, was only to defend the Kings person, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Parliament, all its Members, Privileges, and secure them against all force and violence whatsoever, which cause they had not only deserted but betrayed, and fought against, contrary to all former Engagements,</hi> to which cause he adhered, and defired entrance to maintain it. To which he answered. <hi>That indeed was once their Good Old Cause; but now it was not so, for since they had pursued another Cause:</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> replyed, that then they were <hi>real Back-sliders therein,</hi> and their <hi>Cause</hi> neither <hi>old</hi> nor <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>bad, new</hi> and destructive to the former <hi>old one.</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion Mr. <hi>P.</hi> pressed them to shew <hi>their order forbis seclusion,</hi> &amp; tell him their names; They answered they would not shew it, nor tell their names: He then told them, <hi>That certainly their</hi> Good Old Cause <hi>was in their own Iudgements, Consciences very bad, since they durst not own it by name</hi>: They answered, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Annesly <hi>the last day when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to tell their names, as they do now, had inquired out some of them, from whom be might learn them.</hi> In conclusion when he could not prevayl, he told them, <hi>they declared themselves and those now siting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Cowards, and their magnified</hi> Good Old Cause <hi>to be very bad, since they were afraid of one single person without Arms, when as they were a whole Army of armed men, and bad above</hi> 40 <hi>voyces to his one, yet were afraid to admit him in, for fear he alone should blow them all up with the breath of his mouth, and goodness of his cause.</hi> And so departing, he met Mr. <hi>Prydeaux</hi> in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> and desired him to acquaint those within, <hi>that he was forcibly kept out of the House by the Souldiers, who beset the passages to keep out what Members they pleased</hi>; Then returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Hall, a secluded Member he there met pressing him to know what passed in the <hi>Lobby:</hi> he related the sum of what was done and said, which divers pressed about him to hear, and some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers among others; who when he had ended his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, said, <hi>he was an honest Gentleman, and had spoken nothing but truth and reason.</hi> After which meeting with Colonel <hi>Oky</hi> in the

            <p>This being an Exact <hi>Narration</hi> of the <hi>truth, substance</hi> of what passed between Mr. <hi>P.</hi> the <hi>Army-Officers,</hi> and those now fitting, on the 7th. and 9th. of this instant <hi>May,</hi> both in the <hi>Lobby, House,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> being since necessitated to publish it, to prevent and rectifie the various misreports thereof. He shall now relate, (as a <hi>Corollary</hi> thereunto) the true and only reasons then inducing him (after earnest Prayer to God for direction and protection in this Grand Affair) to press the admission of himself and other Members into the House, to correct the manifold contradictory censures of what he then did and spoke.</p>
            <p>Some have been staggared and amazed at it, as if he were now turned an Apostate from his former principles, acting both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Judgement and Conscience, to cry up, and make himself a Member of that old Parliament, which he publickly printed to be dissolved above ten years since, by the Kings death; Others have censured it for a rash, foolish, and desperate attempt.</p>
            <p>A third sort condemn it as a seditious, tumultuous if not treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Action, prejudicial to the publick peace and settlement, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving severe exemplary punishments.</p>
            <p>A fourth Classis doome it, as a scandalous Act, dishonorable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to our Religion.</p>
            <p>A fifth sort cry it up, as a most necessary, heroick, national, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Action, deserving everlasting honor, prayse, thanks from the whole English Nation, and a necessary incumbent duty as a Member of the old Parliament, (though legally dissolved) being pretentionally now revived against Law, Truth, by those very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Officers, who six years past <hi>ipso facto</hi> dissolved, and declared it to be dissolved; yea have held many <hi>new Mock-Parliaments</hi> of their own modelling since, all proving abortive, by forcible ruptures as the long Parliament did</p>
            <p>It is not in Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> power to reconcile or controll these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory censures; neither was he ever yet so foolish or vain-glorious, as to be any wayes moved with the censures, opinions, or applauses of other men; nor so ambitious, covetous, as to pursue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61236:10"/>
any private interest of honor, profit, revenge, &amp;c. under the notion of publick Liberty, Justice, Reformation as many have done; nor so Sycophantical as to connive at others destructive exorbitances, guilded over with specious Titles; this being his constant rule, to keep <hi>a good Conscience in all things both towards God and man,</hi> Acts 24.16. to discharge his publick trust, duty towards God and his Native Country, though with the probable hazard of his life, liberty, estate, friends, &amp; what else may be precious to other men; to trust <note n="*" place="margin">Comforting, supporting himself against all persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, reproaches, libels, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies cast upon him: With Mat. 5.10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. 3.14, 16, 17. c. 4.12, 13, 14, 16.

            <p>The only ground, end, motive, inducing Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> thus ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and timely to get into the House, was no wayes to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any <hi>unparliamentary</hi> Conventicle or proceedings whatsoever, nor to own those then sitting to be the old true Commons House of Parliament, whereof he was formerly a Member, as now constituted, much less to be the Parliament it self then sitting; but to discharge the trust to which he was once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After his election against his will and inclination, he came not into the House till the Treaty was almost concluded, (and that at the request of divers eminent Members) only with a sincere desire to do that cordial service for preservation of the King, Kingdom, Church, Parliament, Laws, Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and prevention of those manifold Plots of forein Popish Adversaries, Priests, Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, Sectaries, seduced Members, Army-Officers, and Agitators, utterly to subvert them, which other Members overmuch or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neglected, coldly opposed, or were totally ignorant of: What good service he did in the House during that little space he continued in it, is fitter for others then himself to relate.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61236:15"/>
a King of this <hi>Realm</hi> by his death 2ly. The Counsel by whose advice it was summoned, was <hi>his,</hi> not his heirs and successors Counsel. 3ly. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament convened, <hi>his Parliament</hi> alone, not his heirs or successors, both of them ceasing to be his Counsel or Parliament by his decease. 4ly. The subject matter for which it was summoned. Divers urgent and arduous businesses concerning <hi>Us,</hi> not our heirs or successors, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Our</hi> (not their) <hi>Realm</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> who was no more <hi>Us,</hi> and the kingdom no more <hi>his kingdom,</hi> so soon as he lost his life. 5ly. The end of summoning this Parliament, was only this, for the <hi>King himself</hi> to have a conference and Treaty with the Prelates and Nobles, and for them to be personally present with <hi>Us,</hi> not our heirs or successors, to give <hi>Us</hi> their Counsel, &amp;c. not our heirs and successors: All frustrate, made impossible, and absolutely ceasing by his death: because when once dead, they can neither parlie, conferr, nor treat with the King himself, nor the King with them, nor be personally present with Him for that purpose: unlesse they will averr, that a meer dead headlesse King can really confer, treat, parly, consult, advise with his living Prelats, Lords, Parliament, and they with him, &amp; be Parliamentally present with each other in the Lords House neither of which they dare admit into it, for fear the King if living, and Lords too, should afright them out of it, as the Kings ghost, yea the memorial of it though dead, might justly do. 6ly. The mandatory part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Kings name</hi> alone, to summon them to treat with and give their Counsel unto <hi>Us</hi> concerning the foresaid businesses relating to <hi>Us</hi> and the defence of <hi>Our</hi> Realm, <hi>Our Businesses</hi> aforesaid, not our heirs and successors. He and his businesses all ending when he expires, the Parliament must of necessity determine. 7ly. The Parliament ceasing to be the <hi>Common counsel</hi> of the King and his kingdom, and nothing possible to be ordained BY US, (the King, not his heirs and successors) Prelates, Nobles in Parliament, without his concurrent Vote, or when he is dead; unless a dead King can give counsel, make Ordinances, give his royal assent to Bills when deceased. It must inevitably follow, that all the Authority, causes, grounds, ends for which the Members of this Parliament were all summoned to treat, consult, and give their advice to the <hi>King himself</hi> determining, and becoming impossible to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his death; the Parliament must of necessity expire and be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, even as the natural body ceaseth to be and remain a living man when the Head is quite cut off: If then those now sitting (who cut off the Kings Head, the Head of the Parliament, and thereby destroyed that temporary body politick) will have their Conventicle revived by this Act, they must set on his head again, raise him alive out of his Grave, and bring him back into the House, to impeach, condemn, decapitate them in this true High Court of Justice for this their beheading him in their Court of Highest Injustice. Which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> presumes they dare not doe, least his revived Ghost should scare them thence, or justly retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their transcendent Treachery.</item>

               </note>Whereunto Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> answers: 1. That the sole end, scope of this Act was not to provide against the dissolution of the Parliament by the Kings natural, or violent untimely death, not then thought of, (he being in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, likely to live many years by the course of nature, and to survive all the ends for which this Act was made,) but to raise credit for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to provide monies by this Act, <hi>to prevent the untimely dissolution, proroguing, adjourning of this Parliament by the Kings own regal power</hi>: He having prorogued, dissolved all former Parliaments during his Reign in discontent, by his Regal power (not death) against the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons wills. 2ly. This is intituled, <hi>An Act to prevent Inconveniences which may happen by the untimely adjourning, proroguing, or dissolving of this present Parliament,</hi> and the Prologue, Body of the Act, provide joyntly and severally against all three, to wit, <hi>the untimely proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61236:16"/>
or adjourning,</hi> as well as <hi>dissolving</hi> of this Parliament. But no Parliament ever was, is, or possibly can be <hi>untimely prorogued,</hi> or <hi>adjourned,</hi> by the Kings death, but only by his actual Regal will and power: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dissolving of it, intended by this Act, must be only an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely dissolution by his actual will,</hi> Commission, writ, and regal power, alone, by which his former Parliaments were prorogued, dissolved against the Lords and Commons assents, not by his death, whether natural or violent, being against his will, and no part of his Regal Supremacy, but only of his human frailty 3ly The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> the Commons feared would ensue by the untimely dissolution of this Parliament, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prevent by this Act, are thus expressed in the Prologue. <hi>Where as great sums of mony must of necessity be suddainly advanced and provided for relief of his Majesties Army, &amp; people of the Nothern parts of this Realm, and to prevent the imminent danger this Kingdome is in, and for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of other his Majesties present and urgent occasions, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so timely effected as is requisite, without credit for raysing the said mony: which credit cannot be obtained, untiil such Obstacles he first removed as are occasioned by Fears, Iealousies, Apprehensions, of divers of his Majesties Subjects, that this present Parliament may be adjourned, prorogued, or dissolved,</hi> (1.) <hi>before Iustice shall be executed upon Delinquents,</hi> (2ly.) <hi>publike grievances redressed,</hi> (3ly.) <hi>a firm peace between the two Nations of</hi> England and Scotland <hi>concluded,</hi> (4ly.) <hi>and before sufficient provision be made for the repayment of the said monies, so to be raysed: all which the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving duly considered, do therefore humbly beseech your most excellent Majesty, that it may be declared and enacted. And be it therefore declared and enacted by the King our Soveraign Lord, with the assent of the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the same, That this present Parliament now assembled shall not be dissolved, unless it be by Act of Parliament to be passed for that purpose,</hi> &amp;c. By which it is undenyable, 1. That the Commons when they petitioned for, the King when he <hi>declared, enacted,</hi> &amp; the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons when they assented to this Act, did never think of or intend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against a dissolution of this Parliament, by the Kings untimely death, nor of a future dissolving it by an Act of Parliament by his Successors or others after his decease; but on the contrary, presupposed the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his life, and of this Parliament thereby, till all the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they recite were prevented, and a new Act passed by him and them jointly to dissolve this Parliament when these Inconveniences were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and things effected: Which is irrefragable, 1. Because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>in Terminis,</hi> The speedy advancing and providing of monies, for the relief of <hi>his Majesties Armies,</hi> and people of the Northern parts (not their subsequent Armies) and the supply of <hi>his Maiesties present and urgent occasions,</hi> (not their own) and the Fears, Jealousies, and Apprehensions of divers <hi>his Maiesties Loyal Subiects, &amp;c.</hi> o be the only ground of their humbly beseeching <hi>his Maiesty</hi> for this Act. All which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61236:17"/>
presuppose his life, being, preservation, and the Commons great care of complying with him as their <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> without the least thought of his untimely death since happening, or secluding the King or his Poûeritie, out of this and all future Parliaments by colour of this Act, as those now fitting have done point-blanck against it. 2ly The Fears, Jealousies, and Apprehensions they had occasioning this Act, were only these, That this Parliament might be adjourned, prorogued, dissolved, 1. Before Justice shall be duly executed upon Delinquents, (then in being and complained of, as <hi>Strafford, Canterb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But none of these four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars could be accomplished by the Lords or Commons alone after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties death,<note place="margin">

               </note> but by the King alone, or by his concurrence with them whiles living: Yea they were all actually accomplished in his life time, long before his death.

It is most certain, that all these ends of making this Law, (as the <hi>Prologue</hi> thereof, and the word <hi>THEREFORE</hi> in the Commons prayer, infallibly declare) were fully accomplished by the King in his life, so long before his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death:</hi> Therfore none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now remaining to be performed; &amp; all acted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ince their accomplishment by those now sitting, being diametrically contrary to this Act, these ends, and occasions of it; this Parliament must of necessity be beheaded, expired with the King; and cannot survive his death. 4ly. The words, <hi>That this present Parliament assembled shall not be dissolved, unlesse it be by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be passed for that purpose, nor shall at any time or times during the continuance thereof,</hi> (twice recited in the subsequent clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) <hi>be prorogued, or adjourned, unlesse it be by Act of Parliament to be passed for that purpose</hi>; can be intended of no other but that present Parliament, which passed this Act: which consisted of <hi>The Kings Maiesty our Soveraign Lord</hi> (<hi>by whom this and all other Acts passed or to be passed,</hi> was declared and enacted; and this intended Act like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) not of his heir or successor after his death; and of the Lords and Commons House then in being; not any new House of Lords or Commons succeeding after their deaths then sitting: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the King was cut off by an untimely death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an impossibility accruing to dissolve it by an Act of Parliament within the words or intent of this Act; it must of necessity be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by his beheading: <hi>Impossibilities</hi> making Acts of Parliament to perform them meerly void, as our Lawe makes <note n="n" place="margin">Brooke, Perkins, Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert, Ash.

This Act and those who made it, must have and had a retrospect to the Writs whereby it and they were summoned, and the ends, things therein expressed: But they all determined, and became <hi>Impossible</hi> after the Kings beheading; Therefore the Parliament must be destroyed with him:<note n="o" place="margin">Serj.

Those then sitting went in openlie like a House, upon 40 daies general Summons by Writs, setting without Gards, secluding none of their Fellow. Members by force. Those now sitting stole sodenlie into the House, in a surreptitious manner, without any notice given to the people of the Nation, or to those for whom they formerly served, or to the absent Members, or those then in <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> who were not of their combination: setting Gards of Army-Officers at the Door, (who conducted them thither,) and presently secluded Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and the other Members who upon the first notice of their sitting came to know upon what account they sate: taking forcible possession with Souldiers, and strong hand of the Commons House, and keeping themselves in possession thereof by force against the secluded Members &amp; majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the house, contrary to the Statutes of 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.15 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 9.31 <hi>Eliz c.</hi> 11. against forcible entries and deteiners; the Statute of 7 E. 1. the Libertie, Privilege, Rights, and Usage of Parliaments: A practice utterlie unseeming such transcendent Saints, Patriots of publick Liberty, as they boast themselves, &amp; that Honor, Justice, Honestie, Synceritie, Gravity, Wisedom, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all Members of a Parliament, and Reformers of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Grievances, Frauds, and indirect practises in others. 3ly. That old House of Commons had a special care of providing for the Kings Armie, his <hi>urgent</hi> and <hi>present occasions: professed themselves his loyal Subjects,</hi> and him <hi>to be their King and Soveraign Lord</hi>; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie besought his most Excellent Majesty, <hi>that it might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and enacted by him,</hi> that this Parliament might not be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>prorogued,</hi> or <hi>adjourned</hi>; but <hi>by Act of Parliament</hi>; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging they <hi>could make no such Act without his Majesties Royal assent,</hi> and that both the <hi>King and Lords House</hi> were essential Members of the Parliament within this Act. But those fitting since 1648. till 1653. and now again thus entring the House, by pretext of this Act, have renounced, abjured, and professedlie engaged against all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61236:20"/>
this, to which they are direct <hi>Antipodes</hi>; Therefore no Commons House within this Act. 4ly. The Commons House within this Act, was that House which was then in being when this Act pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, dulie elected by the people by the Kings Writs, not the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie-Officers, and pursued the self-same ends recited in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, for which this Act was made and assented to by the King and Lords. But this New House was created, constituted, not by the Kings writs, or peoples election, but the Armies swords, and conspiracie, 7 years after this Act first passed; then disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turned out of Doors above 6 years by the Army; and now re-inducted into it by their armed Votes and force to serve their ends, not to pursue those mentioned in the Act, accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed many years since, and now becoming impossible. Therefore they are not so much as an House of Commons within this Act, and the Armie-Officers and Souldiers who formerly thrust them out, &amp; now recall them; may do well to consider that Gospel-Text, Gal. 2.18. <hi>If I build again the thing I destroyed, I make my self a Transgressor, even against this very Law,</hi> as well as the law of God, and other laws of the Land.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. If they are not so much as a Commons House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much less then are they the lawfull Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in anie sense within the letter or meaning of this Act, no more than so manie of the old Gunpowder Popish-Traitors, (had their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son taken so good effect in blowing up King <hi>Iames,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> whole House, and majoritie of the Commons House there assembled, as their late new Powder-plot hath done) had been the onlie law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Parliament of 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> they destroyed, in case they had entred then into the Commons House with the Mace before them, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, stiled themselves alone the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as a right devolved unto them by Conquest or Succession; which had they presumed to do, no doubt the whole English Nation <note n="*" place="margin">2 Kin. 21.23, 24, c. 14.5.6, 1 1 King. 16.16 to 21.</note>would have risen up against them as one man, and never have so far dishonored themselves, their Religion, or Countrie, as to own and submit to those Jesuitical Romish-Traitors, only for destroying of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>King,</hi> Lords House, and English Parliament it self, as the onlie true old English Parliament then <hi>re-assembled.</hi> The Reasons are unanswerable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the whole House of Commons then sitting in its primitive splendor, fullnesse, freedome, was by its own quadruple acknowledgement in it, no more but the <hi>Commons House,</hi> and one Member of this Parliament, not the Parliament it self; never own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61236:20"/>
but professedlie disclaiming it self to be the Parliament, or present Parliament within this Act. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Because this Act was made not by the Commons alone without the King or Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, but by the King as their Soveraign Lord, declaring and enacting, and the Lords and Commons, as jointlie assenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Because it is most absurd to conceive, that the King and Lords by passing this Act, to continue this Parliament as then constituted, till dissolved by Act of Parliament, did <note n="*" place="margin">See Exact Col. p. 135, 148, 317 to 314.</note> ever intend to seclude themselves quite out of it, or to make the Commons House alone an absolute independent Parliament, without both or either of them; though five times speciallie providing by name for their Parliamentarie interests; Or that they or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons intended to make each of themselves a distinct Parliament without the other, and so to erect three New Parliaments at once, by providing against the untimelie proroguing, adjourning, or dissolving of one; The King and Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> both jointlie and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie having the self-same Arguments from this Act to prove each of them a several or joint Parliament without the Commons, by the Commons own intention in passing this law, as the Commons have to justifie themselves to be a Parliament, now they have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and engaged against them both, and will admit of neither as Members of their Parliament, when as this verie Act preciselie prohibits the King to dissolve, prorogue, or adjourn the Parliament, or either House therof; or the Lords to prorogue or adjourn, much less dissolve the Commons House, or the Commons to prorogue or adjourn, much lesse dissolve the Lords House, declaring and enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That at any time or times during the continuance of this Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> House shall not be adjourned (nor yet the Commons House) but onlie by their own respective Orders, and <hi>by themselves alone,</hi> declaring, enacting everie thing and things whatsoever done, <hi>or to be done</hi> to the contrarie, <hi>to be utterly void and of none effect,</hi> 4<hi>ly.</hi> Because this Act both in the Title, prologue and <hi>body,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents onlie the <hi>untimely proroguing, adjourning, and dissolving of this present Parliament at any time or times during the continuance of it, but by Act of Parliament or themselves,</hi> stiling it 8. several times, <hi>this present Parliament,</hi> and giving it no other Title, yea it preciselie describes it to be, a <hi>Parliament onlie of King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> as it was when this Act was made, and so to continue till its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. But the Parliament now sitting, was not <hi>this present Parliament,</hi> being not then known, heard of, nor imagined ever to start up in After-ages, by any who made or consented to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61236:21"/>
this Law, it being created onlie by the Armie 7 years after this Act, and now revived full 18 years after it, without anie King or House of Lords, and protesting, engaging against them both as no Members of it. Neither can they pursue any one of those ends for which this Parliament was continued. Therefore they are doubtlesse beyond dispute, no Parliament at all within the words or intention thereof, their own Consciences, Reason being Judges, (whatever they pretend) nor yet by their own Republican principles, <hi>a free and equal Representative of the people.</hi>

            <p>Many of you (especially <hi>Millinaries,</hi> and <hi>Fifth Monarchy-men,</hi>) pretend, that Jesus Christ is now comming to reign personally <hi>on Earth a thousand years,</hi> and that you shall all reign together, as <hi>Ioynt-Kings</hi> with, or <hi>Vice-royes</hi> under him. But the setting up of a New <hi>Republick</hi> and <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> is wholly inconsistent with this Kingdom and Monarchy of Christ you now expect; which suites only with a Temporal King and Kingdom. How this Opinion will accord with Christs own description of it, John 18. 16. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> or <hi>Pauls,</hi> Rom. 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</hi> (nor yet Arms and Armies,) <hi>but Righteousnesse and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> (which Souldiers, Armies usually destroy, not produce, or propagate) let those who maintain it, consider. When Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> was kept close Prisoner in <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle by <hi>Iohn Bradshaws</hi> and our New <hi>Republicans illegal warrant</hi> in July, 1651. some four dayes after his imprisonment there, divers Officers and Souldiers of the Garrison, who had long debated every day for sundry Months before, their <hi>present expected personal reign of Christ on Earth,</hi> repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, to know his Opinion concerning it, as he was taking fresh Air in the Bowling-Alley, standing in a ring about him: Upon which he first demanded their Opinions of it: when they had all fully uttered their Conceits in the Affirmative with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; M. <hi>Pryn</hi> briefly answered, <hi>That now they had beheaded one of our Kings, and almost conquered another, and our</hi> 3. <hi>Kingdoms, they thought, talked of nothing but being all Kings themselves, and of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing personally on Earth cheek by joll with Christ himself, as his Fellow-Kings, no Earthly King being fit to be a Companion for such transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sublimated Saints as they thought themselves. But they were all most grosly mistaken: for that very</hi> Text <hi>of</hi> Rev. 20.4, 5. (which he read out of one of their Bibles) whereon they principally grounded their Opinions and Reign, <hi>was pointblank against them.</hi> And I saw the Souls OF THEM THAT WERE BEHEADED, (not of them who took off their own Christian Protestant Kings and Nobles Heads) <hi>for the Witnesse of Iesus, and the word of God, and which had not worshipped the Beast, nor his Image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, nor in their hands, and they

lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years</hi>: (is it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Earth, and Chap. 22.5. rather proves their reign to be in the New <hi>Ierusalem in Heaven.</hi>) <hi>But the rest of the dead,</hi> (who were not thus beheaded) <hi>lived not again,</hi>) (much lesse then reigned with Christ,) <hi>till the thousand years were past. By which it is most apparent, That if Christ shall reign personally on Earth for a thousand years, as they all conceived, and that this time was now at hand: yet not one of them should, or possibly could reign with him, if this Text be Vmpire:</hi> For the words are most positive, that none else shall thus reign with <hi>Iesus Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing expresly averred in the affirmative; then in the Negative, <hi>But the rest of the Dead lived not till the thousand years were past.</hi> Upon which account, the late King, and other Protestants whose Heads they had cut off, and those Godly Christians they had slain, murdered in the Wars; and perchance himself and others who had lost their Ears, Liberties, Estates, and were shut up close Prisoners, for <hi>the Testimony of Iesus Christ, and had not worshipped, but opposed the Beast of</hi> Rome, <hi>his Image, Superstitions, innovations, Proceedings against the late King, Parliament, Religion, nor received the mark of the Beast in their Foreheads or hands, might peradventure reign with Christ a thousand years.</hi> But as for themselves and other Army Saints, who made it their businesse, and reputed it their honour, Saintship, to cut off the Heads of their own Christian Kings, Nobles, Brethren; to destroy Kingdoms, Parliaments, &amp; their Privileges; secure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, close imprison their Members, worshipping the very beast and his Image, and visibly receiving his mark in their Foreheads, hands, by these their Jesuitical practises; keeping up an Army and Iron-Sword still drawn amongst us, to the great oppressing, undoing of their Native Country, of purpose to keep off <hi>the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Crosse of Iesus Christ, which he</hi>

               <hi>expresly enjoyned them with self-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits to take up daily, and follow him,</hi> and that other Crosse, their own Consciences tell them, these perfideous, treacherous practises of theirs justly demerit, they could have no ground at all from this or anie other Text to reign with Christ <hi>in his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly or earthly Kingdom,</hi> out of which these their <hi>seditious, unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and bloody practises did eternally exclude them,</hi> as the 10, 14, 15. <hi>verses</hi> of this very Chapter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11, 15. 1 Cor. 6.8, 9, 10. Gal. 5.20, 21. resolve. Therefore if ever they <hi>desired or expected thus to reign with Christ, they must all presently repent of these their former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61236:41"/>
put off their Swords from their sides, take up Christs daily crosse, lay down their own heads upon the Block, and then willingly chearfully lose them, not for their Treasons and Rebellions, but for the Testimony of Iesus Christ, and the word of God, and opposition of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treasonable Plots of the Beast of</hi> Rome; <hi>then they might expect to reign with him, otherwise they had no hopes by the resolution of this Text,</hi> and that parallel'd place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11.12. which excellently explains it; <hi>If we be dead with Christ, we shall also live with him; If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: If we deny by him</hi> (by refusing to suffer with or for him) <hi>he will also deny us.</hi> With which words these formerly confident Swordmen were so non-plussed, that they had not one word to reply, and gave over all future discourses of this subject ever since, being as unwilling to lose their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay or Heads for the testimony of Christ, as the <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 19.21, 22.</note> young man in the Gospel was, <hi>To sell all he had and give it the poor, to gain eternal life and Treasures in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, consider, That as it is the highest <hi>glory, excellency</hi> of God himself, the greatest <hi>comfort, felicity, security of his</hi> Church, Saints, <hi>that he is the living God stedfast for ever,</hi> Dan. 6.26. <hi>That he is the Lord and changeth not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>That with him is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or shadow of change,</hi> James 1.17. <hi>That he is the same immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table God for ever, from everlasting to everlasting: That his Counsels, thoughts of heart, purposes, truth, faithfulnesse, commands, loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Covenant, stand fast, firm, unalterable to all generations, for ever and ever,</hi> Psal. 33 11. Psalm 90.1, 2. Psalm 100.5. Psal. 02.16, 17. Lam. 5.19. Hebr. 8.13. Psal. 110.4. So it is the most transcendent Honour, Dignity, Glory of God the Fathers, and Jesus Christs <hi>Kingship, Kingdom,</hi> and the chief consolation, exultation, Beatitude of their Subjects and chosen Saints; <hi>That the Lord is, and fitteth King for ever; That he is an everlasting King, which reigns and shall reign for ever and ever; that his Kingdom, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Throne, are all everlasting, established, and enduring for evermore, for ever and ever, throughout all Generations; that they cannot be moved, and shall have no end,</hi> Psalm 10.16.
