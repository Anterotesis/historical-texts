         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALthough now a dayes it be little better than paper caſt away, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the Reader in the entrance of a Book, though with never ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
an eloquence; ſince men will not ſo loſe the pleaſure and Venerie
of envious Cenſure, but haſtily run on to banquet their gall with thoſe
faults which they will either find or make: And although (as one ſayes
well) a man had better never write than give an account to everie one of
that hee has written: Nevertheleſſe, I am determined not to give eare to
ſuch a cowardly wiſdome, leſt I incur a double imputation; either as not
daring to meet with the Detractour, or not caring to ſalute the Ingenious.
There are ſome, I make no doubt (though in other matters ſufficiently
knowing, yet ignorant in this) who doe and will diſlike the thing it ſelfe,
nay the verie name of Vaulting, as accounting it an unneceſſarie and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
exerciſe, a device to breake ones neck, or limbs, or the like: but
ſuch when they know more, will anſwer themſelves; in the meane time,
their ignorance is a ſufficient puniſhment. Another ſort there are, who are
content to allow the thing, but will by no meanes have it an Art, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the child of an accidentall and undigeſted experience, receiving the
degrees of its excellencie, from blind cuſtome only and difference of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
It were too long to confute theſe by reaſon, and likewiſe unneceſſary
in this place, ſeeing I have amply ſhewne it in the following leaves. A third
ſort there are, who grant it to be an Art, and this Art extraordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
in the practice; but they will ſay it is not ſo accurately handled, nor
in ſo exact a method as it deſerves. To ſuch, ſince it concernes my ſelfe, I
<pb facs="tcp:100116:4"/>
ingenuouſly confeſſe, I have done in it what I was able; nor am I ſuch an enemy
to the common good, as to envie, or not rather calmly to ſuffer my
ſelfe to be caſt out before him, that can and will performe it better. Yet let
me comfort my ſelfe with this truth, that all Arts, if they bee ſo handled
that they may teach, will not admit of that elegancie of word and phraſe,
which though they becommingly dreſſe, yet they dazle the eye of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
A fourth ſort there are yet behind, who I know will wonder, whence
I amongſt all the excellent Profeſſours of this Art, both Engliſh and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,
ſhould have the confidence to enter upon this Tract, which had been
worthy of the beſt of them; and firſt of any (I thinke I may ſafely ſay ſo)
dare expoſe my ſelfe under this title to the Preſſe and publike view. This
indeed comes neereſt me of any; but I ſhall anſwer (and as I thinke, beſide
their expectation) that what they account in me a fault, and a malapert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
I eſteeme as my greateſt happineſſe; nor would I change the
glorie of being the firſt that have written, with that of having written:
Since in all mens opinions, the firſt Founders of all Arts and Sciences, have
beene as honourable as thoſe that have built upon their foundations to the
faireſt height: but enough of this, leſt I ſeeme to hug my good fortune e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to oſtentation, which might have beene anothers, and perhaps more fit
for ſuch a burthen, and far more better deſerving the honour of preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Yet, Reader, this I will ſay, if happily it may adde any value to mee or
this my work: although I had rather my work ſhould praiſe both it ſelfe
and me: Thou haſt the fruit and obſervations of almoſt thirtie yeares, and
Rules confirmed by daily practice during ſo long a time: if this may adde
<pb facs="tcp:100116:4"/>
any thing to the eſteeme of my labours, ſo be it: For the reſt, examine the
whole piece, and thou ſhalt find Reaſon embracing Experience thorowout:
and among reaſonable men then, how can it miſſe of its ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good, and a juſt acceptance? Nor need the Practitioner complaine of
obſcuritie, as in many other, who doe ſo interlard their writings with the
knottie tearmes of Art, that they may bee ſaid both to teach and not to
teach. I have labour'd to avoyd that vice, as having ſeene the uglineſſe of
it in them. Beſides the plainneſſe of the phraſe too, wherein everie Paſſe is
dreſt, I have added to each a lively and beautifull Cut; that ſo what is but
dead as it were in words, may be there ſeene in motion and to the life, the
rule and the example mutually illuſtrating one another. What is elſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>AS in the greater world there is no one qualitie more noble and neceſſarie
than motion and activitie, it being that whereby Aire excelleth the Earth,
and Water and Fire the Aire, and the Heavens the Fire; and that whereby all
theſe doe preſerve themſelves, and thoſe creatures they containe: So neither in
the little world, Man, whether in reſpect of the Soule, as being moſt neerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
to the nature thereof, it being in it ſelfe a perpetuall Motion, as alſo the
fountaine of all Activitie; or in reſpect of the body, as being that only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are knowne to live, and which chiefly diſtinguiſheth that Earth wee are
made of, from the reſidue we tread on. Now although it be impoſsible for a
man to attaine to that height of agility which is found in thoſe greater bodies, it
will be ſufficient nevertheleſſe, if Art conſpiring with an able Conſtitution, may
and hath rendred men equall to the moſt active of the beaſts. This no doubt will
ſeeme a paradox to ſome, that are enamoured of the admirable ſpeed of a Hart,
or Horſe, or the nimbleneſſe of a Cat, or have ſeene the Apes: but let ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the wonderfull frame of a mans body, how it is the patterne (as it were)
whereby both the world and all other creatures were made; how in his thighs
the Horſe, in his heart the Lion, in his hands the Ape, in his back the Elephant
are (as it were) ſtored up, all making one, by ſo much more mightie than they
all, by how much he is but one: and they ſhall find that Nature is not wanting
to man, but man to himſelfe, and that it is not lack of abilitie, but lack of uſe,
that has ſhrunk mens ſinews, and enfeebled them, even to the contempt of beaſts.
<pb facs="tcp:100116:5"/>
Is it not a ſhame then, that men ſhould ſo forget that they live, and out of a baſe love
of idleneſſe, ſuffer their bones to gather ruſt, as it were, and the gout lockup
their joynts; chuſing rather a chaire than legs of their owne, and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
trouble and torment of Phyſick, than to need none: a man may not unfitly
think, they practiſe to lye ſtill all their life time, leſt their grave being not uſed
to it, ſhould be too troubleſome. Certainly, a ſhame it is in any, but eſpecially in
a Gentleman, as in a Gentleman likewiſe the contrary love of ingenious exerciſe
is moſt praiſe-worthy: conſidering the meaner ſort of people are called to it by
their neceſſities, when as the Gentleman is, or ſhould be ſtirred up to it by the
deſire he has to doe his Countrey good, and to heap honours on his name by his
brave and heroick actions: which how can hee, when by a degenerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
life, his body becomes utterly unſerviceable, and his ſoule, when ſhe would
ſhe w her ſelfe in action is in fetters, and ſet as they doe Horſes in their triall, to
draw at a tree. Well then doe thoſe, and worthy are they of their Anceſtours, as
of the hearts and eyes of all men, who loathing the lazie and unmanly life, doe ſo
accuſtome themſelves by dayly uſe to exerciſes of all ſorts, that they may bee no
flower in their actions, than their intentions, and have bodies like the ſoules of
the other. Equally blameable with thoſe ſons of idleneſſe are thoſe, who out of a
having and parſimonious diſpoſition, will not goe to the price of Art, Art that
it as it were another creation, and gives thoſe helps which Nature never meant,
nor hop'd, which muſt alwayes ſiſter Vſe, and be in joynt commiſſion with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie,
or a man can never arrive at that excellencie and height, in this kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which he is capable of: And this I ſpeake as well in generall, in reſpect of all
bodily exerciſes; ſince there it not one of them (though meere ſtrength and Vſe
<pb facs="tcp:100116:6"/>
may performe things indifferently admirable) but muſt expect their finiſhings,
and perfection from the hand of Art: as alſo more eſpecially, in reſpect of the
Art of Vaulting (the Subject of this preſent Treatiſe) as being as excellent and
amiable as any of her ſiſters, if not more, and partaking in as high a degree of
the favours of Art, and the advantageous helps of maſterie and skill, as thoſe
that have their title <hi>Sub privilegio,</hi> and happily have gained the more early ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the world: Not that I doe herein chalenge the Science of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or by compariſon provoke to the combat; ſince I know ſhe is as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
arm'd as able to defend her ſelfe; but as conſidering they are ſiſters, and
therefore in hope they will without grudging endure each others praiſes; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that I would hereby detract from the facultie of Dancing, for what were
it but for one hand to wound the other, ſince I profeſſe both. No rather, let the
ingenious that deſire to be acquainted with this Art, ſuſpend their judgements
till by ſome triall they find it, though boldly, yet deſervedly praiſed: in the mean
time I ſhall have my ends, if what I have ſaid may provoke men only to the love
of it, and excite in the gentle breſt a deſire to ſee what he has read, not doubting
then but the ſucceſſe will warrant my confidence, and that the Art will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it ſelfe to the ſhame of words. Nevertheleſſe, I muſt not omit thoſe parts
of its praiſes, which are yet behind, leſt I betray the former, and if any thing can
raiſe it to an equall glorie with its fellowes, what more authentically than its
antiquitie; example in any thing being that which moſt readily procures mens
aſſent to it, and the more ancient the example, the more aſſuredly ready the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
There might be much probably alleaged to this purpoſe, but let this one ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for all; it is <hi>Homers,</hi> the ancienteſt of the Greeke Poets, when deſcribing
<pb facs="tcp:100116:6"/>
               <hi>Ajax</hi> leaping from the beake of one ſhip to another, he uſeth this Simile:<note place="margin">Iliad. 15.</note>
               <q>
                  <l>As when a man well knowing how to uſe</l>
                  <l>The vaulting Horſe, of many a Steed doth chuſe</l>
                  <l>Foure from the field, and to the Citie drives,</l>
                  <l>Whilſt many a man and woman, thronging ſtrives</l>

               </q>
Certainly a moſt ancient and infallible teſtimony. To its antiquite we may
adde its uſe, which daily experience has found to be manifold, both in peace
and war, for need and pleaſure. In war, the nimble avoydance of a mans horſe,
if wounded or killed under him, and in like manner the ready aſcent into his
enemies ſaddle, if it be his hap to unhorſe him, and much more, which the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Souldier ſhall find: In peace, a thouſand graces to horſe-manſhip, ſervices
to Ladies, and other courtly feats depend on it, beſides infinite that practiſe will
meet with, which cannot now be thought on. One thing more, the generally
embraced eſteeme and communitie thereof, it has been loved even of Princes,
and now is: Doe not thou then (gentle Reader) diſtaſte, or neglect an Art ſo
honoured by its Fautors, ſo anciently worthy, and ſo generally neceſſarie; but
give it entertainment and love, which is that I have endeavoured according to
my abilitie to perſwade, and then I ſhall thinke thou wanteſt nothing but a
Teacher, and not repent that I have made thoſe things publike, which were the
peculiar rights of a private Schoole: And ſo let us deſcend to the practice.</p>

               <p>BEing thus prepared, the firſt Paſſe brings you into the ſaddle, and is thus
performed: by raiſing of your right arme, and extending your right
leg, provoke your ſelfe to the ſpring, then at once ſink your body, clap both
feet to the ground, move your right hand back, and ſpring, clapping your
right hand on the hinder pummell, and withall nimbly ſhifting it from
thence to the fore pummell, equally poyze your body on the ſtrength of
your armes with a ſtraight leg, and you ſhall gracefully ſink into the ſaddle,
then when you have occaſion to alight, clap both hands on the fore pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,
raiſing your body to the ſtrength of your armes, and reverſe your right
leg over the hind pummell, keeping it ſtraight as before, and bowing when
you touch the ground: the one will make your deſcent ſightly, the other
eaſie. If you chance to make uſe of the common riding or hunting ſaddle,
holding your left hand as before on the pummell, clap your right hand in
the middle of the ſaddle, ſo raiſing your body, remove not your hand, till
you are in the ſeat.</p>

ſhift your left hand which you firſt placed on the head of the Horſe, to

pummell, advance your body thereon; and being thus elevated, let goe
your right hand, which you may ſafely doe, for the ſpring of your arme in
the going off, will ſend you with much eaſe to the ground.</p>
               <p>Another way there is to vault over the neck of the Horſe, which is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

your time, riſe; and whereas in the former the right led the way, now
let the left, ſo doing you muſt needs force off your right arme on the fore
pummell: but be carefull you quickly clap him in his place againe, for you
will need the help of both hands to carrie off your body, in your deſcent
bearing your back toward the head of the Horſe.</p>

difficult, by reaſon your hands muſt be conveyed three times from pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
to pummell, before you can bring your body off round: but to the
purpoſe. Place your ſelfe on the neere ſide of the Horſe, laying your left
hand on the fore pummell, then ſpring, and faſten on the hind pummell
with your right hand, carrying your right thigh over that arme, that on it
the body being equally poyzed, may reſt till you can remove the left hand
to the hinder pummell: for the right hand muſt fly off in the ſame time
that the left hand comes, carrying both your legs over the fore pummell,
the left leading the way, and ſo as ſoone as your body is come round on the
neere ſide againe, clap the right hand behind you on the fore pummell, ſo
bearing of your body with your face towards the head of the Horſe.</p>

pleaſe to deſcend, clap downe your left hand againe on the fore pummell,
and wheele your body off with both legs ſtraight over the head of the

of the firſt Horſe, then taking your time, making no more motions than
two, as is before preſcribed: for in making more, you ſhall over-ſtand your
ſpring, and tire your arme with expectation of its burthen; as likewiſe if
you make leſſe than two, you cannot ſufficiently ſtir up your ſpirits, nor
winde up your ſinews to their full bent: this obſerved, mount your right
leg leading the way, as well in your riſe as in your fall, and clapping your
right hand to your beſt advantage on the hinde pummell of the firſt Horſe,
riſe to the ſtrength of your armes, and throw your ſelfe off as high and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
as you can, and in your paſſage clap both your hands on the fartheſt
Horſe, ſo deliver your body to the ground.</p>

in the very heat of the motion, clap your left hand ſtrongly ſtretched out

face towards the wall, and the right leg foremoſt, making uſe of your right hand in
your paſſage to haſten the motion, and to force your body the more ſwiftly round,
neither taking your left hand from the wall (which is, as it were, the center and
ſupporter in all Pomado's) till you feele it diſcharg'd of its burthen, and your ſelfe
on the ground with both legs together, and in every reſpect poſtured as when you

            <p>ANd theſe are the chiefe, if not all that can be done from the ground, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the Horſe, or otherwiſe, which I have handled plainly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically:
the one being a degree to the other thorowout, that ſo as the
Learner increaſeth in ſtrength and agilitie, hee may ſtill have difficulties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to that ſtrength, and like <hi>Hercules</hi> be ſtill oppoſed by ſucceeding
monſters, the following alwayes more ſeemingly invincible than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
Tis true, there are many gracefull paſſages on the Horſe, which never
take their riſe from the ground, as manifold in their varietie, as in number:
but I chuſe rather to confine my ſelfe within this compaſſe, as knowing
theſe as they are more principally uſefull, ſo they doe far more beſeeme a
man: Nevertheleſſe, if theſe my firſt fruits ſhall be favourably eſteemed of,
and paſſe the publike without wounds, I ſhall be encouraged at ſome other
fit opportunitie to enlarge it with thoſe, though not ſo ſubſtantiall parts,
yet ornaments of the Art, and publiſh whatſoever can be ſaid, or done
in this kind.</p>
