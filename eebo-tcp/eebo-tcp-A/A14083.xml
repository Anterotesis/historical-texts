            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But alas! it is the nature of ſicke and crazie appetites, to thinke the meate which is ſet before them, is vnſauourie, when indeede the fault proceedeth not, but from a meere diſtemperature in their owne palates.

               <p>THere is no greater argument of a generous minde, then to ioy in whatſoeuer it ſeeth generous in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Owle and the Bat, though they haue eyes to diſcerne there is a ſunne, yet haue ſo euill eyes, that they cannot delight in the ſunne: it is for Eagles onely, and ſuch kingly birds, as haue had no other Aerie for their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19365:10"/>
breeding, than the lappe of loue, to gaſe with pleaſure &amp; admiration on his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The meaner ſort of people, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are oppreſſed &amp; aggraued with ſuch groſſer humours, as the channels of their bloud are vſually dammed vp with; dare not but with cowardly feare approach the pallaces of Princes: it is honour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for them, they thinke, if they may be ſuffered to obſerue the frontiſpice, or at the moſt to take a view of ſuch inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our offices, as are in them. Their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of a ſhorter wing, then to aſpire ſo high as to looke into a roome of ſtate; yet euen theſe, if in theſe meaner parts their duller obſeruation find any thing, which holdes not correſpondency with their conceit, will not ſticke at their departure for a little errour to diſcommend the workmanſhip of the whole frame. They which out of a cynicall diſpoſition doe wound the reputation of Women with inuectiues, are men of no better garbe. The graces haue found no ſweeter habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vpon earth to reſt in, then their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19365:10"/>
boſomes. Our Sauiour did not ſcorne when hee came downe from heauen to make the wombe of a Virgin, the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of his glory. Whereupon <hi>Saint Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> tranſported with a diuiner ecſtacie, crieth out, <hi>O venter capacior coelis, diffuſior terris; latior elementis; qui illum continere valuit, quem totus mundus capere non potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.</hi> O bleſſed wombe, wider then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, broader then the earth, larger then then the elements; which was able to containe him, whom the whole world was too little to receiue. And to ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where could vertue in the pourpris of this vniuerſe, haue picked out a fairer manſion? It ſeemes to me that Women were erected of purpoſe for her to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne in; and that, by the hand of God himſelfe, who built her, built her I ſay, (for this is the proper word, by which the mouth of wiſedome in the originall expreſſeth hir creation) to ſhew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of his skill, in the cloſing vp of his worke. But <hi>Calumnie</hi> ſuggeſteth here, that ſhe was built indeede, but the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19365:11"/>
foundation was a crooked rib.
<q>
                     <l>Inde genus curuum, placidae virtutis inane.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And from hence a crookedneſſe both in manners and behauiour hath euer ſince deſcended by way of propagation, from hir to hir poſteritie; which I will no otherwiſe confute, than by condemning ſuch of ignorance, as haue beene authors of this improper ſpeech: Art would haue termed it an Arch, which of all kindes of Architecture is both the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt, and the faireſt. But this is not the period of their traducements: they will ſeeme to tax the Artiſan himſelfe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and miſtaking. He made hir for a helpe, ſay they, to Man, when ſhe fell out to be nothing leſſe; as if that patron of all exemplary goodneſſe had beene ill aduiſed in his ends. They conſider not the fault is in themſelues, if they proue contrary to his intention. Their owne peruerſenes is that, which maketh them ſuch as they report them. Let <hi>Phaebus</hi> haue the guiding of the day and ye ſhall ſee it cleare and lightſome, but if <hi>Phaethon</hi>

haue the mannaging of thoſe ſteedes, his preſumptuous ouer weening wil go neere to ſet all things in combuſtion. I but, ſay they, ſhe was according to that Spaniſh adage; <hi>Armas del Diablo: cabeza del Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado: deſtruycion del Parayſo;</hi> The ſword wherewith the diuell cut the throate of mans felicitie; ſhe was the head of ſinne, the ouerthrow of Paradiſe. But let them conſider the good they gained by this hir errour, and tranſgreſſion; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their foreheads bee of Adamant, they will recant thoſe blaſphemies and cry out with a better reformed zeale, <hi>O foelix culpa, quae talem, ac tantum meruit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptorem!

O needefull offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was not to be cancelled, but by the death of Chriſt. Then was it, and not till then, that the dores of thoſe euerlaſting taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles, in which the king of glory hath is reſidence, were opened vnto wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Man. He was driuen out of an earthly Paradiſe by one Angel, that he might be welcommed by Legions of them into a heauenly one, whereof that other was but a figure and a type. And this it may be, was the cauſe why God after the time of her fall, and not before, entitled hir <hi>Heuah,</hi> the mother of the liuing. I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many things, and not inſiſt vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long.</p>
               <p>Hir breſt is as a precious cabinet in which the choiſeſt of all Virtues are preſerued. Our Sauiour himſelfe could not but wonder at the faith which hee found in the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and forgot not in the height of his admiration to crown it with applauſe. Malice notwithſtanding would perſwade the world, that their outſide is a ſhop for vanitie; their inſide a ware-houſe for impietie; that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them is but peeuiſhneſſe; chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, waywardneſſe, and gratefulneſſe a miracle. In a word, that their boſomes are fuller of miſchiefes and diſaſters, than euer was <hi>Pandoras</hi> boxe: and that like the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19365:12"/>
Apothecaries painted pots, they may be faire without, yet full of poyſon within. And ſurely I muſt needes confeſſe, that there are ſome, on whom ſhe may iuſtly faſten theſe reproaches. For howſoeuer the matter be the ſame, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence notwithſtanding in the forme. The fineſt cloth hath a liſt, and the pureſt gold, is not without ſome droſſe. But let not preiudice, like one of <hi>Circes</hi> charmes worke ſuch a fearefull metamorphoſis vpon the mindes of men, as to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon brutiſh; iudgement and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, things of little ſenſe. Let them not ſhew themſelues, like bores, as ready to roote vp a bed of roſes, as a dunghill: but conſider that the earth hurteth not the ſunne, with thoſe miſtie vapours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, which ſhee breatheth forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but depriueth her ſelfe by them of that comfort, which the chearfulneſſe of his beames would otherwiſe afford hir.

               <p>The force thereof is ſuch, as hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the greateſt conquerours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their glory, and to caſt the trophies of their victories, as enſignes of their ſubiection at hir feete. <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who like another <hi>Atlas</hi> could carrie cities on his ſhoulders, and by the vigour of his arme which ſerued him as an armie, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and confound the batalions of his vncircumciſed enemies; did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this his more then naturall ſtrength, become an homager to hir. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> for all his wiſedome was made hir liegeman; and <hi>Dauid</hi> who in his youth had ouercome the Lion and the Beare, and did afterwards vanquiſh that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Philiſtim,</hi> the thunder of whoſe Threats proclaimed nothing but terrour and amaſement to the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> vpon the ſight of <hi>Berſhabe,</hi> &amp; that at a ſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was captiuated by hir comelineſſe.

               </argument>
               <p>IT is an iniurie to Virtue, to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alwaies cloſe-priſoner to the Heart. ſhe deſireth to looke out at the eyes, and to goe forth now and then in the words.

               <p>
                  <hi>Euill words are,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the very gangrenes of good manners;</hi> if they eate them not out, they will at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face them. If Women haue immodeſt lookes, it will auaile them little for auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the worlds cenſure, to haue honeſt hearts. A booke is cenſured many times, by what the title promiſeth; and Siluer,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19365:25"/>
into what faſhion ſoeuer wee melt it, though it ceaſe not to be ſiluer, yet the outward ſtampe is that which maketh it currant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Craſſus</hi> had a liking to a goodly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor belonging to a certaine Veſtal, which that he might the better purchaſe, hee tooke occaſion to meete with hir in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie places, &amp; at ſundrie times, omitting nothing in his carriage &amp; conuerſation, which might any way endere him to hir; but by this courteous entercourſe hir In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency grew to be ſuſpected, and in the end, (as Malice is euer ready to picke a hole in Virtues coat) ſhee was publikely accuſed, to haue inceſtuouſly conuerſed with him. <hi>Poſtumia</hi> was a little too much in clinde to laughter, and now and than delighted freely to diſcourſe with Men, but this hir freedome brought hir to bee arraignd as an Adultereſſe, wherof when ſhee had throughly acquited hir ſelfe. <hi>Spur. Minutius,</hi> the high Prieſt abſolued hir, but withall aduiſed hir, <hi>ne verbis vitae caſtimoniam non aquantibus vteretur,</hi> ſo to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19365:26"/>
order hir life thence forward, that the outward faſhion might not preiudice the inward forme.</p>
               <p>Forbearance of the Action is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent demonſtration of a chaſt Deuotion. T'is from the ſetled diſpoſition of the Will, that this purer Virtue doth receiue hir forme.

               <p>Some could be content to haue it, but they would not bee thought to deſire it. They wiſh another would foile them, when of themſelues they haue a will to fall. Such as are truely modeſt, and ſuch aſſuredly are the moſt, will not ſticke to make their liues the ranſome of their Fame: for feare, though they conſented not to the doing, they might be thought
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19365:26"/>
to bee well enough contented with the deede.</p>

                  <hi>Theoxena</hi> to free hir Siſters children and hir owne from the laſciuious embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of King <hi>Phillip,</hi> put weapons into their weaker hands, and perſwaded them <hi>Vt imminens ludibrium morte effugerent;</hi> to reſcue themſelues by Death from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſgrace, where in ſhe had no ſooner preuailed, but with a heroine reſolution ſhe ſhewed them by hir owne example, that what ſhee had taught them, was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be done.</p>

                  <hi>Hippo</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> when the Shippe in which ſhee trauailed was taken by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, caſt hirſelfe immediately into the ſoft embraces of the ſea, to free hir Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the luxurious courtſhip of hir Foe.

This done, ſhe cauſed his head to be cut off, and bringing it home in hir own lap, caſt it for a preſent at hir husbands feete who vented the paſſions, which the ſight thereof had ſtirred vp in his boſome, with words which ſauoured ſomewhat of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe: <hi>O Woman, faith is an excellent thing:</hi> But ſhe confronted his pitie with hir own puritie, and told him, <hi>It was more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by farre, there was but one man liuing, that euer knew hir.</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19365:27"/>
hauing caſt them on the ground before him, bad him glut himſelfe with thoſe traiterous obiects, which had conſpired with his luſtfull Thoughts, to make hir a prey to Infamie.

               <p>The <hi>Mileſian</hi> Virgins, whether through the diſtemperature of the aire, or vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion of diſcontent, I know not, were on the ſudden poſſeſſed with ſuch a furie, that neither the prayers of their friends, nor the teares of their Parents, could diuert them from an obſtinate and ſelfe-wild reſolution, which they had to hang themſelues, and many notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the warineſſe of their Keepers, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19365:28"/>
the terrour and amaſement of the whole Citie, did continually by ſubtile ſlights and deuiſes, giue theſe their tragicall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes their determinate effect; till at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth one of the wiſeſt Senators cauſed a Law to bee proclaimed, <hi>That whoſoeuer in that manner did abridge hir daies, ſhould after hir death be carried naked through the market-place:</hi> the conſideration of which diſhonor, ſuch was their ſetled Modeſty, did not onely reſtraine them, but free them from this frenzie. <hi>Shamefac'tneſſe,</hi> is nothing elſe, ſaith the Philoſopher, but a feare of Ignominie and iuſt Reproach. Theſe Virgins were ſo ſenſible thereof, that to remoue it euen from their Aſhes, they were content to forbeare that which they moſt deſired.</p>
               <p>I could muſter vp an armie royall of thoſe heroicall examples, to deſtroy thoſe Monſters, which make the Virgin fame of Women their tributarie foode. But who ſeeth not, that euen the moſt of thoſe few, which are Actors of vnciuill parts, can produce Men for their Authors. Such
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19365:29"/>
a one who preferred hir Honor before hir Life, hath notwithſtanding for hir ſafetie of hir Husband ſuffered it like litter to be trampled on by the Luſt of a deadly Enemie, and done that for him, which ſhe would by no meanes haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for hir ſelfe. There are of thoſe, who for their Husbands profit and aduantage doe lend their bodies out, and that by their expreſſe appointment and entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Phaulius</hi> the Argien offered his wife vnto King <hi>Philippe</hi> through ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as <hi>Galba</hi> did out of curteſie and ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; when hauing feaſted <hi>Mecaenas</hi> at a Supper, and finding that his wife and he beganne with ſignes and glances to plot a further matter, that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhoulder vp their loue, hee feigned a heauie ſleepe, which he auouched with no little grace. For vpon the inſtant a fellow being emboldned thereby to caſt a theeuiſh hand vpon his Cup-borde of Plate, he cried out vnto him freely. <hi>Stay, ſtay, thou knaue, ſeeſt thou not, that I ſleepe for none, but for Maecoenas?</hi>

               <p>Some Husbands haue ſuch curious eyes, that if their wiues want colour of their owne: they muſt ſeeke for a ſupply.

that their daughters ſhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any kinde of literature at all.

               <p>To conuerſe with the dead, and this is to conuerſe with Bookes, hath bin ſtill accounted the readieſt way to moraliſe our harſher natures, and to weane them from all inbred Barbariſme to more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and ciuill conuerſation.

As if they ſhould conforme themſelues to mens weakeneſſes, and patterne out their owne Abilities by their Defects. He that is depriued of his bodily ſight, is content to bee led, though by a childe: and ſhall hee, that is blinde in his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding diſdaine to be directed by her, who by the ordinance of God, and the rules of ſacred Wedlocke, is alotted him a fellow-helper in all his buſineſſes? The Husband and the Wife are the eyes of a Familie; if the right one bee ſo bleared, that it cannot well diſcerne; the guiding of the Houſhold muſt of neceſſity be left vnto the left, or on the ſudden all will go to wracke. And ſurely I ſee no reaſon but the Henne may bee permitted to crowe, where the Cocke can doe nothing but cackle. So that learning, we ſee, is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, and a decencie, moſt expedient for Women, were it for no other reſpect, then to ſupply, as occaſion may require, the defects that are in Men. And truely ſome of them, by ſeconding a naturall propenſion in themſelues to letters, with

an induſtrious purſuit, haue attained to ſo high a perfection in them, that men conſidering how imperiouſly they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a preheminence ouer them herein, haue had iuſt cauſe to bluſh at their own ignorance. There are ſome, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity obiecteth to our view, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rare and profitable inuentions made them deſerue the names of Goddeſſes heere on earth, as <hi>Pallas, Ceres,</hi> and the <hi>Sybills,</hi> whoſe mouth it pleaſed God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to vſe as a ſacred Oracle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to publiſh vnto the world, what hee purpoſed in his will.

But all ages haue affoorded ſome, whoſe Spirits being of a ſtronger temper, and harder edge, then to turne at ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, haue trauailed beyond thoſe Herculean Pillers, and made manifeſt to the world, that the Braines of a Serpent haue beene lodged in the Head of a Doue. For proofe hereof let vs ſearch no farther into the boſome of Antiquitie, then thoſe times, in which the pride and glory of <hi>Italie,</hi> ſat chained, as a <hi>Trophie,</hi> on the victorious armes of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Gothes,</hi> and we ſhall finde, that there liued then amongſt them Queene <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſunta,</hi> who with ſuch wonderfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and moderation ſo managed their harſher mindes, that ſhe found not in them, all the while ſhe raigned, the leaſt rub or ſtoppe, which might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſmoother courſe of hir procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

                  </gap>; is a poſition out of check. The heart, that fainteth at the alarmes of an enemy, cannot poſſibly be recouered, vnleſſe it drinke the Spirit of his blood. To mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter any other <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> than this vnto it, is meere vanitie, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but a weak effect. This alone is that extracted Quinteſſence, which beyond all Chymicall inuentions, muſt free it from thoſe Paralyticall reſolutions, and Epileptike convulſions, whereinto, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very noiſe of his approach, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies apt to fall. The Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> in a dreame ſaw a Souldier, called <hi>Phocas,</hi> killing his Wife, his children, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelfe, with which Viſion being ſorely daunted, he enquired of his ſonne
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19365:60"/>
in law <hi>Philippicus</hi> if there were not ſuch a fellow in the Armie, who tould him, yes; and withal that he was a roaring youth, but yet a very Crauen; Whereupon the Emperour concluded with a troubled countenance, that if he were a Coward, he would ſure bee cruell. And indeede this argument may hold in men, in whom want of courage is occaſioned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome diminution, ablation, or deprauation of the animall, and vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; by reaſon whereof they neuer think themſelues ſecure, till their enemies death ſigne the <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> which muſt ſet them free from the dangerous purſuit of hazard and moleſtation: but in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it muſt faile, from the quickneſſe of whoſe apprehenſion, ariſeth many times a ſuddaine fright, which vpon a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of the obiect doth as ſuddainly vaniſh. And thus let mee ſee if the Soule of the wiſeſt &amp; the worthieſt man be able to reſiſt the firſt conceits and fantaſies that aſſaile him, and ſtarteth not as out of a natural ſubiection, with much
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19365:60"/>
paleneſſe and contraction at the noiſe of thunder, the vnexpected diſcharge of a Cannon, or the ſuddaine cracke of ſome great ruine. Sure it ſufficeth here, as in other Paſſions, that his opinion remaine ſafe &amp; ſound, that the ſetlednes of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vndergo no alteration or attaint, and that he giue not his conſent to his affright and ſufferance. I muſt confeſſe yet, there be many Vultures, Harpies, and helliſh Furies amongſt them, in whom as in <hi>Media,</hi> and the like, Paſſions are ſo predominant, that they make not a ſuperficiall impreſſion, but penetrate ſo farre into the ſeate of Reaſon as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, and corrupt it. But if things may be cenſured with indifferencie, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries will finde, that Crueltie euen in theſe, is not an imperfection of Nature, but a defect of breeding. <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Nurſe, while he was young would now &amp; then ſuckle him with the blood of Beaſts and foules, that were newly kild, which bred ſuch a habit in him, that being manlier growne, hee neuer returned from the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19365:61"/>
ſlaughter of his enemies, but hee licked his ſword: Which barbarous and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thirſt of his, was an occaſion that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miris</hi> hauing cut off his head, cauſed it to be caſt into a tub of mans blood, with this exprobration of his crueltie. <hi>Satia te ſanguine quem ſitiſti, cuiuſque infatiabilis ſemper fuiſti: Now glut thy ſelfe, inhumane Tyrant, with that, whereof heretofore, thou couldeſt neuer haue thy fill.</hi> The Plants of <hi>Eden,</hi> in the ſtate of innocencie, were apt, it ſeem'd, to riot in their growth; the walkes and allies thereof were likewiſe ſubiect to be quickly defaced, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with weedes, and therefore the Lord himſelfe tooke care that Man ſhould be put therein to keepe it, and to dreſſe it. And indeed it is the propertie of ſome vigorous and actiue Spirits, when they finde a vacation of good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, to make themſelues a Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of bad. The brighteſt ſword will quickly ruſt, if it be not vſed; The fatter the ſoile, the ſooner will the fielde be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne with nettles and briers, if it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19365:61"/>
lye long fallow. <hi>Neglect is vrenda filix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſcitur agris.</hi> Nature, if ſhe be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually lopt and prun'd, will ſuddainly grow debauched.

The like is likewiſe recorded of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> and diuers others. But I am led a little from my leuell. It appeareth out of all theſe premiſes, that to ſay Women becauſe they be fearefull muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be cruell, is a deceitfull concluſion; and that Crueltie, becauſe it is found in the vntutoured boſomes of ſome fewe amongſt them, muſt needs, like a beloued Gueſt, be inwardly harboured of them all, is a conſequence, as voide of Charity as the other was full of Sophiſtrie.

                  <hi>THucydides</hi> was of opinion that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and vertuous Woman ſhould as charily cloiſter vp hir Fame from the Eares of Men, as ſhe would hir Face from their Eyes. But <hi>Gorgias</hi> was of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde. For though he would not haue their Beauties ſeene; hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent their virtues might be knowne. And <hi>Plutarke</hi> much approueth thoſe Romane Lawes, which permitted Women as well, as Men, according to their deſart, and dignitie, to be publikely praiſed, at the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19365:70"/>
ſolemnizing of their Funerals. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirme, that nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth alwaies to produce that, which is moſt perfect, and therefore willingly would ſtill bring foorth the Male, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Females, it ſhould ſeeme, like thoſe, that are borne blinde and lame, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way defectiue, the prodigious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and miſtakings of hir operations: Howſoeuer likewiſe their aduerſaries would depriue them of that glorious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Gods diuinitie imprinted in the heart of Man at his creation; becauſe it is ſaid in the 1. <hi>Cor. 11. v. 7. That man is the Image, and glory of God; but Woman is the glory of the Man;</hi> And hereupon would conclude, that their whole Sex is but an ample demonſtration of natures Crazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their owne vnworthineſſe: <hi>Plato</hi> yet maintaines, that if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinction betwixt their ſufficiencie: and ours, it is not eſſentiall, but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, &amp; ſuch a one as is grounded meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon vſe. And therefore, ſaith hee, as both the Hands are by nature alike fit
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19365:70"/>
for all manner of actions, till applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and imployment bring in a difference of Right and Left. So Women and Men haue in them the ſame aptitude and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie for the well managing of ciuill and militarie places, and it is exerciſe alone, which begets dexteritie in the one and the other. Which example he drew peraduenture from the doctrine of the <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> who diuided all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>euill;</hi> and in the ranke of thoſe that were <hi>good,</hi> placed the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the Male, and that which was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and finite: in the ranke of thoſe that were <hi>euill;</hi> the Left-hand, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and that which was infinite. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this, his concluſion is, That as thoſe bodies are moſt perfect, and fitting for euery action, which can, if occaſion require, as well apply their left-hand to the buſineſſe, as their right: ſo is that Common-wealth the moſt abſolute which for good gouernment can make vſe of Women, as well as of Men.</p>
               <p>It is an <hi>Axiome</hi> in Schooles, whereof
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19365:71"/>
no <hi>quaere</hi> can be made, That <hi>Subſtantiae non recipiunt aut maius, aut minus.</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances admit not either more or leſſe: wherefore as one ſtone cannot be ſaid to be more a ſtone, then another, ſo farre as concerneth that eſſentiall forme, which giueth a being to them both: no more can one man be ſaid to be more perfectly Man then another. And ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Male ſhall not be thought more worthy then the Female, in regard of his eſſence, becauſe they be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended both vnder one kinde: but if in any thing he haue the ſtart, and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it is merely by accident, and no way elſe. As concerning that foreallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged poſition of <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> I confeſſe it is true, that nature in the production of things doth continually minde the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt; &amp; therefore intendeth the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth of Man in his kinde, but not Male more then Female. For if ſhe ſhould alwaies produce the Male, ſhee ſhould commit an extraordinary incongruitie; becauſe as from the bodie, and the ſoule, ariſeth a compound more noble, then his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19365:71"/>
parts, which is Man: ſo from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Male &amp; Female doth redound like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a compound, which is the onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of humane generation, without which the parts would ſoone decay. Male and Female therefore, are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alwaies together, neither can the one exiſt without the other. One Sex al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one is an argument of imperfection; and therefore the Heathens did attribute both of them to God. <hi>Orpheus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> that he was Male and Female. So that the graces and abilities which are in them, howſoeuer they may varie in ſome outward traces and lineaments, are in forme and ſubſtance the ſame with ours. Let vs conſider if the magnificencie of of <hi>Semiramis</hi> and that of <hi>Seſoſtris;</hi> the ſubtiltie of <hi>Tanaquil,</hi> and that of <hi>Seruius;</hi> the courage of <hi>Porcia,</hi> and that of <hi>Brutus;</hi> of <hi>Timoclea,</hi> and that of <hi>Pelopidas;</hi> doe not reſemble one the other very neerely.

The diuerſitie of the operation ariſeth onely from the varietie of the Organe. But ſelf-conceitedneſſe hath like a canker eaten into the hearts of Men, and poſſeſſed them with ſuch an admiration of their owne ſufficiencie, that they looke but with a ſcornefull eye vpon the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of others.
