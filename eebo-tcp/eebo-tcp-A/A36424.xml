         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

IAMES LVDFORD
OF
ANSELY, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' all my Services and Respects
necessarily devolve on you, as on
the Inheriter of your Brothers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
yet you may lay a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Claim to my Esteem and Observance,
from your own repeated Favours and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
In so much that I am bound by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tye of Gratitude, on all Occasions, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
my Resentments of them, and think
my self unworthy privately to enjoy the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
unless I declare to the World how
much I am Oblig'd to you. You must needs,
<pb facs="tcp:54814:3"/>
Sir, think me sincere in my Intentions,
when, upon making so small and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
a Payment, I am willing to call the
Publick to witness, I am infinitely still your
Debtor. I confess, the opportunity I have
had of improving my Talent by the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of your Brothers Tuition and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
might (you may justly think) have
inabled me to offer you an Original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a Translation, and the Transcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Character and Sense, might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have been expected than my Authors.
But for my Apology, I must plead my Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
in the loss of him, which yet
is no more peculiar to me than to the
whole Society of <hi>Magdalen-College,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was a Member. He is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
as a Person in whom the Scholar
and Gentleman were so well met, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them spoil'd the other: He was
Learn'd without Arrogance; Genteel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vanity; Witty without Affectation;
Well bred, Airy, Gay and Easy, yet never
relax'd his Mind so far as to abate in
any part of its real Improvement. And,
though to instance the Graces and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Endowments of his Body, would be
thought perhaps to derogate from those of
his Mind, and to make the Lustre of his
Vertues stand indebted to his Person, yet
I can not but think so curious an Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:54814:3"/>
was design'd to answer the Merit of
the Inhabitant, whose outward Structure
should represent the Quality of the Owner.
But I do not mean to inlarge on his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
for that is Work that must be wrought
extreamly Fine, or methinks 'tis Nauseous,
even on the Dead; and, whatever I may
pretend to the contrary, will look more like
a Complement to your self, than Iustice to
his Memory. The little I have said will
suffice, I hope, to shew that what I here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you is not altogether unsuitable to his or
your Genius, wherein Philosophy is divested
of the Stiffness and Morosness of the Schools,
and has assum'd the Garb and Air of a
more Ingenuous Education, than ordinary.
Here is something, Sir, that will entertain
your Philosophical Minutes, and something
that will quicken those design'd for your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
and all so mixt and temper'd, that
the Author seems still to have kept his Eye
on those two main ends, Pleasing and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing.
Philosophy by this Method is
become a <hi>la mode</hi> amongst the Women of
greatest Quality in <hi>France,</hi> who pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more in being accounted Partisans
of a Sect, than Leaders in Dress and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.
And we may presume that the Power
and Force of Imitation will reach the
Minds of our <hi>English</hi> Ladies, when Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be set off with the Allurements
<pb facs="tcp:54814:4"/>
and Delight they meet with in reading a
Romance. To provoke them therefore I
have adventur'd upon this Translation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Prohibition of <hi>French</hi>
Commodities: But it is not from their
Iudgments I expect the Approbation of my
Endeavours: My chief Design was to please
you; And if I shall in the least succeed in
that Attempt, it will be abundant Honour
and Satisfaction to</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT
OF THE
AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>IT is almost three years since this Book was
in a capacity of appearing; and if it were
of any Concern to convince the World of
this, it might be done by the Testimony
of Persons unsuspected in this Affair; and such
as would merit Credit when they determin'd it
in favour of the Author. The Reader may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in two or three places, that have some
reference to those times, which were not
thought necessary to be alter'd. Such is the War
betwixt <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> and <hi>Malebranche</hi> Father of
the Oratory, of which there is an account given,
without any mention of the Cessation of Arms,
or any pretence of a Truce which hath been
since concluded. But it may be presum'd not
amiss, to advise such as think themselves not
obligd to so exact an Inquiry into things of that
Nature, that the Map of the Moon, whose
<pb facs="tcp:54814:5"/>
Hemisphere is describ'd at large in the Voyage
to the World of <hi>Descartes,</hi> is no new thing, and
that <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to, Aristotle, Gassendus, Mersennus,</hi> &amp;c. are
not Inhabitants of those Lands and Countries
lately discover'd in that vast Continent, nor, of
those wherewith the Author of this Book hath
inlarg'd the Map. Our Astronomers have been
acquainted with those places long ago, and have
establish'd Principalities on behalf of those
great Men whose Names they bear. This may
be seen in the <hi>Almagestus</hi> of <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Mathematicians, who write Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on the Eclipses of the Moon.</p>
            <p>Some may be farther inquisitive to demand,
why <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> had the Honour to be
made <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Partner, in the framing of his
World, rather than so many other famous <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians</hi>
he might have made choise of. To which I
return, that <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> had the Preference,
not only on the account of the particular Esteem
and Love <hi>Cartesius,</hi> as well as other excellent
Philosophers of his time, had for him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the almost only Gentleman that
was in a condition to be an Assistant in that
great Enterprize when he began it; the other
Ingenious <hi>Cartesians</hi> having not left our World
till after him.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <pb facs="tcp:54814:5"/>
            <head>A General View
Of the whole
WORK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LUCIAN,</hi> in his Entry upon his true
History, hath taken the most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Method that possibly could be thought
on. He proclaims forthwith to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that whatever he shall say is false. After
which giving his Imagination swing, he loads the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with all the Extravagancies his Fancy can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
him with. By this means he secures himself
from that grand Concern which attends all sorts of
Composition, and consists in preserving probability in
the Narration; an Obligation otherwise indispensable
to every Writer that pretends to give Relations.
The worst of that <hi>Exordium</hi> is, it cannot be made
use of twice, and that it begins to be Thred-bare, as
<pb facs="tcp:54814:6"/>
soon as it ceases to be intirely new. It is a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Publick would never pardon in any one but
him that had the good fortune first to light upon
it: A gentile turn that no one can imitate without
passing for a Plagiary, and a Grace of Wit that
admits of nothing surprizing or agreeable in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Indeavour. That Consideration joyn'd with
the difficulty which may be easily guess'd, I had to
preserve the strict Law of probability in my History,
will persuade those that shall read it, that I envyed
<hi>Lucian,</hi> more than once, this his so happy Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
Nor can I but acknowledge the same. Yet I
must add, that a second Consideration would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
have determin'd me to a different Choice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
decency would have allow'd me to make use of
the former. I am a Philosopher: And the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I pretend to, bars all admittance unto such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.
The Character of a Philosopher is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to speak Truth, or to think he does; at least
indeavour to be thought to speak it. For me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
my self of all gayety of Humour, and then to
affect it (to follow the Example of the greatest
Enemy the Philosophers have known) would have
been poorly to support a Quality, I extreamly value
my self upon. So that I should be cautious of using
the like Preamble, and acquainting my Readers that
all they were to expect of me should be false. I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
them therefore from this time forward that I
have a quite contrary design, and that I mean to
set off my History with an Air of Truth, such as
may be able to persuade the most Incredulous, did they
lay by Prejudice in the reading of it, that what I say
is most undoubtedly true. But such is the Nature
of Prejudice and Prepossession, that after all the
pains I have take to appear credible, I am conscious
<pb facs="tcp:54814:6"/>
notwithstanding I shall not be believ'd. Let it be
how it will: For after all I will by no means offer
violence to the Iudgment of my Readers. Now see
in few Words the design of the Work.</p>
            <p>I therein relate the Particulars of a Voyage which
I made to the World of <hi>Cartesius.</hi> I begin the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
very advantagiously, upon an occasion that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
presented me, and which seems worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
Through the whole Thred of the History, as I
fall in with Emergencies, I explain with as little
difficulty and as pleasantly as the Subject will bear,
the most principal Points of <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Philosophy.
I examine many of them in the way, and refute
the greatest part of them in a manner clear, as I
think, and intelligible enough; and which commonly
has in it something new and unreceiv'd. I have made
it my business to diversify and enliven a Subject na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
dry and melancholy, as well by the variety of
Accidents, which give me occasion to digress upon
them, as by some peculiar and not incurious Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the History of <hi>Cartesianism:</hi> And likewise
with some brisk and warm Discourses of such Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
as no one will be uneasy to hear Dispute. To
conclude, my last and most principal Business to
the Examination and Discussion of the general System
of <hi>Cartesius</hi> his World, and his managery of the
chiefest Parts of it, as he proposes it in his <hi>Book
of Principles,</hi> and in that which is Intituled, <hi>A
Treatise concerning Light,</hi> or the World of
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> which he mentions so often in his
Letters to <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> but was not printed
till after his death. And I doubt not, in that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion,
to establish this one Proposition, that hath
been often advanc'd, but still repuls'd, and still, I
<pb facs="tcp:54814:7"/>
am confident, will be, as a Paradox to many,
That there is scarce any Philosophical Hypothesis
more unjust and incoherent, or whose Conclusions
have less connexion with its Principles, than that of
<hi>Cartesius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Proposition, I say, hath always seem'd a
Paradox, because it thwarts the generally receiv'd
Opinion of that Philosophy. No one will deny but
that some of his Principles being but meer Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
without Proof, the Mind cannot find that
satisfaction it demands: But what they stand upon
is, That these Suppositions being once receiv'd, all
the rest doth follow in so direct a Line, in so
great order and perspicuity, that the evidence of
the Consqeuences, expanding it self (as I may say)
upon the Premises, the mind begins of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to imbrace for Truths, what were before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as bare Suppositions.</p>
            <p>This may be true of some parts of his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and particularly of those wherein he treats of
the Nature of some Sensible Qualities, in which
a Man must almost be forc'd to acquiesce, that
shall read them without Prepossession. But I am of
opinion it is false in respect of the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure
of his World, and the Consequences he
draws from it. 'Tis this part of his Philosophy
which I shall more throughly examine, and it is
this of all other, that hath hitherto best escap'd the
Censure. Plenty of Objections have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> against the New De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
he hath pretended to give, for the
existence of a Deity, his distinction of the Soul and
Body, his System of Light, his Rules of Motion,
<pb facs="tcp:54814:7"/>
as also those concerning Reflection and Refraction.
Scarce any yet have given him disturbance upon
the Hypothesis of his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> which is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Foundation of all he says touching
the motion of the Planets, the ebbing and flowing
of the Sea, the gravity and levity of Bodies;
and of his whole System concerning Light, of
which he himself has been so very fond.</p>
            <p>I will not say but they have augmented the
Difficulties upon each of these last Heads, since a
great many have attack'd him thereupon: But
I only say they have seldom or never examin'd
them with relation to his general Hypothesis, by
which I undertake to shew, that commonly what
he writes of particular Matters, is inconsistent
with the whole; and it is mostly in that, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of my Voyage hath something altogether
new.</p>
            <p>For what remains, if I shall succeed in this
last Affair, which was almost the only occasion
of this Enterprize, I shall glory to have been the
most mischievous Adversary <hi>Cartesius</hi> ever met
with. For that which distinguishes that great
Man from all the other Philosophers, is not the
lucky Explication of some particular Phenomena's
in Nature (that Praise is shar'd by an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Philosophers, both Ancient and Modern)
but that vastness of Capacity, and extent of
Genius, whereby he could frame an intire System
of the World, so well contriv'd, that taking for
granted a few Principles most simple and easy to
be understood, he could give a reason for all the
Occurrencies of Nature. It is that Attempt, as
<pb facs="tcp:54814:8"/>
most believe, by which he obtain'd his end, and
which hath procur'd him so much Honour and
Reputation. To shew then his System to be full
of Contradictions, that it is incoherent, that one
Supposition destroys another, is to undertake him in
his strongest hold, and to wound him in the part
that is most sensible. We shall see in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the History what ought to be our Thoughts
of it.</p>

VOYAGE
TO
The World of Cartesius.</head>
            <head>PART. 1.</head>
            <p>IT fares with the <hi>World of Monsieur Descartes,</hi>
as with other lately discovered Lands,
whereof such different Accounts are given,
as often contradict one another. Scarce
Mention was made of this <hi>New World,</hi> but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Number of <hi>French, English</hi> and <hi>Dutchmen</hi>
resolve to go see it. The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> however zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for new Discoveries, understanding it was
barren of Mines of Gold and Silver, of Indigo
and Ginger, seemed not much concerned about
it: Wherefore those that had most contributed
unto it were not a little pleased, as believing,
they had no Reason to apprehend the <hi>Inquisition</hi>'s
coming there to disturb them. Among other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54814:10"/>
Things in that World the <hi>Earth</hi> takes a Turn
about the <hi>Sun,</hi> as in that of <hi>Copernicus:</hi> And it
is known that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> hath more than once,<note place="margin">Desc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om. 2. lett. 43, 75.</note>
on that occasion, reflected on the Misfortune of
poor <hi>Galileus.</hi> I cannot tell, but it may be on
his Account he hath taken so much Pains to prove
this Paradox,<note place="margin">Part. 3. pr. n. 26.</note> That the <hi>Earth</hi> stands still, though
at the same Time it is carried about the <hi>Sun</hi> by
that Luminary's <hi>Vortex.</hi> Let it be how it will,
many of those that give out they have best exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
that Country, have made their Relations
of it, but so differently, that a Man can scarce
yet determine what he must believe: If you will
credit one Party, they'll tell you, It is no <hi>World</hi>
at all, but a perfect <hi>Chaos:</hi> That all lie in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and wild Confusion: That 'tis impossible
for a Man to turn himself in it: That there is
neither Light nor Colours, neither Heat nor
Cold, Drought nor Moisture: That Plants and
Animals <hi>there</hi> don't live. There you have not
only Liberty, but positive Orders to doubt of
every thing in Nature. Some there shall be that
will dispute you out of the Name of a Man;
though you have a Face like other Men; though
you be made up of Flesh and Bone as they;
though you Walk, and Eat, and Sleep, and,
in a Word, perform all the Natural Functions
of a Man; yet, I say, there are those that shall
contest that Title with you, until having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
you, and understood you speak <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially,</hi>
they shall be convinced that you have
<hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> look Proud and Scornful, and
have not the least Respect for Antiquity. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
especially is scouled in all Companies, and
upon all Occasions, by them, being look'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54814:10"/>
upon as a Vain Babler, and an <hi>Antique</hi> Teller
of Dreams. It is said, There is neither good
<hi>Christian</hi> nor good <hi>Catholick</hi> there, since they
tamper with Principles too Delicate and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
in Matters relating to Religion. No
Body can tell what to make of their Belief of the
Creation of <hi>Our World,</hi> the Production of Matter
and the Providence of God; who, with them,
had no other Care upon him than to order the
Cubical Particles of Matter to whirl about their
Center: After which he might sit Idle and
Unconcerned, since all the rest could be managed
without the least of his Assistance.</p>
            <p>On the other Side, we are ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red, A most
excellent Conduct shines throught the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
That all is admirably contrived, and
founded upon the Rules and Laws of Nature:
That this <hi>World</hi> is indeed disburthened of an
infinite Swarm of <hi>Accidents, Qualities,</hi> and <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Species,</hi> as of an unprofitable Lumber,
wherewith the <hi>Philosophers</hi> have imbroiled and
incumbred ours: But yet, notwithstanding it
cannot be deny'd, but the Senses are subject to
the same Impressions there as here, only with
this Difference, that the Causes are more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and better explain'd.</p>
            <p>As to the Point of Religion, nothing seems
more justifiable than the Apology of these
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> which perhaps some have ingaged too
inconsiderately for an Affair of that Weight and
Moment. Can we apprehend a greater <hi>Idea</hi> of
God Almighty, than that which <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
hath given? An Idea that he derived not from
the Visible Creatures, that sleight and faint Ray
of an infinitely perfect Being; but which his
Mind found impressed upon it self, and which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54814:11"/>
left no room for him to doubt of the Existence
of a Sovereign Being, though he possessed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heaven nor Earth, nor any Body, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any other Soul than <hi>his:</hi> Can the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Deity be advanced to a more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Degree than he hath done it? God,
according to him, can cause, That Two and
Three shall not make Five; That four Sides shall
not be requisite to make a Square; That the
Whole shall be no bigger than One of its Parts;
Effects that other <hi>Philosophers</hi> never scruple to
place out of the Reach of the God head. But
has not an Author of a little Piece, called, <hi>A
Letter wrote to a Learned Iesuite,</hi> clearly shewn,
That 'tis <hi>Descartes World</hi> that is described in the
first Chapter of <hi>Genesis?</hi> Another Book hath
since been publish'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> with the Title
of <hi>Cartesius Mosaisans,</hi> and is to the same effect.
The Author of the Treatise concerning <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the Stars,</hi> describes the End of the
World upon <hi>Descartes</hi> his Hypothesis. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Scottanus,</hi> in a late Apology, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> against those that Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to render him obnoxious to the Suspicion
of Atheism, observes to us the Respect he had
for Religion, certifying us, That one of his
Reasons for the reducing his Meditations to the
Number of Six, was the Consideration of the
<hi>Six Days</hi> which God imployed in the Creation
of the World. If we may credit <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sennus,</hi>
a Learned and Noted <hi>Minim,</hi> and an
intimate Acquaintance of <hi>Descartes,</hi> we shall
find nothing of a more Christian Temper, and
that inspires us more ravishingly with the Love
of God than <hi>Descartes Philosophy.</hi> In short,
there is nothing more edifying than the Letter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54814:11"/>
that <hi>Philosopher</hi> wrote to the <hi>Sorbon Doctors,</hi> in
dedicating his <hi>Meditations</hi> to them; which is so
true, that not long since, a Friend of mine, not
wont to be very Nice in those Matters, having
read by chance the Letter at my House, which
touched him; and finding farther the Title of
<hi>Meditations</hi> in the Front of the Work, he seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
entreated me to lend him that Godly
Book, to entertain his Devotions during <hi>Passion
Week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so strange Variety of Opinions, and
Relations counter to one another, of <hi>a World,</hi>
otherwise of no little Renown, provoked my
Curiosity and induced me to be convinced of
the Truth or Falsity of the Reports, in my
own Person. All the Difficulty was to find a
Guide to conduct me to a Country, to which
there was no Road passable either for Horse or
Foot, for Coach or Barge, by Land or Sea:
But presently after my Resolve, I was happily
favoured with the most lucky Occasion that could
be wish'd, for the undertaking my Voyage with
all the Pleasure and Ease imaginable. Having
sojourned some Months in a Country Town,
I strook up Acquaintance with an <hi>Old Standard,</hi>
of about eighty Years, a Man of Parts, and that
formerly had conversed much with <hi>M. Descartes.</hi>
That Commerce had begot in him an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Zeal for the Tenets of that <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and
exasperated him to declaim against the Method
and Opinions of the School, the Prejudices of
Childhood, and taught him to make external Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
on the <hi>Cartesian Philosophy.</hi> He had so
given himself up to this Opinion, that he could
no ways suffer, in Point of Philosophy, any one
to deviate never so little from it. In a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54814:12"/>
that we had together upon such sort of
Things, I desired to know if he kept up his
Correspondence with any <hi>Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esians</hi> of Worth
and Reputation. No, (said he) I have broke
with all Sorts of Persons that call themselves by
that Name. I can no longer find among them
that Zeal and Observance the first <hi>Cartesians,</hi>
without Reserve attributed to that great Man.
Every one now a days builds Systems according
to his own Humor, and allows himself the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Adding or Retrenching what he pleases
in the Platform <hi>M. Descartes</hi> hath laid; which
is a concern of that critical Nature as cannot be
once touch'd without spoiling the whole. Since
the Death of the Famous <hi>M. Chersilier,</hi> I have
forbore writing to any single Person, for I am
persuaded, That the pure and unmixt <hi>Cartesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi>
was buried with him.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen <hi>(reply'd I)</hi> are of a strange
Constitution. All the Prefaces of your Books
are fill'd with Invectives and Raileries, against
those who implicitely espouse the Sentiments of
an Author, and profess they will never desert
him. It looks as if you, and the rest of the new
Philosophers, had banded together in an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Confederacy, to make continual War upon
the Followers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> on that Account; and
at the same time you fall into the same Error for
which ye reproach them, and are an hundred
times more bigotted to your <hi>Descartes,</hi> than they
to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For my part, I know not how to blame
the Conduct of those that are somewhat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
which you are so enrag'd against. If their
Reason hath discover'd to them another Path
than what <hi>M. Descartes</hi> trod in, why are you
angry if they follow it? <hi>Aristotle</hi> held Possession
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54814:12"/>
a long time, and reign'd absolute Monarch in
Philosophy. The Prescription and Vassalage
of several Ages, confirm'd his Title of Prince of
Philosophers. <hi>Descartes</hi> is a Rebel, who durst
encourage a Party against his Prince: What
Right has he to demand a greater Submission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, than he was willing to allow to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because <hi>(answer'd he)</hi> Truth and Reason are
manifestly on his side. That, reply'd I, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the first step Rebellion ever makes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the justice of its Cause, and proclaim the
publick Welfare does depend upon it. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Sir <hi>(pursu'd I)</hi> I am more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to Neutrality in this Affair than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
I have determin'd to dive to the bottom
of <hi>Descartes's</hi> Philosophy, of which I have, as
yet, but a dark and confus'd Knowledg, having
never studied him in his own Works, but in the
Books of his Disciples, as soon as they appear'd,
and that irregularly, and without Method. But
as I am oblig'd to leave this Country very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and have but a short time to advantage my
self by your Ability in this Affair, therefore it
was that I enquir'd, Whether you had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Letters, or Friendship with any
good <hi>Cartesian</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to whose Acquaintance
you might recommend me, and who would be
willing to instruct a Scholar so apt and forward
as I pretend to be?</p>
            <p>That Proposal extreamly inspirited my <hi>old
Gentleman,</hi> and I perceiv'd sudden Joy diffus'd
it self all over his Countenance. Ever since I
knew you <hi>(said he,</hi> taking me by the Hand) I
have observ'd in you a passionate Concern for
Truth; which is the best, and first Disposition
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54814:13"/>
               <hi>Descartes</hi> requires to attain unto it. Trouble
not your self, you have still two Months good,
which you must stay with me; and that's as
much time as is required. I shall in a little time
receive some News from <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
wee'll take such Measures as shall much
shorten your Journey.</p>
            <p>Hey day! News from <hi>M. Descartes!</hi> (said I)
why he has been Dead this forty Years. I should
be sorry, <hi>answer'd he,</hi> to have let that Word
escape me in another's Presence, but I let it ship
purposely at present, to highten your Desire of
hearing from me those Things which few in the
World are acquainted with, which presently
will surprize you, and the Knowledg thereof
will convey you in a trice to the end you desire.
Hear me then:</p>
            <p>You must know <hi>(continu'd he)</hi> that <hi>Cartesius,</hi>
like the ancient Leaders of Sects of Philosophers,
avoided the publishing all the Mysteries of his
Philosophy. Some he reserv'd which he only
divulg'd to some particular Friends, of which
I had the good Fortune to be one. All the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Discoveries he had made, which he
thought might be of Use, and either contribute
to Morality, or serve to make any Progress in
the Knowledg of Natural Beings, he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
the Publick with. But Prudence advis'd
him to suppress such others, as some might have
converted to an evil Use. The Immortality of
the Soul is one of those Points, wherein he was
oblig'd to observe that Method, and certainly
is one of the most Important Articles in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
To prove this in a plain, familiar and
intelligible way, such as shall force the Mind to
give assent, and leave not the least Scruple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54814:13"/>
is to undermine the chief Foundation of
Libertinism and Atheism. This <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
hath done, by demonstrating the distinction of
the Soul and Body in a Man, by the only clear
and distinct Conception that we have of those
two kinds of Being. That Demonstration is
one of the most fine and useful places of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Meditations. And he was high-sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to see it so ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly oppos'd, especially by
<hi>Gassendus;</hi> which, though before he had ask'd
his Permission, gall'd and vex'd him, a little more
perhaps than was convenient upon that occasion.
Which gave rise to a Reflection in the Mouths of
many at that time, and which betwixt our
selves was true enough, <hi>That</hi> M. Descartes <hi>did
not understand Raillery.</hi> But he had Moderation
enough in the heat of his Conflict, to decline the
submitting to the Temptation, which had often
invited him to confirm his Demonstration by
Experiment, fearing it might prove of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence: And that is the Mystery
which I am about to teach you.</p>
            <p>It was his way (as all know) to endeavour
to make good by Experience, the Truths he had
discover'd by the meer Light of his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
He was in hopes, that having demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so clear conviction the distinction of
the Soul and Body, he might make so far a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
as to penetrate into the Secret of their
Union, and at last come to that of separating,
and re-uniting them when he pleas'd. The
Questions that his Illustrious Scholar, <hi>Elizabeth
the Princess</hi> Palatine, us'd to make upon that
Head, and the difficulty he found in himself to
invent such Solutions as might be easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
put him, in short, upon the Undertaking.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54814:14"/>
One day he propos'd his Design to me, and some
other of his Friends. We thought him Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical:
And I remember I laughing made Reply,
That there was but one way imaginable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it, which was, to find out the famous <hi>Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus
of Mercury,</hi> which that God, they say,
sometimes by <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Orders made use of, to
separate the Souls from Bodies, and after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
term of Years to joyn them unto new ones,
according to the Principles of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smigration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That however did not divert <hi>Cartesius</hi> from
raving on his Project, not ascertaining himself
of the Success, nor judging yet he ought alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to despair. That was it, that ingag'd him
in a more exact Study than formerly of an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Body, and occasion'd him to make those
most exquisite Discoveries in Anatomy. The first
Conclusion that he drew from the Idea he had of
the Soul, as of a being perfectly Indivisible, was,
That it was not extended through the whole
Body, as vulgarly it is taught. He shew'd the
falsity of that Master Reason, which was us'd
till then to confirm Men in their Prejudices,
that in whatever part you prick the Body the
Soul is sensible of Pain. Then said the
Philosophers, It must be extended through the
whole. He exposed the Weakness of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by two Experiments, that manifestly
prove the perception of Pain, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Objects in Places where our Soul is
not. The first is that of those Persons who have
lost an Arm, who from Time to Time perceive
an Aking in the Place where their Fingers used
to be, as if they had their Arm entire, although
their Fingers are not there, nor by Consequence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54814:14"/>
their Soul. The second is of a Man that's
Blind, which he often instances, who makes his
Staff supply the Loss of his Eyes, to distinguish
the Figure and Qualities of Objects: Who knows
by the Assistance of his Stick, whether it be
Water, Earth or Grass that he touches; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Floor be Rough or Smooth, &amp;c. For it
is certain he perceives all this by his Staff, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
no one will say, That his Soul is in it.
He then demonstrated, That the Impression of
Objects upon our Body consisted only in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Nerves and Fibres, that are
spread throughout the Parts, it being unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Soul should be co-extended with them.
But it was suffcient to her for the perception of
Objects, that that Vibration should be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to some principal part where she kept
her Residence; just as the Vibration caus'd by
the touch of a soft, or hard, of a rough or smooth
Body, communicates it self to the Hand by the
Mediation of the Staff; that as the Staff ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
from the Hand to the Body, which it
touches, is instrumental to the Soul for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Qualities of the Body; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Nerves drawn out, for instance, from
the Brain to the Hand, may be ministerial to its
perception of the Body that the Hand doth
touch. And that in fine, The Pain, caus'd by
the too near approach of a Finger to the Fire,
doth no more suppose the Souls actual Presence
in that part of the Body, than does the ail of a
Finger, of which a certain Maid complain'd
from day to day,<note place="margin">Let. de Desc.</note> whose Arm, being gangreen'd,
was cut off without her Knowledg. For she
only felt the Pain, because the Humours, or
some other Cause, made a Concussion in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54814:15"/>
Nerves of her Arm, which ran before to the end
of her Hand, and because they strook them in a
manner like to that which was formerly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to excite a Pain in the Finger, before she
lost her Arm.</p>
            <p>Having made this first Step, and drawn a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of that Importance and Satisfaction,
from so abstracted a Principle as the Indivisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul; it was easy for him to prove
she kept her Court no where but in the Brain.
There it is that the Nerves do center, or rather
from thence they have their Origin. It is there
that the Philosophers, if you except a few, and
in those <hi>Vanhelmont,</hi> who seiz'd with a Whim,
plac'd the Soul in the Breast; it is there, I say,
that the Philosophers generally agree to be
found that which we call the Common Sense,
that is to say, the only place where the Soul can
be advis'd of all the different Impressions that
external Objects make upon the Senses. But
since the Brain is of large Extent, and besides
that soft and whitish Substance, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
goes by that Name, hath Membranes,
Glands, Ventricles or Cavities, it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
intricate to resolve, and precisely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in what place the Soul was seated. <hi>M.
Descartes</hi> throughly examind the different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Philosophers and Physicians there upon,
and after having solidly confuted the greatest
part of their Sentiments, that were founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but weak and unsound Principles, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
concludes, The seat of the Soul must
have three Conditions: First, it must be one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to the end that the Action of the same Object
that at the same time strikes two Organs of
the same Sense, should make no more than one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54814:15"/>
Impression on the Soul, as to instance, she might
not see two Men where there was but one.<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Let. 36.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it must be very near the Source of the
Animal Spirits; that by their means she might
easily move the Members. And in the third
Place, it must be Moveable; that the Soul cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it to move immediately, might be able to
determine the Animal Spirits to glide towards
some certain Muscles rather than others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
no where to be met with but in a little
Gland call'd <hi>Pineale</hi> or <hi>Conarium,</hi> situated betwixt
all the Concavities of the Brain, supported and
incompass'd with Arteries, which made up the
<hi>Lacis Choroides.</hi> It is that <hi>Lacis</hi> we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
that is the source of the Spirits, which,
ascending from the Heart along the Carotides,
receive the form of an Animal Spirit in that
Gland, disengaging themselves there from the
more gross parts of the Blood; and from
thence they take their Course towards the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Muscles of our Body, partly dependent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
partly independently on the Soul; as the
Author of Nature has order'd it, with reference
to the end he propos'd to himself in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>So far <hi>M. Descartes</hi> took Reason along with
him for his Guide; and for ought I know he
might have stop'd there, had not Fortune, or
rather the good Providence of God (who often
encourages the laudable Curiosity of those that
apply themselves to the consideration of his
wonderful Works) reveal'd to him in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner the Secret that he was in search
of. And that was without doubt one of the
most strange Effects of the desires of a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Soul,<note place="margin">P. Malle.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> branche.</note> which a <hi>famous Author</hi> stiles a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54814:16"/>
Prayer, that never fails to be heard, when
it is joyned with a prudent and exact Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Reason.</p>
            <p>Should you believe me, <hi>added he,</hi> if I should tell
you <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had often Fits of Extasy?
Why not? <hi>Said I;</hi> that's no such incredible
thing, of so Contemplative a Man as he was;
nor is it a Case without a President. Who has not
heard of those of the famous <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in which
he often lost himself, through his vehement Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to Mathematical Speculations, and in
one of them his Life? <hi>Syracuse</hi> being taken by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army, whilst he was drawing Figures in
his Chamber with that earnestness of Mind; the
Tumult of a Town taken by Storm, was not
loud enough to wake him: And he sooner was
run through by the Soldiers that had forc'd his
House, than he was apprehensive of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>Alas! <hi>reply'd he,</hi> with a Sigh, you'll see in the
Consequence of what I am relating, That the
Extasies of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> were no less fatal, tho'
they were not of the same Nature, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from a far different Cause. It happen'd
one Day, whilst we were at <hi>Egmond,</hi> a little
Town in <hi>Holland,</hi> which he delighted in, that
he entred his Stove very early in the Morning
(which he had caus'd to be built like that in
<hi>Germany,</hi> where he began his Philosophy) and
set himself to thinking, as he us'd to do.
Two Hours after, I came in: I found him lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the Table, his Head hanging forward,
supported with his left Hand, in which he held a
little Snush Box, having his Finger near his
Nose, as if he was taking Snush. As for the
rest he was Immoveable, and held his Eyes open:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54814:16"/>
The noise that I made in entring the Room not
causing him to stir, I had the Patience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him half an Hour postur'd in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
without his perceiving of me. In the mean
while there happen'd an Adventure that much
surpriz'd me: There stood upon the Cornish of
the Wainscot in the Stove, a Bottle of the Queen
of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Water; I was amaz'd to see it
descend, whilst no Body came near it, and to
pass through the Air towards <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> The
Cork, with which it was stopt, came out of its
own Accord, and the Bottle fastning it self to
his Nose, hung there for some time. I protest I
durst have swore at that moment, there had been
no small Conjuring in the Business of our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
and that some familiar <hi>Demon,</hi> like
that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> had inspir'd him with all the fine
Things he still had taught us. But I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
not long after that there was nothing less
in it, and I desire you to suspend your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereon. He awaken'd a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as in a start, and striking his Hand upon the
Table, <hi>This time at last,</hi> said he, <hi>I have it.</hi> I
thought him still in a Dream: And springing up
forthwith upon his Chair, transported with Joy,
without seeing me, he cut two Capers in the
middle of the Room, still repeating, <hi>I have it,
I have it.</hi> I burst out with Laughter to see that
Frolick, a thing not customary with <hi>M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
being naturally of a Grave and Melancholy
Temper; who hearing and seeing me at the
same time, presently redden'd, and afterwards
fell a Laughing as well as I. And as I was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
with him to give me the Reason of his Joy
and Rapture: To punish you, says he, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
observed an <hi>Indecorum</hi> unbecoming a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54814:17"/>
you shall not know't so soon: And with
that he left the Room in which we were, and
entred into his Closet, bolting it upon him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
two days after he imparted to me the
Mystery.</p>
            <p>We took a turn together out of Town, and
after occasional Discourse of several Things;
Well, said he, abruptly, without recourse to
<hi>Mercury</hi>'s <hi>Caduceus,</hi> I have found out the Secret,
not only of the Union of the Soul and Body,
but also how to separate them when I please:
I have experienc'd it already. That was the
Product of the Meditation, wherein you sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me the other day; and when I seem'd to
you to awake of a suddain, I came farther a
Field than you imagine: He spoke this in so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and positive a way, that he seem'd to be
in earnest. It shall be your Fault, <hi>added he,</hi> if
you are not convinc'd of the Truth of what I
say, and of the Experiment. It is the most
curious Secret in the World. I am resolv'd to
commit it but to very few; but that Adherency
which you have manifested until this time unto
me, will not suffer me to be reserv'd in any
thing. He went on, without giving me time
to complement his Generosity, and related that
extraordinary Event in all its Circumstances.</p>
            <p>He told me, that being fix'd attentively upon
the Question which the <hi>Princess Elizabeth</hi> had
propos'd, touching the Union of the Soul and
Body, and revolving in his Mind his former
Thoughts upon that Subject, in the midst of
that extraordinary Application, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in such a strange Surprizal in an Instant,
that he was not capable, when he told me of it,
to express himself clearly thereupon, nor could
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54814:17"/>
he gain so distinct a Conception of it as when
actually he was in it. All that he could tell me,
was, That it resembled a Trance, because in
that there is no use of the Senses; one can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
See, nor Hear, nor Feel the Impression of
External Objects (unless they be extreamly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent)
and then there is an end of it: But herein
it was quite different; since the Soul had Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of it Self, and was apprehensive of the
Cessation of its Organical Functions: Which in
a Trance is nothing so. That she was furnish'd
with a World of Immaterial or purely Spiritual
Notices, of which he had sometime discours'd
to us, but in an abundantly more perfect and
lively manner, than when his Attention was
disturb'd with the appearances of Fancy, which
constantly interrupt it: That more Discoveries
of Truth could be made thus in one Minute,
than in ten years by the ordinary means; which
Knowledg of Truth fill'd the Soul with so pure
and satisfactory a Joy, that nothing is more true
than what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, likely upon the same
Experience, That the compleat Happiness of
Man, in this Life, if there is any such thing,
consists in the Contemplation of God and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Beings.</p>
            <p>But he told me, he had no sense of that perfect
Joy, till he was fully enlightned upon the Point
that then took up his Thoughts: Which was
done in a Moment. He had the satisfaction not
only to know, but to be sensible, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
of the Truth of the greatest part of those
Things which had imploy'd his Meditations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that time; and of the Evidence of the Idea's
he had fram'd concerning the Essence of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul; to see her advanc'd upon her Pineal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54814:18"/>
Gland he had conjectur'd, and to see that the
Union of the Soul with the Body was nothing less,
then that vertual, or rather imaginary Extension,
by which she was suppos'd commensurate with
the Limbs; much less those imaginary Modes,
which the Schools makes use of, to confound
and plague the Conceptions of Youth. But that
which was of most Importance was, to see; that
this Union was nothing in Effect, but these
actual Commerce and Correspondence the Soul
and Body had with one another. A Commerce
that chiefly is maintain'd in this, that the
Nerves spread through the Body, by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
give occasion to the Soul of knowing
the different impressions, External Objects make
upon the Senses; and in that the Soul pursuant
thereupon, by the Motion she immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
upon the Pineal Gland where all the
Nerves concentre, determines the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to their several marches through the
Muscles, to produce in the Body such several
Motions as she shall please to give, and especially
those that are necessary to her Preservation.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>(pursu'd, my old Friend) M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
entertain'd me with all that happen'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that occasion, and all the other Reflections he
had made. The Principal of which was, That
his Soul in that juncture no longer perceiving
the Motions, external Objects caus'd upon his
Body, and by consequence that Commerce, in
which the Essence of Union consisted, being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
she could behold her self as in a separate
State, though in the mean time she resided at her
usual Abode; that local Presence having the
least share in her Union with the Body: She
then had a mind to disengage her self from the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54814:18"/>
Body, and see what would be the Event of that
Separation. No sooner had she wisht it, than it
was so. And he farther experienc'd what he
had often suggested to us before, that if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
of the Body had all its Organs sound and
free; if it had its customary Heat in the Heart
and Stomack, the circulation of the Blood, the
filtration of the Humours, and all those natural
Functions, all the Motions constantly perform'd
in us without the notice of the Soul would go
on as regularly in her absence, as when she was
there. Moreover it fell out as she was busy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the operation of her Body at some
paces distance from it, a Fly fortun'd to tickle
it in the Face; presently the Hand rais'd it self
to the place, and unseated the Fly just as if the
Soul had been actually in the Body. So true it
is that the greatest part of the Motions of our
Body, which we attribute to the Soul, are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the sole Disposition of the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Soul before she durst venture to wander
very far from the Body, made her <hi>entry</hi> and <hi>exit</hi>
sundry times; and judging by the disposition
in which she saw it, she might without any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
danger leave it for some time, she haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded
the undertaking a very long Voyage.
She arriv'd at <hi>Beitany</hi> in the Houses of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and from thence she made a Sally unto
<hi>Paris</hi> to the House of some other Acquaintance.
She was much concern'd to see that the People
there had but an indiffernt Opinion of her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
the Country <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had chose to live
in, and some unwaranted Inferences that one
or other had drawn from his Principles, had
given occasion to those rash Censures. It is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
true, that all the time he liv'd and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54814:19"/>
when he dy'd, he was a sound and honest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
            <p>Finally, such was the success the Soul found
in her Rambles when separate from the Body,
that she could when she pleas'd in a Minute tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
three or four thousand Leagues: In so much
that this of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> parting from <hi>Egmond</hi>
about half an hour after eight in the Morning,
had travers'd all <hi>France</hi> in an hour and an half,
and was return'd at ten.</p>
            <p>Bless me. said I to my old Gentleman, how
expedient would that be for a Person that so
passionately desires to see the Country as I do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
You shall gratify your Curiosity, <hi>answer'd he;</hi>
but hear me out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Descartes</hi> Soul being return'd from her Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in <hi>France,</hi> found her Body almost in the same
posture in which she left it. But as yet she was
not fully Satisfy'd. She was unacquainted with
the way and means that led her into this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And she consider'd it was an hazardous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit,
and that being once united to her Body,
she might never, for ought she knew, be disjoyn'd
again, till Death should cause a final Separation.
She apply'd her self therefore seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Nature of her Body, and the disposition
of all its Organs: She found that the Nerves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in Sentation, and those that serve for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
functions, as the beating of the Heart, the
circulation of the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were of a Nature
quite distinct. She saw that these were vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distended, and she concluded it might be for
the better communicating the Animal Spirits to
the Muscles with which the Nerves are united,
and capacitating them to maintain and continue
those natural Motions, the Soul is not aware of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54814:19"/>
when united with the Body; and that, on the
contrary, the Nerves made use of in Sensation,
and by whose Means the Soul received the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Objects, were almost all unbraced,
and lax, which might prevent the Motion,
caused by the Impulse of Objects, from being
continued unto the Seat of the Soul: The Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
was to find the true Cause why one should
be taxed without the other, and how she might
bring it about to distend those that formerly were
laxed.</p>
            <p>Mean while the Snush-Box, which I mention'd,
his Body held in its left-Hand, made <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
call to mind, That before his Extasie he
had taken Tabaccco-Snush, and he could not tell
but so extraordinary an Effect might have been
produced by the Vertue of that Tobacco. That
which he took of was an unusual kind, which a
Merchant of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> had brought over from
an <hi>Island</hi> near <hi>China,</hi> and presented him: It
was extreamly strong, and <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> to
mollifie it had mix'd a certain Herb in it, dryed
to Powder, whose Name he never would acquaint
me with, nor the Place where it grew, though
he presented me with a great Quantity of the
same: He laid a sufficient Dose upon the Back-Side
of his Hand, and gave it his Body to take;
and at the same Time happen'd this prodigious
Effect in his Brain; for all the Vapours raised
there since his last taking were dislodged and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated
in an instant. He observed it was only
the Particles of the Tobacco that scattered the
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mes of the Brain, and that those of the Herb
which he had tempered with it being not so
fine, and having very little Motion, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselves in the Nerves that cause Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54814:20"/>
and and made them looser than they were
before.</p>
            <p>Seeing that Effect, he no longer doubted, but
concluded it to be the Herb, which he mix'd
with the Tobacco, that caus'd his Trance, and
took away his Senses; and that the Tobacco? at
the same Time unhar bouring all the Fumes that
might benight the Brain, left the Soul with the
entire Liberty of knowing and reflecting on
it's self, as she had then experienc'd. After
which he thought that <hi>Hungary Water</hi> was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient
to brace the Nerves afresh, that serve
for Sensation, since it is often used to recal those
Persons that swoon away. The Soul takes the
Bottle, I not long since mentioned, and brings
it in the Air from the far Side of the Chamber to
his Body, (and therein consists exactly the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
of which I then suspected <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
guilty) and moistens his Nostrils with it: The
subtile Vapour of that Liquor effected what he
aimed at; presently the laxed Nerves erect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and the Soul streight seats it self in the
Pineal Gland, and finds itself consederate with
the Body as before. It was in that instant I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Descartes</hi> to come to himself. I told you,
he lock'd himself forthwith in another Room,
it was to make a second Experiment of his Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
and his Herb, which succeeded to his Hearts
Desire: Since when, it was a Business of nothing
for his Soul to leave the Body; and since his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
to me the Secret, his Soul and mine have
made an hundred Expeditions together, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
our selves of the greatest Curiosities in
Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54814:20"/>
As those that read the Works of <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
are unacquainted with all that I have been relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they with just Cause are amazed at a thing,
which you will not startle at for the future. I
mean the Particulars he descends to in his <hi>Physicks,</hi>
concerning the Properties of his three Elements,
at how great soever remove from Sense they lie;
concerning their Figure, their Motion, their
Rank and File in the Composition of his World,
and all particular Bodies, concerning the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> in which he proceeds so
far as to observe the different size of the Balls of
the second Element,<note place="margin">Part. 3. Princip.</note> of which they consist, in
their respective Places, how those that come
nearest the Centre of the <hi>Water</hi> are the least of
all; those that are a little removed are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bigger, increasing still in Bigness unto a
determinate Distance, after which they all are
equal. Concerning the Formation of their Parts
chamfer'd in Fashion of a Skrew, with which he
explains the Nature and the different <hi>Phenomena's</hi>
of the Load-Stone, in a way so fine and easie,
<hi>Phoenomena's</hi> that till then had puzled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
all the Philosophers, even those that had
so ready a Method of explaining all things by the
Assistance of their occult Qualities: All this he
saw intuitively, and of himself; and for me that
speak to you, is it possible to think, That at the
Age of seventy seven, and being of so weak a
Constitution as I am; I say, is it possible for
you to think I should have lived to this, and
preserved my Health and Vigour as I do, unless
I had had a perfect Knowledge of the Machine of
my Body? Unless I had still filled and made-up
the Breaches whereat Life leaks and runs out
continually? I mean not, in applying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54814:21"/>
that Medicine prescribes, whose conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
are so very uncertain, and from the Use
of which <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> has so frequently
dissuaded the Princess <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lett. de Descartes.</note> But in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that Critical Knowledge my Soul has of
my Body, of which she perfectly is, and can be
instructed as often as she pleases, by putting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Capacity I have now been-speaking
of. I must acknowledg Sir, <hi>replyed I,</hi> then, it
is a most admirable Secret and of Infinite Use;
I am impatient till I learn it of you, and as
soon as I know it I am persuaded I shall improve
it to as great a Benefit as <hi>Adam</hi> would have done
the <hi>Tree of Life in</hi> Paradise, if he had continued
there. And I doubt not but if <hi>Origen</hi> had known
it, he that looks upon the History of Scripture
as <hi>Allegory,</hi> he would have believed the Tree of
Life to be nothing but this Mystery which God
had communicated unto <hi>Adam:</hi> But that which
you was speaking of your Health, creates one
Scruple in me; How <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> having
to the Advantage of this fine Knowledg came to
dye at the Age of fifty four? Was he so much
out of Love with his Life as to neglect the
repairing those effluxes of his Machine, whose
Failures and Disasters he could so easily
foresee?</p>
            <p>Do you believe then, <hi>returned he,</hi> that <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
is dead? I know not, said I, how you
understand it, but methinks the Corps of a Man
should not be buried unless he was dead before;
and all the World knows that in the Year 1650.<note place="margin">M. Chersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Lett. de M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the Body of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was interred at <hi>Stockholm</hi>
with great, Pomp and Solemnity, by the Care of
<hi>M. Chanut,</hi> his particular Friend, and then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
of <hi>France</hi> at the Court of <hi>Sweden:</hi> That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54814:21"/>
since <hi>M. Dalibert</hi> hath ordered his Bones to be
removed to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to be disposed of in the
Church of S. <hi>Geneve,</hi> where his Epitaph is to be
seen, engraven upon a fair White Marble: It
seems to me once more, That all this supposes a
Man as dead as dead can be.</p>
            <p>All these Particulars are true, said my <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian;</hi>
but for all that it is false that <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
is dead; for that we call Death is when our
Body becoming incapable of Vital Functions,
either by the Defailure of the Organs, which are
wore out in the Succession of Years, or corrupted
by some Disease, or endammaged by some Hurt
or Wound, the Soul is oblig'd to quit her Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
following the Laws of their Union esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
by the Sovereign Master of the Universe:
But <hi>Cartesius</hi>'s Soul was by no means separated
from his Body after this manner. Hear then the
Matter of Fact.</p>
            <p>About three or four Months after his Arrival
in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> where Queen <hi>Christina</hi> had invited
him, and did him the Honour to entertain him in
her Library an Hour in a Morning every Day:<note place="margin">Pref. de lett. de De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cartes.</note>
He was seized in the midst of Winter with an
Inflammation of the Lungs, seconded with a
Giddiness in the Brain; but the Fever having
left his Brain, there had been no great Difficulty
in his Recovery.<note place="margin">Lett. de Descartes.</note> Himself had wrote a little
Time before to one of his Friends, That he had
made some Discoveries in Anatomy, that insur'd
his Life for an hundred Years: And 'tis known
that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> did not use to go by Guessing, or
advance any thing without a firm Assurance; but
an unseasonable Misfortune rendred his Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
fruitless; seeing he had not rested well
that Night, his Soul had a Mind to take a little
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54814:22"/>
Turn for Recreation-sake; he takes his usual
Dose of Snush, and his Soul leaves his Body in
the Bed. By ill Luck the Physician, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Custom came to visit him at Midnight;
the Noise he made, in entring the Chamber,
did not awake his Body, whose Senses were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
laid asleep by vertue of the Herb, of
which I spoke, that was mingled with the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco:
But having put to his Nose a Vial of
extreamly Spirituous Liquor, to fortifie the
Brain, it made a more quick and lively Sally
upon the Organ of Sense than <hi>Hungary Water</hi>
used to do, which <hi>M. Descartes</hi> Soul made use of
when she would re-enter the Body, and conclude
its Trance; it caused it to open its Eyes, and to
give some Groans. The Physician ask'd it how
he did? The Machine accustomed, some Days
ago to answer to that Question, <hi>That he was very
ill,</hi> made still the same reply; but to other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
the Physician proposed (since the Soul was
not there to talk rationally, and answer to the
purpose) the Answers were full of Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
and <hi>Delirium,</hi> just as the Machine was
determined by the Voice of the Doctor: It
talked eternally of the Separation of its Soul
from its Body, because the last Thoughts the
Soul entertained in the Act of separating her self
were those of that Separation, which had left
some Figures or Traces stamp'd upon the Brain,
answering to those Thoughts, and determining
the Tongue to a Motion, requisite to pronounce
such sort of Words. These Symptoms enduc'd
the Doctor to believe he was again transported
with a Raving in his Head; wherefore he is out
of Hand blooded in the Foot, Cupping-Glasses
are apply'd, and several other Violent Remedies,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54814:22"/>
which so exhausted and altered his poor Body,
that in a short Time it had spent all its Strength;
it's natural Heat began to faint, and lose itself by
little and little; a De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luction of his Brain fell into
his Breast; and in a Word, it became a meer <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daver,</hi>
and unable to perform the Duties of Life,
and to receive his Soul. Thus it happened; so
that you see a Man may truly say, <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
is not dead.</p>
            <p>Assuredly Sir (<hi>said I</hi>) this is not to dye
according to <hi>due Form and Method;</hi> nevertheless
the <hi>Swedish Physician</hi> would be held Guiltles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Faculties of <hi>Europe;</hi> for he has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Rules of his Art he acted according
to appearance, and if he did but understand
what you are teaching me, That <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
is not dead, he might boast of the Greatest and
most unprecedented Exploit that was ever known
in Medicine, I mean to have killed a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
causing him to die. But Sir, I beseech you
(<hi>continued I</hi>) acquaint me, if you know, What
was the Destiny of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> Soul; for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the uncontroverted Principles of our
Faith, a Soul in leaving this World receives
her Arrest for Eternity, and either has her
Portion in Paradice, Hell or Purgatory for
some Time.</p>
            <p>That Question ruffled my old Gentleman;
And in the Name of God (<hi>said he</hi>) almost in
a Passion, rid your self of that Ridiculous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
you have taken up in the Schools, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Questions of Religion in Matters
purely Philosophical. <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had once
thought to renounce his Philosophy, or at least
refuse to publish his Works, to save him the
Trouble of answering those impertinent Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54814:23"/>
which were made at every turn and upon
all occasions. I am giving you clear Matter of
Fact, and you desire me to Account for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of God. But in brief, have not I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall'd
all your Difficulties, when I told you
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> was not Dead? And since he is
not Dead, why demand you if he has submitted
to a Judgment, the Dead are only concern'd
in?</p>
            <p>I beg'd his Pardon for my Imprudence; and
agreed with him, That nothing was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
and inconvenient, than such sort of
occasional Questions, to a <hi>Philosopher</hi> that had
made a <hi>System</hi> without regard to any thing of
that Nature. And that likewise put me in mind
of entreating my Readers, to use the same Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
towards me. That they will not wrangle
with me, upon the Point of separate Souls,
whole Shoals of which I meet with in my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to the <hi>World of Descartes,</hi> nor tye me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all the Scruples, they might be able to raise
on that Account. For therein bottom the most
agreeable Passages of my History, with which
I should not present the <hi>Publick,</hi> but upon that
Condition. I would entreat them to remember
the Priviledg these <hi>Cartesian Gentlemen</hi> take,
who when perplex'd in answering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
brought against the Essence of Matter,
and drawn from the Sacrament of the Host,
think they have right to cry out, They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd;
That their Philosophy is sequestred from
Things relating to Faith; That they are <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
and not <hi>Divines,</hi> and undertake the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Mysteries of Nature, not of Religion:
I would, I say, they'd do me the like Justice;
or, if they had rather, the same Favour. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54814:23"/>
supposing any one so Religious, as to suspect me
of the Heresie of those, who say, The Souls
in parting from the Body are not doom'd for
Eternity; I wish he'd consider once more, that I
am in this, an <hi>Historian</hi> and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> not a
<hi>Theologist,</hi> and give a Relation of <hi>Descartes</hi>'s
<hi>World,</hi> am not making a Profession of Faith.
Which the Character of an History (such as I
am upon) will bear, far more independently
of the Truths of our Religion, than a System of
Philosophy. Any one that knows never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
must be forc'd to acknowledg this: Which
being once suppos'd, I return to the Narrative
of my <hi>Old Gentleman,</hi> who thus went on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Soul returning to <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
found her self in the like unlucky Circumstances,
as did one <hi>Hermotimus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> mentioned by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
who having procur'd the self-same Secret as
<hi>Descartes,</hi> left constantly anights, his Body
asleep in Bed, whilst his Soul went a rambling
through the World. Both one and the other,
at their return, found their Lodgings out of a
Capacity to receive them.</p>
            <p>The Task <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Soul enjoyn'd her self
then, was, to meet at <hi>Paris.</hi> She would not
tell me presently of the Accident, but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
me to take a turn or two: No sooner said
than done. With one Snuff of the Tobacco, I
equipt my self to wait on her. My Soul was
no sooner out of my Body, but she said, in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
Spiritual, she was about to tell me strange
News. I am, says she, no longer Imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd;
my Corps is this day to be interr'd at
<hi>Stockholm;</hi> and he gave me the Particulars of
what I have been relating: Nor did she seem
sab or afflicted thereupon. I then demanded of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54814:24"/>
her if she experienc'd what the <hi>Philosophers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
That the Soul being the substantial Form
of the Body, when separated for good and all,
is <hi>in statu violento.</hi> She answer'd me, she knew
nothing of that violent State, but found her
self incomparably better out, than in the Body:
And that she had but one Concern upon her, to
know in what part of the vast Space was best to
settle her Abode in. That she would take my
Directions in the thing, but that she found her
Will inclin'd for the <hi>third Heaven. The third
Heaven,</hi> according to the division <hi>Cartesius</hi>
makes of the World, is the last of all, and that
which is the farthest remov'd from us. For the
<hi>first</hi> is nothing but the <hi>Vortex,</hi> in which is plac'd
the Earth, whose Centre is the Body of the Sun,
about which, the Coelestial Matter that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the <hi>Vortex,</hi> carries us, and makes us turn
continually like the other Planets. The <hi>second</hi>
Heaven is incomparably larger than that in
which we are, and takes up all that mighty space
in which we see the fix'd Stars, which are so
many Suns, and have each of them a <hi>Vortex,</hi> of
which they are themselves the Centre, as our
Sun is of this. Lastly, the <hi>third</hi> Heaven is all
that Matter, or all that indefinite Extent, which
we conceive above the Starry Heaven, and is
void of Bounds, and in respect of which the
space of all the other may be consider'd as a
Point.</p>
            <p>Now many Reasons determin'd <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
to choose his place of Residence in the highest
Heaven. The first was, To avoid the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of an Innumerable gang of Souls of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
that were vaulting and fluttering on all
parts of this our <hi>Vortex;</hi> for, to tell you by the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54814:24"/>
way, 'tis incredible how many Souls we met up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Journey: And <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was much
surpriz'd to see the Secret, of which he took
himself to be the first Inventer, made use of in
all times, even by those of a very mean Quality,
whereby they have escap'd a dying, or whose
Souls have lost their Bodies by some Accident,
not unlike that of <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> But that which
made their Company so disrelisht, and perfectly
intolerable to <hi>Cartesius</hi> his Spirit, was, That
these Souls, so disentangled as they were from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
were tinctur'd still with Prejudice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were prepossess'd, when united with
their Bodies. That when he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verss'd
with them about the Principles of Bodies,
and the Causes of several Phoenomena's, they faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppos'd to him, or prov'd by the Authority
of <hi>Aristotle, substantial Forms, absolute Accidents,</hi>
and <hi>occult Qualities,</hi> as is done to this day in
many Schools. And except some few Souls of
the highest Rank, which he hath converted and
proselyted to <hi>Cartesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nism,</hi> all are inveterate and
inleagu'd against him with as immoderate Fury,
as the Philosophers of this World when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to publish his Doctrin here.</p>
            <p>The second Reason that byass'd him to that
Election, was, because he look'd upon those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite
Spaces as a new Discovery, of which he
was the Author. For it was upon his forming a
distinct Idea of Matter, whose Essence consisted
in Extension, that he concluded Space, Extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Matter, to be one and the same thing,
signify'd under different Names: And being it
was necessary to admit of a Space and an Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
above our World, since we have a most
clear Conception of them, it was plain, That
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54814:25"/>
above our World there was Matter too, and as
we can have no Idea of any Bounds or Limits
that Matter has, it is necessary it should be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
or rather Indefinite.</p>
            <p>Finally, the third and most prevailing Reason
of all, and which he intimated not to me, until
we arrived upon the place, is, that well, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing
the Matter above the fix'd Stars to be
uninform'd, and not yet shap'd into a World,
he was in good hopes that he was able to set it
to work himself, and fancy'd that in dividing
and agitating it, according to his <hi>Principles,</hi> he
could reduce it to a World like this, excepting
that it would be destitute of real Men, and only
stor'd with <hi>Automatous Machines</hi> in their Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
That Project was the Subject of the
most part of his Books, especially of his <hi>Book of
Principles,</hi> and that Entituled, <hi>The World of</hi>
M. Descartes. We set out immediately for the
third Heaven. I shall not descend to the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of our Voyage. I hope in a few days
you'll bear me Company there your self. I'll
only say, that upon our Coasting, we found all
Things exactly in that Portrait we had drawn
before, without Form, without due Order, or
any regular posture of the Parts, as rude and
unsightly Materials, that require the Hand of
the Artist. We survey'd it all about, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd
our selves a long time in the vast De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
of the other World; which perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to me the Face of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and that
confus'd Mass of which the Poets speak. That
enterview, as much a Spirit as I was, fill'd me
full of Horror, so hideously frightful it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.
It is notwithstanding here (<hi>said the
Spirit of</hi> M. Descartes) that I will fix; nor will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54814:25"/>
I quit this Place till the Providence of God shall
dispose of me for Eternity; he brought me into
the World to reform and re-establish the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi>
of it. I had with good success began the
Business I was sent upon; but one unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
not in my Power to foresee, prevented
me from prosecuting my Design: That shall not
hinder me from using the Knowledg he hath
given me to the best Advantage. I presume,
to accomplish here the <hi>System of my World,</hi> of
which you have seen the Draught: Matter here
is plenty and to spare, and only Motion's want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and I have all encouragement to hope,
That God, who, of his Goodness, uses to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend,
in Quality of an Universal Cause, to
the Thoughts and Inclinations of his Creatures,
conformably to their Nature, will not be
wanting to me. Being a separate Spirit, I can
lay Claim to greater Motions far than those that
set the Wheels of all the World below a going:
I shall no sooner desire the Moving of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but God, pursuant to the Laws of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
will create so much Motion as I have a
Mind to: There will be need of nothing more
than the Determination of that Motion, and the
Distribution of it, according to the particular
Necessities of every part of Matter. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
as I have heretofore explained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on Second Causes, which Province will
entirely belong to me; I know very well the
Rules; the Consequences I have drawn from
those Rules will infallibly compass my Design.
In short, I find my self in a Capacity, according
to my <hi>Principles</hi> to warrant the Success of my
Enterprise; since notwithstanding the Machine
I undertake is of an unweildy Bigness, for I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54814:26"/>
design to make it as capacious as <hi>our World,</hi> and
must be composed of an infinite different Parts,
since the Engines that must be plaid are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
since the <hi>Combinations</hi> and the different
<hi>Determinations</hi> of Motions must be infinite, it
will not be the Work of one Day, nor one Year;
half an Age is not too much for an Human Spirit
for projecting such a Grand Design: But I am
persuaded, my Principles supposed, it will be
sufficient. I shall take no Satisfaction in Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
that shall come and interrupt me, during
that Space of Time: I will now begin to enjoy
the Pleasures of Solitude, which I could never
find on Earth, and I intreat you to manifest my
Intentions thereupon to all my Friends below,
whom you think it convenient to acquaint with
my Circumstances, without telling them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
where I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for once more I say, I would
not have, them know exactly what's become of
me, nor what I am a doing: The Men there,
and especially the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> deserve not to be
admitted to the Knowledge of these great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they'd ridicule as fabulous what ever you
should say concerning me, as they did for the
most part entertain as Whim and <hi>Chimera</hi> all
that I revealed of my Project touching the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of a World.</hi> As for you, <hi>my dear Friend,</hi>
I would that you return to your Body, which

fasting may inflame it, and introduce a Fever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Above all, take Care you never finally abdicate it,

<hi>Philosophers</hi> that we met in diverse Places;
for that is contrary to the Decree of Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Mersennus,</hi> and send him hither; I'll take him
to me for an Assistant, and to keep me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Having receiv'd the last Orders of this dear
Spirit, and obtain'd Permission to give him a
Visit once at least, in three or four Years Time;
having considered the great Violence I should
suffer, in being so long distracted from him, and
the Danger likewise I was in of being so for
ever, in case I should dye during that great
Term of Years, he had destined to the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his World; we spiritually imbrac'd each
other, and I stood forwith for <hi>Paris.</hi> I cut it
through a vast number of <hi>Vortexes</hi> and <hi>Planets,</hi>
without discovering <hi>Father Mersennus;</hi> but at
last I found him out in <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which he
very much delighted, because that is a very jolly
Planet: I intimated to him the Orders I had for
him from <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> which he imbraced with
Joy, having been all-a-long his faithful Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,
and especially at <hi>Paris.</hi> Being I was
in haste for my Departure, we had not much
Discourse together, so we parted; he bent his
Course towards the third Heaven, my Spirit
took the Way that led to my own Home, where
she reunited with my Body.</p>
            <p>Since that Time I have paid <hi>M. Descartes</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
or seven Visits; the last was about two Months
ago. He assured me then, He had dispatched
almost all his <hi>Combinations,</hi> and that all was as
good as demonstrated: And unless the most
evident Principles of <hi>Geometry, Mechanicks</hi> and
<hi>Staticks</hi> were false, he was confident of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
He promised to give me notice about
this Time, to come and see him, to the end we
might take a Review together, and examine his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54814:27"/>
Design, and may be forthwith fall to work in
the <hi>Production of his World,</hi> that is to say, to
afford me the most Noble Diversion, of which
an human Soul is capable. I daily expect a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to depart, and it will be your own Fault
only (<hi>added he</hi>) if you are not a Sharer in this
Voyage, and gain a greater Stock of Knowledg
in one Day than the most reputed <hi>Cartesians</hi> have
in all their Life. This is the Sum of all I had
to say.</p>
            <p>Scarce had he made an End of speaking, but a
<hi>Country Gentleman,</hi> of no mean Rank, of a good
and genteel Presence, though I disliked the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
of his Visit at that instant, entred his
Chamber, in a Country Habit, saying, his Coach
stood ready at the Gate, and that it was Time
to go. It was a Design they had agreed on, to
take the Air for a Fortnight; which obliged me
to take my Leave of them and retire.</p>
            <p>I knew not what to think of this Relation: I
never took him for an <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> that had given
it me: And surely (thought I) this Story is too
well pursued to be a Dream. I then conceived
it might be some mysterious <hi>Allegory,</hi> containing
all the Secrets of the Sect, of which he would
give me afterwards the Explication. I applyed
my self however to the reading of my fine <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
and I compassed him during the Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
though it cost me many a Head-ake, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the too great Intention of Thought:
But I understood in the Consequence, That all
he had said was far from <hi>Allegory,</hi> and that he
ought to be taken in a Literal Sense, at the end of
his <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>old Friend</hi> being returned from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
sent me a Letter, the next Morning, in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54814:27"/>
which he notified, He would see me before four
and twenty Hours were at an end, and that I
should put my self in a Readiness for my <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>
I waited all the Day, with great Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but seeing at last he did not come, about
ten a Clock I went to Bed; half an Hour after,
being yet awake, I was amazed to hear my Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
drawn on all Sides my Bed, the Casements
of my Windows to fly open with so vast a Noise,
and to see, by the Assistance of the Moon, my
<hi>old Gentleman</hi> in the middle of the Room, and
another with him, habited in an unusual Dress:
I protest I was seized with such a sudden Dread,
that the Hair of my Head stood upright, and I
sweat all over. The <hi>old Gentleman</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to my Bed-side, said, You are fearful,
take Courage a little, Don't you know me? I
know you (<hi>answered I</hi>) in a trembling Tone,
but what could I think to see you in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
without entring at the Door, with such a
Noise and Havock as was here? What you
should, and ought to think, (<hi>said he</hi>) is, that
a Spirit separate from the Body, may enter any
where without a Key, and needs not the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of a Door: And for the Noise, it was
first to wake you, and then for the Pleasure of
surprizing you, and putting you in a little Fright.
Do not you remember the Conversation we had
together a Fortnight since? I well remember it
(<hi>said I</hi>) but was it all true you then related?
Infallibly (<hi>said he</hi>) and I now am come to make
good my Promise I then made you, of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World:</hi> Here is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Father Mersennus,</hi> who is now come from
him, to advise me all is ready; and that he would
be glad, before he puts the Design of his <hi>World</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:54814:28"/>
in Execution, to make a Tryal in the Presence
of some of his Friends; you shall be of the Party
if you think fit: I advise you not to lose so fair
an Opportunity. At the same Time <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sennus</hi>
steps up, and bowing low to the Ground,
confirmed what my old <hi>Philosopher</hi> had said, and
added, That understanding by him the Character
and Qualification of my Soul, he could undertake
for a kind Reception from <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> Pardon
<hi>Reverend Father (said I</hi>) my Astonishment, I
am not accustomed to receive such Visits: Spirits
I never saw before, and I could never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
they had been so civil and well-bred as I
now find them.</p>
            <p>Mean while, though I us'd all possible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to compose my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf, I still was somewhat
fearful: I was under strong Apprehensions there
might be Sorcery and Witchcraft in the Case,
and that under pretence of guiding me unto
<hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> they design'd to convey me
to the <hi>Witches Sabbath.</hi> On the other hand I
fear'd to affront these Gentlemen-Spirits, who
for the most part understand not Will and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
And my Memory furnish'd me with a
parallel Case, of some certain People cajol'd
with the pretence of such sort of Mysteries, till
having learn'd a part, and refusing to go on,
they had their Neck writhen by the Devil or his
Accomplices: I renounc'd all manner of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
in my self, and made use of all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
my Prudence could suggest in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture;
after which, I spoke to them as fairly
as I could, in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you make Profession of a <hi>Sect</hi> that
gives it as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> That a Man must not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to any thing but a Truth, fully and clearly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54814:28"/>
manifest: And that it is distinguishes you from
all others, and especially the Philosophers of the
Schools. The Conversation I had with this
<hi>Gentleman</hi> a fortnight ago, and the Critical Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> since, joyn'd with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Circumstances, create some Scruples in my
Mind, of which should be glad to be clear'd
before we go any farther. With you take kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what I shall propose? We will hear you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
(<hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d me, and I
began to speak with a more steady Voice. It is
not many days since I read in <hi>M. Descantes,</hi> That
<hi>the Essence of the Soul consist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in being a thinking
Substance,</hi> and that she hath neither Extension,
hor Figure, nor Colour; which I know not
how to reconcile with what I see at present:
For you give me to understand, you be purely
Spirits, yet I perceive in you different Colours,
and I see you form'd in the Figure of a Man,
and you look like Beings that are extended:
Rid me I pray you of this Perplexity. <hi>Father
Mersennus</hi> presently tool the Word. What you
propose (<hi>said he</hi>) stands to Reason: But it is
easy to answer you, and plainly to expound the
Thing by the evident Principles of true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
It is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tain a <hi>Soul</hi> is essentially a <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Substance,</hi> and that she is neither Figur'd no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Colour'd. We are purely Spirits indeed, and
though we seem to have a Face, and Hands, and
Feet; yet we have neither Face, nor Hands,
nor Feet. He must be as addle-brain'd as was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54814:29"/>
               <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and bent on Error with as great a
Zeal as he, when he ingag'd himself in that
Affair. Who thinks the Soul is not only Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
but has also Parts proportion'd to the
Body, which she animates, and is therein just
as a Sword is in the Scabbord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His devout Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that saw Souls of a blew Colour in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
had topsyturn'd his Mind upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>To make you therefore comprehend how you
see us Colour'd, Figur'd and Extended, with
Face, Hands and Feet, though we have neither
Extension, Colour, Figure, Hands nor Feet;
you must know, your Soul, whilst she is united
with the Body, cannot behold another Soul, so
as in her self she is, cannot hear her Speak; or
to explain my self more justly, cannot have the
immediate Communication of her Thoughts.
To the end then, you might know that we are
here, and that we might make you understand
our Thoughts, and the Design that brought us
hither, it was expedient to make use of means
proportion'd to the Capacity your Soul at
present's in. Now I would not have you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that for this purpose I was forc'd to frame
my self a Body of some Matter. But only call
to mind what your reading of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> ought
to teach you, That to see an Object, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto your Soul, is nothing else than to
perceive the Extension, Figures and Colours,
of that Object. That that perception is not
caus'd immediately by the Object, which being
at a distance from our Body and our Soul, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
act upon them of it self: That therefore's
done by the Reflection of Infinite Rays of Light,
which rallying from every part, and every point
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54814:29"/>
of the Object, strike and make the several
Threads to quaver, of which the Optick Nerve's
composed. That Concussion is communicated
to the Brain, and to the place of Residence of
the Soul; and it is pursuant to, and on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that Concussion, the Soul forms an Idea
of the Object which she perceives or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
in the manner we call <hi>Seeing.</hi> And it is
according to the various Modifications of
that Concussion, that she sees Objects at several
distances under divers Figures, and of different
Colours. From whence it follows, that the
Perceptions or Ideas of the Soul, have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
dependence on the Objects; but only on
the exteriour Organ, which may be prov'd by
a thousand Experiments, but especially by that
of Phrenetick People, who perceive Objects
quite different from what they really are; and
see them where they are not.</p>
            <p>Now that you may perceive a Body in the
place where I am, when no such thing is there,
it is sufficient that your interiour Organ should
be moved in such a manner, as it would be if a
Body was really there. That's the thing I now
am actually doing upon your Optick Nerve, to
make you know that I am here: That is it,
which causes you to see a Body, though in truth
there is none to see. And what I act upon the
Organ of Sight, to make a Body appear, the
same I do in proportion upon that of <hi>Hearing,</hi>
to find you Sounds and Words. I impress a like
Motion upon the Strings of your Nerves of
the fifth Conjugation, as would the Vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Undulations of the Air, were it agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the Motion of a Tongue and the
Mouth of a Man, who should stand where I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54814:30"/>
seem to do, and should utter the same Words
you at present hear.</p>
            <p>Upon these Principles it was,<note place="margin">F. Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnan.</note> that a <hi>Father</hi>
of our Order has most ingeniously unfolded the
Mysteries of the Holy Sacrament, without the
assistance of that Medly of absolute Accidents,
that could never be conceiv'd. For, says he,
when we are taught the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>I. C.</hi> is under
the appearance of Bread, nothing more is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated,
than that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>I. C.</hi> is truly
there, where the Bread was, and seems still to
us to be, to the end that Bread may appear
where the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>I. C.</hi> actually is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God acts
upon our Senses. He there produces the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
Motions, and makes the same Impressions
the Bread did before. So when our <hi>Lord</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself to St. <hi>Magdalen</hi> in the form of a
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> it was by acting upon her Eyes, just
as the Visage and Habit of the Gardiner would
have done, and not by cloathing himself with
the absolute Accidents of a Gardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r.</p>
            <p>But that which you may gather from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Experience, is, the manner how the Dead
appear, who sometimes by God's Permission
present themselves to those alive: For they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the same Method as I do actually my
self. And those Bodies of Air or Water, which
some pretend they attire themselves withal, are
only the Whym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies and Forgeries of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
who have treated of <hi>Devils craft</hi> in
supposing the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>School Philosophy.</hi>
Have you any farther Difficulty, said he, upon
that Point?</p>
            <p>Ah! (<hi>Father, reply'd I</hi>) you have made it as
clear as the Sun, and have given me infinite Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Your Discourse is altogether Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54814:30"/>
I rely not much upon the Explication of
that <hi>Father</hi> of your Order, upon the Mystery
of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> I take it for a Maxim with
the wisest of the <hi>Catholick Philosophers,</hi> That all
Novelty in such sort of Things is dangerous,
at least always ought to be suspected. You have
absolutely dispers'd the Doubts that troubled
me. It was indeed long ago that I had a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Sensation was caus'd by the Local Motion
of the Organs; but that Idea was not unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> had said it before <hi>Cartesius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arist. in Probl.</note>
but had not explain'd it. From this time forth
I renounce for ever a great part of the Ideas I
had fram'd thereupon. I solemnly abjure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, all the Axioms that respect the <hi>Active,
Passive, and passible Intellect.</hi> I acknowledg they
are Terms that signifie nothing, and are of no
use but to make the Ignorant to stare, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand them, but imagine the <hi>Philosophers</hi>
can.</p>
            <p>After that Protestation <hi>Father Mersennus</hi>'s Soul
mov'd my <hi>Organ</hi> in such a manner, as gave me
to apprehend he was well pleas'd. Which made
me take the boldness of proposing a second
Scruple. Father (said I) I don't well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what that <hi>World</hi> is of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> where
you would conduct me. For in reading <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
I did conceive his World was nothing
else, but this of ours, explain'd by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Philosophy.</hi> And I distinctly remember I
have read in a Letter, he had formerly wrote
these Words; That he should think himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving
of the Name of a <hi>Natural Philosopher,</hi>
if he could only tell how Things might be,
without demonstrating they could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
There he Bravado's it a little.<note place="margin">Let. 37. Tom. 2.</note> But that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54814:31"/>
confirms me, that when he speaks the contrary,
and says he pretends not to give an Account of
Things as they are in the World, but only how
they ought to be in a World, that he imagins
he would be angry, should we credit him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>What you say is true (<hi>reply'd Father</hi> Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus)
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> design'd not to be believed
in that Particular. So that the <hi>World of</hi> M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,
is in earnest, this World explain'd by
the <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Philosophy.</hi> But it is also
true, that there is, or rather, will be very
speedily, another World, that may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be call'd <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> since it will be
of his own Contrivance. And that's the World
with which this Gentleman, your Friend, has
entertain'd you, and that we shall give you a sight
of if you please. Nothing certainly (<hi>said I</hi>)
will be more diverting: I would quit the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
or the <hi>Festivals</hi> of <hi>Versailles,</hi> to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of this Prodigy, which doubtless, is the
compleatest Work of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the almost
Master-piece of Human Nature. But Sir (<hi>said
I, turning to my old Gentleman</hi>) the Story of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
you have formerly related, gives me some
disturbance. The Voyage you know is very
long; and a World like this he is about, is not
to be built in one Hour's time. I know my Soul
loves her Body very well, and would be much
concern'd at her return, to find it incapacitated
to receive her. And an hundred Accidents may
happen, against which no one can give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>We are provided for them all (<hi>said he:</hi>) Look

with each other, in so much that <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
thought himself oblig'd to Write against him.
Because he deprav'd his Doctrin, and made it
give Offence. <hi>M. Regius,</hi> (who if <hi>Descartes's</hi>

and gentilest Gentlemen in the World, to
revenge himself, and shew how he scorn'd, and
trampled on a thing, <hi>Cartesius</hi> set so high a rate
upon, taught it this litle <hi>Negro:</hi> One time above
the rest, he went to make use of it. Returning
one day from the Country, where his Master
had sent him, much tir'd, he sate himself under
the shade of an Oak: His Soul left his Body to
its repose and rambled for Diversion I know
not where. Mean while some Highway-men
kill'd a Man hard by him. The <hi>Grand Provost</hi>
who was near, being advis'd of the Murder, came
speedily with his <hi>Sergeants:</hi> The Noise they made

was such, that it awak't the Body of the <hi>Little

to fly. They pursue him, overtake him,
and examine him. He contradicts himself at

absence of his Soul, were not likely to be very
coherent. The <hi>Grand Provost</hi> who was a little too
expeditious in the Business, took his Flight, and

               </gap> that
was committed. The Soul returning not long
after, found her Body hanging in that rascally
Posture of a <hi>Malefactour.</hi> Forc'd then, as she
was, to seek a now Abode, she was in a miserable
condition. The majority of separate souls
which play in all the vast extent of the World,
being Souls of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and Souls of great
Importance, and having in a Convention held
by the most considerable of them, declar'd that
Opinion of <hi>Philosophy</hi> true, that holds an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
in Souls of the same Species: They
would no ways admit that the Soul of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Negro</hi> should enjoy the same Priviledge as
they, and gave her chase througout the Universe.
In short, her good Fortune would, that she should,
attempt to pass our <hi>Vortex</hi> and arrive at the
very place <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Soul had pitch'd upon to
Meditate. He had Compassion on her, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
her the liberty to live with him. <hi>Father
Mersennus</hi> brought her hither, in Case there
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54814:32"/>
should be occasion, and we'll leave her with your
Body to take care on't.</p>
            <p>The Retail of a Story so well circumstanc'd,
induc'd me to credit what was said, as true. I
intreated both the <hi>Spirits</hi> to excuse the Transport<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I was guilty of telling them, that the Figure
and Colour he made use of to appear in, being
the same the Devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> printed on my
Mind that horrible <hi>Idea.</hi> I desir'd them to give
me some Instructions, how I must be rigg'd to
accompany them in that wondrous Voyage, that
they propos'd; saying, I hop'd to make infinite
Advantage of the Favour they vouchsafed me, and
in their Society, to return so choice a Treasure
of Knowledge, as would distinguish me from
the rest of Mankind. Three things, say's
<hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> you have to do: The first is, To
dismantle your Mind of all the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of
Childhood, and the <hi>ordinary Philosophy.</hi> For 'tis
strange to see how the Prejudices the Soul sucks
in but by the Senses, should make so deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on the Understanding, with Time and
Custom; which she chooses for the Rule of her
Opinions. In so much, that Souls separated
form their Bodies, otherwise than by Death,
although during that separation they act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on the Senses, do yet think, judge and
reason conformably to their prejudice. Without
that Precaution, you'l make a fruitless Voyage,
and be but where you are, at your return.</p>
            <p>The second Requisite before our embarquing
is, That you give Orders to this <hi>little Spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
after what Method he must treat your Body in
your absence. Whereupon it is advisable to
let you know, that when your Soul shall be in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54814:33"/>
state of Separation, all things will be carried on
in the usual Road, not only as to Natural Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but as to those Motions caus'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Objects; provided that you leave the
Machine mounted in the same manner, as it is
at present. So that if you us'd to wake, and
rise at the sound of an Alarm, or at a certain
Hour, as soon as that Hour shall strike, the
Motion of the <hi>Timpanum</hi> of your Ears communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to your Brain, shall make way for the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits to glide along the Muscles, and to
produce in your Legs and Arms, and your
whole Body, such Motions as daily you your
self produc'd, for the taking of your Breeches,
then your Doublet, and the rest of your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances,
after one an other, and dressing
you from Head to Foot. It shall walk as it us'd
to do; traverse all the House upstairs, and
down. It shall s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at it self at Table, as soon as
the voice of the Page crying <hi>Dinner Sir is ready,</hi>
shall strike upon its Ears: It shall Eat, shall
Drink, and in a word, perform every Action it
has been accustom'd to; the Animal Spirits
never failing to take their course towards cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
parts of the Body, at the presence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Objects, and by consequence producing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
certain Motions in the Body, in certain
Circumstances. Now in all External Actions
that we do, there is nothing but Motion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
this way. And hence it is that Beasts who
are undoubtedly as Meer Machines as our Body,
seem to us at the same time to act both with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and Uniformity.</p>
            <p>The only Mischief that you need to fear, is,
in case a Friend should come to visit you: Because
the Body, without the Soul, would be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54814:33"/>
to maintain discourse, and must answer very
impertinent to the Thing in hand. For betwixt
our selves it is only by Discourse that we <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesians</hi>
know that those Bodies we commonly call
Men, are truly <hi>Men,</hi> and not meerly <hi>Machines:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Let. 53. de Desc. Tom. 1.</note>
But herein it is this <hi>Little Negro</hi> will be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> hath taught him all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Motions, possible to be made upon the
Pineal Gland; and all the various Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
of which the Animal Spirits are capable
by its means: And how the Words are form'd
in the Mouth, only by the motion of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that stir the Tongue, the lower Jaw, and
Lips: And how particular Words are fram'd,
only by the certain Motions of the Muscles,
caus'd by that of the Animal Spirits, according
to the different Questions, a Friend, suppose,
that gives you a visit in the absence of your
Soul should propound to you. The <hi>Little Negro</hi>
by the various Motions he shall then impress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Gland, and, from thence upon the
Animal Spirits, and Muscles, shall form with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
failure in your Mouth the Words that ought
to be spoke, and such Answers as the Questions
shall demand. And fear not he should make
your Body speak any thing unbecoming of your
Soul: For I'll say that for him, <hi>Negro</hi> as he is, he
is no Fool.</p>
            <p>You may take yet an other way: It is but
leaving your Body in the Bed, where it is, and
in the Trance you'l put it by the taking Snush
for the separating of your Soul. That Trance
which consists in slackning the Sensitive Nerves,
is not attended with any further trouble: Mean
while, this <hi>little Negro,</hi> shall make your Figure,
and shall so exactly Personate you, as if your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54814:34"/>
Soul had made no expedition: And in that there' I
be no difficuty, no more than is in my appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Formalities of <hi>a Friar,</hi> and this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
in the same Physiognomy, and dress
you us'd to see him, as I have but just now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
it to you. And to observe to you by the
by; you see the <hi>Cartesian Philosophy</hi> teaches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Sin, what <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus</hi> and many
other <hi>Magicians</hi> could not do, without first
giving themselves to the Devil.</p>
            <p>The third and last Thing you have to do, is,
To take a little of the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Snush, which
he has brought you; so we'll hoise Sale, and stand
off for the Road that will bring us to <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having return'd thanks to <hi>Father Mersennus</hi>
for the Instructions and Light he was pleas'd to
give me; I assur'd him, as for the first Article, I
durst undertake; for that I had all along been
somewhat <hi>Sceptical</hi> in point of <hi>School<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Philosophy,</hi>
and that my Mind was free from the contagion
of <hi>Prejudice,</hi> that commonly is caught there:
And as to the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Infancy, the reading
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> had taught me to distrust them.
And that whilst he was Discoursing I had arm'd
my self with a fresh Resolution, of assenting to
nothing but what I should most distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
following <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s advice. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to mention another Resolution I had made,
which was, To fore arm my self, at least, as
much against the Opinionativeness of the <hi>Cartesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
as the <hi>ordinary Philosophers,</hi> well knowing they
were as much conceited as their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Touching his Directions, that respected my
Body, in my Soul's Absence, I closed with the
second Proposal; Seeing (<hi>said I) Reverent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54814:34"/>
it seems more simple and feasible than the
former. I like it well (<hi>quoth he</hi>) since 'tis
one of our <hi>Maxims</hi> in any System, to choose the
most simple way, and that which costs least
Trouble. However, that was not the Reason
that resolv'd me, but because I thought therein
less Danger, and was not so firmly persuaded
that my Body would be so expert and active in
the Absence of my Soul, as was pretended;
and also because the Instance of Brutes which
was urged, made little Impression on my Mind,
unable to discard those Prejudices a Soul capable
of Sense and Reason had confirmed. I de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired
<hi>Father Mersennus</hi> to give Orders to the <hi>Little
Black to sute himself with my Person,</hi> 'to fee if it
would fit him: Forthwith it was done; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
another <hi>me</hi> at my Beds Feet, as the <hi>Sosia of
Amphitryon</hi> saw another <hi>Sosia</hi> before his Lady's
Gate, at his Return from the Camp; only with
this Difference, that <hi>I</hi> at my Bed's Feet asked
very courteously to <hi>me</hi> in the Bed, whereas the
<hi>Sosia</hi> who return'd from the Army was well
cudgelled by <hi>himself Sosia,</hi> who stood before the
Gate of <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mena.</hi> I recommended to him above
all the fast bolting of my Chamber-door, that
no Body might enter, and the frequent visiting
my Body Day by Day, and admonishing him
to take Care it might always lye in a Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Posture.</p>
            <p>Upon my <hi>old Sophi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter</hi>'s presenting me a Dose
of Snush, I demanded if it was the True: For I
remembred I had heard a Story of one <hi>Apuleius,</hi>
that one <hi>Qui pro Quo</hi> metamorphosed into an
Ass at the same Time he expected to become a
Bird. He told me, he carried but one sort, and
that there was no Danger of Mistaking: I then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54814:35"/>
presently took it, and sneezed (God bless me)
three or four Times, with mighty Violence.
Hereupon I fell into a Swoon, like that of
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> I described before, and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
my Soul, by the only Act of the Will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her enlargement from the Body.</p>
            <p>I intend not to enter upon the Retail of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
I made upon my Soul, and on my Body,
when they were divorced from one another; I
will only say, I began from that Moment to
perceive the Strength of Prejudice and Conceit,
in obstructing the Knowledg of Truth; and how
wise and rational is the Advice <hi>M. Descartes</hi> and
his Followers give, precautioning us on that
Respect, and yet at the same time, how little
Care those Gentlemen had to make use of the
Rules they prescribe to others. For the first
thing <hi>my Gentlemen</hi> would persuade me, whether
I would or not, was, that my Soul in the instant
of Separation, saw herself seated on the <hi>pineal
Gland.</hi> As I judged it unfitting to begin with
them by a palpable Contradiction; I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That the Separation was performed so
heedlesly, I had no Time to make that Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What I said was true, and was also the
least disobliging Answer I could find; for I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
remembred, and was throughly convinc'd
of what I had lately read in <hi>M. Stenon</hi> the great
Anatomist, who was a great admirer of <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
and look'd upon him as the ingenious
Contriver of a <hi>Novel Man,</hi> but shew'd and prov'd
by ocular Demonstration,<note place="margin">Anatomie du cerveau.</note> this <hi>Man</hi> of his a
quite different Creature from <hi>that</hi> which God
Created: And that the <hi>Pineal Gland</hi> has not the
Situation, much less is capable of those Motions
attributed to it, upon that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> That the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54814:35"/>
Vessels with which it is encompassed, are not
Arteries, which might supply it with the Matter
of the Animal Spirits, as <hi>M. Descartes</hi> supposes;
but only Veins, that by consequence the Honour
and Priviledge it has given it, of being the
Closet of the Soul, is without Foundation; and
that perhaps it deserves not to be advanced
(upon any more considerable Employ it has)
above the other Glands, whose Office is usually
of no great Importance in an <hi>Animal Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were my Thoughts, though I kept them
to my self; and I was desirous, as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to accompany them in their Sentiments.
I first observed to them how Digestion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in my Body, though my Soul was absent,
by the only Vertue of that <hi>Acid Humor</hi> in the
Stomach, which, by the Agitation of its insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Parts, dissolves Meats no otherwise than
<hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> dissolves Metals: How the most
subtle Parts, separated from one another, made
a Cream-like Liquor, called the <hi>Chyle:</hi> How the
<hi>Peristaltique</hi> Motion of the Guts served to drive
down the grosser Parts, and to give admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the <hi>Chyle</hi> into the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> of the
<hi>Mesentery,</hi> through the imperceptible Pores,
proportioned to the Figure of the Particles the
<hi>Chyle</hi>'s composed of: How upon the Heats stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in my Heart, just as before, the Blood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
its circular usual Course, continuing all
the consequent Effects, such as Nutrition, and
the sound Constitution of the Limbs, placed at
the greatest Distance: How, in short all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were carried on, by the only <hi>Clockwork</hi> of
the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here the Sticklers for the old Philosophy
must not resent the Compliance I used on this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54814:36"/>
Occasion; for if all that was absolutely false, it
could never have been true in this present Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
seeing my Body was not corrupted, tho'
my Soul had left it; but if the Motion and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Humours once had ceased, it must
of necessity have been corrupted: Whence it
follows, That supposing my Soul separate from
my Body, as I do then suppose it was, it is plain
that all the Motions were performed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
only by their Dependance on the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last we thought of setting out: I ask'd
then what Names and Titles of Dignity or
Respect Souls used to treat each other with in
their Spiritual Conversation; for that Souls
being in <hi>French</hi> of the Feminine Gender, I was
guilty all-a-long of an Absurdity, in calling the
Soul of <hi>M.</hi> by the Name of <hi>Monsieur,</hi> yet I
durst not use <hi>Madam</hi> nor <hi>Mademoiselle.</hi> As
for you (<hi>said I to</hi> Father Mersennus<hi>'s Soul</hi>) I
may ease my self of that Trouble for the future,
by using <hi>your Reverence;</hi> so you may, said he,
by addressing M—s Soul with <hi>your Lordship,</hi>
both Titles <hi>are all a mode</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and arriv'd
from thence in <hi>France.</hi> But trouble not your
Head about it, we continue the same Names we
had in the World when in our Bodies, <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
is <hi>M. Descartes</hi> still; this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is what
he was before; I am called <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi>
as you are <hi>M—,</hi> for we <hi>Cartesians</hi> are a little
<hi>Platonical</hi> in the Business. With <hi>Plato</hi> what's a
Man? He's a Soul that makes use of a Body:
And you may call to Mind a Particular Passage
among others in <hi>Cartesius his Method,</hi> where he
says, <q>Examining with Attention what I was,
and that I could conceive my Body to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54814:36"/>
and on the contrary, if I did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
a Moment without thinking, I had no
Reason to believe I had an Existence in that
Moment—I conceived I was a thing, or a
Substance, whose whole Nature and Essence
did meerly consist in thinking; so that my
self (I mean my Soul, by whose means only I
am, what I am) my self, I say, is a thing
wholly distinct from my Body. </q>
And I wonder
(<hi>added</hi> Father Mersennus) the <hi>Philosophers</hi> and
<hi>School-Divines</hi> have escaped this Passage, and have
not before this ranked it in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of his
pretended Errors; especially since <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>
reflected on it by the by. But let's be gone, said
he, and let's make haste, we have lost a whole
half Hour already; Time's very precious: And
with that he Soars up in the Air with the Soul of
the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> and I without any more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs,
set out to follow them.</p>

            <p>THE Weather was very serene, the
Air extreamly clear, the Moon was
in the Full, and the Stars glittered,
methought, in an extraordinary
manner, which made me wonderful impatient
to contemplate those Glorious Bodies more nigh
them, whose Splendor, Vastness, Number and
Order have been thought a Subject of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by all Ages, the worthiest Object of the
Study and Meditation of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and most
sensible Proof of the <hi>Divinity;</hi> notwithstanding
which, my Guides caused me to make a Halt
upon the Pinnacle of a Tower, raised far above
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54814:37"/>
the rest of the Town, to observe the Nature of
the Air of that low Region, and the Parts of
which it is composed. Come on (<hi>says my old
Gentleman</hi>) you shall know by your own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
the Truth of <hi>Descartes</hi> his Sentiments,
in the Explication of Natural Beings. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what he says in his <hi>fourth Book of Principles,</hi>
that the Air is only an Amass of branched and
ragged Parts, of the <hi>third Element,</hi> extreamly
small, sever'd from one another, and floating in
the middle of the Balls of the <hi>Second Element,</hi>
whose Motions they obey. See how the Parts of
the <hi>First Element</hi> are mingled through the whole,
and fill up all the Intervals the little Globules
and the branch'd Parts leave betwixt them; how
the Fluidity of this Body, as well as all other
we call Liquids, consists in the Motion of its
insensible Parts, which have an indifferent Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to any Side; for being they are all in
Motion, and have mostly quite different Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
we may readily conceive two things:
First, That upon a Liquid Body's ceasing to be
confined and bounded by a Solid one, it must
diffuse itself on every Side, since it's Parts are in
a Motion every way. Secondly, That upon a
solid Body's offering to pass through, finding all
the Parts in Motion, it easily makes a Separation;
since, to do this, 'tis only requisite to give them
different Determinations instead of those they
had before; it being certain that when Bodies,
and especially small ones, are in Motion, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so different as that in which the little Parts
are found, 'tis the easiest thing in Nature to give
them new Determinations, and by consequence
to divide a Liquid Body, and pass through
it. These two Phaenomena's then of a Liquid
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54814:38"/>
Body, being explain'd so cleverly and so intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
as you see they are, by the <hi>Principles</hi> of
Philosophy; the <hi>Gentlemen Philosophers of the
Schools</hi> would have a great Sway over my Mind,
if they would oblige me to acknowledge Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity
for an absolute Accident, distinguish'd
from the Motion of the Insensible Parts of a
Liquid Body.</p>
            <p>As much inclined as I was to defend the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of the <hi>old Philosophy,</hi> I must own this
Reasoning, joyned with that I saw my self,
made great Impression on my Mind; for though
I could perceive no such Thing as the little Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> of which he talk'd,
and which was a meer Illusion of a Soul intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
as much as possible, with the <hi>Ideas</hi> and
<hi>Prejudices of Cartesianism;</hi> yet I was forced to
Acknowledg in the Air those little insensible
Parts loose and disingaged of one another, that
undoubtedly constitute all Liquid Bodies. I
plainly saw that <hi>subtle Matter</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi>
himself acknowledged under the Name of <hi>Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
Matter, and taught to be dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World, in a most rapid Motion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I could not disallow that plain Explication
he had made of the Properties of a Liquid Body:
And I must grant, That were <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
as reasonable in all its Parts as this, I
might be a little tempted to turn <hi>Cartesian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
troubling my self to dispute the Globules
with him of the <hi>Second Element,</hi> or offering such
other Doubts and Scruples as then came into my
Mind; with entire Submission I complemented
upon all the rest, both these Companions of my
<hi>Voyage;</hi> that is to say, upon the <hi>subtle Matter,</hi>
and on that <hi>branchy Matter,</hi> which I termed in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54814:38"/>
their Language without more ado, the <hi>Matter of
the First and Third-Element.</hi> I much applauded
their Explication of Fluidity, and commended
it for its Neatness and Simplicity; but a little
Adventure turned the Discourse, and had like
to have spoiled the Fruit of all my former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plasance.</p>
            <p>There was on the top of the Tower on
which we lighted, a kind of a Twirl that was in
the Nature of a Weather-Cock, about seven
Inches Diameter; its Substance was of Plate of
Steel, very thin and light; its Sails were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
equal, and the Pin on which it turn'd,
smooth and polish'd: So that the gentlest Gale of
Wind set it a going, and at the same time
turn'd about a bent Iron Rod (for the observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the point of the Wind) whose end made
the Axis to the Twirl. It fortun'd that a <hi>Soldier</hi>
of a <hi>Suitz</hi> Regiment that quartered in the Town,
discharg'd his Musket in the Air: It was loaded
with two Bullets, one of which as it flew, but
just glanc'd upon the end of one of the Flyers of
the Twirl: And yet impress'd so considerable a
Motion as lasted a long time. The Bullet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
its Motion almost in a right Line, and
went very near as far and as swift, as the other
Bullet that never touch'd upon the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock.
I had good Reason to take notice of that
last Circumstance. <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> slipt not
that occasion to demonstrate to me another of
<hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Principles. You see (<hi>said he</hi>)
these Flyers; if that Ball had not slanted upon
one of them in passing, seeing there is not any
breeze of Wind, do you think they would have
left that quiet Posture they were in, and turn'd
themselves about? No certainly (<hi>I reply'd.</hi>)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54814:39"/>
The posture they were in a Moment since, could
never have been chang'd for that they are in at
present, but by the assistance of some External
Cause that has made that alteration. But now
(<hi>added he</hi>) that they are in a directly contrary
State, do you believe they could quit the same,
without the determination of some other Cause
that should destroy their Motion, as the Bullet
did their Rest? <hi>Father (said I</hi>) that Question
seems more difficult than the other to resolve:
I have heard it always held, as an unquestionable
Axiom, That every Body, whilst it is in Motion,
tends to its Repose as to its end. We'll grant
you (<hi>reply'd he</hi>) that Philosophick Banterage
every Body, whilst in Motion, has a tendency
to rest, as to its end. A Body is endu'd with
Reason and a Will, first to have an end, and
then to make unto it. But if that Proposition is
capable of receiving any tolerable meaning, it
says no more than this, That in the situation
and disposition Bodies have among themselves in
the World, sensible Bodies that are mov'd do
truly lose their Motion by Degrees, upon the
opposition they receive from other Bodies, to
which it is communicated, and at length they
rest. For if nothing did destroy that State of
Motion it would last for ever, by the same Rule,
that if nothing did disturb the rest of a Body,
it would always remain immoveable. And this
it is of which I had a desire to convince you,
by the Example of this little Wind-mill, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
has presented us.</p>
            <p>Supposing this Gimcrack had turn'd in
the midst of Water, as it does in the midst of
Air, it is a plain Case, it's Motion would
quickly have been destroy'd by the great Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54814:39"/>
the Water would have made. If two of
its Sails had been longer, larger and heavier,
than the other two, the Motion had ceas'd soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
yet: Because that inequality would have been
another Cause of a more forcible Resistance.
Again, if you add to this, that the Pin on which
it turns had been thicker, as also rusty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polish'd,
the Motion had been lost still sooner,
for the same Reason. But because it stands in
Air, and in Air that's very fine; because it Sails
are exactly pois'd, and its <hi>Axis</hi> slender, smooth
and polish'd, the Resistance that it finds is less,
and the Motion so much greater, and longer it
will last. Whence we may thus conclude: Much
Resistance destroys much Motion; a less Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
destroys less; and a lesser yet, destroys
a lesser Motion still; and so on: Hence, if
there was no Resistance at all, the Motion would
not flag, but continue always; hence as a Body
would maintain its Rest, unless an external
Cause disturbed it in the Possession of that State,
so a Body would continue its Motion, as long as
it should meet no Molestation in it. So then,
the great Principle of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> is establish'd,
That a Body of its own Nature stays always in
the Capacity it is plac'd; if it is at rest 'twil
always rest; if it is of a Triangular Figure it
will be of a Triangular Figure always; if it is
in Motion it will for ever be so: But for the rest
this Principle is not peculiar to <hi>Descartes, Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi>
before him, <hi>Gassendus, Hobbes, Maignan,</hi> &amp;c.
suppose it true. And I remember likewise, That
in making my <hi>Collections</hi> for my <hi>Commentaries
upon</hi> Genesis, where I have introduced an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Number of <hi>Philological, Philosophical</hi> and
<hi>Astronomical Dissertations,</hi> I have remarked more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54814:40"/>
than one Place in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> where he either
teaches of supposes the same Doctrin; and
<hi>Vasques</hi> one of the subtlest of the <hi>School Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
has proved it at large, as to the concern of
Motion: It may however be said, that no one
ever carried it to that Pitch, and used it so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously,
and with that Advantage as <hi>Descartes;</hi>
and thence it was that particular Difference and
Honour was paid him rather than to others upon
that respect.</p>
            <p>I am much of your Opinion (<hi>I returned,</hi>)
That General Principle is without Controversie
one of those, the Mind of Man admits without
offering Violence to itself; and the Difficulty
that is found in applying it to Bodies, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in Motion, proceeds only from that false
Idea, so commonly received, of what we call
<hi>Modes</hi> in Philosophy, and from our conceiting
Motion as a <hi>positive being,</hi> and Rest as <hi>its Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
though neither Motion is a Being, nor Rest
the Privation of a Being, but one and the other
are different and contrary States, of which a
Body Natural is capable. But, <hi>Reverend Father,</hi>
this Whirl-gig here has raised a Scruple in me,
of which I'd fain discharge my Conscience; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is grounded on another Principle of <hi>Descartes,</hi>
concerning which you may call to mind, if you
please, that the Ball that touch'd the Sail, seeing
it but glanced upon it, lost nothing, or next to
nothing of its Motion, that it had so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and we saw it arrive to its Journey's
End as soon as (at least was but a Trice behind
hand with) the other that never touched at all;
and on the other Hand impressed a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Motion on the Engine: For whether we
measure the Quantity of the Motion, by the Bulk
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54814:40"/>
Compass of the Body moved; or whether we
measure it by the largeness of the Space traversed
by the Body, in those innumerable Circles it
described, spight of the Resistance of the <hi>medium</hi>
wherein it turned: Or likewise whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the swiftness of the Motion, it is manifest
the Ball communicated much more Motion to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he other Body than it lost itself: And on the
contrary, granting the supposition you have just
made unto my Hands, to demonstrate a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of <hi>Descartes;</hi> I mean, that the Sails had
been unequally ballanc'd, and of a different Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that the <hi>Axle</hi> had been Gross, unsmooth,
or rusty, and that the Ball had grazed on one
of the Sails less obliquely than it did, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
in these Circumstances the Ball had lost
much more of its swiftness and its Motion, yet
would have impress'd or communicated much
less than it hath at present. What now's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of those grand Principles of <hi>M. Descartes?</hi>
that a Body at the same instant that it moves
another, communicates exactly so much Motion
to it as it loses, and precisely loses the same
Quantity it communicates; for here the Bullet
communicates a great deal, but loses little; and
in the other Supposition it loses much, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
but little: What now becomes of those
mighty <hi>Axioms</hi> that lay the Foundation of his
<hi>Physicks,</hi> and support the whole Frame and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of his <hi>World?</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> That God in the Creation
of the World, or Matter, created at the same
Time in it a definite Quantity of Motion, or
<hi>Transport</hi> (as he himself styles it) from one
Place to another, which is always the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Increase or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diminution, although the Parts
of which the World's composed, have sometimes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54814:41"/>
more and sometimes less of it; forasmuch as
what is lost in me, is of Necessity received into
another: That God is the universal Cause of all
the Motion in the World: That the Creatures
have no Pretence to its Production, and can only
determine that produced already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if a
Body communicates more than it has in it self,
God or the Body it self must needs produce the
<hi>overplus</hi> of the new; and if a Body loses more
than it communicates, that which is lost and not
communicated, must of necessity be annihilated.
And this is sufficient to demonstrate that the
Quantity of Motion is not always the same in the
World, but on the contrary it increases and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
every Moment. In a Word, we see here
a considerable Part of Matter put into a rapid
Motion that before had none at all. I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it was in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> and that a little
thing would turn the Scales; that will not do
our Business, it will still be true to say, there is
a new <hi>Transport</hi> communicated to a large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Matter: That that Transport is no
small one, since it carries a great deal of Matter
through a great deal of Space; yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ball hath not lost the least imaginable, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is carried as far, and as swift, within a Trifle,
as it would have been if it had communicated
none at all. But that which seemed of most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
was, the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God, that was
interessed in this Affair: For the Reason why
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> was so zealous to preserve the same
Quantity of Motion to a Grain, was because
God's unchangable. See where this Trifie now
has led us? But what a Mischief would it be, if
this petty Instance overturning the Principle of
the Quantity of Motion, should shatter all those
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54814:41"/>
               <hi>Seven</hi> fine <hi>Rules</hi> of Motion <hi>Descartes</hi> has esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
with so exact a Calculation? Mean while
they all take it for granted, and subsist but on
the Courtesie of that Supposition; however he
makes no Scruple to conclude his Explication
with this remarkable Passage, <hi>All this is so evident
it needs no Demonstration.</hi>

there began to play the Philosopher; I mean, of
avoiding, above all things, a too heady for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
in his Determinations, and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
any Principle, without examining of
it with all possible Diligence, and upon greater
Evidence than the most palpable Demonstrations
in Geometry afford; of having so strict an Eye
in every thing, and of making so exact an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis</hi>
of all the Propositions he advanc'd, that he
might be certain nothing could escape him; for

            <p>I foresaw that this Discourse would not relish

Things in my Discourse, a little Malignity in
my Reflections, abundance of false <hi>Prejudice</hi> that
still stuck by me, whatever Assurance I had given
to the contrary, and some Difficulties at the
Bottom, for the clearing of which it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to discourse <hi>Cartesius:</hi> But let them (<hi>said
he</hi>) seem as Big and as Frightful as they can,
they will presently disappear, upon his convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you; I have experienced it an hundred
Times. No Man was ever more troublesome
to him in Questions than my self, which I us'd
to make on all Occasions, even 'till I wearied
him. These Difficulties once I thought inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable;
but one Letter, of about a Page he wrote
me, dispersed all my Doubts, and gave me more
Light into the Matters then in Hand, than the
entire Volumes of other Men. I much expected
the Reproach of Prejudice, for that's the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Refuge of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> and the Gentlemen his
Disciples, when they find themselves press'd a
little home: I urged however that Point no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to him; I only excused my self from the
Malignity he charged upon my Reflections, and
upon the Hopes he gave me of the Solution of
my Difficulties by <hi>M. Descartes, (I rejoyn'd)</hi>
You exceedingly rejoyce me, Reverend Father,
for I am a Cartesian in my Heart, though I am
not a through pac'd one in my Mind, wanting
sufficient Light to extricate my Doubts, which
the Reading the Books of that Great Man has
raised in me; but I have a sincere Love for Truth,
and assure your self, I shall wholly resign my self
up unto her, so soon as <hi>M. Descartes</hi> shall present
her to me.</p>
            <p>After that Protestation, which seemed a little
to reinstate me in their good Oponion, we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54814:42"/>
launch'd again: And it will not be amiss to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
my Reader here, this once for all, That
whatever Room these Harangues and Disputes
take up upon the Paper, they lasted but one single
instant, since separate Spirits entertain each other
a quite different way from that they use when in
the Body, whose Tongue pronounces but one
Syllable at a Time; one Spiritual Word that a
Separate Soul shall speak unto another Soul, is
more full and expressive than a thousand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
or written: And since my taking of
this <hi>Voyage</hi> I have made a World of fine Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
for the explaining the Way that Angels
discourse together; I question not but to be in
Print some Time or other upon that Occasion:
I confess I shall speak many Things that for
want of Use will not be understood; but my
<hi>Book</hi> may find no less a Welcome and Esteem for
that, but rather the good Fortune Books of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
Divinity</hi> have met with, that have been
for some Time the only ones in Fashion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
meerly by their being unintelligible
to those that read them, and pretending to be
understood by the Composers; for it is known
by too manifest Experience, the Authors of
those Books are not always such mighty Saints as
they would seem.</p>
            <p>We parted then from the Top of the Tower,
before the Instrument desisted from its turning,
and we steered towards the <hi>Globe</hi> of the
<hi>Moon:</hi> My Soul perceived an unspeakable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to scud it in the Air, and to wander in
those vast Spaces, she could only travel with the
Eye before, when united with the Body; that
minded me of a former Delight I had sometime
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asted in my Sleep, in dreaming that I whipt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54814:43"/>
through the Air, without ever touching Ground,
above which I thought my self exalted many
Yards.</p>
            <p>We met upon the Road vast Troops of
Separate Souls, of all Nations, <hi>Laplanders,
Finlanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Olaus mag. l. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 17. Tert. de anima.</note> 
               <hi>Brachmans;</hi> and I then remembred
what I had read in several Books, That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of separating the Soul and Body was known
among those People. But about fifty Leagues
on this side that Planet, there is a Region very
well stock'd, especially with <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and
those <hi>Stoicks</hi> for the generality: And quite from
that Place to my Arrival at the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi>
I descryed how swingingly History belies an
infinite Number of Persons, that it supposes
dead, like other Men; though, in truth, they
are no more Dead than <hi>M. Descartes himself.</hi> I
shall discourse with some of them as I go
along.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> has an Atmosphere like the Earth,
that by a moderate Computation may amount to
three French Leagues in height. As we were
just ready to strike Sail, we made a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from us, three Souls that held a very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conference together; we judged they might
be Souls of Consequence, by the deference many
others in their Retinue seemed to pay them:
Upon our enquiring who they were, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
they were <hi>Socrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
that were met in Consult, for the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
for that being advised by certain News
from <hi>our World,</hi> That the <hi>Venetians</hi> had beaten
the <hi>Turks,</hi> not only out of <hi>Ancient Peloponesus,</hi>
but also the Famous City of <hi>Athens,</hi> where here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
these three Philosophers had made so great
a Figure; they had resolved in their Debate,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54814:43"/>
so soon as any <hi>Noble Venetian</hi>'s Soul should arrive
in these Quarters, to petition her to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their Interest to <hi>General Morisini</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>'s
Consideration; To require the replacing
the Statues the <hi>Athenians</hi> had erected to them;
To re-establish the Academy and the <hi>Lyceum</hi>
with all their Priviledges, and to restore the
Marbles in the <hi>Prytaneum,</hi> whereon was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Justification of <hi>Socrates,</hi> with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations
charged on <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi> his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers:
And in case they should push their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
as far as <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to have as great
regard for <hi>Stagyra,</hi> at present <hi>Liba nova,</hi> as
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had formerly on the account
of his Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose Country that was.
I am surprized, says <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> to see
these <hi>Philosophers;</hi> I never heard any Mention of
them here, nor did I ever meet them in all my
Travels: It is true, I have observed in my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries

used to quit their Bodies, the better to

<hi>Voyage,</hi> and where we were a going.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> took the Word, and made
answer, We were upon a Visit to a Friend of
ours, that lived at a vast Distance; that we were
happy in timing our <hi>Voyage</hi> so exactly, as to
have the Opportunity of paying our most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Respects to those <hi>Personages,</hi> that have given
Renown and Glory to Antiquity, and whose
Names after the Tract of two thousand Years
were still acknowledged and held Venerable by
all the Nations in the Earth.</p>
            <p>'Tis believed below we are dead, said <hi>Socrates;</hi>
True (<hi>replyed</hi> Father Mersennus) and I my self
was guilty of that Universal Mistake: But here
are <hi>two Gentlemen (continued he)</hi> meaning us,
that are still Inhabitants of the <hi>lower World,</hi> and
who will undeceive it as to that Particular. I
shall not be sorry, for my part, answered he;
and it would not be amiss to acquaint the People
there, That the Soul of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> such as I
am, staid not to be dismissed from the World by
the Decree of a Faction of Corrupt Judges,
and the Clamours of a Multitude, incensed by
the Envy and Buffoonry, of a Coxcomb of a
<hi>Comedian.</hi> Hear the State of the Matter; well
knowing the Rage and Popularity of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I thought it not worth while to stay, but
quitting my Body, I gave Orders to my <hi>Familiar
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54814:45"/>
Spirit,</hi> to enter in my Room, and to put a good
Face upon the Business to the End; being more
Secure of his Performance than my own, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Constancy and Resolvedness I found in my
self. He acted his part to a Tittle; and I scarce
think 'tis yet forgotten in the World, what
Constancy appeared both in my Looks and
Words, when the Sentence of my Death was
heard pronounced; with what Undauntedness I
was seen to take from the Executioner the Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock-potion
that poisoned my Body, and the
Fury of my Accusers, that were ready to burst
with Malice, to see me a <hi>Philosopher</hi> to the last.
It is true (<hi>I replyed</hi>) that last Action of your
Life has procured you a vast esteem among Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
to this Day, and I question whether it
will make for your Glory, for us to publish the
true Matter of the Fact, as you have related
it. No matter (<hi>said he</hi>) I have still a greater
Love for Truth than my own Glory, and am
more concerned for <hi>Her</hi> than for <hi>my self.</hi> Most
bravely answered (<hi>I cry'd</hi>) and worthy of your
self; That one Sentence is worth all the Oration
your <hi>Demon</hi> harangued your Friends with, to
comfort them in your Death, and I am resolved
it shall lose nothing of its Value in the Carriage.
If one fine Wit of our World had but heard it,
he would certainly have canonized you for't; he,
I say, that in reading your Story, was much put
to't to forbear an Invocation, and crying <hi>Sancte</hi>
Socrates <hi>ora pro nobis</hi> (That Extravagance is
known to be <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s, and <hi>Socrates</hi> himself
thought it very impertinent.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> next obliged us to disabuse the World
of those false Reports, that were current of his
Death; some making him dye of the Colick;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54814:45"/>
others affirming he poisoned himself; others
again, That he drowned himself in <hi>Euripus;</hi>
these last came nearest to the Truth. He told
us then, That being disgraced, and banished
from the <hi>Court,</hi> upon Suspicion he was dipt in
the Conspiracy of <hi>Calisthene,</hi> his Friend, against
<hi>Alexander,</hi> he retreated to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he
opened his School of <hi>Philosophy;</hi> That he was
there impeached of <hi>Atheism,</hi> as groundlessly as
<hi>Socrates,</hi> by a <hi>Priest of Ceres;</hi> which obliged him
to retire to <hi>Calcis:</hi> That one Day as he was
taking a Turn upon the Bank of <hi>Euripus,</hi> and
recollecting in his Mind the glorious Advantages
he had lost, of making his Fortune, seeing all
his Hopes unravelled, that he was for ever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded
from the <hi>Court,</hi> and discharged from
<hi>Athens,</hi> the Melancholy that seiz'd him made
him resolve to leave the World; that, to
that intent, he made use of the Secret <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi>
had left him, from whom he had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to descend in a Right Line by his Father
<hi>Nicomachus,</hi> formerly Physician to his Majesty
King <hi>Amyntas,</hi> the Grand-Father of <hi>Alexander;</hi>
he made use of it, I say, to separate himself
from's Body, which he left in a Place where the
Sea, in a high Tide, chanced to carry it off.
Upon the finding of his Body drowned, every
one made his Conjecture: The Court, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
what Impression Disgrace would make
upon the Spirit of a Courtier, whose Nature it
is, more than may be supposed, upon Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to dispatch themselves out of the World,
concluded very rationally on the Point; but the
Opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Disciples</hi> carried it. At
that Time he was about explaining the Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
of the <hi>Flux and Reflux</hi> of the Seas: He
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54814:46"/>
had confess'd contrary to his custom, that he
did not throughly apprehend it: And that vex'd
him to the heart. Thence they readily concluded
<hi>that</hi> the cause of his despair. One of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
proclaim'd it in several parts of <hi>Greece.</hi>
And as if he had been behind him, when he
threw himself in the water, added the words he
spoke unto the Sea, just upon his jump; <hi>Since
I can not comprehend thee, thou shalt comprehend me.</hi>
The <hi>Antithesis</hi> seem'd very pretty. That gave
Legs to the report, and by that Pass-port it
arriv'd to us.</p>
            <p>There is something strange and new in these
Particulars as well as in the Story of <hi>Socrates.</hi>
And many of the Circumstances are left out in
most of the Authours that have treated on this
Subject. That encourages me to hope they'l
meet with a kind Entertainment from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
since tis this that now a days lifts our
Historians unto Reputation, and sets 'em above
the common herd of Writers: And nothing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akes so much as Paradox in History; since a
Manuscript that shall thwart the long receiv'd
Opinions of Mankind, is the only piece in
fashion, especially if sland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the <hi>News of the Republick of Learning</hi>

hardly any thing but rare and admirable Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.
But tis not on the faith of <hi>Manuscripts</hi>
I ground my Reports, things commonly subject
to be question'd, but on the Testimony of the
Persons mainly concern'd in the History, and
who have either done or suffer'd the thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
related. And I challenge all the <hi>Burnets in
England</hi> to evince me false in any thing, by all
the <hi>Histories</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of the Moon.</hi>

As for <hi>Plato,</hi> he told us, It did not so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his Head, what were the Sentiments of
Men concerning him, and thank't us for the
offers of our Service that we made him: But
Experience convinc'd us of the truth of <hi>Father
Mersennus</hi>'s conjecture, touching the <hi>Republick;</hi>
and also that had his <hi>Reverence</hi> been a little more
conversant in the Affairs of the <hi>Globe</hi> of the
<hi>Moon,</hi> he would have made no wonder at his
finding <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> thereabouts; since
the first had effectually establish'd his <hi>Republick</hi>
there, and the second his <hi>Lyceum,</hi> both which
we see geographically describ'd in the Mapps of
that Country by <hi>Father Grimaldus</hi> a <hi>Iesuit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cartes Seleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> one
of the Notablest Mathematicians of the Age.
We have nothing of certainty as to <hi>Socrates</hi>'s
abode; but 'tis more than probable his ordinary
Resort is in his belov'd Disciple <hi>Plato</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>After this little Entercourse, as we were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leave of these Gentlemen, <hi>Socrates</hi> demanded
what Friend it was we went so for to wait on?
<hi>Father Mersennus</hi> answer'd, that it was <hi>Descartes:
Descartes! (reply'd Aristotle:</hi>) What that mad
Blade that came from the other World above
thirty years ago? He that was made the Owl
of all the Philosophers, not able to endure him
here, and that forc't him to seek out for other
Quarters! Truly a very pretty Fellow, that to
have treated me so Bully-like, and with that
disdain I am told he did: Me, I say, that have
been the <hi>Tutour</hi> to the greatest <hi>Prince</hi> and greatest
<hi>Conquerour</hi> that ever was! Me, to whose Honour
<hi>Philippe</hi> and <hi>Olympias</hi> erected Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es! Me, that
have taught <hi>Philosophy</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> that have wrote
so many <hi>Books</hi> and had a whole <hi>Regiment</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatours!</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54814:47"/>
Me whose Words had pass'd so
long for Oracles, and the decisions of the
Schools; Me, in fine, that all the Philosophers
plume them selves as having gain'd unto their
Party, and not willing, nor indeed daring to
confess, I take the contrary side! I would fain
see that bold Merchant venture on the Benches. I
have seen his Books and pity 'em. Would you guess
(<hi>said he</hi>) turning hastily to <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato;</hi>
what is the first step he would have his <hi>Wise men</hi>
make, in order to his safer conduct to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Truth? He makes him doubt of every
Thing, and bids him take for false the most self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
Proposition in the World, that Two and
Three are Five, that the Whole, is greater than
its Part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You know Gentlemen, said he,
what work the World have made with him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
For my par't, I'd only ask the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
one Question, Does he suppose a Man can
doubt of every thing, or does he not? If not,
Why makes he it the leading precepts of his
<hi>Method?</hi> For in point of Precept and Method,
'tis necessary they be such as can be put in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.<note place="margin">In Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

If he does suppose it, how is it he more

one single person, that was in his Senses as to
those apparent Truths? Does he think that those
he has to deal with, have lost their Senses? Or
does he imagine that the Arguments of the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
would be more effectual in his Mouth, or
in his Writings than in theirs, whose only
Design, for the generality, was to torture and
plague the other <hi>Sophists</hi> and to make themselves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54814:47"/>
sport with those as should indeavour seriously to
confute them? But never dream'd of one <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Descartes</hi> that should one time or other
Martial their <hi>Sophisms</hi> in the Van of his <hi>Method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now supposing <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had induc'd
me to doubt that Two and Three made Five; and
that the Whole was bigger than its Part; I would
fain know what Method he would take to rid
me of this doubt, and to replace me in the <hi>Statu
quo</hi> of certainty where I was before? This
could not be done without the aid of another
Proposition, more evident than the other; which
must serve to convince me, that what I began to
doubt, was undoubtedly, not to be doubted of.
Now what is with him that high and mighty
Proposition, that must brandish its Light on all
the rest, and act the Sun among the other Stars?
Why: I <hi>think, therefore I am.</hi> For, says he,
'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is impossible to think unless I am. Most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably

that Two and Three should not be
Five; that the Whole should not be bigger than
its Part; than 'tis impossible I should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
unless I think, and that I should think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
I am? If I could bring my Mind to doubt
once of the two first Propositions, should I be
much pain'd to make question of the third? Or
if a <hi>Sceptick</hi> should be so impudent to deny me
those, need he be more, to deny me this? And
should not I find my self equally impower'd to
demonstrate to him all the three? <hi>Descartes</hi> in
that procedure pretends to silence a <hi>Sceptick</hi> that
challenges him to demonstrate any thing; or to
shew him the evidence of a Proposition, himself
pretends to have made him doubt of. The
<hi>Sophist,</hi> resolv'd to deny the evidence of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54814:48"/>
Proposition, baffles him: And so will I; telling
him, I stay in the maze of Doubt into which he
led me, and am like do to so, since the Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he brings to expedite me thence, is as
blind and dark as those which he made me boggle
at before.</p>
            <p>But probably (<hi>in pursuance of his humour</hi>)
you are charm'd with the wonderful progress
he makes in his following <hi>Method.</hi> Reflecting,
<hi>says my Great Philosopher,</hi> upon that first Conlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>I think, therefore I am.</hi> I observe I am no
other way assur'd of the certainty of it, than
by having a clear and distinct <hi>Idea</hi> of what I
there affirm: So that I can take it for a general
Rule, that whatever I can clearly and distinctly
conceive, is true. But is this the peculiar of that
favourite Proposition, only <hi>I think therefore
I am?</hi> Supposing that <hi>Descartes</hi> had left me in
the capacity I was, and where I must be still,
in spight of Fate, as to the certainty of these
Propositions Two and Three are five, the
Whole is bigger than its Part; might not I make
the same reflection on these Propositions as he
makes on his? And being not oblig'd to invent
a Rule of Truth for the <hi>Gentlemen Scepticks,</hi> but
only for my self, which I might make use of
in forming all my Judgments, might not I be
allow'd to argue upon my Propositions as he
does on his? The reason why I am ascertain'd of
these Propositions, that is; why I not only doubt
not of them, but perceive, I cannot doubt of
them, if I would, is, that I have a clear and distinct
perception of what I there affirm: And seeing
I have such an one, can I still doubt whether I
have or not? When to have and to judge I have,
or rather to be sensible I have it, is the self
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54814:48"/>
same act of the Understanding. For in effect,
from thence it is; from my own Conscience it is
proceeds the impossibility of doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of that
Proposition, two and three are five, as well as
of that other, <hi>I think therefore, I am,</hi> as all will
agree that we are able to judge any whit nicely
in such Cases. I might then equally from these
and a thousand other Propositions draw the same
Inference, <hi>Descar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> concludes from his, to make
a Rule of Truth on, <hi>What I clearly and distinctly
conceive is true.</hi> And it is as trifling as absurd,
to make the Certainty and Evidence of such sort
of Propositions, depend on the Certainty and
Evidence of any other, since they are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s certain
and evident of themselves, not from any thing
prejudicate or antecedent to them. All of them
stand on the same Square as to their Conviction,
and nothing's more unreasonable or against the
Rules of Method, than to go to prove them by
one another: Hence it is they are called Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Propositions; and even <hi>Descartes</hi> himself
will own, That that General Principle, <hi>What I
can distinctly conceive is true,</hi> is no ways a Rule of
Truth for such kind of Propositions; but that
their Rule of Truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> that which convinces
me of their Truth, is, as I have been saying,
the only Experience, and internal Sense alone my
Mind has of that Truth, at the instant of forming
those Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom the very Name of <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
had put in Humor, staid not long in so
pleasant a Road, but pursued to push his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms
home. The greatest Pleasure (<hi>said he</hi>)
I had in reading that admirable Piece, was to see
a Man so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oil, and perplex himself, as to lie
open, not only to the most subtle <hi>Sceptick,</hi> but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54814:49"/>
to the meanest <hi>Logician,</hi> that with three Grains
of Wit and Sense, knew how to inforce the
Rules of Logick he has learn'd: With that he
run through his <hi>Method,</hi> his <hi>Meditations,</hi> and the
<hi>first Part of his Book of Principles,</hi> so as to let us
know, he had attentively examined them. He
shewed us, in presenting the Order and Array
of <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Propositions, that no Man ever went
so preposterously to work as he, for the Invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Establishing a Rule of Truth: For that
after having made us doubt of all Things, and
next, in this dark Passage introduced one Spark
of Light, <hi>all that we can distinctly conceive is true:</hi>
He presently makes us suspect that again by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
drawn from his third Meditation. <q>But
many things which before seemed evident, are
become again uncertain; which has determin'd
me hitherto to question, whether Two and
Three are Five: Hereupon it came into my
Mind, That possibly there was a God, that
could have made me of such a Composition, as
I might be imposed upon in Things that seem
most clear and evident: And as often as that
Thought recurs of the Power of God, it is
impossible for me not to own, but that, if he
pleased, he might easily have framed me so,
as to be mistaken in the Things I most clearly
conceive: But otherwise, upon my steady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
those Things I distinctly conceive, I
am urged with so clear Conviction, as to be
unable to forbear exclaiming. Deceive me
who can; It is impossible, so long as I think,
I should not be, or that I should not have been,
since it is true at present that I am; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may be equally impossible that Two and
Three should not make Five, and so of other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54814:49"/>
Things, wherein I see a palpable Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And indeed having no inducement to
believe there is a God, a Deceiver, and not
knowing as yet whether there be any at all,
the Reason that makes me doubtful, being
grounded but on that Suspicion, is but weak,
and, as I may so say, <hi>Metaphysical.</hi> But to take
away this Doubt it self, it is necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Whether there is a God? And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there be, Whether he can be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Aristotle</hi> began to descant, That <hi>Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
had no longer Right to put off that <hi>Axiom</hi> for
a Rule of Truth, <hi>All that we distinctly conceive is
True:</hi> Seeing he had rendred it suspicious by
that Reason, drawn from the Power of God; a
Reason that appeared to him so forcible, that it
was impossible, whilst he reflected on it, not to
own, that God, had he pleased, could most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have made us so, as to be mistaken in things
we most distinctly conceive. This supposed,
the Stress he laid upon the Evidence of his other
Propositions, could at best but ballance it, and
render his <hi>Rule of Truth a Probability:</hi> Nay it could
not do so much, since it was not to be done,
but upon the Strength of the Evidence of the
Propositions; a Rule that became a most uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and fallible, by that sole Argument, which
he found impossible to resist, when he reflected
on it: And that the Argument that made him
suspect his <hi>Axioms,</hi> though founded on the bare
Supposal of the Existence of a God, which as
yet he had not examin'd, ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as so weak and trivial, in reference to a
Man, that in pursuit of his <hi>Method</hi> acknowledges
the Power of God, in case he does exist, extend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54814:50"/>
to every thing, and possibly to the making us
such sort of Creatures as might be deluded in
things they most distinctly conceive. And that,
lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it thw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>Philosopher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that was yet in Doubt of the Truth
of that Proposition; <hi>All that I distinctly can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is true:</hi> To dream of proving the Existence
of a God, to clear him of that Doubt: For
how would he be convinc'd of the Existence of
a God, but by some evident Demonstration?
And how shall he be convinced by some evident
Demonstration, so long as he shall doubt, if
what a Man distinctly conceives is true?</p>
            <p>From whence <hi>Aristotle</hi> concluded, <hi>Cartesius</hi>
made a Circle in his Method; which is the most
vile and unpardonable Fault that reasoning can

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: For, according to him, he could
no ways be perfectly sure of that Principle, <hi>All
I distinctly conceive is true:</hi> But because there is
a God, and because that God is no Deceiver;
nor could he know there was a God, and that
that God was no Deceiver, but because he knew
distinctly the Existence of a God, by the Idea
he found in himself, and because he distinctly
conceived, That to Deceive was a thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of God. In a Word, that he proved the
First Proposition by the Second, and the Second
by the First, without having the Right to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Truth of either. But Gentlemen (<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, in an insulting way</hi>) upon your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
I pardon your <hi>Worthy Master</hi> that
his unhappy Stumble: It was only a false Step
he chanced to make in the Dark, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, he recovered himself, and stood upon
his Legs. He concluded, For the Existence of
a God, and many Truths that we undoubtedly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54814:50"/>
and clearly know; the Conclusion is true though
the Inference be false. But you must not take
it ill if I add one Word more, a disgracing his
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Axioms</hi> one by one,<note place="margin">In resp. ad object. 1.</note> make you
sensible how ill founded is the Reputation of a
Philosopher, said to Argue conclusively and
closely. I remember I have read in that <hi>Author</hi>
a Proposition pleasant enough; <hi>viz.</hi> That God
could change the Essences of things; That the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we call necessary are only True,
because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will have them so: And if God had
willed it, as he might have willed it, if he pleas'd,
that Two and Three should not make Five, that
Proposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Two and Three are Five at this
Day would be false. When <hi>Descartes</hi> advances
that <hi>Paradox,</hi> he would fain be believed to own
a vast Respect for, and most humble Submission
to the Omnipotency of God, and is angry with
the other <hi>Philosopher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and impleads them of
almost Blasphemy, for presuming to say, God
was not able to cause, that Two and Three should
not make Five: Yet if you track <hi>Descartes</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
you'll quickly find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That 'tis not altogether
for his Devotion-sake he maintains that <hi>Thesis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but because that absurd Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t was the evident
Result of some other Points of his Doctrin:
To have admitted of a Proposition so harsh as
that, upon Constraint, and as a Conclusion
drawn naturally from a Principle of his laying,
would not have made much for his Honour, and
would besides have discouraged others: That
made him think it his best way to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with them, to make the Out-cry first, and
to wonder how the Philosophers could be so rash
and inconsiderate as to prescribe Boundaries to
the Almightiness of God. I shall not at present
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54814:51"/>
meddle with the Absurdity of that Proposition;
I design not to correct all the Blunders of that
Knight Errant of a Philosopher; it will be too
Glorious for him to understand I have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to criticise upon him. But to enlarge
a little on the Business in Hand, I say, should
all I have urged against his Method be false;
should all the Arguments wherewith the World
has baited him, be Void and Null, that <hi>Paradox</hi>
alone would totally overthrow him; and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him
suppose it true, 'tis impossible he should give a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any Rule of Truth: For if it hold, That the
Truth of Propositions so depends on God, as
that he could have caused those este<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m'd neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
true, to have been false, it was in his
Power to have made these two be false;
<hi>What I conceive distinctly is true: To deceive is an
Imperfection.</hi> If God was able to have done it,
how knows <hi>Descartes</hi> but he actually has? What
greater Reason has he to believe he hath not,
rather than the contrary? Hath God revealed
it to him? Upon his Principle, I'll doubt, not
only as a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> but now I'll doubt in earnest;
Thus his two Rules of Truth are no longer Rules
of Truth. What now betides his Glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>I think therefore I am?</hi> I have no need
to be a <hi>Sceptick</hi> to discredit it: Why? Because
I know not whether God from all Eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
it true or false. Nor could I purchase
that knowledge without a Revelation; and still
it must be questioned whether Revelation could
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erve for a Rule of Truth, in these our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
Thus <hi>Descartes Wiseman,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made so far a Progress as to know, he
<hi>thought,</hi> and that he <hi>was,</hi> is here unfortunately
<hi>non-plus'd.</hi> I have a world of Reflections more to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54814:51"/>
make, and I should never be exhausted if I would
enter upon his egregious Metaphysicks, his new
Demonstrations he pretends to give for the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a God, the Distinction of the Soul and
Body: Upon his way of answering Objections
made against the rest of his Method, if I would
trouble my self to let you see how (when his
Propositions are attacked, and at once the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
of them, or the Method he takes to come
to the knowledge of Truth) he contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sometimes to defend his Propositions well or
ill, without endeavouring to justifie his Method,
though that is the Piece in which he has pretended
most to shew his Excellency; and which is the
most despicable of all at Bottom, as I think I
have sufficiently proved to you: But this is
enough to satisfie you, I have not pass'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on your Master without sufficient Knowledg
of the Cause: And since I have delayed you too
long, <hi>Gentlemen Cartesians,</hi> I am your most humble
Servant; recommend me to your <hi>Illustrious Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> followed him, taking Leave
more civilly, and more like <hi>Gentlemen</hi> than he:
And <hi>Plato</hi> added, he was transported to see <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>'s
Reputation so run down in the World;
and that he deserv'd it were it for nothing, but
his Behaviour towards the <hi>Philosophers</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and especially for his ill natur'd Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
unto <hi>Plato</hi> himself: That he had used all
Endeavours possible to suppress the Reputation
with which they flourished in the World, and
had used less reserve toward him than all the
rest, although he had been his <hi>Master;</hi> and
meerly by his Calumnies in Point of Doctrin,
he had raised himself to the Character of <hi>Prince</hi>
of <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:54814:52"/>
You know not, said I, what Time may still
bring forth, and you need not despair of coming
in Play again. <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy has had
many Turns of Fortune within this Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years; and I'll tell you, as a Piece of News
from our World, That hardly more than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Years ago, the <hi>Sovereign Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church</hi> was upon putting forth a <hi>Placate,</hi>
commanding your <hi>Philosophy</hi> should be taught at
<hi>Rome,</hi> instead of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s, and he had gained
the Point, but for a great Man of that Time,
called <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> If that had once passed at
<hi>Rome,</hi> there had been a Fatal Stroke to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Philosophy, and <hi>yours</hi> had carried it all the
World over. You at once surprize and please
me, (<hi>replyed</hi> Plato) I am extreamly Glad, and
most highly obliged to you for this News: <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
shall know it, and I'll imploy it to revenge
the Insult of his late Discourse.</p>
            <p>Mean while my two Guides were enraged to
hear their <hi>Master</hi> treated in so vile a manner;
they had waited the End of his Discourse, to
answer it, but observing him troop off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving them the Opportunity, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
what they could to stop him: As they
saw it was in vain, the <hi>old Gentleman</hi> raillying, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
him at a Distance, So ho, <hi>Good Monsieur
Aristotle,</hi> where may a Man find your <hi>Sphere of
Fire?</hi> we have not met with it in our Voyage;
though your Books give us Intelligence it was
placed above the <hi>Air,</hi> and yet below the <hi>Moon.</hi>
For my part I was highly gratify'd with that
Encounter, and Discourse; I had the Pleasure to
observe, That <hi>Spiritual Philosophers</hi> no more than
<hi>Corporal</hi> could forbear disputing, and were no
less jealous of their Sentiments and Reputation.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54814:52"/>
I had the Happiness of this Diversion more
than once in my <hi>Voyage,</hi> upon several Occasions;
of which I shall give account.</p>
            <p>After the Departure of our <hi>three Philosophers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
well, (<hi>said I to</hi> Father Mersennus) what think
you, <hi>Father,</hi> now of <hi>Aristotle?</hi> Indeed he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me a litte hot; but after all, methinks
he's no ill Disputant: That way of tracing
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> step by step in his <hi>Method</hi> of the
re-search of Truth, is very maliciously design'd,
and capable of raising Scruples, especially that
last Argument taken from the Truth of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Propositions, that with <hi>Descartes</hi> have their
Dependance upon God, seemed perplexing
enough: And I do not remember that any one
has before hit upon the Use that he hath made
on't.</p>
            <p>Stuff! meer Stuff! (<hi>he replyed</hi>) All that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
has said, scarce any thing was tolerable
but the Circle he charged upon <hi>Descartes;</hi>
and that's an antiquated Objection; I my self
have touched upon it heretofore, as you may see
in the <hi>Second Objections,</hi> that come after his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,</hi>
which are my own as well as the <hi>Sixth.</hi>
I am glad I know so much, (<hi>I returned</hi>) they
be both most worthy of you, and admirably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and I am very well satisfied, That Circle
is something more than imaginary; for 'tis not
to be supposed, that <hi>Father Mers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nnus, Aristotle,
M. Arnauld,</hi> who is the Author of the <hi>Fourth Set</hi>
of <hi>Objections,</hi> and several others, had all met in
the self-same Point, but that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it very like at least, what they there
apprehended. But under the Rose, do you take
that answer <hi>M. Decsartes</hi> gives to get out of that
unlucky Circle, and that no one ever yet has
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54814:53"/>
took in hand to be satisfactory or fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
He answers, That in saying, We knew
nothing certainly, before our Conviction of the
Existence of a God, he had expressly noted,
That he only meant it of some Conclusions that
might come into our Mind, at the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me Time
we reflected not on the Principles, from which
they were derived.</p>
            <p>It would perhaps be somewhat difficult to
make that Proposition capable of any tolerable
Sense; but 'tis the easiest thing of an hundred
to shew it to be a meer Fetch and Evasion; and
to disprove the Truth of the thing itself, it is
but reading the same Place <hi>Aristotle</hi> now cited,
of his <hi>Third Meditation, Page the thirty fifth and
thirty sixth of his Method, Number the fifth of the
first Part of his Principles;</hi> and one shall see he
there makes us doubt of all, even of Principles
that carry with them their own Evidence; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that Principle itself, <hi>What I distinctly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
conceive is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rue,</hi> by the Suspicion we have there is
a God, who could so have constituted us, as we
might be mistaken in things most clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended:
So that when he says, We know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
surely, before the Knowledg of a God, he
speaks not only of some certain Conclusions that
strike upon our Mind, separately from their
Principles, but of all sorts of Knowledg, and of
that it self, <hi>What we distinctly conceive is true.</hi>
And hereupon it is your self, <hi>Aristotle, M.
Arnauld</hi> and others, have trapt him in a
Circle.</p>
            <p>I own, That Answer may be found in some
of his Letters, occasioned by the same Objection
started to him afresh. I know that he repeats it
not by way of Answer, but couching it cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54814:53"/>
in the <hi>First Part</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> where
he gives us an Abstract of his <hi>Method,</hi> and his
<hi>Meditations;</hi> but that's no <hi>Salvo</hi> to the Business.
Besides, those Words have a very ill Effect, in
the <hi>First Part of his Principles,</hi> for they unhappily
stand so near the other, that make us doubt of
self-evident Propositions, because of the Suspicion
we have of a God, that, may be, employs his
Power to deceive us; that the Contradiction
plainly strikes our Eyes.</p>
            <p>Nor has his famous Proposition, <hi>I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am,</hi> any better S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccess; for having given
us that Proposition as the first of which we could
be assured, we might demonstrate to him, That
cannot be the first, since its certainty necessarily
supposes the Truth of some others, and in those
of these: <hi>It is impossible that that which thinks
should not be; it is a Contradiction for any thing
to think, and yet not be in the instant that it thinks.</hi>
The Proposition (which is very remarkable)
by which he proves that other, <hi>I think therefore I
am,</hi> at the same Time he pretends it to be the
first of all. He declares then, That when he says,
that Proposition, <hi>I think therefore I am,</hi> is the
first and most certain of all those which offer
themselves to the Mind of a Man, who observes
Method in Philosophy; he pretends not to deny
but that he must be certain of this before; <hi>It is
impossible that he that thinks should not be;</hi> as also
of divers others. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyn this Acknowledgment
with what he says in the <hi>foregoing Page,</hi> 
               <q>We
must likewise doubt of other Things, which
we held most certain, of <hi>Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi>
even of Principles that we thought
self-evident until now:</q> What are then self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
Propositions if not these? It is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54814:54"/>
That a thing should be and not be:
A thing cannot be, and not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the same Time,
cannot act, and not be, and the like. He then
supposes not the Truth of these Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he doubts of them. And in Truth, the
Reason he brings to make us doubt of self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Propositions extends equally to all. We
must doubt, says he, of Principles that we call
self-evident, because we have heard there is a
God, who can do all Things; and who knows,
but he may have so contrived us, as we might
always be deceived, even in things that seem
most evident? And be pleased to recollect, <hi>my
Father,</hi> what <hi>Aristotle</hi> said in Concluding; That
<hi>Descartes</hi>'s Propositions were less to be found
Fault with than their Conn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xion and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
in his Method that he takes to come to
Truth; and that the Truth of some certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
was not absolutely contested, but only
with reference to the Method that he takes, by
which he forfeits the Priviledg to suppose them,
be they as true as may be, since according to
that Method he is disabled from acquiring the
Knowledg of their Truth. And it is upon that
account, probably, he was put so out of Humor
with <hi>Gassendus</hi> and <hi>Father Bourdin</hi> a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> who
were those that chiefly closed with him in that
Loc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Their Scruples are proposed in a lively
manner in <hi>Latin;</hi> and it were well if the <hi>French
Translation</hi> equalled the <hi>Original.</hi> But upon the
mentioning the <hi>French Translation,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave to add one little Remark, I
made a few Days since, and thought not fit to
communicate to others. <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s dear
Disciples being possibly put to it (at least I so
imagine) to disengage their Master of those
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54814:54"/>
petty Perplexities, of which I have been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
in the <hi>French Version,</hi> that has been put
forth, of his Works, and which had his own
Approbation, have somewhat sweetned that
distastful Proposition, in the first Part of his
Principles. The <hi>Latin</hi> has it thus, <hi>Dubitabimus
etiam de reliquis, quae antea pro maxime certis habui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:
Etiam de Mathematicis demonstrationibus,
etiam de iis principiis quae hactenus putavimus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse
per se nota.</hi> It would be natural to render it:
We will doubt of other things, which before we
held most certain; also of Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations;
also of those Principles which hitherto
we thought self-evident: They have turned it so,
I say, in <hi>French,</hi> as to make us believe, That
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> spoke not of self-evident Principles
in general, but only of Mathematical: <hi>Nous dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

que d'eux-memes ils soient assez manifestes.</hi> We
will doubt also of all those things we hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
esteemed most certain, even of the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of Mathematicks and their Principles,
though they are sufficiently manifest of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
If this was designedly done, as one may
reasonably suppose, it was a little Innocent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain,
that obliged <hi>Descartes</hi> and injured
no Man; and prevented at least the Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
should be visible. But to return to the
Answer <hi>Descartes</hi> made to the Circle alledged,
What think you <hi>Father,</hi> is't a good Defence?
Or is it not to make a Retreat and Capitulate
with his Enemies? Or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ther, to speak more plainly
and truly, to unsay and contradict? In good Faith,
Father, declare it ingenuously; you have treated
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54814:55"/>
               <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> somewhat like a Friend, or
rather as a generous Enemy, you have disarmed
him: He was a Man that scorned to beg his
Life; you foresaw too how high he'd carry it
after the Combate, and still would challenge all
he met with; yet for all that, you have thought
fit to give him Quarter, as a Man that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it in Consideration of those other great
Services he has done Philosophy: I applaud
your Generosity, and you have no reason to
repent on't.</p>
            <p>That little Softning, with which I temper'd
the Harshness of my Criticks, had its design'd
Effect, which was not wholly to sowre <hi>Father
Mersennus.</hi> He took it graciously enough, and
only answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a rallying way, You are a very
Wrangler, and delight to find a Quarrel; and
the Humor that I see you are of, had you lived
in <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Time, you had certainly incurred
his spending a whole Chapter on you. But all
that you say comes to just nothing, as I could
easily convince you; but the Discussion of Fact,
and Contradiction is too tedious an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for us Travellers. I perceive too <hi>Monsieur</hi>
is tired already with it, continued he, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> and only wants a
Mouth to yawn. Come, says he, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> you
seem something Melancholy, brighten a little,
brighten; What do you think of?</p>
            <p>Think? of nothing said he. How <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsieur,
(I replyed)</hi> What's that you spoke? certainly
Blasphemy against the Doctrin of our Master:
If <hi>Aristotle</hi> had heard you, what would he have
said? Do you <hi>think</hi> of nothing? So, What's
become of the Essence of the Soul, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Descartes</hi> is <hi>thinking?</hi> I had as lieve you'd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54814:55"/>
tell me that you have no <hi>Being</hi> as that you do
not <hi>think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He took me up in a very serious Air, which
sufficiently bespoke a greater Displeasure my
Words had given him, than <hi>Father Mersennus</hi>
before. You put a perverse Construction on my
Proposition, which meant no more, than that
my Mind was not possessed with Melancholy
<hi>Ideas,</hi> as you thought: I am heartily glad,
<hi>Monsieur, said I,</hi> for Gayety and Briskness are
never more necessary than in a <hi>Iourney:</hi> But
since we are fallen bechance upon the Essence of
the Soul, I could wish you'd plainly expound
what <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> has said thereon; for as
pure a Spirit as I am, I have no clear insight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my own Essence; and I wonder at it. A
very ill Sign, <hi>said he,</hi> that's as much as to say,
your Intellect is benighted still with Prejudice,
and which I have already too much perceiv'd in
you: And I well observe, that Novice which
we lately met has raised fresh Scruples in you by
his <hi>Sophistry. Monsieur,</hi> I replyed, to use no
Disguise with you, I'll frankly lay open the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of my Soul, in which I find it. I am
ravish'd in my Thoughts to meet with those that
contradict <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>Philosophy;</hi> that opens and
enlarges my Mind: But how strong soever their
Arguments appear, I secure my self against them,
and still reserve my Mind docil and tractable
for the Instructions of that great <hi>Genius,</hi>
supposing he has the Leisure or the Goodness to
bestow some on me, when I shall have the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to see him. As for the Preconceptions of
the Schools and Childhood, I have for the most
part quit them, as I passed my Word before I
undressed me of my Body: Yet I confess some
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54814:56"/>
still remain, concerning the Essence of the Body,
and the Essence of the Soul, which I hardly can
call by that Name, in the signification you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it, since they seem grounded upon Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and on solid Reason. I have however
too great a Deference for <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> to be
throughly confirm'd that they are not false; so
that I am willing to acknowledg, to speak in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iner Language, a gloomy kind of Darkness over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts
my Mind in those Particulars; and I have
not yet obtain'd the Priviledg of <hi>Cartesian Souls,</hi>
to have most distinct <hi>Ideas</hi> of those two kinds
of <hi>Being,</hi> which make up the World. But once
more I shall submit to your Instructions and
<hi>Descartes</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>He then began to explain the Doctrin of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>
thereupon, but said no more than I before
had read in his <hi>Meditations,</hi> in his <hi>Method,</hi> in
the <hi>first part</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> and in some of his
<hi>Letters.</hi> I shall not here give any Exposition of
that Doctrin, because I shall have an occasion
to speak of it upon an Adventure that befel us
in the Globe of the Moon. I pretended out of
Complaisance to have a better Taste of it than
before, and to find more Solidity in it than
when I read it by my self. That acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
restated my Companions in their jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Humour, who after much Merriment and Droll,
upon <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy, wheel'd about unto
his <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> which according to his Map
of the World ought to be situated under the

or footstep in our <hi>Voyage.</hi> They were very Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

in the space of almost two thousand years: For
that many Stars that have formerly appear'd in
the Heavens now disappear: What's become of
the seventh <hi>Pleiade,</hi> and of that seen the last

any one, since its ceasing to appear, should
bring his Action against <hi>Tyco Brahe</hi> and others
that observ'd it, as false Intelligencers, that
abus'd the credulous World, do you think it
would not be thrown out? And does not
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> himself give us to apprehend that
our <hi>Vortex,</hi> infinitely greater than the <hi>Sphere of
Fire,</hi> shall be sometime swallow'd up, when one
least thinks on't? And when by that Absorption
the Sun shall become an Earth, and perhaps at
once the subtil Matter which is conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>'d in the
Centre of our Earth, forcing its Passage throug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
the Crusts that cover it, shall make that a Sun;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54814:57"/>
granting that the Books of <hi>M. Descartes</hi> existed
in another <hi>Vortex</hi> where are Men, would not
they look on all he has wrote of our World as
Fabulous and <hi>Romantick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, granting that there never was a
<hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> it was ever admirably suppos'd.
Never was <hi>System</hi> more exactly contriv'd than
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s of the Elements. They all are rang'd
according to the Dignity or Meanness of their
Nature. The <hi>Earth</hi> as the most unactive and
ignoble Element, has the lowest Seat. The
<hi>Water,</hi> less course and heavy than the Earth,
takes place above it. The <hi>Air,</hi> by reason of
its Subtilty, is exalted higher than the Water.
And the <hi>Fire</hi> the most noble and most vigorous
of them all, owns no Superior but the Stars,
and the subtil Matter in which swim the Planets.
The extent of each is likewise proportion'd to
the Merit of their Nature: Like Brethren they
have divided the Estate of the four Qualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
each of them has two, one of which in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
Degree. The <hi>Earth</hi> is cold and dry,
the <hi>Water</hi> is cold and moist, the <hi>Air</hi> is hot and
moist, the <hi>Fire</hi> is hot and dry. And to the end
they may bear up still, in the perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
they give each other; if the prevaling Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of one's more active, the predominant
Quality of the others put them in a good post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
of Defence against the effort of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Could any thing be more justly or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
imagin'd? In fine, with how many fine
Thoughts has that <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> and that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Disposition of the Elements, furnished
our Preachers heretofore, and still supplies those
of <hi>Italy?</hi> But to mention something better in
its kind, that one <hi>Devise</hi> of <hi>Father le Moine,</hi> of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54814:57"/>
which the <hi>Sphere of Fire</hi> is the Substance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
there had been one, and would deserve
there should be one still, and that it should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for ever. Designing to signifie the more
<hi>pure</hi> are Friendships, the more <hi>durable</hi> they are,
he painted the <hi>Sphere of Fire,</hi> with this <hi>Spanish
Motto, Eterno porque Puro.</hi> This Fire's Eternal,
because it's pure. What an unhappiness it is
that that Thought so fine and solid as it is all
over, should at last be false for want of a <hi>Sphere
of Fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I was defending as well as I could, the
<hi>Peripatetick Interest,</hi> whilst we arriv'd at the <hi>Globe</hi>
of the <hi>Moon.</hi> I shall not be tedious in giving a
large Description of it, since others have don't
before me. I will only say that the <hi>Earth,</hi> look't
to us that view'd it from the <hi>Moon,</hi> as the Moon
appears to those that view it from the <hi>Earth,</hi>
with this difference, that the <hi>Earth</hi> seem'd big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
far, because it really is so. So we judg'd
that the Earth, in respect of those that beheld
it from the <hi>Moon,</hi> had the same <hi>Phases</hi> as the
<hi>Moon,</hi> in regard of those that behold it from the
<hi>Earth;</hi> that it had its <hi>Quadratures,</hi> its <hi>Oppositions,</hi>
its <hi>Conjunctions,</hi> except that it could never be
totally Eclips'd, by the reason of its greatness
in comparison of the <hi>Moon,</hi> whose Shade could
not have a Diameter so large as the Earth then
in Conjunction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> is a Mass of Matter much like that
of which the <hi>Earth</hi> is compos'd. There you
have Fields and Forests, Seas and Rivers. I
saw no Animals indeed, but I am of Opinion if
there were some transported they would thrive,
and probably multiply.<note place="margin">Empire de la Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

undesignedly that he deceiv'd us, having first
been deceiv'd himself. One of the separate
Souls which we found in great Multitudes, and
which were there at his Arrival, told me the
Original of that Error. A great Company of
Souls surpriz'd to see a Man with his Body, in a
Land where the like was never seen before, had
a mind to know the meaning of it. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
together to appear in Human Shape to
him: They accost him, and enquire by what
Method he accomplish'd so great a <hi>Voyage:</hi> Made
him relate what he knew of <hi>our World;</hi> and as he
seem'd equally inquisitive as to the Transactions
of the <hi>World</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the Life the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
led there, the <hi>Familiar Spirit of</hi> Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
who was among the rest, took upon him to
answer: And having declar'd who he was, as
that <hi>Historian</hi> himself relates, he made him upon
the Spot, a Fantastical System of the Republick
and Society, which is the same he gives us in
his Relation, where he seriously tells us, There
are Men in the <hi>Moon;</hi> characters their Humour,
describes their Employments, their Customs and
Government. But 'tis worth the knowing that

               </gap>opperies he has inserted, he brought not
from that Country, as the Soul assur'd me;
and that many Profane Allusions and Libertine
Reflections he there makes, were only the Fruits
of a debauch'd Imagination and a corrupt Mind,
such as was that <hi>Historians,</hi> or of the Imitation
of an <hi>Author,</hi> yet more Atheistical than himself.

famous <hi>Astronomers</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whose Names
they bear, and who are the high and mighty
States there. We landed in <hi>Gassendi,</hi> a Seat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fine and very apposite, and such in
a Word as an <hi>Abbot,</hi> like <hi>Monsieur Gassendus,</hi>
could make it, who wanted for neither Genius,
Art nor Science, and who had no use for his
Revenues, in gaming treating and living high.
The Lord of the Mannor was then absent, whom
we should have been glad to have waited on,
since we heard that he still continu'd his Civility
and Moderation, which were his Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.
And though formerly there were
some Misunderstandings betwixt him and <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
yet he always very obligingly, and with
a Mark of Distinction, entertain'd the <hi>Cartesians</hi>
that came to pay a Visit, and especially <hi>Father
Mersennus,</hi> who was his peculiar Friend. He
was a Man that equall'd <hi>M. Descartes</hi> in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of <hi>Genius,</hi> excell'd him in the reach and
extent of Science, but was less heady and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited.
He seem'd somewhat a <hi>Pyrrhonist</hi> in
Natural Philosophy, which in my Opinion is
becoming enough of a Philosopher, who provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he looks into himself, must know by his
own Experience the Limits of a Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and the short Sightedness of its

            <p>From <hi>Gassendi, Father Mersennus</hi> conducted us
to the <hi>Land</hi> that bears his Name. It is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently

Mersennus</hi> is only commendable for its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            </p>
            <p>We staid in this place about half a quarter of
an hour, when I intimated to <hi>

Mersennus,</hi> willingly consented to my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
for as much as he himself had never made
that <hi>Voyage.</hi> We cross'd the <hi>great Ocean,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the left Hand the <hi>Isle of Winds,</hi> and on
the right, that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> and pass'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> over
that of <hi>Pitheas,</hi> still pushing on quite to the <hi>Sea of
Rains,</hi> which is bounded by a vast <hi>Land</hi> stretch'd
from East to West, much like that of <hi>America,</hi>
as it is decypher'd in the Maps; whose Eastern

               </gap> Deserts.
Towards the middle of that Land, upon the
Shore of the <hi>Sea of Rains,</hi> we discover'd a kind
of a large Town, of an oval Figure, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54814:59"/>
we had the Curiosity to go to see; but we found
all the Avenues guarded with Souls who deny'd
us Entrance, tho' civilly and obligingly enough.
We demanded of one of them, What Town
that was, and why there was no Admission? He
answer'd, it was call'd <hi>Plato,</hi> and was the same
where that <hi>Philosopher,</hi> whose Name it bore, had
establish'd his <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> that no Persons
were admitted there, which he himself had not
first examin'd, which Caution he observ'd, for
fear some Stranger should bring thither the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>other World,</hi> which were
the only Pestilence that <hi>Republick</hi> had to fear;
that <hi>Plato</hi> was not at home at present, but would
return in a little time; and in Case we desir'd
to have Admission, we might, waiting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of <hi>Plato,</hi> commence our Quarantine at <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret,</hi>
which was a little Seat upon a rising
Ground, we saw some distance from the Town;
that that Quarantine was not a Quarantine of days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but a Quarantine of Years; because the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Diseases a <hi>Spirit</hi> was tainted with, wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
purg'd off with far greater Difficulty than the
Pestilential Airs of <hi>Bodies</hi> are dispers'd, which
come from infected Places. We thank'd him
for his offers, and told him, We came not
there with a Design to settle, but that we were
going farther; that if <hi>Plato</hi> had been in Town,
he probably would have had some Condescension
towards us; that we had met him in our Journy,
and had receiv'd great Civilities from him: And
that we must endeavour to be contented upon
the disappointment of our Curiosity, on tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
occasion. So we bent on our Journy, dissatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied
enough, from the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> where
we little thought they had treated Strangers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
they do in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:54814:60"/>
From thence we travell'd over all that Land
from North to South, after which we discover'd
another Sea, call'd the <hi>Sea of Cold,</hi> in which
stood a very fair <hi>Island,</hi> which they said was
<hi>Aristotle</hi>'s; we made no Debate whether we should
take it in our Road: The only Question was,
Whether if we were ask'd who and what we
were, we should declare our selves <hi>Cartesians?</hi>
It was my Sentiment not to carry it so high in
an Enemies Country: But Father <hi>Mersennus</hi> and my
<hi>old Gentleman,</hi> concluded for the contrary, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado adding, there was nothing we need
to fear; that if we were beset we had wherewithal
to defend our Selves, and in point of Spiritual As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
the Number came not in the Account;
that it was not the first time, there had been seen
a <hi>single Cartesian,</hi> that fronted with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
a <hi>Class</hi> of four hundred <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd
by a <hi>Regent</hi> of consummate Experience.
Only we must keep a strict Guard upon our
selves, to offer no Insult or Raillery, that
might give Offence to those we conversed
with.</p>
            <p>But it was a great Surprize to us upon our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
to see this Island under a stricter Guard
than that of <hi>Plato.</hi> They were there in Battel
Array, as in a Town that had the Enemy at
the Gates, and expected the next News should
be of being begirt with a close Siege. There
was your Court of Guards advanc'd far into the
Field, your Centuries upon all the Hills round
about, and Scouts and Intelligences in all parts
of the Air. As we came within three hundred
Paces of the place, we saw a Detachment of
about a dozen Souls, drawn from the Court of
Guard, approach us. He that commanded them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54814:60"/>
gave the Word, Stand, who's there, and to
what Sect do you belong? Our old Veteran un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly
cry'd, Long Live <hi>Descartes</hi> and the
<hi>Cartesians.</hi> He was amaz'd at the Reply; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
us not to stir a step, and forthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
an Advice to the <hi>Officer</hi> of the Guard.</p>
            <p>No sooner the Advice arriv'd to the Officer,
but all his Troops at a Signal given, were arm'd
<hi>capape,</hi> and gave us to understand by their looks
they were in readiness to receive the Enemy:
That is, they were accountred with <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> in
all sorts of <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> whereof some
concluded for the <hi>Soul of Beasts,</hi> others for the
necessity of <hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> in mixt Bodies;
others for <hi>Absolute Accidents,</hi> and such like
Things, against which <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had declar'd.
The <hi>Officer</hi> himself coming up, we presently
knew him. He had been an ancient Professor
in the <hi>Vniversity of Paris</hi> and formerly my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
in Philosophy: O God! said he, adressing
himself to me, and must I have the Affiction
of seeing you on the side of our Enemies conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
even to the servil Office of a Spy? Is
this the Recompence you make for the Pains I
have taken? Have you met with a course of
Philosophy, comparable to mine, which was
then reputed, the most gentile and solid in the
whole <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Paris?</hi> Where's that Respect
and Submission you own'd in your greener years,
for the Prince of Philosophers? What Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had you to take up arms against him? <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
(I reply'd)</hi> I still preserve that Respect, that
Esteem and Friendship for you, which I owe,
inviolable, and I take it for a peculiar favour
of Fortune to meet you here, to make a fresh
Protestation of them. And I assure you, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54814:61"/>
I am neither come in quality of a Spy or Enemy,
but if you please so to receive me, of a <hi>Voyager:</hi>
'Twas purely curiosity that brought me hither,
by the way. As to the concern of Philosophy,
I must acknowledge I am a little <hi>Sceptical</hi> in that
Matter, and know not at present what I am.
I am resolv'd to try all Sects before I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd;
so that you may, Sir, look upon me
as a Man of an uninterested Country, and that
contrives no Plot or Mischeivous Design against
your <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> These <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> indeed,

and Men of Honour, and have Esteem for Merit
though it be on the contrary side; and who
hold, that <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> in point of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
is the unviolable Charter of all honest well

at the bustle and disturbance in this
Country: There's no <hi>Spanish Town</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi>
so readily Alarm'd as yours; What is't you so
much dread?</p>
            <p>That which we so much dread, <hi>said he,</hi> is, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
<hi>Enemy</hi> of our <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> your <hi>Descartes,</hi> who
when on <hi>Earth,</hi> did all imaginable towards the
extirpating the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and only desisted
there, as we are from good Hands inform'd, to
come to ruin them in <hi>this Country.</hi> It is now
more than thirty years, so exact a Guard has
been observ'd, to prevent a Surprize consequent
to the Advice we have had, that in all this time
he hath been forming a Party, and gathering all
the Forces possible, in order to a Descent. This
is the Intelligence we have receiv'd from a
<hi>Dutch Professor</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> who acts here as
<hi>Generalissimo</hi> in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Absence. But <hi>Descartes</hi>
may come as soon as he pleases; you see we are
in a capacity to receive him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54814:61"/>
Well, <hi>Monsieur (said I)</hi> if that be all, you
may sleep secure; <hi>Monsieur Descartes,</hi> I assure
you, has no Design of an Invasion in his Head;
he's a thousand Times farther off this Place than
'tis from hence to <hi>Earth;</hi> he is thinking of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>New World</hi> above the Heavens; he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
us to see the Execution of his Grand Design,
and thither 'tis we are going: And to convince
you of the Truth of what I say, 'tis but deput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when we part, some Souls to bear us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and they shall bring you an account of what
they there shall see.</p>
            <p>You rejoyce me mightily, said he, for we Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks
are tired with these long Fatigues:
but take it not ill, that I execute my Orders,
and conduct you to the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Place,
according to the Custom, That all <hi>Philosophers</hi>
of a different Sect from ours, arriving here, give
him an account what Project brought them hither;
we have used this Course but since <hi>Descartes</hi> has
given us these Alarms. So we took the Road
that led to the Place, convoyed with a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of about fifty Souls, <hi>Academiques</hi> for the
most part and <hi>Collegians,</hi> who look'd as if they
did not wish us very well; that Place was only
a great Garden that represented the <hi>Lyceum</hi> in
<hi>Athens,</hi> where <hi>Aristotle</hi> used to teach his Scholars
walking, whence they derived the Name of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks:</hi>
'Tis of a great extent and very finely
kept, it is cut into abundance of Allies, whereof
the four greatest meet in the middle of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
at a round large Fountain, whereon is
raised a stately Pedestal of the most delicate
Marble I ever saw, on which stands the Statue of
<hi>Alxander the Great,</hi> crowned by <hi>Victory</hi> with
Lawrels, trampling under Foot Scepters and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54814:62"/>
Crowns, and Bucklers and broken Arms, and
the Treasures of <hi>Asia.</hi> Four great Statues,
chained to the four Corners represent the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Nations <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered. I found
that Monument so like that of the <hi>Place des Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoires,</hi>
that I should have believed one had been
the Pattern to the other, had not I at the same
Time made Reflection, that the near Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of those two Hero's, might easily have
furnished the Minds of both the Undertakers
with the same Ideas. All the Figures of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
no less than the other Statues in several
Parts of the Garden, as those of <hi>Philippus, Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi>
and many other illustrious Personages, who
formerly honoured <hi>Aristo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are of <hi>Silver,</hi> for Silver is very cheap and
common in the <hi>Globe of the Moon;</hi> and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
for that Reason <hi>Chymists</hi> who always affect
Mystery in their Words, call that <hi>Metal</hi> by the
Name of the <hi>Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we were admiring that noble Monument,
we were astonished to see all of a sudden, four
Water-Spouts rise from the four Angles of the
Pedestal, the largest and the highest that ever
were; they mounted at least four hundred Poles
in heighth, and they were brought from a River
behind a neighbouring Mountain that was higher
than the Wells of <hi>Domme</hi> in <hi>Auvergn;</hi> over
which the Water was carried by the admirable
Contrivance of the Old Philosophy, that in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Horror of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature,
shew'd how with Pumps to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

high, which Secret is unfortunately lost
in our World; for since the Time of <hi>Galileus</hi> we
can raise Water no higher than three or four and
thirty Foot. We saw these Water Spouts on
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54814:62"/>
every Side, the least of which exceeded the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Trees that encompassed the Garden. From
the middle of the Garden we observed four Halls
of different Figure and Architecture, one at the
End of each of the four Alleys: We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the biggest of them, which was of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Beauty and Magnificence, being of Gold,
Azure and Precious Stones. On both Sides, in
the Intervals of the Windows was your Imbossed

of <hi>Aristotle</hi> over the rest of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
and the Extravagancies of those that went for
Wisemen before his Time.</p>
            <p>The first on the Left-hand exhibits <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
doctrining his Disciples, and presenting them
with a sort of Table-Book, wherein, among
others, were written these three <hi>Precepts:</hi> First,
That they were to <hi>hear</hi> him full <hi>five Years</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking a Word to contradict him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
They must lend an attentive Ear, especially
in the Night, to the Musick and Harmony of
the <hi>Celestial Spheres,</hi> which only Wisemen are
priviledged to understand. And, Thirdly,
they must abstain from eating <hi>Beans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second shews you <hi>Democritus</hi> laughing
with Might and Main, and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> weeping
in warm Tears, and a Troop of little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
hooping after them as after two Fools.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54814:63"/>
In the Third we had <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynique,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
like a Morris-Dancer, mounted upon a
Cross-way-stone, at bottom of which lay his
<hi>Tub,</hi> expounding to an Auditory much like
that of the Singers <hi>du pont neuf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last sate <hi>Aristotle</hi> on an exalted Seat,
that looked more like a Throne than a Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Chair, and at his Feet stood all the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
that lived before him, in Admiration, and
listning to him as an <hi>Oracle.</hi> Before the Throne
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> were heaped the Books that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Writings of those same <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
his <hi>Predecessors,</hi> which one was putting Fire to, to
sacrifice them to the <hi>Goddess Wisdom,</hi> whose Head
resembled a Sun, brandishing abundance of Rays
upon the Face of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and making a Glory
round about it.</p>
            <p>At the Bottom of the Hall, upon a kind of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
stands a large Silver Statue of the beautiful
<hi>Pythias,</hi> formerly <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Lady,</hi> for whom his
Passion was so strong, as to Sacrifice unto her.</p>
            <p>At the Top of the Hall was a Ceiling, enrich'd
with admirable Paintings, lately done, divided
likewise betwixt <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Embossings; for on one Side was the
<hi>Hero</hi> receiving a Thunderbolt from the Hand of
his pretended Father <hi>Iupiter Ammon,</hi> to fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
all the Princes of <hi>Asia;</hi> and on the other the
<hi>Philosopher</hi> receiving another from the Hand of

the New Sects of Philosophy, among which we
easily knew <hi>M. Descartes, M. Gassendi, Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Maignan,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>As we were taken up with the Curiosity of all
these different Pieces of Sculpture and Painting,
the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> of the Place came in to give us Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

of Philosophy,</hi> in the <hi>Colledge de la Fleche,</hi> ceased
not to be a <hi>Philosopher</hi> thereupon; nay pretends
he commenc'd one but from that Time. As he was
fully convinced there was far less to be gained
from the most curious of Books and Libraries than
from the great Volume of the World, the most
Compleat and Instructive of all others, to such as
know how to study it as they ought; he pitch'd
upon Travel. During nine or ten Years he run
through most Countries; frequented the Court,
as also the Armies of most Foreign Princes: But
still as a <hi>Philosopher, i. e.</hi> continually making serious
Reflections upon the Intellectual and Moral Part
of Man, upon the different Customs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54814:64"/>
upon the contrary Judgments Men make
of the self-same things, conformably to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Notions they have imbibed concerning
them, endeavouring always herein to alembeck
Truth from Falshood, and to advantage himself
equally by the Folly and Wisdom of other Men;
that he might collect a System of Life, composed
and regulated by defecated Reason, whose Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
as far as possible, should be independent
of the Turns and Wheels of Fortune.</p>
            <p>He began to put his Project in Execution, in a
certain Place in <hi>Germany,</hi> which he does not
name, where he passed the Winter, at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the <hi>Coronation</hi> of the Emperor <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
III. where closeting himself whole Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his Stove, he recollected in his Mind
all the Observations he had made, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Mankind; which he imployed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
his Rules of Morality, as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

to <hi>Metaphysical Notices,</hi> and those of <hi>Natural

Piece we have of his Works.</p>
            <p>Next he deliberated what Place was most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for a Settlement;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he was byassed against
his stay in <hi>Britanny,</hi> his Native Country, where
his Family then bore, as it does to this Day, a
considerable Port, foreseeing the Incumbrances
he should find among his Relations, would ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
retard his vehement Pursuit of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
In fine, he resolved on <hi>Holland,</hi> as a Retreat

freest from Disturbance, where every one, <hi>said

            <p>He passed near eight Years in Peace and Quiet,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

prescribed himself, to leave the World as he
found it, without endeavouring to reform it, or
rectifie its Ideas, to think only of finding Truth
for himself, and of conquering his own Passions;
but he was worsted first by that of Printing, and
after by all the other, Authors are subject to, when
they find their Opinions contradicted: For it
must be confessed, although <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had

Justice of the <hi>Procurators</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who thought
they had done him a special Favour, in obliging

caused him to be condemned as an <hi>Heretick</hi> by

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reputation and
Vogue, partly by his Intrigues, brought it
about, that <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Philosophy should be
condemn'd throughout the University, of which
he was Rector: He cited him by the order of
the Magistrates, with a great noise, at the sound
of a Bell, by the notice of a Bedel, to come
and answer to the Calumnies he was said to have
written against <hi>Voetius.</hi> In so much that his
Friends advis'd him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be upon his Guard, as
being scarce secure in the place where he was,
though it was out of the Reach and Jurisdiction
of <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> Two Papers, wherein <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
mention'd <hi>Voetius,</hi> one of which was the Letter
he had wrote to <hi>Father Dinet,</hi> were declared
diffamatory Libels. That Declaration was
Printed, and affix'd and sent to the principal
Towns of the United Provinces. If we may
believe <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> there was no less Design
on Foot, than the Banishing him all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by a Decree, the loading him with prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Fines, the burning his Books by the Hand
of the common Hangman, to which, some said,
<hi>Voetius</hi> had resolv'd to make so great a Fire in
burning of them, as the Flame of it should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all the Countries thereabouts. In a
word, <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was forc'd to get clear of
these Troubles, to imploy the credit of his
Friends, and the Interest of the <hi>French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
that might hinder it from proceeding any
farther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:54814:67"/>
These Quarrels were kept up many Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and <hi>M. Descartes</hi> foreseeing the Apologies he
he design'd to have presented to the Magistrates
of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> to justifie himself, and
demand the reparation of his Honour, would
be ineffectual in the procuring such satisfaction
as he pretended due to him, thought often of
leaving <hi>Holland,</hi> where he found not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he at first propos'd to himself. The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he received from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France</hi> at that
time, with the promise of a good Pension, if
he would come and live at <hi>Paris,</hi> determin'd
him to depart: But the Troubles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
unluckily-stop'd the Career of his good
Fortune. Letters were sent him in Parchment
curiously seal'd, and full of the greatest Praises
in the World: But that was all; nor had he his
Letters <hi>gratis.</hi> Never Parchment, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
says, cost him so dear, and was so unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as that: Nothing could hinder him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to his beloved <hi>Holland,</hi> without fear of
falling afresh into the Hands of <hi>Voetius, Schook</hi>
and <hi>Revius:</hi> But not long after, the <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>Sueden</hi> sent for him to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where 'tis vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
said he dy'd.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto said of the difference
of <hi>Voetius</hi> with <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> has been taken for
the most part out of the Letters of that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.
<hi>Voetius</hi> inform'd us in the <hi>Globe</hi> of the
<hi>Moon,</hi> of the other Particulars that concern'd
himself, to wit, That after <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Holland,</hi> he grew reconcil'd to
<hi>Regius</hi> the Physitian, who in the Feast of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
as a Badge of the real Intentions of
his future Friendship, presented him with some
of <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>Snush,</hi> which he often made use
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54814:68"/>
of, but especially to come to the <hi>Lyceum</hi> in the
<hi>Moon;</hi> that having highly merited of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
by those famous Exploits manag'd against <hi>Regius</hi>
and <hi>Descartes,</hi> in the Defence of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
Philosophy, that <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Philosopher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him the Imploy we saw him in possession
of; that he nevertheless wav'd the accepting of
it, till, understanding that <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Soul left
no Stone unturn'd to bring the Souls of these
Parts over to him, his Zeal for the <hi>Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
had wrought upon him to quit his Body,
in order to oppose the Designs of that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that very <hi>Voetius</hi> that was formerly
the Hero of <hi>Peripa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecism</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Our Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notwithstanding was extraordinary civil on
both Hands; and after our mutual Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to each other, he express'd the Joy he
had to hear <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was hatching no ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon the <hi>Lyceum of the Moon.</hi> He confess'd
likewise the Regret he had for urging that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
heretofore so far: But that his own
Reputation in <hi>Holland</hi> was incompatible with
<hi>Descartes</hi>'s. That if he had once permitted the
<hi>new Philosophy,</hi> to take Footing in the <hi>Vniversity
of Vtrecht,</hi> he must either have been oblig'd to
learn it, or hold his Tongue in all Disputes:
And he found much uneasiness to consent to one
or the other: That he was then too old to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Descartes</hi>'s Scholar; and that it was easily
guess'd how ungrateful a Task it had been for
an old <hi>Philosophy Professor,</hi> to hear all his Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
disputed, without the Priviledg of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, at least by way of Arguing; for that
<hi>Descartes</hi> having thrown out of Doors the
Terms made use of in the Schools, he had been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54814:68"/>
oblig'd in all publick Acts, to stand as a Person
that was Deaf and Dumb: He that had always
been renown'd for his Subtilty and Penetration.
That he had observ'd in his Philosophy many
good Things, among abundance of others that
seem'd somewhat hard. And that having often
discours'd <hi>Aristotle</hi> concerning that Philosophy,
they had both concluded it would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to make some Accommodation, and if
we were willing, it would be no trouble to him,
to enter in a particular Conference thereupon:
We gladly embrac'd his Offer, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
order'd his Attendants to retire, he spoke
as follows:</p>
            <p>You may easily see, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> by the Rank I
hold there, I have a great share in the Favours
of the <hi>Prince</hi> our <hi>Soveraign:</hi> I have yet a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in his Confidence: You will readily think so,
by one Profession he has made me, and which I
am well assur'd I may safely venture to make
you in his Name. It is this, That his Interests
are indeed closely united with the Interests of
those Philosophers that write themselves <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians,</hi>
but at the bottom they are no more the
same than are their Sentiments in point of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy:
But notwithstanding he hath hitherto
dispens'd with the Promiscuous confounding of
them. The Pleasure, and at once the Honour
to see himself Marching at the Head of all the
<hi>Philosophers</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> that with an unanimous
Consent attributed to him the Quality of their
Prince, was well worth the trouble of conniving
at the diametrical Repugnance he saw in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
of most of those, who declar'd to be
intirely his. That division it self, which was
to be found among his most zealous <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isans,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:54814:69"/>
who took it to be a greater Honour, and made
it of more Concernment to have ingag'd him
on their side, than Truth it self, did not a little
contribute to his Glory: To see himself inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on Reason, by the sole weight of his
Authority made Umpire of all the disagreeing
Philosophers; to injoy peaceably the Priviledg
of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> among those that disputed it
with <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> had something charming
in it, that induced him to think it best to be
contented, without being much concern'd at
their taking or mistaking of his meaning; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whatever they say, he only, by the Voice
of both Parties was always in the right. But
since that <hi>M. Descartes, M. Gassendi,</hi> and some
others, have thrown off the Yoak of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to justifie their Conduct have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
and with Success enough, to shew the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
or the unsoundness of some Opinions
of the Schools, of which they pretend to make
him the Warantee, because the best of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
have awarded them unto him with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Consent: He hath thought fit to declare
himself on the first occasion, and to intreat the
<hi>Publick,</hi> as also those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> the <hi>new Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
to do him Justice in that Particular. He
protests then to separate his Interest in many
Articles from theirs, that style themselves his
Disciples: He declares that in the <hi>Questions</hi> of
the <hi>Schools,</hi> many things go under his Name
which are none of his; as is for Instance, that
most Childish Notion of the <hi>Horror of a Vacuum.</hi>
That he himself hath certify'd and prov'd by
Experience, the Pressure of the Air, which at
this Day is made a Principle in the Physical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilcation
of such <hi>Phenomena's,</hi> as have most alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54814:69"/>
to the Question of a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> That he is
no ways the Father of an infinite little Beings,
introduc'd in the School Philosophy. That his
Writings have often been mis-interpreted, and
Men have commonly taken for Natural Beings,
what in his <hi>Idea</hi> were only Denomina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ions and
Metaphysical Attributes.</p>
            <p>This Calm, <hi>continu'd he,</hi> with which I speak,
after that ungovernable Obstinacy you formerly
knew me guilty of, might stand for my Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
as to you, in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Absence: But I
will farther add, that since you meet him out
of the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> he hath dispatch'd an
Express, in which he gives orders, that if you
pass'd this way, I should not fail to inform you
of his Thoughts and Intentions, and to let you
know that whatever Warmth appear'd in him
in his Discourse against <hi>Descartes,</hi> he would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
gladly hearken to some Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
with him: Furthermore this is no unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
Resolution. The Expedient has been
form'd, and written long ago, and the Fault
will not be ours if you do not see it, and take
upon you the presenting it to <hi>Descartes,</hi> if you
so think convenient. We return'd, we most
joyfully accepted it, and that we thought our
selves happy any ways to contribute to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of the <hi>two greatest Philosophers</hi> the
World has known, and the Reunion of two
Parties, that were at present the only conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in <hi>Europe.</hi> He took forthwith out of a
Cabinet that was at the end of the Hall, and
where, upon handsom Shelves, stood a good
sight of Books, excellently bound, and that
look'd exactly like Books the new Philosophers
have compos'd, within this thirty or forty

must forthwith accord; that the Sect-Leaders
of Philophy, <hi>Neque omnia, neque nihil viderunt.</hi>
With that he presented us the Project of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and desired us to read it at our
leisure, in our <hi>Voyage;</hi> as also to take with us,
as we had offered at our Arrival, some <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian
Souls,</hi> to accompany us to <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Place
of Residence, to the end he might know by
them, what that <hi>Philosopher</hi> had resolv'd upon
the Propositions laid down in that Treaty. We
thanked him for the Honour he did us, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting
us with so Important a Negotiation;
assured him, we would do all that lay in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the facilitating its Success; and after
much Expression and Acknowledgment of his
Civilities, we beg'd his leave we might persue
our <hi>Voyage,</hi> since we had a vast way still to go,
and had spent many Hours in that we had pass'd
already. He conducted us out of the <hi>Lyceum,</hi>
and giving some Instructions to two Souls of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54814:70"/>
the Country, that seem'd Spirits of Note and
Fashion, ordered them to wait on us, so made
his <hi>Conge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Designing to run over that whole <hi>Hemisphere</hi>
of the <hi>Moon</hi> that is oppos'd to <hi>our Earth,</hi> we
kept on our Road to the North, and leaving
<hi>Democritus</hi> on the left, we pass'd through <hi>Thales,</hi>
and drove on quite to <hi>Zoroaster;</hi> from whence
we made a double towards the West, through
desert Lands, where we saw the ruins of some
ancient Towns, as of <hi>Atlas, Cepheus, Hermes,</hi>
without meeting Man, Woman or Child, till
we came to the <hi>Lake of Dreams,</hi> on whose Banks
we found three separate Spirits, with whom we
were taken up one Moment in Discourse, as we
passed along.</p>
            <p>We surprized the two first, stoutly Cursing
and Banning their Wives they had formerly in
the World. One of which was, that <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi>
mention'd by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Body abed, to make a Ramble, as his
Custom was, his Wife, that did not love him,
slipt not the opportunity of calling up her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to whom she shewed, not without tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Hair and playing the Mad-woman, the
Body of her Husband unsoul'd and breathless,
and carried the Humour on so well, that the
Body was burnt, according to the custom of the
Country, before the Soul return'd, who was
from thenceforth forced to seek another Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The other Spirit was a <hi>Roman Senator,</hi> whose
Name was <hi>Lamia,</hi> whose Wife had trickt out of
the World by the same Project, though, a little
more it had miscarried. For as he related it,
The Soul being ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rned to look its Body, where
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54814:71"/>
'twas left, not finding it, and seeing the Family
Mourning, begun to smell how the Matter
stood: It Posted presently to the place where
was built the Funeral Pile to burn the Body,
and arriv'd there, just as the Fire began to seize
it. The Soul thought it inconvenient to reunite
her self with it, for fear it might be obliged to
be burnt alive, she only mov'd its Tongue, so
as many of the Standers by heard these Words
twice distinctly repeated, <hi>I am not dead, I am
not dead.</hi> But seeing the Masters of the Funeral
Ceremonies, who had undoubtedly received an
<hi>Item</hi> from the Dame, unconcerned as 'ere, she
left it to be burnt, and came to fix in the <hi>Globe
of the Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, whom we found two Leagues
farther in a ghastly Grot, was the famous <hi>Iohn
Duns Scotus,</hi> commonly called <hi>Scot,</hi> or the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Doctor.</hi> He has pass'd for a dead Man unto
this day, on which Account some have given
out most ridiculous Stories, and highly disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the Reputation of so worthy a
Person, and which have still been well confuted.
But the truth is that he is not dead; and that
having by the subtilty of his Mind, found out
the Secret so many others have procured, his
Corps was taken for dead, and was buried in
the absence of his Soul, which took Sanctuary
in the <hi>Globe of the Moon.</hi> He was incompass'd
by a Croud of little (I know not what you call
them, for they were not <hi>Beings,</hi> but I think)
<hi>Formalities.</hi> He was the first Father of them in
the <hi>Philosophical World,</hi> and he that gave them
first Repute. They be the prettyest, littlest,
slender,—you'd think them next to <hi>nothing.</hi>
Perceiving we were Philosophers, to be a little
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54814:71"/>
more affable than ordinary, he began to ask us
what we thought of an <hi>Vniversal a parte rei,</hi>
and whether we did not take it to be <hi>Objective
Precisions?</hi> Our <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> who besides his
<hi>Cartesian Ideas</hi> upon Philosophy, had still a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of that gruff and surly Humour <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Compliments had provok'd, answered him in a
careless Air, We concern not our Heads much
with such insipid Trifles; that it was but <hi>Irish
Gibbrish,</hi> and that none of us had any Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Elogy <hi>Buchanan</hi> gives his Country
Philosphers, otherwise Men of Sense and
Worth,
<q>Gens ratione furens &amp; mentem pasta Chimeris.</q>
Trifles and Chimera's, reply'd <hi>Scotus!</hi> They are
the finest and most solid Questions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
By this it was we distinguished our
selves in my time; by that Subtilty wherewith
I handled these Questions, I was advanced to
the quality of <hi>Doctor Subtilis.</hi> Trifles and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras,
quoth a! You <hi>French</hi> Philosophers, have
you ever read the History of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of
<hi>Paris?</hi> If you have not read it, read it: You
will see if these things were look'd on hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as Trifles. You will see under the Reign
of the young <hi>Lewis,</hi> one <hi>Rousselin</hi> of <hi>Britanny,</hi>
at the Head of the <hi>Nominals,</hi> disputing Hand to
Fist in the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> against those who
held an Universal <hi>a parte rei,</hi> and from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they came to Swords, that there was
Man-slaughter in the Case. You will see, what
I have been told is done, since I quit your
World. That in the reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Eleventh,</hi>
the Court and Parliament interposed themselves
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54814:72"/>
in Philosophical Differences, which you call
Trifles; that by the order of the King, the
Books of the <hi>Nominals</hi> were chain'd and pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock'd,
strictly prohibiting the opening them
ever after: And I would to God, those Decrees
had not been repeal'd by the Asserters of that
empty Philosophy, which will have Universality
consist in Names and Conceptions: Then at
this day I should have reign'd absolute in the
Schools.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>continu'd he</hi>) taking Courage, Are not
you of that Party of Philosophers I have heard
talk of some time since, and whose Works I have
likewise seen in a Visit I made <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who
have a certain <hi>British Cavilier</hi> for their Leader,
called <hi>Descartes?</hi> Yea verily, <hi>reply'd our old</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian,
and we take it as an Honour so to be.
Be gone, cry'd he, all in a Rage and Passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Away with you! Hence Hereticks, as you are,
who take it for an Honour to be of a Sect, which
by its Principles is oblig'd to renounce the
Faith of our most Holy Mysteries. Your <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
holds that a determinate Extension is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to a Body, and that a Body being once
of the size of a Cubical Foot, it would be as
great a Contradiction to lose that Extension, as
to conceive a Mountain without a Valley. It
will be then a Contradiction that the <hi>Body</hi> of the
<hi>Saviour</hi> of the World which had the bulk of
many Feet, should be comprehended in the space
of the least Particle of the Consecrated Host.
Once more be gone Excommunicates: And since
you will stay here in spight of me, I abandon the
place; and forthwith he march'd off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:54814:72"/>
That his extraordinary Zeal was no less sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
than diverting. But that which pleas'd
me most, was, That upon our leaving that
place, the two <hi>Aristotelian Souls</hi> which <hi>Voetius</hi>
had deputed to accompany us, began by the
way to resume the Argument of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and to
urge it vigourously against <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> and
my <hi>old Man,</hi> who were much perplexed to rid
their Hands of it. But they proposed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against the manner whereby <hi>M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and after him <hi>M. Rohault</hi> undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Mystery of the Eucharist, without the
assistance of <hi>absolute Accidents;</hi> which may merit
a place in this Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Descartes</hi> in his Answer to the fourth Set
of Objections, propos'd against his Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Meditations, explains the Mystery of the
Eucharist as follows. He says, That the Body
of <hi>I. C.</hi> after the Consecration, is in the self-same
place the Bread was in before; but that it
is so precisely in the same space, that in what
place soever, it was true to affirm before the
Consecration, here is Bread; it is true to say
after the Consecration, here is the Body of
<hi>I. C.</hi> So that if we conceive that before the
Consecration there was, whether in the Surface
or in the Substance of the Bread, little Pirami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
Cubical or Triangular Spaces, fill'd with
Piramidal, Cubical or Triangular Parts of
Bread, we must conceive, after the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
those little Spaces are possessed in the same
exactness by the Body of <hi>I. C.</hi> From whence it
follows, according to him, That when 'tis said
the Body of <hi>I. C.</hi> is comprehended in the same
Dimensions, and the very Superficies as the
Bread, by that word Superficies is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54814:73"/>
not only that external Surface that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
the total Figure of the Bread, but also
that which terminates all the parts which are in
the depth and substance of it, separated from
one another by the Pores, and little Intervals that
are fill'd up with Air, or some other Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Bodies: In so much that should some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
parts of the Bread be put in motion by
the Air, or some other Body, the new Substance,
that takes the place of those insensible Parts, is
equally put in Motion.</p>
            <p>Upon that Supposition <hi>M. Descartes</hi> argues
thus. Whatever makes an Impression upon our
Senses is only the Superficies of a Body. Every
Body therefore that has the same Superficies as
the Bread, will make the same Impressions on
our Senses as the Bread. Therefore since the
Body of <hi>I. C.</hi> is so precisely in the same space
as the Bread, that it hath the same Superficies to
an Hair, it must inevitably make the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on our Senses as the Bread, that is, it
must reflect the Light, as the Bread did, and
with the same Modifications: And from hence
we see in it the same Colour and the same Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
It must be press'd towards the Centre of
the Earth, by the Impulse of the same Matter
that pressed the Bread before, because of the
Figuration of its Parts of which it was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and hence we perceive in it the same Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
It must vibrate the Nerves of our Tongue,
and insinuate it self into the Pores, just as did
the insensible parts of the Bread; and hence
we apprehend in it the same Taste, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From
whence he concludes, That Mystery may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
explained, without the incumbrance of
absolute Accidents, which are kept in service
without any occasion for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:54814:73"/>
See then one Difficulty among many others
our <hi>Peripateticks</hi> proposed against that Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we will demonstrate (<hi>said they</hi>) that,
granting that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the Bread is not at all
changed into the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> but that after the Consecration, the
Bread still remains in the Host.</p>
            <p>In order to their Demonstration they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> and <hi>the old Gentleman:</hi>
I. Whether by the Principles of <hi>Descartes,</hi> the
Matter of all Bodies considered in it self, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently
of the different Modifications of its
Parts was not of the same Species? They answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Yes. II. If that which constituted the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
Difference of Bodies was not, according to
them, the different Configuration, the different
Situation, and the different Motions of the Parts
of those Bodies? They acknowledged it. That
supposed, <hi>said they,</hi> we'll evidently prove, That
the Substance in the Eucharist, after its Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
is nothing else but Bread; for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or the Substance, which hath the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration
of Parts, the same Motion, and in a
Word, all the same Modifications that constitute
the Essence of Bread, is Bread, according to the
aforesaid Principle: But the Substance found in
the Dimensions of the Host, after the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has all those Modifications; and 'tis only
by the Means of those Modifications we conceive
it to have the same Superficies as the Bread, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word Superficies in the same Sense <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
gives it: And 'tis in vertue of those Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
that that Superficies makes the same Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on our Senses as the Bread did before
the Consecration: And 'tis from the same Reason
that it reflects its Light precisely to the same
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54814:74"/>
Angles as the Bread: That it receives all the
same Impulses, and the same Determinations of
the Matter, that pushes it towards the Centre,
as the Bread: That it communicates the same
Vibrations to the Nerves of the Tongue as
the Bread: Therefore the Substance that is
in the Space of the Host, after the Consecration,
according to <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Principles, has the Form
or the Essence of Bread; therefore it is Bread,
which was to be demonstrated. And from thence
our Catholick <hi>Peripateticks</hi> concluded, It was not
without good Ground that Recourse was had to
<hi>Absolute Accidents,</hi> in the Explication of that
Mystery.</p>
            <p>They made yet one Reflection more upon a
Saying <hi>Descartes</hi> adjoyns to his Explication, and
which ruines his Answer. <q>Notwithstanding,
<hi>says he,</hi> the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to speak
properly, is not there, as in a Place, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally.</q>
For, said they, What is it, for
God's sake, to be in a Place in proper speaking,
but entirely to fill a Space? to hinder the Passage
of other Bodies that present themselves; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
the Light, to be pressed downward; to
have Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all this, according to
<hi>Descartes,</hi> agrees to the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in
the Sacrament of the Host. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Notion commonly received of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Existence attributes not to a Body in that
Capacity all those Properties; for none of those
that have spoke of the Body of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in
the Sacrament, have supposed it was that which
reflects the Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, they say the quite
contrary.</p>
            <p>So they concluded, deriding the Vanity of the
Applause <hi>M. Descartes</hi> assumes to himself in that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54814:74"/>
Place, upon the Intelligible Manner, wherewith
he pretends to have explained that Mystery, and
upon the Obligations he has laid on the <hi>Orthodox
Divines,</hi> for having furnished them with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
more agreeable with <hi>Divinity</hi> than those
usually received. Applause, as well grounded as
the Prophecy he made a little after, by which
one Day it shall come to pass, that as soon as
the World shall be reclaimed from the <hi>Prejudices</hi>
of the <hi>School,</hi> all the Opinions of our Old <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
and <hi>Divines</hi> thereupon, shall disappear and
vanish as Shadows, at the Approach of that Light,
wherewith those Glorious Principles of the New
Philosophy shall fill the Minds of all such as know
how well to use them.</p>
            <p>For my part, I was of Opinion, upon hearing
<hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> so refuted, that he had better
have stuck to his general Answer, be it as bad as it
will, That he was a <hi>Philosopher</hi> and not a <hi>Divine,</hi>
and that he pretended not to explain the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our <hi>Religion</hi> by the Principles of his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</hi>
I was astonished too in that Occurrence,
That such sort of Answers had the good Luck
to meet with no Reply, especially having to do
with <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> who would never willingly
take the last Blow in Point of Disputes and Books.
But I am persuaded I have since found the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Difficulty in a Letter <hi>M. Decsartes</hi>
wrote to a <hi>Father of the Oratory, a Sorbon Doctor.</hi>
He says, speaking of <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> That his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judgment, as young a Doctor as he was, was
of more Weight with him, than that of half
the Ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi> Was not a
Clearing of that nature able to disarm the most
incensed Adversary in the World?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:54814:75"/>
During that Dispute, wherein <hi>Father Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and the Old Blade thought it unnecessary to
keep to Mood and Figure, and were content to
evade the Objection by much raillery upon <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Accidents,</hi> alledging they ought to be banish'd
to the Desert of <hi>Scotus,</hi> to make up his Train
and Attendance, with all his little <hi>Formalities;</hi>
We crossed the <hi>Calm Sea,</hi> and turning short to
the Right, we passed through <hi>Hipparchus, Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus,</hi>
and the <hi>Peninsula of the Stars,</hi> and from
thence we cut through the <hi>Sea of Clouds.</hi> We
entred into the <hi>Demy-Island of Dreams,</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the beginning; so called from the little
Mansions in the Globe of the Moon, inhabited
for the most Part with <hi>Chymists,</hi> that are in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the <hi>Philosopher's Stone,</hi> having not been
able to find it upon Earth; and a World of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Astrologers,</hi> who still are as great Asses as
they were in the other World, and spend all
their Time in making <hi>Almanacks,</hi> and correcting
by exact Supputations the false <hi>Horoscopes</hi> they
made in their Life time.</p>
            <p>Among others we found <hi>Cardan,</hi> who though
he was possessed of a good Copy-hold Eastward,
on the Shoar of the <hi>Ocean of Tempests,</hi> could not
yet forbear making frequent Visits of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the same Society. He passed away his
Time but discontentedly, having not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the Shagrin and Melancholy, occasioned
by that Notable <hi>Horoscope of</hi> Edward <hi>VI. King of</hi>
England, whose most remarkable Fortunes and
Adventures he had foretold, quite to the Fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Year of his Age, who yet had the confounded
Luck to die at Fifteen. Two other things, much
of the same Nature, entertained his Thoughts
in that deep Melancholy: The first was the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54814:75"/>
Death of his Son, whose Horoscope had proved
Faulty, he having not foreseen what yet came to
pass, That he should be executed at <hi>Milan,</hi> in
the four and twentieth Year of his Age, for
poysoning his Wife. The other thing was the
uncharitable behaviour of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Monsieur
de Thou,</hi> in publishing in their Books to all Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
That he was suffered to dye with Hunger.
For after all, <hi>said he to us,</hi> they are Lyars, for
were <hi>I dead,</hi> 'twas impossible I should be here.
I must confess, that having foretold the Day of
my Death, in my Horoscope, I made my self,
and finding I was mistaken, seeing at the Time
prescribed no Sign or Symptom of approaching
Death, I shut my self in my Closet; and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Confidence to appear from thenceforth in
the Sight of Men, since every Moment of my
Life to come had been the continual Reproach of
my Mistake, I even resolved to quit my Body,
and come and inhabit here. And this, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
is the real Truth of the Matter. We took
occasion to extenuate the Causes of his Affliction,
by telling him of the Reputation he always had,
with a <hi>non obstante</hi> to all that, in the World, as
an extraordinary Man, and distinguished from
the Vulgar: After which we took our Leave of
him, and posted from thence to <hi>Mersennus,</hi> where
we launched for our Voyage over the Moon.
There it was that the two Philosophers stepping
aside for some Moments, we read, altogether,
the Project of Accommodation betwixt <hi>Aristotle</hi>
and <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> which <hi>Voetius</hi> had given us
charge of, and whose principal Articles I shall
here relate. It was divided into two Parts;
The first was to regulate the Method, how the
<hi>Aristotelians</hi> and <hi>Cartesians</hi> must for the future
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54814:76"/>
demean themselves towards one another, in their
Books, Disputes and Conversations. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which was very long, contained several
Propositions, that the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> remitted, to
make some Advances nearer the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the like Abatements from the <hi>Cartesians,</hi>
whereby they might approach better the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians.</hi>
That Second Part was rather a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of many <hi>Cartesian</hi> Opinions than a Treaty
of Accommodation, which gave me to conjecture
it would fail of the Success they promised to
themselves, or at least pretended to propose
themselves. 'Tis easie to see that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or
at least <hi>Voetius</hi> his Secretary was well informed
of our Sublunary Occurrences, and what was for
and against his Party and his Adversary's.</p>
            <div type="treaty">

each other; that Way being unphiloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,
and being likewise already exploded the
Schools, by the Worthiest and best of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:54814:76"/>
The Ladies and knowing Women must no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
treat <hi>Aristotle</hi> on their Besides as a Fop and a
Pedant: They ought to know he has been a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
a Man of Courtship and Intrigue, who,
before he became a Philosopher, took his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and spent his Estate, that was no little one,
being Son of the Chief Physician to <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
Grandfather of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and perhaps there
was never a Philosopher in the World more a
<hi>Courtier</hi> and a <hi>Gentleman</hi> than <hi>he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other Hand the Old Professors of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy

                  <p>

That in the New Impressions of the Works
of some of his Followers, some Prefaces be lopt
off, or rather some Malicious Satyrs against the
<hi>School Philosophers,</hi> not caring to distinguish them
from one another, and throwing unjustly upon all,
the Faults of some Particulars, such as are the
Passion of Wrangling, Confusion, Equivocal

Terms, and Ignorance in the most Curtious Parts
of Physicks.</p>
                  <p>It shall be prohibited all the <hi>Cartesians</hi> to give
a Character of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Merit, before they have
read him, especially before they have seen his

others, where he treats Natural Philosophy in
Particulars: And they shall take heed of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Judgment on that <hi>Philosopher</hi>'s Parts by his
Books <hi>De Phisico auditu,</hi> that are not so clear and
perspicuous as his others; the Author having his
private Reasons for his writing in that manner;
which have yet been more confounded in Tract

who often talk <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                  <p>Be it prohibited likewise all the <hi>Peripateticks</hi>
to be angry at <hi>Descartes</hi>'s philosophy before
they have throughly examined it, under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of rendring themselves ridiculous, as some
have done, who have placed him in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of <hi>Atomists;</hi> that is, of such as fancy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
composed of <hi>Atoms</hi> or indivisible Parts; or
as another that wrote ingenuously to <hi>M.
Descartes</hi> himself, he had plainly seen with his

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Aristotle</hi> entreats the <hi>Gentlemen Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
not to father upon him whatever they find
in the Books of his Disciples, without consulting
himself; promising on his part, to give no one

                  <p>WHereas the Article of <hi>Substantial Eorms</hi>
hath occasioned the greatest Noise and
Division between both Parties, as may be seen

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> complained forthwith of the Delicacy
of the first <hi>Cartesians,</hi> who thought it advisable
to take Disgust at the very Name of <hi>Substantial
Forms.</hi> For suppose, said he, that no more was
meant by that Word than the Principle of the
Properties of every Body, and that which is the
Cause why one Body so differs from another, that
Use has given it a particular Name, and made it
a Species distinct from other Kinds of Bodies:
What hath that Term so Distastful and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54814:78"/>
As to the Idea the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have
affixed to it, making it to speak, an <hi>Incomplete
Substance distinct from Matter;</hi> he said, That
Definition being no where to be found in his
Writings, at least in express Terms, he might,
if he thought good, disown it, and devolve
upon the <hi>Arabian Commentators,</hi> as on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of that <hi>Being,</hi> all the Railleries and fine
Things pretended to be spoke by the <hi>new Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
on that Chapter. But that he was not yet
in that Humour, the <hi>Cartesians</hi> having concluded
nothing rationally against that System. That
an <hi>Incomplete Substance</hi> was no <hi>Chimera,</hi> since the
reasonable Soul in Man is undoubtedly so.
That their grand <hi>Axiom</hi> brought to demolish
<hi>Substantial material Forms,</hi> viz. Whatever is
Material is Matter; was palpably false, as they
have been answered an hundred times, seeing
Motion and Figure, which are material Things,
are notwithstanding devoid of Matter; and also
that he lookt upon the ordinary Doctrin of
<hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> as his true Doctrin. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
adjoyn'd he, we shall see what use
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> will make of it, and what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he will offer on his part. When he shall
have granted Brutes a Soul, the Peripateticks
will consider whether they shall recede from some
other Point.</p>
                  <p>Upon which, he brought many Arguments
to persuade him to be less hardy and intractable
thereupon. He represented how that Article of
his Philosophy had shockt the whole World.
That his earnestness and zeal for that Opinion
had been excusable, if he had been the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
but it is well known a Spaniard, called
<hi>Pereyra,</hi> first lit upon that Notion; and some
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54814:78"/>
were so malicious as to say, he had drawn it
from the Spaniard's Book before he deduc'd it
from his own Principles. That he had already
gain'd, by that Opinion, as much Honour as
could be expected; that it was lookt upon in the
World as an Ingenious Paradox, on which he
and his Disciples had descanted very subtly, and
had sufficiently plagu'd and tormented the
School Philosophers; but that the latter and
more intelligent sort of Men could not forbear
Laughing, when they seriously undertook to
maintain it as a Truth. That 'twas known
this was the first Effect the Preface to a Book,
Entituled,<note place="margin">L' Ame des Betes.</note> 
                     <hi>The Soul of Beasts,</hi> produced in the
Mind of its Readers. A Book wrote indeed
with a great deal of Wit, but wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
too seriously drives at the Conversion of
the Philosophers upon that Subject. That no
one had brought one substantial Reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the prejudice of all Mankind in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
That no one had yet demonstrated
that a middle Being, betwixt Spirit and Matter,
was a thing impossible. That the Promise the
<hi>Cartesians</hi> had made, to explain all that we see
admirable in Beasts, by the sole disposition of
the <hi>Machine</hi> was whimsical, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
on, since it never had been put in Practice.
That when they talked of these Matters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
they sometimes spoke pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sibly enough;
but when they descended to Particulars, they
were either much to be pitied or not endured.
That the only Idea of the manner of Brutes
acting on infinite occasions, compared with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at
Paradox, made it look extravagant. That
whereas 'twas answered, that Argument prov'd
too much, and made for the reasoning of Beasts;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54814:79"/>
it must be acknowledged that Instance perplex'd
the Philosophers, and gave them trouble to get
clear off; yet after all, whatever pain it put
them to, their Argument lost nothing of its
Force; and the Instance on the other hand infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
increased the difficulty. For if it be hard
to comprehend, that Beasts should not have
Reason, upon seeing them act in so admirable
and methodical a manner, how much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
would it be to deny them bare Perception?
And lastly, for <hi>Descartes</hi> to give up that point,
would not be construed to retract; having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
declar'd, he could not demonstrate, that
Beasts had not an apprehensive Soul,<note place="margin">Let. 67. Tom. 1.</note> no more
than it could be demonstrated unto him, they
had.</p>
                  <p>After that, <hi>Aristotle</hi> passed to another Point,
which had some Connexion with the former;
which was, <hi>The Essence of the Soul,</hi> made by
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> to consist in actual <hi>Thinking,</hi> as he
makes the <hi>Essence of a Body</hi> to consist in actual
and determinate <hi>Extension.</hi> He tells them, That
though he has many Scruples, as to his Method
and Manner whereby he offers to demonstrate
the distinction of the Soul and Body, and that
many People continued dissatisfied a little with
the Answers he gave to the Objections of <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus</hi>
and <hi>M. Arnauld;</hi> notwithstanding he
would not dispute him that Glory of having
said something thereon, wholly New and very
Ingenious. That he is likewise disposed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Opinion touching the Essence of the
Soul, provided he would satisfy him as to one
Difficulty taken from Experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:54814:79"/>
Many Persons, said he, have made you that
Objection: That if the Essence of the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in actual Thought, it were impossible she
should exist without thinking; and thus it
would follow, we should have Thought whilst
we were in our Mother's Belly. You will not
scruple in the least that Consequence: And as
to what's rejoyned by them, that had we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
Thought, whilst we were in that Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
we must necessarily have remembred some
one of those Thoughts, at least, that we had
there: You answer, The reason of our Non-remembrance,
is, because the Memory consists
in certain Traces, which being made in the
Brain, upon thinking of an Object, are there
preserv'd; and that the Brain of Infants is too
moist and soft for the preservation of those
Traces, at least in such a manner as is requisite
to cause remembrance. But you are pressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Answer,<note place="margin">Lettr. Tom. 2.</note> for as much as in several places
of your Writings, you distinguish Memory into
two sorts, whereof one depends upon the Body,
and those Tracks or Footsteps impressed upon
the Brain; and the other, which is purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual,
depends upon the Soul above. You
also distinguish Notices into two kinds: The one
that depend upon the Organ, and the other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,
that are wholly Independent on it.
Now we can easily apprehend that the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Brain of an Infant, may be in the
cause why the Soul recollects not those Thoughts
which have their dependence on it; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Memory wholly intellectual, those
pure Conceptions, those immaterial Notices
which are altogether independent on the Organ,
and the different Plaits or Impresses of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54814:80"/>
Brain, the humidity of the Brain can be of no
Moment, and we must undoubtedly remember
those Thoughts, and the Motions of the Will
that have pursued them. You will say, that an
Infant in the Mother's Womb is destitute of
those pure Notices, and of the use of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Memory.<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Let. 4. 38.</note> But that is the thing I am
asking a sufficient Reason for, and of which I
should be highly pleas'd to be convinced. In
effect <hi>Voetius</hi> had given express Orders to both
his <hi>Envoys,</hi> to see that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> gave a clear
Explication of the Point.</p>
                  <p>From the Essence of the Soul they proceeded
to the Essence of the Body. <hi>Aristotle</hi> entred on
that Article with an acknowledgment of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
he formerly fell into, advertising at the
same time <hi>M. Descartes</hi> to take care to avoid the
like Misfortune. I believed, said he, the
World was from all Eternity, upon a false
Principle I suffered my self to pre-possessed
with, to wit, That God was a <hi>necessary</hi> Being in
his <hi>Actions,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Existence.</hi> You
have one also, of which the self same Error is
the necessary Consequence: And I am not the
first that has put you in mind of it. You not
only affirm, That the Essence of Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in Extension, but farther, That <hi>Matter,
Extension</hi> and <hi>Space,</hi> are but three different
Names of one and the same Thing: From
whence, with you, it follows, That wherever
we conceive Extension and Space, there must
necessarily be Matter. And from thence you
conclude, the World is boundless and infinite,
or, as you choose to speak, indefinite in Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Your Adversaries of the Terrestrial
World have indeavoured to demonstrate, That
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54814:80"/>
bottoming on those same Principles, the World
and Matter must always have been, and that
Matter must necessarily continue always. For
as there is Matter at present, where we conceive
at present Space and Extension, so by the same
Reason there always has been, and ever will be,
Matter, where we conceive there ever has been,
and ever will be Space and Extension. But
we conceive that there always has been, and
that there always will be Space and Extension,
where the World at present stands. This is a
nice Point, and might justifie the Conduct of
the <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Vtrecht</hi> on your
Respect. Betwixt our selves (<hi>continu'd he</hi>)
the reasoning that bewildered you in that unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
Maze is a meer Sophism. A <hi>real</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
say you, cannot comport with <hi>nothing.</hi>
Now to be extended, is a <hi>real</hi> Attribute, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
therefore agree with <hi>nothing.</hi> It agrees not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
with Space, and with what we
imagine above the Firmament, and call by the
Name of Space. Therefore that which is above
the Firmament is real. Therefore that which
is in the Indefinite above the Firmament, is
Matter. Therefore Matter, Extension and
Space, are the self-same thing.</p>
                  <p>You ought to have apprehended the defect of
that Reasoning from two Respects. First, from
the Consequence that is taken from thence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
for the Eternity of the World, and
which voluntarily offers it self to the Mind.
Secondly, that supposing it false, as indeed it is,
that the World should be Eternal, they'l de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
to you by an Argument, exactly like
yours, that another Attribute, no less real than
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> you term so, comports with nothing.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54814:81"/>
For if the World is not Eternal, it is plain a
Man may truly say, that <hi>nothing</hi> is Eternal;
since, excepting God, there has <hi>Nothing</hi> been
from all Eternity. Now to be Eternal, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
as real an Attribute as to be extended.
But as it is a manifest Absurdity to affirm, a real
Attribute can accord with <hi>nothing,</hi> it is necessary
to reconcile it all, that you agree with your
Adversaries, that those Words, <hi>Extended</hi> and
<hi>Eternal,</hi> when attributed to <hi>Nothing</hi> and to <hi>Space,</hi>
make in our Minds quite contrary Ideas, to
what we have upon our attributing them to a
<hi>Being</hi> or a <hi>Body.</hi> When we attribute them to a
Being or a Body, they signifie something <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
when we attribute them to Nothing and
to Space, they give a <hi>Negative</hi> signification.
In a Word, when 'tis said, nothing is Eternal,
no more is meant, than that there has been no
Being created from all Eternity. And when
'tis said, There is only an extended Space
beyond the Firmament, it is understood there
is no Body there, and that there may be one
to fill up that Void, and nothing of a Body,
which we there conceive. We cannot speak
of <hi>Nothing</hi> and of Space, but we must speak
<hi>Something</hi> of them. We cannot express what
we think of them, but by the Terms in use:
Those Terms are the same we imploy to speak
of Beings: But if we make Reflection on the
Ideas, we shall see they are wholly different,
nor are they ruin'd and destroy'd by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as is pretended.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in Mind of a little Instance,
subtil enough upon this Subject, which formerly
Dr. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re,</hi> an English Gentleman, gave you,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54814:81"/>
he whose Elogies went so far as to apply to you
what <hi>Horac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> said of <hi>Homer; Qui nil molitur
inepte.</hi> He propos'd this Question to you.
Suppose that God should destroy the World,
and reproduce it a little after, might not it be
said there would be, or at least, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
there would be some Interval between the
Destruction and Reproduction of the World,
although nothing of real interceeded betwixt
them both? From whence he proceeded to
conclude, That supposing in a Chamber God
should annihilate all the Bodies that are between
the Walls, there would yet be Length, Breadth
and Depth, although at the same time there
was nothing real there. He thought to have
foil'd you, supposing you would readily have
assented to his first Proposition, of which there
seem'd no Doubt or Scruple: But I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he found himself well enough Match'd,
when you deny'd him that we could conceive
in his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> any Duration or Interval, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Destruction and new Production of
the World.</p>
                  <p>The Author of a Letter wrote some years
ago to a <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosopher, afforded the
Reader Sport and Diversion enough upon that
Point, by several very pretty <hi>Hypotheses</hi> which
he offers. But as I am not given to Trifles, and
'tis unbefitting a Philosopher of my Character
to be merry, I shall only make use of your own
Principles. I'll take that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Air in a Chamber to be destroy'd by
God, without any admittance or production of
another Body there. That <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
makes it manifest, That Extension may
be conceiv'd without a Body, and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54814:82"/>
that the Essence of Matter consists not
in Extension. You will not admit of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis:
But I am going to shew, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
no Contradiction, by a reasoning much
like one of those you make use of in another
Case, and take for Demonstration.</p>
                  <p>For according to you, seeing I distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a thing that thinks, not conceiving Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and because I distinctly conceive Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
not concerning a thing that thinks; I have
good Grounds for my Conclusion, that a thing
which thinks is distinguish'd from Extension
and that Extension is distinguish'd from a thing
that thinks. Thus it is you demonstrate the
distinction of the Body and Soul, and thus it is
evident, one may exist without the other, with-a
Contradiction; and that from this grand
<hi>Maxim,</hi> That the difference of Ideas is the only
means we have of knowing the real distinction
of Things, and their Independence upon one
another. Upon that Principle thus I argue.
I most distinctly conceive the Destruction or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation
of a Body, without conceiving the
production of another Body. Therefore it is
no Contradiction a Body should be destroy'd
without another Body's Production. Therefore
it is no Contradiction the Air betwixt the four
Walls of a Chamber should be destroy'd, and
yet no other Body produc'd in its room.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, which turns to the same Account.
I most distinctly conceive a part of Matter, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside all others, and I most distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all other without that, for Instance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conceiving the Air inclos'd in a Chamber.
My <hi>Hypothesis</hi> then is establish'd, as well as the
Consequences that naturally follow, against
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54814:82"/>
your Opinion, touching the Essence of Matter.
So that if you have any Inclination towards a
Peace, you will be content to say, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Things in their natural Capacity, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is necessarily extended; but will willingly
give up that Expression that hath disgusted all
the World: That Extension, Matter and Space,
were all the very same thing.</p>
                  <p>That Insult which <hi>Aristotle</hi> made upon <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bandying one part of his Principles
against another, worsted my <hi>old Gentleman's</hi>
Patience, and rattled him so, that 'was ten to
one but he had tore the Paper on the spot. He
propos'd our going off without acquainting
<hi>Aristotle's Embassadors,</hi> who were stragled a
good way from us, telling us, the Company of
such sort of Cattle was not very pleasing: But
we represented to him how dishonourable a
thing, and unbecoming of <hi>Descartes</hi> that would
be. That that Paper was not so much a Project of
Peace, as a Challenge and Defiance, <hi>Aristotle</hi> had
sent h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>; that probably he might slight it, and
probably he might think it worth while to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it: That <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had so wonderful a
Gift of persuading and captivating Spirits, and
the production of a World was a thing of that
surprizing Nature, that doubtless the two Souls
that bore us Company, must be converted to
<hi>Cartesianism,</hi> provided <hi>M. Descartes</hi> would be
at the pains of explaining his <hi>System</hi> to them
in a plausible and familiar manner. These
Reasons setled him again, and we pursued in
the reading of the Paper, in expectation of
the two Souls.</p>

                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:54814:83"/>
From the Essence of the Body and Soul, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
passed on to their Union, and the Relations
they have betwixt themselves. He began with
great Encomiums on <hi>M. Descartes</hi> for having
opened the Eyes of the Philosophers, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the Unusefulness as well as Absurdity
of their Intentional Species, in many cases, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,</hi>
That he had taught nothing on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
that ought to be held so strange and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
by the Peripateticks, had not
they deserted the Sentiments of their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Master, to follow the Whimsies and
Imaginations of his Commentators. That he
himself had remarked in many Places, That the
Sense of Feeling was dispersed throughout the
Body, and through all the Organs of the other
Senses: That Vision, Taste, the Perception of
Sounds and Smells were only caused by the local
Motion of some Bodies, that touch'd and moved
the Organs of the different Senses; that in effect,
if that Motion were insufficient for the Soul's
perceiving Objects, those intentional Species
substituted in their Place, would be as far from
serving Turn. That he was not for rejecting
<hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Doctrin concerning the Seat of
the Soul in the Pineal Gland, were it proposed
only as a pure <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> since all that others say
amounts to nothing better; but it was insufferable
that System should be urged as a setled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
Truth. And that the Respect <hi>M.
Descartes</hi> still pretended for Truth and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ought to make him qualify and moderate his
Assertions thereupon.</p>
                  <p>He intreated him likewise to be more Human
and good-natured towards those who taught the
Soul was expanded through the Body; and this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54814:83"/>
is what he added to shew the <hi>Cartesians</hi> were a
little Unreasonable in that Affair: For, said he,
when you assert the Soul is placed in the <hi>Pineal
Gland,</hi> either you suppose she takes up all the
extent of that Gland, or that she only possesses
one indivisible part of it; if she possesses all the
Capacity of the Gland, she herself must thence
be extended; for that Consequence entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
yours, which you draw against the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
who make the Soul expanded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body. If she only possesses an indivisible
Part thereof, there must necessarily be some part
of Matter that is indivisible, and not extended:
And thus in admiting that disjunctive Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
you appropriate to the Soul, what you
affirm belongs to Matter only, otherwise you
grant an Attribute to Matter, which on all other
occasions you deny, and pretend according to
your Principles, however we understand it, that
it is the only peculiar of a Spiritual Soul. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
all the Nerves, where are the Radiations
of the Spirits, that enter in and out of the <hi>Pineal
Gland,</hi> can neither part from the same indivisible
Point of the Gland, nor meet there; so that if
the Soul was in an indivisible Point of that Gland,
she could not have the Perception of all Objects
there. But if you reply, The Soul is not in the
Gland as a Body is in another Body, or as a Body
is in a Place, but that the Soul in quality of a
Spirit is not in that <hi>Gland,</hi> but because she acts
there, because she thinks there, wills there and
perceives Objects there; and that, since the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Impressions of Objects terminate in divers
Points of the <hi>Gland,</hi> where she is advertised of
them, it may be said, the Soul is in all the
Gland: The Philosophers that undertake you,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54814:84"/>
are ready to take you up with a fresh Objection:
For if the Soul acts, wills, thinks, apprehends
Objects in all the Gland, that is to say, in a very
devisible Space; and if that be sufficient to affirm
she is in all the Pineal Gland, it will be true, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their <hi>Hypothesis</hi> to say, The Soul is in
all the Body, since it acts and perceives Objects
in all the Body; she sees them in the Eye, as you
say, she perceives them in that part of the Pineal
Gland, where the Optick Nerve doth point, or
the Rays of the Spirits that proceed from that
Nerve; she perceives Sounds in the Ear, or as
you say, she perceives them in another Point of
the Pineal Gland, where the Nerves do center,
or the Rays that serve for that Perception.</p>
                  <p>Thus that pretended Bug-bear of Philosophy,
I mean the Presence of the Soul throughout the
Body, that causes her to feel in the Hand, when
that is prick'd, and makes her move it presently,
and withdraw it, upon the Sense of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
that makes her stir the Foot in order to
advance, methinks is no longer monstrous or
frightful, nor a Prejudice of Infancy evidently
false, seeing that Presence of the Soul through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Body is no other than that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her in the Pineal Gland, the Pineal Gland
being extended as well as the whole Body; for
the Diminutivenss of the Extension makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Purpose: Why therefore should that
Vertual Extension of a Spirit be turned to a Jest
and Ridicule, when 'tis the same as is admitted
by the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> when both are well explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
and undoubtedly all the Sensations may
very near be as justly explained upon this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
as upon that of the Pineal Gland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:54814:84"/>
From all which <hi>Aristotle</hi> concluded, That <hi>M.
Descartes</hi> had better acknowledg with the wisest
and least conceited of the Philosophers, that
the Relation the Soul had with the Body in the
Perception of Objects, was an incomprehensible
Mystery to the Mind of Man: That the manner
of Objects acting on the Senses, as also how their
Action was carried to the Brain, might be very
well explained, but that a Bar was put to all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Progress, unless a Man would run himself
into an unintelligible Jargon, or advance Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
dangerous in themselves, or in the
Conclusions that might be deduced from
them.</p>
                  <p>He went on in commending <hi>M. Descartes</hi> for
his Integrity,<note place="margin">Lett. de Desc. Tom. 1. Lett. 69.</note> manifested in his declaring there
was nothing in the Idea of a Soul, or a Spirit,
that included an Impossibility of the Production
of Motion by them; and at once he blamed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness
of the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> who fool-hardily
advanced, That no Creature whatsoever had the
Power of producing Motion. It is true, adjoyned
he, with a little dash of Malice, that Paradox,
as ill founded as it is, is one of the Principal Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the <hi>Cartesian System:</hi> For without it how
should an equal Quantity of Motion be kept up
in the World, where there are so many Souls,
so many Angels, and so many Devils, whose
greatest Pastime it is to produce and create Hurly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burlies
every Moment? But <hi>M. Descartes</hi> is so
much more Praise worthy for preferring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of <hi>Truth</hi> before those of his own <hi>System,</hi>
as dear and beloved as it was.</p>
                  <p>The next Article was upon that grand Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In resp. ad 5. object. Let. 110. Tom. 1.</note> That the Essences of
Things and Truths commonly called necessary,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54814:85"/>
are not independent of God, and that they are
only eternal and immutable, because God hath
will'd it so: That God is the total and efficient
Cause of the Truth of Propositions: That it
was equally arbitrary for God to cause that it
should be false, that all the Lines drawn from
the center to the Circumference should be equal,
as to create the World: See then the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what <hi>Aristotle</hi> spoke at length upon
that Subject.</p>
                  <p>He said, He did not well understand what was
the Sense and Meaning of those Words, <hi>God is
the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ficient and total Cause of the Truth of Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
For the Truth of a Proposition, since it is
not a Being, but a meer Relation of Conformity
that it hath with its Object, could not, to speak
properly, have an efficient Cause; and if in
some Sense it might be said to have an efficient
Cause, that could be nothing but the Mind or
Tongue of him that Frames and Pronounces the
Proposition. Again, he demanded if <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
spoke in general of all Necessary Truths,
or only of some Particulars. He could not
(<hi>continued he</hi>) speak of all: For doubtless he did
not believe that God was, or had been able to
make these Propositions false, <hi>There is a God;
God is the free Cause of all Beings; God is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Being.</hi> He must therefore only speak of
Propositions relating to the Creatures, because
according as he expresses himself in one of
his Letters,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> God is the Author of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
as well as the Existence of the Creatures:
But that he had made a Reflection, That the
Truths which respect the Essence of the Creatures
have a necessary Connexion with those that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the Essence of God; and that if it was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54814:85"/>
possible for the one to be false, the other might
be so too: As, for example, this, <hi>The Creature
essentially depends on God,</hi> is a Proposition belonging
to the Essence of the Creature, which if it could
be false, that other would fall into the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.
<hi>God is the absolute Master and free
Cause of all Beings;</hi> for neither the one could be
true without the other's being so, nor could the
one be false unless the other was likewise false:
Whereupon <hi>Aristotle</hi> advised <hi>M. Descartes</hi> to
have a special Care, lest the profound Respect he
affected towards the Omnipotence of God, should
not only degenerate into Superstition, but should
proceed so far as to bring him to Blasphemous
Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Aristotle</hi> made a frank and honest
Acknowledgment, That <hi>Descartes</hi> had explain'd
the Nature of most sensible Qualities in a finer
and exacter way than he had done: As of the
Hardness of Bodies, of Liquidity, of the Power
of the <hi>Elaverium,</hi> of Cold, of Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
to manifest he had no other Concern than for the
Interests of Truth, he retracted, without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
his Position of the Eternity of the World,
and <hi>his Sphere of Fire.</hi> But since that Sphere of
Fire makes one of the principal Parts of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi>
System, and is one of the chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his World, he presumed that <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
could do no less than abandon all his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes</hi>
in Exchange, against which he urged many
Reasons: But <hi>Voetius</hi> having understood from us
that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was ready to put his World in
Execution, and the Design of our Journey was,
that we might be Witnesses of that mighty Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he wrote a Postscript in the Margent, in
which he promis'd to submit himself to that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54814:86"/>
Experience; and supposing it should answer the
Pretensions of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> his <hi>Vortexes</hi> should
be received, at least as a good <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> for the
explaining the Phenomena of the World, which
God hath made. But he farther adjoyned, That
in case <hi>M. Descartes</hi> should fail in his Attempt,
he should be oblig'd thus far to condescend, That
his Physicks, which turn for the most part upon
those Hinges, is an Edifice without Foundation:
And that he should rest contented with the Praise
common to all the Leaders of a Sect, <hi>viz.</hi> That
his Philosophy had something that was Good
and True in it, and that he should avow with
the rest of Mankind, that to <hi>build a World,</hi> and
establish a System of Philosophy, true in all its
Principles and Conclusions, was a Point the
Mind of Man in its utmost Endeavours could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reach.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, as to <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Demonstrations
touching the Existence of God, the Rules of
Motion, and some other Opinions, for which
that Philosopher had engag'd a greater Zeal and
Earnestness, and which required a more through
Discussion: <hi>Aristotle</hi> proposed to him the pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on some Neutral and Unprejudic'd Place,
where they might confer together before disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
Arbitratours, to whose Determinations
they should submit themselves.</p>
                  <p>He concluded with a gracious Offer of associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
him in the <hi>Empire of Philosophy,</hi> upon those
only Conditions compriz'd in that Project. He
admonish'd him to fix some Bounds to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
assuring him of the Vanity of his Hopes if
he pursu'd to carry them any farther; for that
his own <hi>Authority</hi> was too well establish'd
throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> to be indangered by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54814:86"/>
the Enterprizes of a new Comer: That almost
all Universities and Colleges had renew'd the
Oath of Allegiance to him, and had made an
Offensive and Defensive League against the New
Philosophy: That some Ladies and fine Wits of
the great World, that seem'd to set up for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Protectors of a new Party in <hi>France,</hi>
were not such as much stress might be laid upon:
That a Philosophical Dress of Mind would be as
changeable among the <hi>French Ladies,</hi> as the
other Modes and Fashions for the Body: That
few were to be found already that valu'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereupon: And that 'twas said, since the
Play of one <hi>Moliere,</hi> the Name of a <hi>Learn'd
Woman</hi> was become a kind of an Affront. That
though several Learn'd Men, and many Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
were taken formerly with the new
Ideas, there were a very few at present, that
car'd for the Name of <hi>Cartesians:</hi> Some having
presently deserted, to take the part of the
<hi>Gassendists:</hi> Others having cut out Systems for
themselves, compos'd of what they thought best
in both the ancient and new Philosophers:
And almost all affecting to be <hi>Originals</hi> without
tying themselves to any Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
whatsoever. An effect of more pernicious
Consequence than is imagined, of an ill Example
which has been given, by the new Schism made
in Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>Scarce had we made an end of reading our
Paper, when the two <hi>Paripateticks</hi> re-entred in
<hi>Mersennus,</hi> and told us, That from the Western
Coast they descry'd something as an Opaque
Body, that they knew not what to make of,
sailing through the Air with wonderful Speed.
I'll venture my Life on't, says our <hi>old Gentleman,</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:54814:87"/>
it is some incrusted Star, that tumbles from
<hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> after having lost its own; and
is become a Comet. We made towards it with
all hast, and the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Conjecture of the
good old Man gave us good Diversion, when a
few Moments after we perceiv'd it was nothing
but a Man mounted on an extreamly black and
condens'd Cloud, whose whole Accoutrement
look'd exactly like that of a <hi>Magician,</hi> that was
either going to or coming from the <hi>Devil's Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi>
In effect, <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> who knew
him, inform'd us that he was a <hi>Chinese Mandarin,</hi>
the President of the Magicians of his Country,
whom he had often met in our <hi>Vortex,</hi> and about
a year ago, had had a Conference with him upon
the Existence of a God, and that he had prov'd
it to him by the Demonstrations of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi>
that as resolv'd and case-harden'd an Atheist as
he found him, his Demonstrations had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ock'd
him so as he had promised to examine them at
his leisure. He mov'd us to proceed to meet
him to learn what was the Success of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and whether the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was converted.
So we advanc'd towards him; but only <hi>Father
Mersennus</hi> put on a visible Countenance. They
saluted each other, and after some Complements
pass'd, <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> demanded, Whether he
still doubted of the Existence of a God? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
he was throughly convinc'd; and that
he own'd himself under a great Obligation to
him, for having put him upon the Examination
of a Point, of which he was asham'd to have so
much as doubted, for want of making some
Reflections, with which a most ordinary capacity
might have furnish'd him. God be prais'd (<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
Father</hi> Mersennus) what Joy is here
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54814:87"/>
for <hi>M. Descartes</hi> when we shall certify him that
his Philosophy has convey'd the Knowledg of
God to the ends of the Earth! It was certainly
with very good Reason he wrote to me upon a
time, that he was undetermin'd whether he should
publish his Works of Philosophy,<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Let. 37.</note> but that he
thought himself oblig'd in Conscience, not to
deprive the <hi>Publick</hi> of five or six Sheets, that
contain'd the Demonstrations of the Existence
of a God.</p>
                  <p>Father (<hi>reply'd the Mandarin</hi>) I would not
advise you to communicate to <hi>M. Descartes</hi> the
Success his Demonstrations had in <hi>China.</hi> They
pass'd there for pure <hi>Paralogisms,</hi> at least two
of them that are most in his Esteem, and that
are drawn from the Idea of a God, and a Being
absolutely Perfect. And my Obligation to you
consists not in your having communicated to
me those Demonstrations, but in that having
communicated them, in order to my examining
them, it took me in the Head, after having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
their weakness, to discuss some other
which that Philosopher makes light of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of his own, and which yet are those, I
owe my Conviction to. A certain <hi>European
Doctor,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> whose
Sums the Jesuits have translated into <hi>Chinese,</hi>
which I consulted upon that occasion, and the
explication made me by the <hi>Mandarin Verbiest,</hi>
who arriv'd in <hi>China</hi> out of <hi>Europe,</hi> some years
since<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have made a hundred times more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on my Mind, than all the <hi>Cartesian</hi>
Visions that seem'd extreamly shallow.</p>
                  <p>That Answer Thunder struck the poor <hi>Father
Mersennus,</hi> who demanded hastily of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darin</hi>
what fault he found with <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54814:88"/>
Demonstrations? He set himself presently to
refute them, in so much, that we had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of seeing their Civilities and Complements
chang'd into a real Dispute.</p>
                  <p>To let you see, <hi>said the Mandarin,</hi> that it is
not on a groundless Supposition, I condemn
your Demonstrations for Paralogisms, you
must know that after I had heard them from
you, I fortun'd to find them in the Hands of a
young <hi>Hollander</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> who was upon a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with his Country-Merchants, your <hi>Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s
Meditations. Seeing I was already in part
acquainted with their Contents, and wish'd to
be more satisfactorily instructed, he made me a
Present of them, and there I read afresh all
those Demonstrations, all the Objections made
him thereupon, and all the Answers he returns.
The first Reflection that I made in general upon
my Reading, was, that those Demonstrations
and Answers given to the contrary Objections,
left me wholly, at least very much, in doubt,
and my Mind fluctuating in as great uncertainty
as before, concerning the Point that was in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
and that though I did not see forthwith
the Faults of them, yet methoughts I saw them.
Upon that I presented them to two of my
Friends, of the <hi>Tribunal of Mathematicks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
of able Men, that are accustom'd to a
<hi>Geometrical</hi> Method, especially since the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Mathematicians arriv'd in <hi>China.</hi> After they
had run them over, one of the two assur'd me,
without deciding any thing, that if those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
were true Demonstrations, they
were admirable, since they were extreamly
plain and simple: The other adjoyn'd, that
that Simplicity it self rendred them suspicious,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54814:88"/>
for as much as, said he, the more simple they
are, the more they ought to have of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Effect of Demonstration, on the Minds of
those they are propos'd to. Now I am insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of that Effect: My Mind finds not the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
so strong as to be carry'd away with it:
On the contrary, I perceive, I know not what
Doubts and Scruples, that stand in the way of
my Assent, and that induce it to believe those
Reasonings are false. And I remark, added he,
that all, as well Friends as Enemies, of that
Philosopher, that have wrote their Opinion of
his Demonstrations, have made the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
and Experimented the same thing, as I
my self. We set our selves therefore to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Examination of them, and began with that
which <hi>M. Descantes</hi> proposes first of all in the
Geometrical Abridgment of his Meditation.</p>
                  <p>An Attribute which we see distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Idea of a thing may be truly
affirm'd of that thing. But in the Idea of God,
that is to say, in the Idea of a Being absolutely
perfect, I distinctly perceive necessary Existence
is contain'd; since necessary Existence is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and a Being infinitely perfect, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
all sorts of Perfections. Therefore I can
affirm Existence of a Being absolutely perfect,
and say with Truth and the greatest Assurance,
that God exists.</p>
                  <p>Upon a second reading of that <hi>Demonstration</hi>
and Examination of each particular Proposition
of it, whatever appearance of Truth they
seem'd to carry with them, all our Scruples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to grow in us afresh. We apply'd our selves
to the finding out the Cause: We examin'd our
selves, according to the Council of the <hi>Author</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54814:89"/>
of the <hi>Demonstration:</hi> And we descended into
our own Breast, to see if we had not hoarded
up some Prejudices that might block out those
Propositions, whose Evidence, we thought, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
admittance. We found none at all there,
having been to that Instant very indifferent as
to the truth of that Conclusion; and supposing
the Ballance was not in an exact Equilibrium,
we certainly inclin'd towards the side of the
Existence of a God, rather than the other. So
that the Prejudice which favoured that Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
was more to be fear'd on our Account,
than on the contrary. Moreover we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to our selves, we were not concern'd at
the reputation of <hi>Descartes,</hi> and that we were
untouch'd with Envy, with which he seems to
suspect some of his Country-Men tainted, who
had declar'd against his Demonstrations. That
incourag'd us to believe, our Scruples proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Demonstration it self, which by
Consequence, must only carry a seeming Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
since a real and true Evidence of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
or a Proposition, is necessarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a satisfaction and tranquillity
of Mind, that perceives it self enlightned in
so lively a manner, as makes it impossible to
doubt or withstand the Truth. Hence it is that
maugre the Wranglings of those <hi>Descartes</hi> calls
<hi>Septicks,</hi> it is impossible to have any Scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>first Principles,</hi> any ways to doubt, if
the Whole be bigger than its Part; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is impossible that the same Thing should
be, and not be at the same time. Reflecting
therefore upon that Argumentation, we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it must needs seem evident, and at the
same time we experienc'd from within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54814:89"/>
that nothing was less really so. All the
Difficulty was to discover the Spring of that
false Light, and to find out what it was that

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing our Perspectives.
We presum'd we might be understood, and our
meaning thereupon be clearly explain'd by these
Reflections.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Axiom</hi> that makes the first Proposition in
<hi>Descartes</hi>'s Reasoning, is true but upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of two Things. First, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of
which he speaks be a real one, that is, such a
one as represents a real, at least a possible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Secondly, that the Mind, which forms
that Idea, be clearly convinc'd that it is real.
Thus because the Idea of a right-lin'd Triangle
is real, and a Geometrician acknowledges it as
such, perceiving distinctly the equality of the
three Angles with two Rights, upon that Idea
he may truly affirm of that Triangle, that it
has three Angles equal to two Rights.</p>
                  <p>But if the Idea is not real, or if I am not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
assured it is so, it is false that I can affirm
a real Attribute of it, which I distinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in it. Take for Instance, that imaginary
Idea of <hi>A Mountain without a Valley,</hi> in as much
as it represents a Mountain to me, I have an
Idea of an Height; yet I can truly and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, that a Mountain without a Valley is
high.</p>
                  <p>If the Idea is real, and yet is not evident to
me that it is so, it is true that the Attribute I
distinctly apprehend in it, agrees to the thing
it represents: But it is false that I can affirm
that Attribute of the thing in Hand, or that I
can demonstrate to my self that property from
that Idea. As supposing this Idea was a real one
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54814:90"/>
                     <hi>A Horse that has Perception and Sense: Descartes</hi>
that thought it was not real, could not conclude
from thence, That an Horse was capable of Pain
and Pleasure; although that property is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
contain'd in the Idea of a Being furnish'd
with Sense and Apprehension.</p>
                  <p>That once suppos'd to the end, I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the Existence of God, by that sole
Idea (<hi>A Being absolutely perfect</hi>) it is not only
requisite it should be a real Idea, as it certainly
is, but that it be evident to me, abstractedly
from all the usual Demonstrations, that that
Idea is a real one, that is, that it represents to
me a real Object, at least a possible one, and no
<hi>Chimera.</hi> Now I maintain, before <hi>Descartes,</hi>
that Idea is not evidently real, before the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Demonstrations: For if it be evidently
real, it is either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o of its self, or from the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
I make of the Ideas it is compos'd of.
It is not so of it self: For if that Idea were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
of it self, our Mind could never make a
Problem of it, nor demand seriously of it self
before the Demonstration; Is a Being infinitely
perfect, a real Being, or an Imaginary one?
No more than it could make a Question of
these, Is the Whole bigger than its Part? Can a
Thing be and not be at the same time? Since
they are manifestly real of themselves. But
our Mind before Demonstration, can make it
self this Demand, whether a Being absolutely
perfect, is really a Being, or in Phancy only?
And a Man that never had reflected on the things
that prove the Existence of a God, would not
be in the least surpriz'd, to hear that Question
seriously propos'd, as he would be, should any
one ask, as if he were in Doubt, whether the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54814:90"/>
Whole is bigger than its Part. That Idea then is
not manifestly real of it self. It remains then that
the Evidence of its reality must be fetch'd from
the Examination that we make thereon. If so,
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> ought to have minded us of that
Precaution, before we entred on his <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
But I prove that antecedently to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
the reality of that Idea can neither be
evident to us of it self, nor by the discussion of
the Terms contain'd in't. First, because the
Attribute is not comprehended in the Idea of
the Subject: Since it is not essential to a <hi>Being</hi> to
be absolutely perfect. Secondly, because that
Discussion affords me many seeming Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which my Mind knows not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
before the ordinary Demonstrations.
For to examine and unravel that Idea, which of
its self is very general and confus'd, is to retail
all Perfections, whereof not one must be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a <hi>Being</hi> absolutely perfect. Now among
those Perfections, there are some that blunt and
repulse the Mind, because she has not so great a
reach as to conceive them. For Instance, that
that <hi>Being</hi> should be of it self, that that Being
should be Almighty and Independent of every
thing in its acting, even to the Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<hi>Beings</hi> out of <hi>Nothing.</hi> There are others
that seem to her inconsistent in the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
For instance, she conceives Liberty and
Immutability, Immensity and Indivisibility, the
Properties of Bodies and of Spirits, as so many
Perfections. She sees that the Perfections which
agree to several Beings separately, must all be
united in that absolutely perfect Being. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
therefore a Being absolutely perfect,
the represents it at once as a free Being, and an
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54814:91"/>
Immutable, as one that can desire and be averse
to the same thing, though its Will be always
Unchangeable, that is, Omnipresent, without
being extended or divisible, that is, a pure <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and at the same time includes all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of <hi>Bodies</hi> possible to be produc'd.</p>
                  <p>Nay I dare presume to say, that this Idea
thus analyz'd, in respect of a Mind, that never
made any Reflection on the Reasons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Existence of a necessary Being, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
so many Contradictions in that necessary
Being, would as soon represent it as an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Being, as a real one, and that, not suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those usual Reasons, that prove to us a first
cause of all Beings, and the Reflections that
follow them, we should as easily regard that
Being as impossible as possible. From whence I
at least conclude, that the <hi>Idea of a Being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
perfect,</hi> cannot be look'd on as an Idea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
real, by him that examins it, before
his Acquaintance with the ordinary Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Consequently, that he that examins it
cannot absolutely attribute Existence to that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and which is the same thing, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
to himself the Existence of a God,
from the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect.</p>
                  <p>The defect therefore of <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>Paralogism,</hi>
consists in this, that he supposes, before any
Demonstrations, the Idea of a Being absolutely
perfect, to be taken by the Mind for real, and
as having a real Object, which is palpably
false.</p>
                  <p>All this discovers the Original of the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
all the World have had, as to that Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and which those themselves have not
been clear of, whom the difficulty of resolving
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54814:91"/>
so subtil a <hi>Paralogism</hi> hath drawn over to <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s
Party, who doubtless had they been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and sincere, must have confess'd they still
felt some disquiet in their Mind on that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
and that it was by meer Violence they
had at last accustom'd their Understanding to
tell them, that Demonstration was evident.
This was the Fault which some felt, rather than
saw, that made them deny Existence to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
in the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect.
For absolutely speaking, although it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
in the Catalogue of Perfections, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to that Being, yet the Mind to which the
Idea was not manifestly real, took it not in,
and excluded it, in making that very Problem,
<hi>Does a Being absolutely perfect Exist?</hi> Until the
Arguments independent of that Idea had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
the Problem, and convinc'd it that such a
Being did Exist.</p>
                  <p>And let not <hi>Descartes</hi> say, that that <hi>Idea</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
nothing but <hi>Perfections,</hi> it is evident it
includes nothing but what is <hi>Real;</hi> for a <hi>Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Idea</hi> may be compos'd of only <hi>Real Ideas;</hi>
here then is one exactly like that we are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of, <hi>A Triangle that hath all the Perfections of
Triangles.</hi> That Idea, though it includes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
besides real Perfections, is notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Chimera,</hi> since for Instance a <hi>rectangled Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle</hi>
has opposite Properties to those of an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,</hi>
and that Opposition is the reason they
are inconsistent with one another. So, though
all the Perfections of Beings are real, it does
not follow that that Idea, <hi>A Being that hath all
the Perfections of Beings,</hi> should be a real Idea;
and the Opposition I observe betwixt some of
those Perfections, naturally influences my Mind,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54814:92"/>
unless prevented by the ordinary Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to doubt, at least, whether that Idea is
not a Chimera, as well as the other I have been
speaking of. From hence it is that in pursuance
to the Demonstrations that convince me of the
Existence of that Being, but that give me no
clear and distinct Knowledg of its Essence, I
confine my self to say, That Being must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Perfections of all other Beings emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
that is to say, in a way I don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and which would never have come into
my Head, or at least would never have been
look'd on by me as certainly and evidently
possible, unless I had been convinc'd of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the first Being, before the discussion
of its Essence.</p>
                  <p>That Solution of <hi>Descartes</hi>'s first Paralogism,
made way to the discovery of that other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
of his, where he concludes the Existence
of God from the <hi>objective reality of the Idea</hi> (as
he speaks) which we have of God. That Idea,
(says he) which I find in my Mind, has an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
objective reality, since it represents to me
an infinite Being. Therefore it has that infinite
Being for its cause; therefore an infinite Being
exists: For otherwise the Effect would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
that were not in its cause.</p>
                  <p>Those who have undertook that arguing,
give us to understand, they have found it to be
a greater Paralogism than the former, and
bring many Reasons for it, which <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
refutes as well as he is able: For my
own Part, my Opinion is, That <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
supposes in that Reasoning, what lay on him to
be proved: For he not only supposes that that
Idea has an objective reality, but farther, that I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54814:92"/>
can be ascertained independently of the common
Demonstrations, that it effectively has an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Reality, or that it has a Real and not an
imaginary Object: But I am incapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether its Object be real or imaginary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Demonstrations, as I have already
proved: And if I can doubt whether that Object
is not a <hi>Chimera,</hi> I cannot suppose it has an
<hi>Objective Reality,</hi> but ought to fear it has an
<hi>Objective Vanity,</hi> if I may be allowed so to speak;
and in that Case I can by no means conclude,
That God has impressed it on my Mind, and
consequently that there is a God: But I ought
to think, That probably it proceeds from <hi>nothing,</hi>
as <hi>Descartes</hi> expresses himself, That is, from an
Imperfection of Mind that hath produced it, as
it could produce this same a <hi>Mountain without a
Valley.</hi> Hence it is clear and manifest, that those
two pretended Demonstrations are meer Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms,
and that both are maimed and lame
in the same part, and defective on the same
account.</p>
                  <p>Besides, <hi>M. Descartes</hi> can never demonstrate
to me the Truth of the Proposition, on which all
his reasoning depends; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cause of
an Idea ought to contain formally or eminently
all the Perfections which the <hi>Idea</hi> represents;
for when 'tis said, The Cause contains all the
Perfections of the effect, that is not meant, nor
is it evidently true, but of such Perfections as the
effect possesses, and not of those it only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents;
for the Perfections the <hi>Idea</hi> represents,
are not the Perfections of the <hi>Idea,</hi> the only
Perfection of the <hi>Idea</hi> being to represent all those
Perfections: A Quality that hath nothing of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54814:93"/>
Infinite in it, and consequently supposes not an
infinite Cause.</p>
                  <p>I say that Quality includes nothing of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
because the Perfection of an Idea is not
measured by the Dignity of the Object that it
represents, but by the manner wherewith it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it; which being most imperfect in the Case
before us, cannot be infinite. And this single
Instance which I subjoyn to all that <hi>Descartes</hi>'s
Adversaries have said upon the Matter, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to shew, That the Proposition on which is
grounded his whose Reasoning, will not pass for
a Principle of a Demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, continued the <hi>Chinese,</hi> Supposing the
Reasonings of that <hi>Philosopher</hi> were not false or
<hi>sophistical,</hi> they would scarce merit the Name of
<hi>Demonstrations</hi> in the Subject they proceed upon:
There never can be Demonstrations of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a God, whilst they are not received as
such, that is, whilst they are not received as
convincing Arguments beyond reply, the Truth
of which is so prevalent as to destroy all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Prejudice. Now <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>clouded</hi> Minds
can never be pierc'd by that <hi>Metaphysical Subtilty:</hi>
Those of a <hi>middle Rank</hi> find themselves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd,
whether by their Prejudices, or for
want of Penetration; most of those of the <hi>first</hi>
and most <hi>exalted</hi> Order, discover in them, or
think they do discover very knotty Difficulties.
All this put together makes one general Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
on their Consideration, that never read
them, and which might warrant their Prudence
to conclude, if there were no other Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Existence of God, there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
noneat all. So that my Advice to your
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54814:93"/>
                     <hi>Philosopher</hi> and his Followers is, Not so highly to
prefer his <hi>Demonstrations</hi> before those <hi>commonly</hi>
made use of: For if it be true that all others are
inevident in comparison of these, very mischievus
Consequences might be drawn from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
against the Existence of a First Being, of
which the <hi>Libertines</hi> (if I may judge by those of the
<hi>Empire of China</hi>) would not fail to make advantage.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Spirit that drove on the Cloud,
on which the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was horsed, and which
was one of the grimmest and blackest <hi>Devils</hi> in all
<hi>Hell,</hi> grew sowr'd and uneasie at these Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
from which Inferences might be drawn very
prejudicial to the Interests of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or
whether the <hi>Mandarin</hi> was himself in haste, and
expected to hear nothing new upon that Affair,
he had no sooner uttered that last Sentence,
but we saw him on a sudden hurried towards
the East with an incredible Swiftness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> that stood on Thorns to
give him Answer, could not forbear following
him, and kept him Pace for above thirty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
He returned to us about a quarter of an
Hour after, and spoke a little angrily. It is
strange how the Enemies of <hi>Descartes</hi> make their
Insults, and treacherously fall upon us, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them to their Heels, without giving
us so much as Time to put our selves in a Posture
of Defence, and to reply to that noisy Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
which they think to put off at the rate of
Oracles: If the <hi>Mandarin,</hi> no less than <hi>Aristotle</hi>
had rely'd upon their Forces, and believed, as
they pretend, their Arguments a Match for <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
they would not have shrunk when they
were to grapple, and would at least have tarried
the Answer that was to be made them; but these
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54814:94"/>
are <hi>Donquixots</hi> of <hi>Knight Errants,</hi> that bravado
it by discharging a Pistol in the Air, and never
stand to it before the Enemy, which they make as
if they did encounter. But in the Time that I
have accompanied our <hi>Mandarin,</hi> I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
his <hi>Ideas:</hi> He has promised me that this
Day twelvemonth he will be again in <hi>Mersennus,</hi>
where we shall have a fair and leisurely Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>Demonstrations;</hi> then, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
I desire your Company, <hi>said he,</hi> and if I
do not convince my <hi>Gentleman,</hi> so as to stop his
Mouth for the future, I'll commence <hi>Peripatetick</hi>
on the Spot, and utterly renounce <hi>Cartesianism.</hi>
We promised him to wait on him at that Time:
But, Father, <hi>said I,</hi> we have been long upon
the Road, yet have made no great Progress in
our Journey, I desire we may dispatch it as soon
as possible, for I am in fear for my Body, and
would not for a World it should stay without
me above four and twenty Hours. With that he
looked towards the Earth, to see what Hour it
was, and told me, it was but seven Hours since
we left <hi>France,</hi> and provided we made no Halts
in our way, in five Hours, at latest, we shall
arrive in <hi>Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So we left <hi>Mersennus,</hi> and departed from the
<hi>Moon,</hi> by the Northside of that <hi>Globe;</hi> we made
towards the <hi>Starry Heaven</hi> with all the Speed we
were capable of; that is to say, in one Minute
we compass'd many thousand Leagues. It is a
prodigious, and inconceivable thing, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Stars; a Man can discover from
the Earth, with the best Glasses, but a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Part, in respect of those that lie out of
Sight. We cross'd the Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> where I
took pleasure in observing the principal Stars,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54814:94"/>
that are usually describ'd on the Celestial Globes;

                  <p>Had I a mind to divert my self, as <hi>Ovid</hi> does,
in his Description of the Chariot of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> I
might make a thousand pretty Astronomical Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions,
and could create in my Road many new
<hi>Zodiacks,</hi> in which a multitude of Animals cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated

Reparation made for the Wrongs done them by
the capriciousness of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Astronomers,</hi> that
have given the Preheminence to others of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not half so great Worth and Magnitude:
But the Reader may easily imagine to himself all
that. I shall say no more of the Conferences we
had in the rest of our <hi>Voyage,</hi> where I was little
more than <hi>Auditor.</hi> The two <hi>Peripateticks</hi> held
a Dispute almost all the way with <hi>Father Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
and the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> upon several Points
of the <hi>New Philosophy,</hi> but all they said amounted
to little more than may be seen in <hi>Father de la
Grange</hi> and other Books, that treat of such sort
of Things. It pleased me to see with what
Heat each maintain'd his Party, and endeavour'd
to draw me over to it; but I was satisfy'd
in praising first one and then the other,
without giving up my self to either, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took upon me the Quality of Arbitrator,
(which they seemed by common Consent to
award me) for the moderating the too great
Vehemence and Zeal for the Sect that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
transported them a little farther than
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54814:95"/>
was allowable. Mean while I took notice, That
<hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> that conducted us, made us
still leave, from Time to Time, the direct
Road, to fetch a Compass about, and aim'd to
keep us at a Distance from the Body of the Stars,
or, to speak in the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Phrase, from the
<hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortexes.</hi> I demanded the reason
of his doing so; telling him, one of my greatest
Curiosities would be to contemplate a Star at
hand, and to consider the Motion of the subtil
Matter in the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and that,
that was the readiest way to convince me there
were <hi>Vortexes,</hi> such as <hi>Descartes</hi> has describ'd. He
answered, it would be more convenient to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my Curiosity as I returned, after that
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> had himself explained the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Determinations, the Subtil Matter is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of, in a <hi>Vortex;</hi> that thereby I should
better take his Meaning, and before that it
would be but a new Subject of Confusion to
my self, and of cavilling to the <hi>Peripatetick
Gentlemen.</hi> It behoved him to hold to that,
and I had from thence forward but a very ill
Opinion of the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> of which I saw no
likelihood in the Motions of the Matter at a
good Remove from the Stars. But at last we
arrived to the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> which was the
End of our <hi>Voyage.</hi> The Occurrences, that
happened in my Stay there, shall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

of a <hi>World</hi> in, nay for the Construction of <hi>Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Infinite Worlds,</hi> but I saw no Materials
proper to begin, or to make the least Part of
so great an Edifice.</p>
            <p>Having travell'd six or seven thousand Leagues
without any News of Tidings of <hi>Descartes,</hi> we
agreed to separate our selves, that we might find
him out the easier: <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> took one
way, the Old Gentleman and I, with the two <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick</hi>
Souls the other. In short, <hi>Father Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
found him, and quickly after we had parted,
we saw them both together, making towards
us. The obliging way wherewith he receiv'd
me, certified me, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> had
given him a good Character of me, and spoke of
me as a Man that in Time would prove one
of his most zealous Followers. He likewise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
respectfully saluted the two <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> but
gave them to understand the Pains they had
taken, in coming to treat of an Accommodation
with him, were manifestly to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
That <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> had already suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
advis'd him of the Propositions they
design'd to offer, which he assured them he should
not be very forward to condescend to; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he would give them a favourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and satisfie them beforehand he had no ill
Design upon the <hi>Kingdom of Aristotle;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
giving Orders to <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the <hi>two Gentlemen,</hi> he accosted the <hi>Old
Sage</hi> and my self in particular.</p>
            <p>The Discourse began with the ample Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Friendship, <hi>M. Descartes</hi> and the <hi>Old Stager</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54814:96"/>
made each other, mutually expressing the Joy
they had in seeing one another: The <hi>Old
Gentleman,</hi> out of hand took upon him to make
my Elogy, speaking a thousand fine obliging
things of me to <hi>Descartes;</hi> especially he cry'd up
the uninterested Love I had for Truth, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Learning that always had appear'd in me,
and the Readiness I had promis'd, to imbrace the
Instructions, in the Inquest of which I had made
so long a <hi>Voyage.</hi> I wav'd, as modestly as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
the other Praises that were given me; but
added, That for the Love of Truth and Desire
of Learning, I must stand up, as for my only
considerable Accomplishments; that as to the
Readiness I had ingag'd to receive <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s
Instructions, that ought not to come
into the Account, since a Master of his Character
and Worth, and a <hi>Genius</hi> so Admirable and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
beyond all others, as his was, had Right
to demand and require that entire Submission
from all that pretended to Wisdom or Equity
in the World.</p>
            <p>You are pleas'd to carry your Compliment a
little too high, <hi>reply'd</hi> M. Descartes, and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether the generality of those that are
reputed the <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Equitable</hi> Persons of the
World, would subscribe to that Homage and
Submission you their Representative vouch for
them: I question too, according to the Rules
of <hi>Physionomy</hi> of Spirits, whether I ought to
build much upon that pretended Tractableness,
wherein you pride your self so much; methinks
I perceive still at bottom of your Soul some kind
of, I know not what, Prejudices, that indispose
it for the Knowledg of Truth. Tell me, in
beholding this vast <hi>Space, (continued he)</hi> what
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54814:97"/>
is't you think you see? Monsieur, (<hi>I reply'd</hi>)
that is a perplexing Question, but to convince
you that I speak from my Heart, in promising
to be instructive, I will make Answer to your
Question just as my Thoughts are of it: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you I ought to say, That beholding the
great <hi>Space,</hi> I see a <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter;</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Dissimulation, methinks, in effect I see just
<hi>Nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that my <hi>Old Sophister</hi> tipt the Wink upon
me, which I took not at that instant, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Meaning of it till after. 'Tis enough,
says <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> let us talk of someting else:
Give me an account, pray, how goes <hi>Philosophy</hi>
in your World, if you have any News of it;
for these many Years I have been ignorant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of all the Concerns there, as well from
the Indifference and Disregard I have found in
me ever since my quitting the Body, for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of Men, as that Monsieur here, who is
the only Person that has visited me since, having
retired in the Country many Years ago, has
been incapable of hearing the Particulars of
Affairs that concern <hi>Cartesianism,</hi> contenting
himself to learn, and to assure me from Time
to Time, my Philosophy continued still to
have very many Friends, and very many
Enemies.</p>
            <p>And I am not much better instructed, <hi>I
answered,</hi> with what regards your Sect, having
but begun to interest my self in its Affairs, since
those few Days I have had the Honour of this
Gentleman's Acquaintance; however, I will
inform you of all that I could hear, or that has
come to my Knowledg, without giving my self
much Trouble of Enquiry. Your <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54814:97"/>
you know, was set up with all the Advantages
and Disadvantages of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and it has expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
the Fortune which all <hi>New Doctrins</hi> use
to find. Many there are that have imbrac'd it
with Admiration, and defended it with Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Passion. It hath met with the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Protection of Persons commendable for
their Parts, Capacity and Politeness; but almost
all <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Vniversities</hi> have rejected it, and
declared against it: Each acted in that as in all
things else, according to the Principle of Self-interest:
Some took your Side, as apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves thereby distinguish'd and advancd
above the Herd; others deny'd it, as fearing the
diminution of their Credit: The Motive and
Pretence of both Parties was the Love of Truth
and uncorrupt Doctrin. The Posture of present
Affairs hath almost the same Face still; yet if we
judge by the Books, whether of <hi>Philosophy</hi> or
<hi>Medicine,</hi> brought from <hi>England, Holland</hi> and
<hi>Germany, Cartesianism</hi> hath made very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Progress in those Parts. Scarce once in
an Age is printed any <hi>Course of Philosophy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Method of the Schools; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Works of that Nature, that at
this Time are publick in <hi>France,</hi> are Physical
Tracts that suppose the Principles of the <hi>New
Philosophy:</hi> Such Books as treat of an <hi>Vniversal,</hi>
of <hi>Metaphysical Degrees</hi> of <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> create
Fears in the Booksellers Minds; they'll cumber
themselves with no more of them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to rid their Hands of all that they have
left, at any rate, as Merchants do their Stuffs
when the Fashion's over. All those Questions,
heretofore so famous, wherewith the Presses
have groan'd for almost two hundred Years,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54814:98"/>
and that have found Employment for so many
Printers, are no where heard of but in the Schools
of the Publick Professors. Out of the Desks
there is no talk of the <hi>Thomists,</hi> the <hi>Scotists</hi> and
the <hi>Nominals,</hi> at least there is no Distinction
made betwixt them; all are numbred in the
same Predicament, and on the same Side which
they call the <hi>Old Philosophy,</hi> to which is oppos'd
the Philosophy of <hi>Descartes,</hi> or the <hi>New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have had the good Fortune with your
Lustre to efface all the New Philosophers that
have risen both in and since your Time; and to
make use of a Comparison, that bating the
<hi>Odium</hi> of the Subject it is taken form, hath
nothing in it but what makes for your Renown;
As in <hi>Spain</hi> the Name of <hi>Lutheran</hi> is indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
given to all <hi>Hereticks</hi> of whatever Sect or
Faction, so the Title of <hi>Cartesian</hi> is attributed
to all those that have undertaken to make Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Point of Natural Philosophy. I have
seen more than one bold Venturer, that in full
Dispute hath listed <hi>Gassendus</hi> among your Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
though you was undoubtedly his Junior by
several Years: And I know a certain <hi>College,</hi>
where the Professor durst not speak of <hi>Insensible
Matter,</hi> of the <hi>Rules</hi> of Motion, of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity
of <hi>Ideas,</hi> lest he should be forthwith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of <hi>Cartesianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the rest (excepting in the Exercises of
some Honest Religious Persons, that doubtless
have no ill Design, but not having read you,
would yet assume to themselves the Honour of
engaging you) that treating you as an Atheist,
is quite out of Doors, as is the making that
Proposition a Precedent for your Religion, which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54814:98"/>
you advance in the Entrance on your <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,
That we must doubt of every Thing;</hi> yet
some of the finest and clearest Heads do not
stick seriously to affirm, That the late Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have robb'd you
of many Disciples; for upon their Conviction
of the Real Presence of the Sacred Body of <hi>I. C.</hi>
in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> they confidently assert the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of some of your Principles, which they are
at a Fault to reconcile with the Reality of that
Mystery.</p>
            <p>But no matter, all such as have a sound and
unprejudic'd Notion of Things, though they
stand diameter to your Opinions, do you Justice,
and give you an <hi>Encomium</hi> that seems none of the
least; which is, that they acknowledg you have
open'd the Eyes of the Philosophers of our
Times to the Discovery of the Rises of their
Method in Philosophy, by that just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reproach of the little Concern they had,
for the most part, to dive to the Bottom of the
Things they treat of, whether in <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> or
in <hi>Physicks,</hi> and the little Application they bring
with them, both in framing to themselves and
giving their Disciples clear and distinct Ideas of
the Things disputed of; the Abuse that was
made of the subtilty of Mind, perverted only
to the multiplying Wranglings and trifling Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
to the inventing of new Equivocal Terms,
to the confounding rather than enlightning
certain abstracted Questions, prudently enough
introduc'd the Schools, for Exercise and an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Dispute and Emulation, to the Minds
of Youth, but ridiculously made the main Stress
and Essentials of Philosophy, that from thence
had degenerated into an Empty Science, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54814:99"/>
of Words and Terms that signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
The little Observation made upon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
that is the Mother of Philosophy: The
implicit Dependence they had on the Sentiment
of another, often superficially considered and
ill understood.</p>
            <p>I can also assure you, that kind of Advice,
though envidiously at first receiv'd, has not fail'd
of its Effect. The <hi>Desk-Philosophy</hi> has chang'd
its Countenance in the principal <hi>Colleges</hi> of
<hi>France.</hi> The most ingenious of the Professors
affect to treat of the ordinary Questions, and
those that are most crabbed with greater Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and Method, with more Justness and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
persuaded that those Questions thus handl'd
have a greater Power than is imagined to form
a Juvenile Mind, if it is capable of it, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it Correct and Just, to accustom it insensibly
to make those so necessary Abstractions, in
order to the avoiding Mistakes and Fallacies in
the Train of a Reasoning, spun through a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
in the Examination of a Mathematical
Demonstration, the Discussion of a Physical
Experiment, or perhaps a Political Interest or
Concern.</p>
            <p>Since when Men are more shy of calling the
Proofs they bring for their Opinions, <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
they are not so eager to declare War
against those that talk otherwise than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and that often say the same thing. They
have learn'd to doubt of certain Axioms that have
hitherto been held Sacred and Inviolable, and
upon Examination have sometimes found them
unworthy of so great a Title. <hi>Occult Qualities</hi>
are under a Suspicion, and a Cloud, having lost
considerably of their Reputation. The <hi>Horror</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:54814:99"/>
of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is no where receiv'd but in the
Shools, where no one will be at the charge of
Glass Tubes, and certain Instruments which
manifestly prove the absurdity of that hackney'd
Solution, that hath been constantly given to
the most curious and extraordinary Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's
of Nature. All sort of Experiments are
daily made. That of the Gravity of the Air is
try'd a thousand different ways; and there is
scarce any little Pretender to Physick in the
Town, but has at his Fingers ends the History
of <hi>M. Paschal</hi>'s Experiment.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> interrupting me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what was that Experiment of <hi>M. Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal?</hi>
I answered, it was that made in the year,
1648. upon the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Domme</hi> with <hi>Torricelli</hi>'s
<hi>Tube.</hi> Wherein the Quick Silver was observ'd
to fall a great deal lower at the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
than in the middle, or at the bottom;
from whence hath been evidently concluded the
Gravity of the Air. Does that, reply'd <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
go by the Name of <hi>M. P.</hi>—'s Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment?
It is then, because he put it in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
or rather because he occasion'd it to be
practic'd by <hi>M. Perrier;</hi> for assuredly it is not
because he invented it, or foresaw the Success.
And if that Experiment ought to bear the Name
of its Author, it might more truly be intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the Experiment of <hi>Descartes.</hi> For it was I
that desir'd him two years before to make the
Trial,<note place="margin">Let. 77. Tom. 3.</note> and assur'd him of the Success, as being
intirely conformable to my Principles, without
which it had never come into his Head, being
he was of the contrary Opinion. That Man is
Fortunate, continu'd <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> in point of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54814:100"/>
Reputation. A great many Persons were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made to believe he had compos'd a Book
of <hi>Coniques,</hi> extracted from himself by the meer
dint of Reason, at sixteen years of Age: That
Book was sent me; and before I had read it
half,<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Let. 38.</note> I concluded he had made great Advantage
of <hi>Monsieur des Argues</hi>'s Instructions; which
Conjecture, a little after was confirm'd by his
own Confession. What you say (<hi>reply'd I</hi>)
a little surprizes me; for in the Preface to a
Tract, <hi>De l' Equilibre des Liqueurs,</hi> Printed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>M. P.</hi>—'s Death, your Testimony is
quoted upon that Particular, and it is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
conformable to that you give at present:
For there is no notice taken of the assistance he
receiv'd from <hi>M. des Argues.</hi> It is only said,
the thing appear'd to you so prodigiously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
that you would not believe it. But
that you was persuaded that <hi>M. P—</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was the genuine Author of the Piece, but
was willing to confer the Honour on his Son.
I know not, <hi>said he,</hi> what they have made me
speak or think in that Preface, but I am very
well assur'd I say nothing at present, but what I
had wrote in plain Terms to <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tom. 2. Let. 38.</note>
after I had seen the Work.</p>
            <p>After all, said I, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> I am not much
surpriz'd that <hi>M. Paschal</hi> at sixteen years of
Age, without any foreign Succour, wrote a
Book of <hi>Coniques,</hi> and by chance jumpt in his
Thoughts with <hi>M. Descartes;</hi> he that at twelve
years old, before the sight of any Books of
<hi>Geometry,</hi> made himself particular <hi>Definitions,
Figures,</hi> then <hi>Axioms,</hi> and push'd on his Notices
so far, that when he was caught at his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54814:100"/>
he was already arriv'd to the thirty
second Proposition of the first Book of <hi>Euclide,</hi>
which he had never read.</p>
            <p>Do you credit that, said <hi>M. Descartes?</hi> Why
should I not, <hi>said I!</hi> It is so affirm'd and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstanc'd
in the Preface, I have mention'd, as
leaves no room to doubt of it. <hi>M. Paschal,</hi> the
Father, desirous that his Sons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> time should
be imploy'd in the gaining of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> which
he taught him himself, was cautious to conceal
from him the very Names of things, that are
us'd in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and constantly forbore to
mention 'em to his. Friends when he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
Notwithstanding according to the Author
of the Preface, <q>The Passion that Child had
for such sort of Science, joyn'd to his pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Understanding, serv'd him instead of a
Master; seeing his Tasks that were order'd
him, rob'd him of all other opportunities,
but his Hours of Recreation (a Circumstance
very remarkable) he laid out all he could
of those in these Speculations. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd,
<hi>says he,</hi> to make his own Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
calling a Circle a <hi>Round,</hi> a Line a <hi>Barr,</hi>
and so of the rest. After his <hi>Definitions,</hi> he
made him <hi>Axioms;</hi> and as we: proceed from
one thing to another in that Science, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Researches so far, that he was arriv'd
to the thirty second Proposition of <hi>Euclide.</hi>
As he had made that Progress, his Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently
entred the Room he was in, and
found him so attentive on the Proposition he
was upon, that it was a good while before he
took notice of his Approach. But it was a
far greater Surprize to him, upon his Demand,
What he was a doing? To hear him say, He
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54814:101"/>
was in search of such a Thing, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the <hi>thirty second Proposition</hi> of the <hi>first
Book of</hi> Euclide. He ask'd him then, What
made him think of that? He answered, it
was his Discovery of such an other Thing;
thus, as it were, analyzing and explaining
his meaning still, by the Names of a <hi>Barr</hi> and
a <hi>Round,</hi> he came down to the <hi>Definitions</hi> and
<hi>Axioms</hi> of his own <hi>Contrivance. M. Paschal</hi>
was so astonish'd at the greatness and force of
his Son's <hi>Genius,</hi> that leaving him, without
speaking another Word, he went at the
same juncture to a Friend's House of his, one
<hi>M. Pailleur,</hi> admirable in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>
When he came there, he stood immoveable as
a Statue, and as a Man transported. <hi>M. Pail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leur</hi>
observing that, and seeing him in Tears,
was very much affrighted, and pray'd him to
conceal no longer from him the cause of his
Displeasure. I weep not, said <hi>M. Paschal,</hi>
out of any Grief, but Joy. You know what
pains I have still taken to prevent all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of <hi>Geometry</hi> in my Son, for fear it should
take him off his other Studies. Yet see what he
has done; upon that he related all to him that
I have said: And <hi>M. Paschal,</hi> by the Advice of
his Friend, desisted to offer violence to his
Son's Inclinations, who was yet but a dozen
years of Age, and gave him an <hi>Euclide.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Seriously, said I to <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> do you
think a Man could have the Face to circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
a Lye so methodically as this? Could any
thing seem more probable than the Circles he
calls <hi>Rounds,</hi> and the Lines that he calls <hi>Barrs?</hi>
Is not that enough to persuade us of the Truth
of his <hi>Axioms,</hi> and the <hi>thirty second Proposition of</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:54814:101"/>
Euclide? What can be more Natural, than the
Surprizal of <hi>M. Paschal</hi> the Father, excepting
perhaps it was a little too long, who took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Cloak, and order'd his Horses to be
put in the Coach, yet remain'd, at his Arrival
at <hi>M. Pilleur</hi>'s House, in so immoveable a post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
as was capable to scare him? After all it
is very fine and extraordinary, and it would be
great pity it should be false.</p>
            <p>And I say (<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Descartes) it is greater
pity that it should be true, and that any should
believe it: For if once it be credited, that a
Child of twelve years old, that hath never seen
a Book of Geometry, and in whose Presence
all endeavours have been us'd to suppress the
very Name of it, whose Mind all day long was
taken up with quite different Notices, who had
no time to spare but his hours of Recreation,
which no Body probably order'd him to pass
away in Solitude, should be able to frame to
himself a Method of <hi>Geometry,</hi> invent <hi>Axioms,</hi>
and arrive at last to the <hi>thirty second Propositon
of</hi> Euclide, I say, if such like things be once
receiv'd for Truth, the <hi>Publick</hi> will become the
Subject and Game on which, in a short time, the
most <hi>Romantick Panegyrists</hi> shall sport the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies
of their Imaginations. That way of
praising is injurious to the Persons prais'd, and
a Commendation so improbable as that, renders
the Truths themselves suspected, that shall be
found in Company with it. <hi>M. Paschal</hi> was a
Man of a most exalted Capacity, but was far
from being an <hi>Angel</hi> or a <hi>Devil.</hi> I told <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
thereupon, I chanc'd into a Company not
long since, where one was speaking much to the
same purpose as he had done, upon this Topick,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54814:102"/>
and there fortun'd a Gentleman to be there, a
Friend to a Society that was under no mighty
Obligations to <hi>M. P.</hi> who seeing all People ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
that Fable, said, in a careless leering Air,
that the Author of the Preface and his Friends,
did, at most, but Justice to <hi>M. Paschal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
that they had rather been too backward in that
they had said no more; and as he was urg'd to
unmask himself, as to the meaning of a thing
every one perceiv'd he was not very serious in,
he added, That <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> as extravagant as it
look'd to him, appear'd but a very mean return
for the Obligations they were under, for
his Letters to the <hi>Provincial,</hi> in which
he had done 'em very signal Favours that
were worth these, and that were on a more
important Occasion. To which all agreed, and
'twas acknowledg'd <hi>M. Paschal</hi>'s Services to
those Gentlemen could not be repaid in a better
Coin. Yet I must needs tell you <hi>M. P.</hi> wrote
only, by the Memoirs that were given him, and
that he thought true, as false and precarious as
they were, not knowing the Spirit of a Party
wherein he was ingag'd. Undoubtedly he was
rather over-reach'd himself, than any design he
had to impose on others. Let us say no more
on this occasion; and <hi>M. Descartes</hi> recall'd me
to the Chapter concerning <hi>Cartesianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He inquir'd then, what Strength he had in
the <hi>Vniversities,</hi> and most celebrated <hi>Colleges</hi>
of <hi>France?</hi> And how his Doctrin was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there? I told him, without Ceremony, what
I knew concerning it: That I knew no College
that openly profess'd his Doctrin, that most of
them were discharg'd from Teaching of it:
That in the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> extream care
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54814:102"/>
was taken lest the Professors should give too
much liberty on that side: That <hi>Cartesianism</hi> had
been the Debate of several <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and how
that I had heard, from some Body, that it had
been talk'd of putting it down by an Act of
<hi>Parliament;</hi> it was propos'd to the late <hi>Chief
President, M. de la Moignon,</hi> but that that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
was not prosecuted. That the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Caen,</hi> which next to that of <hi>Paris</hi> is the
most flourishing, at least, for Philosophy, had
in <hi>one Thousand six Hundred Seventy seven,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
against that <hi>Doctrin,</hi> and condemn'd it as
contrary to <hi>Orthodox Divinity;</hi> denying all hopes
to any that should undertake to maintain it, of
their admission to any Degree in the <hi>Vniversity;</hi>
and forbiding all such as were already admitted,
the teaching it <hi>viva voce,</hi> or by Writing, upon
pain of forfeiting their Priviledges and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
that the Example of <hi>Angers</hi> had been
imitated therein, that two years before had
made the like Decrees, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by a <hi>Placart</hi> of the King put forth at
<hi>Versailles</hi> in the year, 1675. and that most of
the other Universities had gone in imitation of
the same Proceedings.</p>
            <p>This News chaf'd <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> And what,
<hi>said he,</hi> has no one in these occasions undertaken
my Defence? Would no <hi>Corporation,</hi> no <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
declare for my <hi>Doctrin?</hi> We have seen
whole <hi>Orders</hi> take on them the quality of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
and <hi>Thomists,</hi> and to carry the Interests,
some of an Universal <hi>a parte rei,</hi> others of an
Universal <hi>a parte mentis,</hi> sometimes beyond the
Bounds of a laudable Emulation; whilst a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
so Solid and Curious as mine, shall be
abandon'd to the Humours and Caprice of the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54814:103"/>
               <hi>Vniversities.</hi> I had pardon'd the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
that their ill-natured Behaviour, who were not
oblig'd indeed to have those Considerations for
a Stranger, as I was in respect of them; but I
could never have believ'd they would have
treated me so in <hi>France,</hi> my Native Country;
to which I am sure I have given much Honour
and Reputation. Why were my Bones tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
from <hi>Sweden</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> if at the same time
they intomb'd them with Pomp and Funeral
Elogies, they blasted my Memory throughout
the <hi>Kingdom?</hi> I quitted, it's true, the World,
a little with the soonest: But after all, I left
it not before I had acquir'd a most wonderful
Esteem. I had taken infallible Measures for the
securing my Party: And my Affairs had never
been reduc'd to so damn'd a Plight, had my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
trod in my Steps, and kept their Eye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
on my Views and my Designs.</p>
            <p>For I must confess, said he, I was not exempt
from the Weakness and Blind Side of all Leaders
of a <hi>Sect.</hi> I was concern'd for the Progress of
my <hi>own,</hi> though I feign'd to seem as indifferent
for that as any thing else; and the Hopes I had
one Day to see it take Place of all the rest,
serv'd as an Incentive to encourage my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
I had drawn up my self a System of my
Management, for the accomplishing my Design.
My first Prospect was that of cajoling the <hi>Iesuits,</hi>
and sounding them, to try if I could engage
them in my Interests, or at least make a Party
among them; that would have been a Parting-Blow
indeed, and my Affairs for ever after would
have stood secure of any Rival or Competitor:
They are possess'd of the <hi>Colleges</hi> of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and there are among them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54814:103"/>
a great many Men of excellent Sense, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of protecting my Opinions, if once they
were admitted.<note place="margin">Diverses Lett. de Des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Tom: 3.</note> I sent them my Works, desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to examine them, and assuring them,
I would submit them to their Judgment. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
were very favourable at that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
their <hi>Provincial</hi> was my Countryman,
my Friend, and my Relation: My <hi>Regent</hi> in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
who was still living, and whom I had
observ'd to be a better <hi>Naturalist</hi> than most of
the Philosophers of that Time, wished me very
well. In short, I question'd not my Success;
but I was highly surpriz'd upon <hi>Father Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sennus</hi>
his acquainting me from <hi>Paris</hi> that <hi>Father
Bourdin,</hi> the Mathematician of the <hi>Iesuits College,</hi>
had publish'd Theses in opposition to my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crin.
Those were the first that appear'd
against me in <hi>France;</hi> such a Thunder-clap as
that gave me quickly to understand how the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
stood affected, and how little Stress I
ought to lay upon the Friendship of some Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
Not long after the same <hi>Mathematician</hi>
wrote against my Meditations, in no very seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Style, turning them to Droll and Ridicule;
which occasion'd on my part a very smart and
vigorous Answer. I complain'd thereof to
<hi>Father Dinet,</hi> in a Letter that I printed with my
Meditations: In a Word, an open Breach was
made betwixt the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and my self. I desir'd
<hi>Father Mersennus</hi> very carefully to watch the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> towards me, and to give
me Intelligence of all. I made a Resolution too
to fall upon them, and confute some one of
their Printed <hi>Courses</hi> that was most in Vogue;
but I desisted from that Design for some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:54814:104"/>
Mean while I had another String to my Bow:
There was set up a Party at that Time in <hi>France,</hi>
diametrically opposite to the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> compos'd of
those who write themselves <hi>S. Austin</hi>'s Disciples,
and who were zealous Sticklers for <hi>M. Iansenius,</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Ypres</hi> his Doctrin. <hi>Monsieur Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld,</hi>
as young a Doctor as he was, had already
got an extraordinary Fame: In the concern I
had with him upon account of some Objections
he raised against my <hi>Meditations,</hi> which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
with the greatest Expression of Esteem
I had for his Intellectual Capacity, I found out
what he was, that is, a Man ambitious of <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Novelty,</hi> and of whom one might be
sure, if once one had engaged him in a Party,
recommendable with those two Temptations:
Therefore I was well assur'd of him; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Resentment I express'd towards the
<hi>Iesuits,</hi> was that which most endear'd him:
This fell out so well, that from thenceforth you
should not see a <hi>Iansenist Philosopher</hi> that was not
a <hi>Cartesian.</hi> It was likewise these Gentlemen
that brought Philosophy in Fashion among the
Ladies; and I had Advice from <hi>Paris</hi> at that
Time, That nothing was more customary in
their Dressing-Rooms than the Parallel of
<hi>Monsieur d'Ypres</hi> and <hi>de Molina,</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and
<hi>Descartes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dream'd next of hooking in some <hi>Fraternity</hi>
or other; well-remembring what I us'd to hear
the late <hi>M. Iansenius</hi> say, <hi>That such sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
espouse an Interest without knowing what it is;
and he was of Advice it would be of no small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his</hi> S. Austin <hi>to be seconded with some such
Herd; because,</hi> added he, <hi>when they are once
imbarqu'd, nothing can put a Stop to them</hi> pro &amp;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54814:104"/>
contra. I had an Eye upon the <hi>Minim Fryens,</hi>
upon the Score of <hi>Father Mersennus,</hi> who was my
intimate Friend, and in great Repute with the
Order; but I consider'd that though those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
had Men of Parts and Learning among
them, yet they were little abroad, and taught
not publickly: Again, <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> assur'd
me, That if the Matter was brought before
the Chapiter, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Party would infallibly
carry it, 'cause of the Old ones, who had for a
long Time equipt themselves with all sorts of
Philosophical Furniture, and would never be at
the Charge of suting themselves afresh.</p>
            <p>You did well in avoiding that Game (<hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
our Old Gentleman</hi>) for since that a <hi>Father</hi>
of their Order, one <hi>Father Magnan,</hi> a Rational,
Understanding Man, striking a little out of the
Usual Road, and treading in a new Track, has,
as I am inform'd, been chastis'd in a General
Chapiter, and Prohibitions have been made for
any to imbrace his Principle; and since the main
of their Studies as well as of other Seminaries,
are <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> and Divinity: What is properly
called <hi>Physicks</hi> is not very current; the Offensive
and Defensive League entred by several Orders
for <hi>Physical Predetermination,</hi> against <hi>Mean Science,</hi>
is the grand concern that hath found them Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for almost an hundred Years.</p>
            <p>And it will continue them in Employment still,
(<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Descartes) for the same Reason as
made me take those Measures I speak of, that is,
because <hi>Predetermination</hi> and <hi>Mean Science</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Sentiments of the Order and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
a Quality I designed to give my Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
to eternalize it: But, however, when I
quitted the World, I left Things in so good a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54814:105"/>
tendency that way, as incourag'd me to hope I had
a main Party in the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>Fathers
of the Oratory.</hi> It is a considerable Body in
<hi>France,</hi> whose Business is Study, many whereof
have rendred themselves Famous by their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and their Writings. The Emulation that
is between them and the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to
the Esteem and Respect they have for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was enough to procure me an Hearing in
their <hi>Congregation:</hi> What, have those Fathers
forsaken me?</p>
            <p>You make me call to Mind, said I thereupon,
some Passages in that Business, that may be worth
your Hearing. I know not whether you have
reason to be satisfy'd or dissatisfy'd with the
<hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> you shall be Judge your self.
About ten or a dozen Years ago there happen'd
some Divisions in the University of <hi>Angers,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi>'s defending
certain <hi>Theses,</hi> wherein much New Philosophy
was interwoven, partly according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
partly according to the particular
Notions of the Professors:<note place="margin">Recueil de ce qui s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Angers.</note> The University took
alarm at Sight of those Innovations, and would
not suffer the <hi>Theses</hi> to pass: She gave the Court
an Account of it, and the <hi>Father General.</hi> The
Court was enclin'd for the University, which
oblig'd the <hi>Father General</hi> to order in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
That no one should swerve from the
Ancient Opinions, or any ways teach the New
Philosophy. But here comes a Cup of Comfort
for you; speedily after came out a Printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
penn'd in excellent Latin, to the Reverend
<hi>Father Senault, General</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> entitul'd,
<hi>Epistola eorum quotquot in Oratoriana Congregatione
Cartesianam doctrinam amant:</hi> Wherein, after
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54814:105"/>
having laid down the Motives that induc'd them
to beseech him not to straiten and infringe their
Minds; on that Particular were added these
Words, <hi>ut noris quam late Cartesiana haec labes,
(si labes est)— grassetur. Plusquam ducenti nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero
sumus, quos pestis ista infecit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby you see what Strength you had in that
<hi>Congregation:</hi> Which yet was no Impediment to
the Proceedure and Decree of the <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
of the <hi>Oratory</hi> in 1678. declaring she imbrac'd
no Party; but that she always had, and would
still maintain that Freedom and Priviledg of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Sound and wholesome Doctrin; and that
she laid restraint on none but such as were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
by the Church, or as savour'd of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of <hi>Iansenius</hi> and <hi>Baius</hi> in Divinity, or
of the Opinions of <hi>Descartes</hi> in Philosophy.</p>
            <p>Oh the Base and Cowardly—cry'd <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
all enrag'd. Softly, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> I reply'd,
if you your self had headed a Corporation,
whose Essential Interests you had engag'd to
maintain, you would have had very different
Thoughts from those you now have under the
Quality of a Leader of a Sect. Neither Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
nor Conscience could oblige a Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Martyr</hi> of a Philosopher. Matters are
of a quite distinct Nature in Point of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi>
and <hi>Religion:</hi> A Man may allow of the
Opinions of a Philosopher, consider'd in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and at the same Time be included in
such Circumstances as make it prudence to
Acquiesce.</p>
            <p>But two things there are, which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
observ'd to you, which should make you
overlook those Paltry Affronts you Philosophy
has met with. The first is, that what is in it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54814:106"/>
more choise and better than ordinary, begins to
be authoriz'd in the Schools of the most zealous
<hi>Peripateticks;</hi> who no longer oppose the Truth,
that you have insus'd into them, but only so
husband <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Stake, as it may not be said
that ever any Philosopher had a clearer View
than he. You know the Adventure of the last
Age in <hi>France;</hi> the wisest Heads of the Kingdom
could do no otherwise than approve the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Part of the Regulations made in the <hi>Council
of Trent,</hi> notwithstanding there were Reasons
that obstructed the adhereing to that Couuncil,
on Discipline-account. What was done? The
States of <hi>Blois</hi> made Ordinances exactly like a
great Part of the Decrees of that Council:
Thus, without admiting the Council, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
in effect the Purport of it. The <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi>
have in some sort transcrib'd the Conduct
of those grave <hi>Politicians.</hi> 'Tis a Crime among
them to be a <hi>Cartesian,</hi> but 'tis an Honour to
make good Use of the best Part of <hi>M. Descartes.</hi>
And to compare the Fortune of your Doctrin
with that of another that in our Days hath
made such a Bustle in the World, before the
Propositions of <hi>Iansenius</hi> had been condemn'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> his Followers highly complimented him
upon them: His was the Pure and Uncorrupt
Doctrin that was copied from the great <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin;</hi>
but they had no sooner been censur'd as
Heretical, but they vanish'd in a Trice, and
could not be found in <hi>Iansenius</hi> his Book: No one
could heartily believe they ever had been there,
and in Spight of Bulls of <hi>Popes</hi> and Ordinances
of <hi>Bishops,</hi> 'twas reckon'd a Mortal Sin to sign a
Condemnation of Propositions, and a Form of
Faith, without the Distinction of <hi>De Iure &amp; de
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54814:106"/>
Facto.</hi> The quite contrary happen'd in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
I am speaking of.</p>
            <p>At first, when the <hi>Cartesians</hi> made Mention of
<hi>Subtil Matter,</hi> and ridicul'd the <hi>Horror</hi> of a
<hi>Vacuum,</hi> talk'd of the <hi>Elastick</hi> Vertue of the
Air, the Pressure of its Columns, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Impression of Objects on our Senses,
<hi>Aristotle</hi> was brought to confront them with a
quite contrary Doctrin.</p>
            <p>Since that Time, upon Examination of the
Reasons on which your Propositions in those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
depended, they would not say that you
were in the Right; but many undertook to
affirm, That <hi>Aristotle</hi> had taught the greatest
Part of that before you. There hath been
since discover'd in his Writings an <hi>Ethereal
Matter,</hi> the manner of <hi>Sensations</hi> by the <hi>Concussion</hi>
of the <hi>Organs;</hi> the Demonstration of the <hi>Gravity</hi>
of the <hi>Air,</hi> and the most delicate Truths of the
<hi>Equilibrium</hi> of Liquors: So instead of the <hi>Ianse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
abandoning, or seeming to abandon the
<hi>Right,</hi> and sheltering themselves under the <hi>Fact,</hi>
the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> fall on Possession of the <hi>Right</hi>
by the <hi>Fact</hi> itself; that is, the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> now
find in <hi>Aristotle</hi> what according to themselves
had not been visible for these thirty Years. On
the contrary, the <hi>Iansenists</hi> have lost Sight of
the Propositions they had pointed to us hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
themselves, before they were condemn'd:
So that would you make any Abatements, as I
hope you will, that I may make good my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
I made <hi>Voetius</hi> your Old Friend in <hi>Holland,</hi>
we should see <hi>M. Descartes</hi> turn <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> and
<hi>Aristotle Cartesian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:54814:107"/>
The other Thing, that is Matter of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to you, and that in Defiance to all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of your Enemies must encourage you to
hope for the Immortality of <hi>Cartesianism,</hi> is
the uncontroulable Liberty that's left to every
one of Writing for and against it: And that at
this Day the most Solid and Ingenious Patron
of the New Philosophy, is a celebrated <hi>Father</hi> of
the <hi>Oratory,</hi> whose Books are in great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He forthwith requir'd his Name and
Character. He is call'd, said I, <hi>Father Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche:</hi>
He's a Man of an extraordinary pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Judgment, of profound Thought, that has
a wonderful Gift at methodizing his Reflections,
which he opens and displays in the neatest and
most lively manner imaginable; that knows
however to give an Air of Truth and a probable
Turn, to the most extraordinary and abstracted
Notions; that is skill'd to the utmost Perfection,
in preparing the Mind of his Reader, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essing
him in his own Thoughts. In short, he
is the most charming <hi>Cartesian</hi> that I know.
His principal Work is called, <hi>The Search of
Truth;</hi> and it is from that in particular that he
hath been acknowledg'd for such as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
him: Yet I cannot conceal from you a
little Accident that may somewhat allay the Joy
that News must excite in you; which is, That
this Illustrious Champion of the New Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
has been sometime since at Variance with
<hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> whose Friend he had ever been
before, which made a kind of Civil War. The
Onset and Defence on both Sides is manag'd
with Vigor and Courage; each of them combate
in their own way: Volumes of five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pages apiece are sent out by <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54814:107"/>
the turning of an Hand: The other is less
luxuriant, but more strict and pressing: He takes
those Captains for his Precedent, who only make
use of some select Troops, without any regard
to Number, that always march close and in good
Order, who let the Enemy wheel about as often
as they please, but are sure to break their Ranks
whenever they see an Advantage. Discourse is
various concerning the Motives of that War;
<hi>M. Arnauld</hi> is the Aggressor: The most refin'd
Politicians, who, as you know, never fail to make
the best of their Talent on such Occasions, say,
It is a Trick and Evasion of the <hi>Old Doctor,</hi> who
has several other such at command. Some Years
ago there appear'd two Books against him; one
was titul'd, <hi>The Spirit of</hi> M. Arnauld, wrote by
a <hi>French Protestant Minister,</hi> retir'd to <hi>Holland;</hi>
that's a very roguish Book, I must confess, and
full of Venom and Gall, but he leaves <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi>
inextricably in the Briars; he not only
turns his own Weapons upon him, but also
against the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and concludes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from the Principles and Practice of
<hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> that most of the Arguments he
takes to be most forcible and Advantagious to
the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> are nul and insignificant,
are meer Shew and Out-side, fit only to dazle the
Eyes of the Ignorant, and such as cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
to the Bottom of Things.</p>
            <p>The other Book, which was printed the first
of the two, but was not made publick till some
time after, was written by a <hi>Iesuite</hi> against a
<hi>French</hi> Translation of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd, <hi>The</hi> Mons <hi>New Testament,</hi> done
by the Gentlemen <hi>du Port Royal,</hi> and whereof
<hi>M. Arnauld</hi> took upon him the Patronage and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54814:108"/>
Defence. That Book of the Jesuite is Solidly,
Scholar-like and Politely wrote. He very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
comes over <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> on many Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and adds from time to time, in those
Places, he challenges him to give an Answer to
such and such a Point: Notwithstanding, those
two Books found no Reply; and no one could
say they were unanswer'd, because they were
despised and did not deserve the Pains. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
it self was ingag'd, that Answer should be
made the first (as hath since been done by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hand) and <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>'s Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
were interess'd to satisfy the Scruples,
the Evidence of Fact, and the Force of Reasons
in the second, had rais'd in the Minds of Men.
See then what was the sense of the <hi>Politicians</hi> of
the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis known by long Experience, that <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi>
never us'd to be very Dormant in the case
of Books wrote against him. Whence then
proceeds this extraordinary Patience, he would
fain seem to have at present? Whence comes
it, that instead of defending himself against his
Enemies, that make voluntary Insults to attack
him, and fall so foully on him, he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
new Adversaries, and out of a gayety of
Humour falls to Daggers-drawing with his
Friends and Allies, whilst his Country is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
to the Pillage and Descretion of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Here is, say they, the short and the
long of the Business. Those two Books <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
M. Arnauld.</hi> The first upon several Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
presents you with an <hi>Argumentum ad Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
and is beyond Reply. The second is
penn'd with that Circumspection and Exactness,
as Wards off all Passes, gives not the least hold,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54814:108"/>
and blocks up all the out-lets, where ere his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
might escape him. It would be no
part of Prudence to engage on so disadvantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Terms. He must not, however, be seen
to baulk or decline the Challenge; (and besides
<hi>M. Arnauld</hi> had resolv'd to leave the World,
whenever he desisted to make a noise in it, and
to Write and Dispute whatever it cost him:)
Therefore he cunningly procures himself a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
He picks a random Quarrel with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Malebranche,</hi> threatning an Attack on a
Treatise of his, concerning <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi>
which he had presum'd to publish contrary to his
Advice. He compiles a great Volume, against
two or three Chapters of the <hi>Research of Truth.</hi>
That Book is answered. <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> thereupon
makes his Reply. <hi>Father Malebranche</hi> charges
again. <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> makes yet another Onset.
Here some are inquisitive, why <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>
neglects to answer both <hi>M. Iurieu</hi> and the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite?</hi>
Hey day! cry others, how would you have
him answer them? Does not <hi>Father Malebranche</hi>
find him his Hands full? Whose little Volumes
he's forc'd to overwhelm with bulky Books, to
obstruct the entrance of that monstrous Impiety
into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrin of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
God: Without which no Man can find out
what he means by his intelligible Extension, that
is, he says, in God. However the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
is urgent and requires Dispatch. But
what would you have a Man do? they add. Is
it possible he should be every where at once?
Whilst the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> march'd with all the
Forces of his Kingdom to raise the Siege of
<hi>Vienna,</hi> was he not necessitated to suffer the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54814:109"/>
Garrison of <hi>Kaminiec</hi> to over-run <hi>Podolia,</hi> and
the <hi>Tartars</hi> to inslave <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If that Conjecture is not true, said <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
it is however very probable, and those
Gamesters play the Politician not amiss. But
what (<hi>pursu'd he</hi>) is the Subject of Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those two famous Authors? For I assure
you, I perceive a Concern upon me, upon their
Account. The Matter in Debate (<hi>I answer'd</hi>)
is of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the manner of
our apprehending Objects that are without us.
<hi>M. Arnauld</hi> would have it, that our <hi>Idea</hi>'s are
nothing but the Modifications of our Soul. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Malebranche</hi> pretends, that that Opinion is
unwarrantable, and maintains we have no other
perception of Objects than in God; who being
every where, is intimately united with our
Soul, and who following the general Laws of
the Union of the Body and Soul, communicates
to us the Idea of the Object that he hath in
himself, and at once makes us apprehend the
Impression of it. Both one and the other strive
upon occasion, to ingage you on their side, or
to shew rather, that they advance nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to your Thoughts upon Ideas: But I
am of Opinion, you never penetrated so deep
in that Affair, as that either of them can gain
much by your Authority.</p>
            <p>What you say of me is true (<hi>reply'd</hi> M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes;)
but which at last of these two Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have got the better on't? I answer'd him,
I was not rash and inconsiderate enough, to set
up for a Decider of the Difference and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of those two Hero's: That I could only
say that they fell to't in earnest: That though
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54814:109"/>
               <hi>M. Arnauld</hi> had propos'd to himself the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
<hi>Father Malebranche</hi>'s Tract of <hi>Nature</hi>
and of <hi>Grace,</hi> he thought it advisable to begin
with the Confutation of what he had written
touching Idea's in his <hi>Search of Truth,</hi> looking
on that past (to use his Thought and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Outworks of the place he had
a Design to ruin. That the Subject being very
Abstracted and Metaphysical, and above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Capacity of Men, and <hi>Father Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branche</hi>'s
System on that Particular, requiring
a very great Attention to comprehend it, <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld</hi>
seem'd to have taken designedly that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Assault, for the making a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
Effort on his Adversary; but that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Malebranche,</hi> without giving up his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
wherein he acquit himself admirably
well, had drawn them into the Body of the
place, that is to say, had incorporated them
with the Interests of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious
Ground, and too slippery a stand
for <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> where he was very closely
press'd. Yet that I durst not undertake for the
Success of <hi>Father Malebranche</hi>'s Self on that Side,
because of the great Experience of <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>
in such sort of War, wherein he undoubtedly
merits the Encomium <hi>Admiral Chatillon</hi> used to
give himself, <hi>viz.</hi> He had wherewith to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from the greatest Captains that ever
were, in that having been always beaten by his
Enemies, having lost all the Battles he had been
oblig'd to Fight, after all his Misfortunes, he
still stood upon his Legs, in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Party, and bearing still a Part and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
able to disquiet those by whom he had
been worsted. I might likewise add, without
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54814:110"/>
affronting <hi>Father Malebranche,</hi> he is already sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the loss he has sustain'd since that first
Breach: For before that unhappiness, and
whilst he was a Friend of <hi>M. Arnauld,</hi> he was
every where extoll'd for a sublime and infinitely
penetrating Genius; and at present, he's a Man
that speaks nothing but Perple it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
whom one can neither understand
nor follow without danger of Error: So true it
is that <hi>M. Arnauld</hi>'s Friendship is at this day, as
it ever has been, a prodigious bank of Merit to
those that are so fortunate to injoy it, and that
Societies, no less than particular Persons that
were destitute of that Advantage, would be very
little better for their Reputation.</p>
            <p>As I was thus entertaining Discourse with
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> I perceiv'd in an Instant a change
in me, that carry'd something in it much like
what we experience in some sudden Faintings,
wherein all things seem to alter and turn colour.
I could never have believ'd a Soul separate from
the Body, had been capable of such an Accident.
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> who was aware of it, and well
understood the cause, left me for a moment to
wait on <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Embassadors.</hi> I knew not
what Intercourse they had, till the <hi>old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi>
Information, on our return to th'other
World. He told me <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Descartes</hi> declin'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
all Dispute and Business with them; only
assuring them he had not the least Design of
making any Inroad into <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Dominions;
but that he thought it a difficult piece of Work
to effect a through Accommodation; and that it
would be proper for each to preserve their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in Opinion, as before, without being rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and concern'd to bring over that of others
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54814:110"/>
to it; notwithstanding to the end their Voyage
might not be wholly ineffectual, he promis'd
to see that the <hi>Cartesians</hi> behav'd themselves
with greater Respect and Esteem towards <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
upon condition <hi>Aristotle</hi> would restrain the
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> from flying out with that out-rage
against <hi>Cartesianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to my Spiritual <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> I
knew not the reason of that neither till my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
and it was this. We must suppose that
as long as our Soul is united with our Body, the
most part of its Ideas and Conceptions depend
on the disposition of our Brain. The diversity
of that Disposition consists, as say the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks,</hi>
in the difference of the <hi>Species,</hi> Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Images of Objects, contain'd in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
of the Brain, or imprinted on its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
The <hi>new Philosophers</hi> more truly say,
That those kind of Pictures are nothing but the
Traces and Footsteps stampt on the Brain, by
the ordinary Current of the Animal Spirits,
that flow in great Plenty, as in little Rivers,
and wear themselves a kind of Channel, to
which they usually keep. In what way soever
that different Disposition causes the different
Idea's and different Judgments of the Soul (for
it is an inscrutable Mystery) it is certain it is
done, and that different Ideas suppose different
Traces. So that should a dissection be made of
a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> and a <hi>Cartesian</hi> Brain, with the help
of good Microscopes, for the discovery of those
Prints that are exquisitely fine, one should see a
prodigious difference in the Complexion of
those two Brains. I never indeed question'd
that Truth, but I thought that dependence of
the Soul lasted no longer than it was in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54814:111"/>
Body, and that as soon as the Separation was
perform'd, it had no more Correspondence
with it: But I experimented the contrary, and
my Fellow-Travellers assur'd me that so long as
the Body has its Organs sound and free, let the
Soul be ten thousand Worlds apart, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same Impressions, as if it resided in
it: And that if <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Snush had not
lax'd the sensitive Nerves, I should have seen,
whilst I was in <hi>Descartes</hi>'s World all the Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies,
the Eyes of my Body were presented
with. I should have heard every noise that beat
upon the Drum of my Ears: And so of all the
rest.</p>
            <p>So astonishing an Effect as this makes no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on <hi>Philosophical</hi> Souls: For if they be
<hi>Peripateticks</hi> they presently explain it by the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi>
betwixt the Soul and Body of the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual;
and if they be <hi>Cartesians</hi> they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it by the general Laws of the Soul and
Bodies Union, which is in cause that God on
occasion of such and such Motions made in the
Body, produces such and such Thoughts or
Perceptions in the Soul; and say they, one of
these Laws is, That whilst the Organs of the
Body are capacitated for Imployment, the Soul
wherever she is, receives the Impressions of
Objects that affect them; it being as easy a thing
for God to advertise the Soul of that Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when she is remote from the Body, as when
present, proximity of Place being wholly insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
in the thing; since, according to them,
the Motion of the Organs is not the real cause
that produces <hi>Sensations,</hi> but only the occasional
cause, that is, that which offers an occasion to <hi>God
Almighty</hi> of producing them in the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:54814:111"/>
My Old Gentleman then, as I was saying, in our
Return confess'd the Trick <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> and
himself had agreed to play me: They had given
Instructions, before they departed, to the <hi>little
Negro,</hi> that was commission'd to guard my <hi>Corps,</hi>
at such an Hour, in which they easily foresaw
we should be arriv'd to <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> to
take Care so to determine the Animal Spirits in
my Brain, as they might no longer keep the
beaten Tracks they had been us'd to, for the
exciting <hi>Peripatetick Spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies</hi> in my Mind, but to
make them glide in such a Current as was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and as he knew how, for the implanting
<hi>Cartesian Ideas</hi> in their Room; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with that Dexterity, that whether it was
by the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> of <hi>Sympathy,</hi> or by vertue of
the <hi>General Laws</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi> of the Body and Soul,
my Notions were all in an instant turn'd topsie
turvy: And I, that a Moment since could see
nothing in that <hi>Immense Space,</hi> in which I was,
began to perceive <hi>Matter</hi> there, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that <hi>Space, Extension</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> were all
one and the same thing. After which, as often
as <hi>M. Decsartes</hi> bade us to conceive how such and
such Motions were effected in Matter, I saw them
more distinctly than your most clarify'd <hi>Cartesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
do your <hi>Chamfer'd</hi> Parts of Matter wreath'd
in shape of little Skrews, by the Struggle they
have to squeez betwixt the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>Second
Element,</hi> or to constitute a little <hi>Vortex,</hi> round
the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> and to cause that wonderful affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that is found betwixt that Stone and the
Poles of the Earth, and with it and Iron.</p>
            <p>It is plain that an Universal Revolution of
Ideas, like this, cannot happen in the Soul,
without causing an extraordinary Commotion in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54814:112"/>
its Substance, no more than a general Alteration
of Humors can occur in the Body, without a
Change of its Constitution. I was therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
surpriz'd at so prodigious a Change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wholly unable to give any probable Guess at
its Cause, but could not help attributing it to
some Secret in <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Philosophy; who
returning quickly after, address'd me in a more
Familiar Air than at my first Reception. Well,
what, shall we begin to fall to work upon our
World? I see you are at present capable and
worthy of reaping that Satisfaction. Monsieur,
<hi>said I,</hi> I know not where I am, nor what I ought
to think of my self: But certainly nothing can
more effectually dispose me to a Belief that you
are capable of becoming the Creator of a World,
than that Power you manifest over Spirits. Yes,
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> I acknowledg <hi>Space, Matter</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension</hi>
to be the self-same Thing: I see plainly
in that Space, Materials for the Building a <hi>New
World;</hi> and if you once accomplish so vast and
prodigious a Work, from this Time forward I
renounce my Body to live here with you for ever
and ever, to the End of the World, nothing
seeming comparable to the Advantage of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the most Wife and Puissant Soul,
that ever came out of the Almighty's Hands.</p>
            <p>You'l be better advis'd than that, reply'd
<hi>M. Descartes;</hi> it behoves you to expect the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the <hi>Sovereign Being</hi> for an entire Dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from your Body; nor is there any Necessity
for it, to have all the Satisfaction that you wish.
In less than two Hours Time I'll make you a
<hi>World,</hi> wherein shall be a <hi>Sun,</hi> an <hi>Earth, Planets,
Comets,</hi> and every thing you see more Curious
and observable in yours; and since this World
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54814:112"/>
I am about to make is not to stand for good and
all, but is only an Essay of another I intend to
build at my Leisure, of far greater Capacity and
Perfection; I can easily interrupt and break
the Motions, to let you see in a little Time the
different Changes, which occur not in the
Parts of the great World, but in the Process
of Years.</p>
            <p>Come on then, let us begin, said he, but follow
me exactly in the Principles I lay down, and the
Reflections I shall make you observe: Above all
interrupt me not. After these few Words
<hi>M. Des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>artes</hi> prepar'd himself for the executing
his Projection: Which was by the Exposition,
or rather Supposition of some of his most Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Principles, thought necessary to qualifie us
for the comprehending the Dispatch of that grand
Master-piece.</p>
            <p>Conceive, in the first Place (<hi>said he</hi>) that
all this <hi>vast Space</hi> is <hi>Matter:</hi> For this Space is
<hi>extended,</hi> and <hi>nothing</hi> is not capable of being so.
This Space therefore is an extended Substance,
or which is the same Thing, <hi>Matter.</hi> Whoever
can doubt of this Truth, can doubt if a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
can be without a Valley. Conceive in the
second Place, That in Nature there are two
inviolable Laws: The first is, That every Body
will ever maintain the Post and Capacity it has
once been put in, will never change it till some
External Cause shall force it; if it is in rest, it
will be in Rest eternally; if it is in Motion it
will continue eternally in Motion; if it is of a
Square Figure it will preserve its Square Figure
always.</p>
            <p>The Second is, That a Body always naturally
continues its Motion in a right Line, though the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54814:113"/>
rencounter and justling of other Bodies fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
disturb it from its Regular Course, and
from hence follows an indisputable Principle,
confirm'd by infinite Experiments; <hi>viz.</hi> That
a Body, circularly moved, constantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to get farther from the Centre of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if it fortune to get rid of a Body or
Bodies, that constrain it to move circularly, it
is always sure to make its escape by the <hi>Tangent</hi>
of the <hi>Circle</hi> it describ'd, in its Motion.
<figure>
                  <head>The Line A G is the Tangent, the Stone would
describe, supposing it to be freed from the Sling
at the Point A.</head>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>These Principles are the rich and fruitful
Sources of that infinity of admirable Truths,
of which <hi>True Philosophy</hi> is compos'd, and the
only Rules I will and ought to follow, in the
Production of the <hi>World</hi> I am about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:54814:113"/>
This short Speech ended, I was wonderfully
edify'd in seeing <hi>M. Descartes</hi> fall to Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and make an humble Acknowledgment to God of
all those intellectual Gifts and Blessings he had
vouchsaf'd him.</p>
            <p>Sovereign Being (<hi>said he</hi>) thou bearest me
witness, That never Mortal acknowledg'd that
absolute Dominion thou hast over all thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
with greater Respect and Submission than
my self: So long as I had my Being in the Land
of the Living, I made it my Business to convince
Men of that entire Dependence they have on
thee, having persuaded many of that important
Truth, That thou art the only Being which can
produce every thing in the World: That it is a
punishable Pride in Men to conceit themselves
capable of causing the least Motion imaginable
in Matter; and that the very Motion their Soul
supposes she influences on the Body, which she
animates, is purely the effect of thy Almighty
Power, that in concurrence with the Laws thy
Wisdom itself has confirm'd, moves the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body with such exactness and celerity,
on occasion of the Desires and Inclinations of
the Soul, as persuades her, it is herself that
moves them; though at the same Time she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
her Ignorance of the manner whereby it
must be done. That bright and lively influx,
wherewith thou hast enlightned my Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hath guided me out of that Laberynth of
common Delusion, and open'd me the way and
Method I ought to take, in the Study and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of thy wonderful Works. Though
I at present undertake to work upon that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Matter, which thy infinite Bounty seems
to have left at my Disposal, and though I have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54814:114"/>
assum'd the Freedom of warranting my Disciples
the <hi>Production</hi> of a <hi>World</hi> like that of thy own
Making; yet it is wholly in Dependence on thy
Power I have made this account. Yea, Lord, I
shall contribute in no wise to that Operation,
but by the Desires of my Will, which thou out
of thy gracious Goodness wilt be pleased to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
by impressing so much Motion on this
Matter as I shall wish for, and by giving this
Motion Determinations necessary to the End
which I propose; Reason and Experience having
taught me, That every pure Spirit, such as am
I my self, by one of the Universal Rules, to
which thou conformest thy external Actions,
hath Right and Priviledg of so much Motion as
is sufficient to move the Matter of a World.
Manifest then, Lord, thy Power in Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a Spiritual Creature, that makes this
humble Confession of his Weakness, and give
us farther occasion to praise and glorifie thy
Name.</p>
            <p>Having finish'd his Devotion, <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
mark'd out a round Space, of about five hundred
Leagues diameter, for the making a little
Sampler of his World, whereupon thus he
spake.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I shall at present only represent
you the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> of your World, and all
that is therein; that is to say, the <hi>Sun,</hi> the
<hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Planets,</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> the Disposition
of its principal Parts, and the different Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Dependences they have on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if you will honour me with a Visit
some Years hence, you shall see the <hi>Great World</hi>
finish'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:54814:114"/>
The first thing I shall do is to divide in almost
equal Parts all the Matter comprehended in the
Space I have chalk'd out. All those Parts shall
be very Small, but yet they must be less before I
have done with them: They must not all be of
a Spherical Figure, 'cause if they were all so
shap'd, there must necessarily be an Interval, or
<hi>Void</hi> betwixt them: But a <hi>Void</hi> is impossible;
they must therefore be of all Shapes and Figures,
but angular for the generality.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the Union of the Parts of
Matter purely consist, in that Repose they are
in, one by another; that Division I propose to
make, will last no longer than I shall agitate
them several ways, and drive them on every
Side.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since the Fluidity of Matter is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Motion of its smallest Parts, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
different ways; upon my Division and
Agitation of it in that wise, I shall make it
fluid, as hard and consistent as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>Again, this round Space of five hundred
Leagues, which I have cut out for the building
of my little World, being once made fluid, I
shall divide it into twenty Parts, or twenty
<hi>Vortexes,</hi> that shall be severally constituted of
infinite insensible Parts of Matter.</p>

               </figure>
For the comprehending what I mean by this
Word <hi>Vortex;</hi> imagine to your self a round or
oval Space of Matter, which I divide in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
or ten thousand little Parts. Suppose these
little Parts, so many little Giggs, each made to
turn about their Axle or their Centre; and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54814:115"/>
and bowl'd at the same time about the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of that round or oval Space; and this is
what I call a <hi>Vortex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you must conceive each <hi>Vortex</hi> as a
kind of <hi>Firmament,</hi> at whose Centre will be an
<hi>Astre</hi> or fix'd Star; so that in making <hi>twenty Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes,</hi>
in the Space which I have laid out, I shall
make twenty <hi>fix'd Stars:</hi> But at these <hi>fix'd S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars</hi>
you'l be surpriz'd, and will have the pleasure of
observing, that but one in twenty will continue,
which will represent your <hi>Sun:</hi> All the rest will
become partly <hi>Planets,</hi> partly <hi>Comets:</hi> Nor will
there of those twenty, above one great <hi>Vortex</hi>
remain, which will be that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in which
will be form'd two little new ones, to represent
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of your <hi>Earth,</hi> and that of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
This will be sufficient, <hi>Monsieur, said he,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself to me in particular, to qualify
you for the comprehending the Work I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to compleat. For the rest of my Principles
and Conclusions, which you have seen in my
Physicks, I shall more commodiously explain
them in the performance it self, as occasion shall
be offer'd.</p>
            <p>With that <hi>M. Descartes, Father Mersennus,</hi>
and my old Gentleman, betook themselves to
three different Stations in the Space, and began
to agitate and churn the Matter with a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Alacrity. The twenty <hi>Vortex</hi> were come
in an Instant, each having their Motion deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
on every side, and being so order'd that
the <hi>Poles</hi> of <hi>one Vortex</hi> were terminated at the
<hi>Eclyptick</hi> of an <hi>other.</hi> And hence it is that
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> calls the <hi>Circle</hi> of a <hi>Vortex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part. 3. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>incip.</note> that
which is remotest from its <hi>Poles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:54814:116"/>
Whereas the parts of every <hi>Vortex</hi> were seen
out of hand to be figured Angularwise for the
generality, and to move round about their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
there was a mighty grating and clashing
occasion'd by the Fraction of Angles, that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
followed the Struggle every Part made to
turn its self about its own Centre. And that
was the first Reflection <hi>M. Descartes</hi> occasioned
me to make, for the explaining to me the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and Production of the <hi>Elements,</hi> as they are
distinguish'd in his <hi>Physicks.</hi> You see, said he,
how from the agitation of Matter necessarily
issue the <hi>Elements,</hi> at which the Philosophers of
your World have blanched and bogled so. From
a <hi>Cube</hi> or any <hi>Angular</hi> Body whatsoever, to make
<hi>a round</hi> one, what more is required than the
paring off the Angles and Inequalities that are
found in the Surface of it? And what but this
is done in the Motion I have impressed on all
the little parts about their Centre? Is it possible
they should turn thus without a mutual Unhorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another? And can that continual rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of one against another, fail to polish them
more exactly than if they had been turn'd in a
Lathe? These little Balls constitute that kind of
Matter which I call my <hi>second Element.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in the Interim of the shivering of
these Angles, you see (and 'tis impossible to be
otherwise) there is a World of little <hi>Filings,</hi>
prodigiously less than the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>second
Element;</hi> and it is that diminutive Dust which
I call the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>first Element.</hi> But last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
among the parts of the first Element, as
minute as they are, there are some less than
others, and whereas they are nothing but the
Scrapings of the second Element, they are of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54814:116"/>
very irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gular Figures, and full of Angles:
Which is the reason they entangle and fetter
themselves with one another, and cake into a
<hi>ragged</hi> and <hi>gross Mass,</hi> which I call the Matter of
the <hi>third Element:</hi> And these are my <hi>three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which as you see, I had reason to defy the
World to find a fault with.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was some Moments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking to me, being extraordinary busy
in the management of his Project, and the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
regulation of the first Motions of his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes.</hi>
Mean while the little parts of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of every <hi>Vortex,</hi> by the means of their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their Centre and rubbing against each
other, even'd and polish'd themselves by little
and little, and still as they became perfectly
Globular, they lost of their Bulk and decreas'd
in Size. Then it was that I began to see the
Consequences of the Rules of Motion, which
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> had readily suppos'd. For seeing
these little Balls took up less room than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and seeing they kept still a turning round,
and their Figure rendred them more fit for
Motion, I perceived them presently to quit the
Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and to gain the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
By that Effort obliging the Matter of
the <hi>first Element,</hi> that was dispers'd through all
the <hi>Vortex,</hi> to fall down to the Centre; and to
constitute a Mass of that extreamly fine and
powdered Dust, that still whirl'd round, and
attempted to recover the Circumference from
which the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>second Element</hi> had chas'd
it: But all in vain, because the <hi>Figure</hi> of the
parts of the <hi>second Element</hi> maintained them in
their Post; and all that could possibly be done
by the Matter of the <hi>first,</hi> was upon occasion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54814:117"/>
to slip into the Intervals, the Balls in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> sometimes left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
            <p>The Satisfaction <hi>M. Descartes</hi> observ'd I took
at that petty Play, and the Facility I manifested
in perceiving or conceiving whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, highly pleased him, and engaged
him to explain to me one of the most curious
Mysteries in Philosophy. I could wish, said he,
you had your Body here, you would let in those
admirable Deductions from the Principles I have
laid, with a greater <hi>Gusto</hi> and Delight. Now
you only see in the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortexes</hi> a heap
of Dust or of subtil Matter, of the first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but had you your Body and your Organs
with you, capable of the Impressions that heap
of Dust would make, you'd see for every heap
of Dust a <hi>Sun. Monsieur (continued he)</hi> that
very <hi>Sun,</hi> whose Splendour and Beauty you so
often have admir'd in your World is nothing,
in affect, but an Amass of that same Dust; but
Dust instigated with such a Motion as I explain
in my Philosophy, and you at present see.</p>
            <p>To give you a clear Insight in this Matter, I
need only suppose one thing; which I am sure
you wont deny me; and which, on occasion, I
could shew you in <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself, to wit, that
<hi>Vision</hi> is caused meerly by the <hi>vibration,</hi> of the
<hi>Threds</hi> wherewith the optick Nerve is wrought.
And it is on Account of that <hi>vibration,</hi> that a
Man falling rudely on his Head, or who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the dark, runs his Face against a Post,
sees a sudden flash of Light like the glaring of a
Candle. It tortures the <hi>Naturalists</hi> to explain
the manner how that vibration causes us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all luminous and bright Objects. Upon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54814:117"/>
what <hi>Hypothesis</hi> soever they proceed, they meet
with inconquerable Difficulties: But at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and in earnest it is no more than this.</p>
            <p>See here the Matter of the <hi>first Element;</hi> it
turns round: And consequently wrestles to get
at a distance from the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> in
which it is; in making that Attempt to deviate
from the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> it forces the
Matter of the <hi>Second Element</hi> to circulate, that
possesses all the Circumference, and shoves and
pushes it every way imaginable, since there is
not a point in the Circle that the Matter of the
<hi>first Element</hi> describes, in its Motion, wherein it
does not strive, to make its escape from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and by Consequence does not press against
the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>second.</hi> Imagine then you and
your Body were in some part of the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and that you cast your
Eyes towards the Centre. There are an abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Lines of the Matter of the <hi>second Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that terminate in the bottom of your
Eye. How comes that to pass? Why the Lines
are driven towards the Circumference, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
forced against the bottom of your
Eye, by the subtil Matter, that is, at the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and is indeavouring to make its <hi>Exit.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus pusht it presses upon the bottom of
your Eye; pressing it in that manner it shakes
the Strings of the Optick Nerve, and from this
quavering follows the perception of the Object;
and this is one of the most curious <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s
of my <hi>Physicks,</hi> where I maintain that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Light consists in that restless indeavour
of the subtil Matter to remove its self from
the Center of the Vortex, whence succeeds
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54814:118"/>
               <figure/>
that pressure which causes the most delicate and
admirable Sensation that we have.</p>
            <p>He then went on in explaining to me all the
Properties of Light, and the Demonstrations
he hath given concerning the Reflection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction
of its Rays. He was very large and
copious upon that Subject: For that piece of his
Philosophy, together with that where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s of the Loadstone, is his
darling and beloved Theam. I shall not descend
to the Particulars of that Discourse, for fear of
wearying my Reader, as also frightning some, to
whom Lines crossing one another with A. B. C.
are as terrible as Magick, and the sight thereof
enough to make them shut the Book, and never
open it after. And this is the Reason I will
make use of them as little as possibly I can.</p>
            <p>He would not for any thing whatever have
forgotten to remark to me those little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>annel'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54814:118"/>
Parts, whose Service is so very necessary to
him, nor the way that they are wrought. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Parts of the <hi>first Element,</hi> which are
made of the <hi>filings</hi> of the <hi>Second,</hi> there are some,
that by reason of their irregular Figure, are not
so rapid as the other. Those of this Nature
easily hook themselves together, and make up
little Bodies larger than the other parts of the
<hi>first Element;</hi> and as in their turning about, they
are often obliged to pass betwixt the Balls of
the <hi>second Element,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb 90.</note> they accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for that Passage, and as they squeeze be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, wrythe themselves into the Shape
of a <hi>Skrew,</hi> or become like little Pillars cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
with three Furrows, or gutterwork'd and
tourn'd as you see the Shell of a Snail. They
are chiefly to be found toward the Poles of the
<hi>Vortex,</hi> having their Determination toward the
Centre. Now whereas some of them enter by
way of the Northern Pole, others by the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern,
whilst the <hi>Vortex</hi> turns upon its <hi>Axis;</hi> it is
apparent to every <hi>Cartesian,</hi> that those which
proceed from the North-Coast must be turned
Shell-wife a different way, from those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the South. And Instance <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
took care to inculcate throughly in me: For it
is principally upon that, the Power and Vertue
of the Loadstone do depend:<note place="margin">Numb. 91.</note> But it shall not
be long, <hi>said he,</hi> before you see some particular
Effect of these little channel'd Parts.</p>
            <p>Take notice, said he, how things go in that
<hi>Star</hi> that's next you. How some of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r'd
Parts that come fromward the <hi>Poles</hi> of
their <hi>Vortex,</hi> mingle themselves with the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Star, and not being able to keep
pace with it in Motion, are thrown out of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54814:119"/>
Star; just as the scummy Parts of a boiling Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
are separated from the other, and rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Liquor. See how they link themselves
to one another, and by that Union lose the
quality of the <hi>first Element,</hi> and take on them
that of the <hi>third.</hi> Upon their gathering and
condensing in a very great quantity, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
they must hinder the action of the <hi>first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
whereby it pushes the <hi>Balls</hi> of the <hi>Second
Element</hi> to the Circumference,<note place="margin">Fig. Seq.</note> and consequently
must interrupt that Motion and Pressure in
which <hi>Light</hi> consists. And now you may see
exactly what those Stains are which you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
discover on the Face of the <hi>Sun</hi> of your
World. They are nothing else but the drossy
and scummy Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in Heaps and expanded on its Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p>Now the wreek and scattering of those Stains
which are still a gathering, and as easily dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,

Whilst <hi>M. Descartes</hi> was thus busied in disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to me all his Mysteries, <hi>Father Mersennus</hi>
and the <hi>old Gentleman</hi> were diverting themselves,
by Vaulting from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> and were

who star'd confusedly, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
out of Countenance, and who now,

us; comprehending not a Syllable all the time,

they saw not so much as a Pins Head of all we
saw in that immense Space: And they were much
surprized to hear us entertain our selves seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
with such idle Fopperies and <hi>Chimera's;</hi>
for such they reckoned all we said, so far as to
believe we meerly designed it to expose and
banter them; and doubtless they had highly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54814:120"/>
resented it, had not <hi>M. Descartes</hi> forestall'd
them, by telling them, separate Spirits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
things only in reference to some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ideas they had formerly been possessed with;
and as they saw no <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>Space</hi> where
we most distinctly behold it, so he himself with
all the Eyes in his Head, was never able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>substan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>intentional Species,</hi> though at the same
time the Peripateticks talkt of them, as Things
they saw as clear as the Noon-day.</p>
            <p>Mean time of these Occurrences, the <hi>old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
in haste, came and acquainted <hi>Descartes,</hi>
That on that Coast he had been on, there were
three or four <hi>Vortexes</hi> that began to jumble and
fall to Loggerheads; and that if he did not
speedily come and part them, there needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more to tear and shatter all his World in
pieces.</p>
            <p>Poor honest old Gentleman, said <hi>M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi>
That which makes him so solicitous for
my World, is one of the finest <hi>Phenomena's</hi>
that can possibly be seen, and by which I'll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
to you how <hi>Comets</hi> are begot in <hi>yours;</hi>
and how, in time, a <hi>fix'd Star</hi> may become a
<hi>Planet.</hi> Let us go and cure him of his Fears.</p>
            <p>When we came there we found <hi>two Stars,</hi>
whose Surface was almost wholly overgrown
with Scurf, and whose <hi>Vortexes</hi> began to be
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain'd and suckt up by those round about them.
If you have read my <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> and my
Treatise concerning Light, says <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
to me, you will easily conclude in what this
little bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tle and disorder ought to end; and I
strange, said he to the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> you should
be frighted at it. Call to mind then what I
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54814:120"/>
there teach, how that which preserves a <hi>Vortex</hi>
in the midst of several others, is that impulse
caus'd by the Matter of the Star in its attempt
to obtain a remove from the Centre towards the
Circumference: For the Star, by that Impulse,
pushing and supporting the Matter of its <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi>
keeps the other Vortexes within their
Bounds, and loses no Ground in the Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of its Circuit. For, we must consider all
these <hi>Vortexes,</hi> as so many <hi>Antagonists</hi> that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to an Inch, and so long as their Forces
are equally match'd, gain no Advantage over
each other; but as soon as one of them is
any ways weakned or disabled, it becomes a
Prey to all the rest, each taking in a part of its
Space, and at last usurping it all. Now when
a <hi>Star</hi> begins to be over-run with this Scurf, and
crusted with a mass of the parts of the <hi>third
Element,</hi> it can no longer push with so much force
as it did before, the Matter of its <hi>Vortex</hi> towards
the Circumference; and then the other that
surround it, and whose Matter is indeavouring
to get as far as possible from its Centre, finding
no longer so much Motion, nor by consequence
so much Resistance, expatiate and stretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out, and oblige the Matter of that impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verisht
<hi>Vortex,</hi> to circuit along with them, and
by little and little each Inrich themselves. In so
much, that some Moments hence, you shall see
those <hi>Vortexes</hi> increase their Circumference with
the Spoils of this poor <hi>Vortex,</hi> till at last they
come to the <hi>Star</hi> it self, which will be made
their Sport: That is to say, it will descend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Center of some one of those <hi>Vortexes,</hi>
there to continue in the quality of a <hi>Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et,</hi> to
turn with that Vortex, and to observe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54814:121"/>
of the conquering <hi>Star:</hi> Or it will becon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
by the Motion that shall be given it,
to bound from <hi>Vortex</hi> to <hi>Vortex,</hi> and to make a
long Pilgrimage in Habit of a <hi>Comet,</hi> until its
Crusts shall break: And then perhaps it will
recover the eminency of a <hi>Star,</hi> and will take
its revenge on some other, by appropriating its
Vortex to its self.</p>
            <p>We waited then some Moments, and saw
happen what <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had foretold; all the
the <hi>Vortex</hi> was drain'd dry, the Matter of one
of the neighbouring <hi>Vortexes</hi> surrounded the
crusted Star, and influencing it with a violent
Motion, carried it clever off: But since that
Star, by reason of its Solidity, that consisted
partly in its Figure, most proper for Motion,
partly in the close Connexion of the Parts of the
third Element, that cover'd it, and the paucity
of its Pores in the Superficies: I say, since that
<hi>Star,</hi> by reason of its solidity, was capable of a
far greater Motion than the Mass of Celestial
Matter that incompass'd it, and carried it along;
having by degrees arriv'd to a mighty Speed,
in the turning of a Hand it gain'd the Brink of
the Circumference of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> and out it flew
amain, and continuing its Motion by the <hi>Tangent</hi>
of the <hi>Circle</hi> it had begun to describe, pass'd on
to another <hi>Vortex,</hi> and from that to another, till

to instruct me, That the Adventure I had seen
at present usually happen'd, and would still from

traverse our <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> and ceasing to be seen
as soon as they entred in another.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Ruin of the <hi>Vortex</hi>
I have been speaking of, there were seven others
that ran the same Risque, and became seven
Comets. Whereupon <hi>Monsieur Descartes</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd:
It is not amiss, in order to your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understanding the Effects that are speedily
to follow, to give Names to the Principal Stars
that are left: We have still a dozen of them,
but we will trouble our Heads at present with
no more then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eight. That then, continued he,
pointing out the greatest <hi>Star</hi> of all, and which
had the greatest <hi>Vortex,</hi> we will call the <hi>Sun;</hi>
that other shall be <hi>Saturn;</hi> let the next on the
Left-hand be <hi>Iupiter;</hi> that on the Right shall be
named <hi>Mars;</hi> that other wee'll name <hi>Earth;</hi>
and the nearest to us of all shall be christned the
<hi>Moon:</hi> Of these two little ones, the one shall
be <hi>Venus</hi> and the other <hi>Mercury.</hi> By and by I
will name the other four. Having for some
Time consider'd the admirable Disposition of
all these <hi>Vortexes,</hi> that, in spite of their Flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
did not at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all mix and incorporate with
one another, a thing no one would believe unless
he saw it, and which cannot be comprehended
but by a <hi>Cartesian</hi> Soul; for no other Philosopher
'till this Day hath been able to conceive it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
We saw <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> begin to be
overspread with the rising Scum, and forthwith
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> with the other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vortexes to get ground prodigiously on those
two Stars, till at last their Heaven or their <hi>Vortex</hi>
being entirely swallow'd up, they fell in with
that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> somewhat near the Centre, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54814:122"/>
began to turn about him, floating in the Matter
of his <hi>Vortex.</hi> The same thing happen'd a
little while after to four petty <hi>Stars,</hi> whose
<hi>Vortexes</hi> border'd upon that of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> where
they were oblig'd to descend, and take the same
Lot therein, as <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in that of <hi>Sol.
M. Descartes</hi> called these four the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
because they represent the four <hi>Planets</hi> that
turn about <hi>Iupiter</hi> in our World. Lastly, the
<hi>Earth</hi> in like manner made herself <hi>Mistress</hi> of the
<hi>Moon,</hi> and obliged her to attend her in quality
of her <hi>Planet;</hi> for that is the Name which is
given to degraded <hi>Stars,</hi> because of their only
Employment that is left; which is, to wander
in the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> and to turn eternally about those
that have rob'd them of their <hi>Vortex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which distinguishes their Condition from
that of <hi>Comets,</hi> is nothing but the Difference
found betwixt the Solidity of one and the
other; for as they are less solid than the <hi>Comets,</hi>
in entring the <hi>Vortex</hi> that receives them, they
are not agitated in their Turning with so strong
and violent a Motion, as to toss themselves out
of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> but swim with the Current of
Celestial Matter in which they are plung'd. In
like manner, the Disproportion of Solidity that is
betwixt many <hi>Planets,</hi> carried in the same <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi>
is the cause that some remain more remote
from the Centre or Star, and others approach
nearer to it; for a <hi>Planet</hi> descends towards the
Centre, as long as the Celestial Matter that's
below it, is better able to mount farther from
the Centre, the one necessarily following the
other, according to the Laws of Motion. Thus,
because <hi>Mercury</hi> was less solid than <hi>Venus,</hi> he
came nearer to the <hi>Sun</hi> than she; and the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54814:122"/>
Matter that's above him, forc'd him to that
descent, because it had more Strength than he
to get at a Distance from the Centre, and it
oblig'd not <hi>Venus</hi> to sink so low, because the
Ballance betwixt it and <hi>Venus</hi> was equally pois'd,
the one having neither more nor less Power
to deviate from the Centre of their Motion than
the other. But as it sometimes fortunes in <hi>our
World,</hi> that <hi>Petty Princes</hi> making War with one
another; after having fought some Time, and
the <hi>Conquerors</hi> as well as the <hi>Conquered</hi> drain'd
themselves of Men and Mony, a common and
powerful Enemy comes thundring upon them,
and devours them all: So here happens a sudden
Revolution in <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s <hi>World,</hi> that reduc'd
<hi>Iupiter</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> to the same Condition they
had reduc'd the other Stars, whose Vortexes
they had demolish'd: Both the one and the other
<figure/>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:54814:123"/>
no less than <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> became <hi>Planets,</hi> and
the Sun, the sole and universal Conqueror, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Vortex over all the Space the other
had possess'd before, and constrain'd them all
to turn about himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Descartes</hi> exemplify'd this Matter by certain
<hi>Whirl-pools</hi> we sometimes see in Rivers, whereof
one <hi>great</hi> one, that often contains in it many
<hi>little</hi> ones, represents the great <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi>
and the <hi>little</hi> ones represent the <hi>Vortexes</hi> of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the <hi>Earth.</hi> Those little Whirl-pools are
carried along by the Motion of the greater, and
turn about its Centre, whilst themselves make
every thing that comes in the Reach of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
suppose Straws, or little Chips, to
turn about their own: Thus the <hi>Earth</hi> carries
round the <hi>Moon</hi> in her <hi>Vortex,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites</hi>
in <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having seen so many fine diverting Sights,
and so near a Resemblance of this <hi>little World,</hi>
with our <hi>great one,</hi> our Curiosity tempted us to
a more particular Enquiry, and thorough In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
in all Things that concern'd the Planet
representing the Earth, which we inhabit. But
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> told us, That in case we would see
all Things in Order and Succession, as they should
be, it would be several Hours Work to put that
<hi>Planet</hi> in the Posture and Circumstances our Earth
is at present in, and besides we should see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more occur in it than he had observ'd, in
the <hi>fourth Part</hi> of his <hi>Book of Principles,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the Formation of the <hi>Earth,</hi> as he at
that Time conceiv'd it. Besides that <hi>Subtil
Matter,</hi> whereof it was compos'd, whilst it
was yet a <hi>Star,</hi> which Matter is lodged in the
<hi>Centre,</hi> and besides that <hi>Shell,</hi> infinitely hard,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54814:123"/>
that dams it in, I conceiv'd, <hi>said he,</hi> a kind of
<hi>third Region,</hi> constituted of the Parts of the <hi>third
Element,</hi> not very strictly united: And I yet
farther divided that <hi>third Region</hi> into <hi>three Stories,</hi>
before I imagin'd to my self the Earth in the
Capacity it has at present, and in which I am
going to put my own.

               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>lowest</hi> of these <hi>Subordinations</hi> was, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my Position, an Arch of very Solid and
Heavy Matter, and there I place the origin of
<hi>Metals.</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> which I rang'd above it,
was a Liquid Body, constituted of the Parts of
the <hi>third Element,</hi> pretty long, very flexible and
pliant, as it were little Eels, temper'd with an
abundance of the Parts of the <hi>second Element,</hi>
which was nothing else but what we usually call
<hi>Water.</hi> Lastly, above all this I suppos'd a <hi>third
Vault,</hi> made of the most clinging and craggy
Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> whose sensible Parts
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54814:124"/>
were only Stones, Sand, Clay and Mud, and
which was very porous: And this is the outward
Surface of the Earth, on part of which tread
Mortal Men.</p>
            <p>Next, I explain'd, how in that <hi>upper</hi> Vault
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> by its being expos'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Beating of the <hi>two first Elements</hi> against it,
that rush'd through its Pores with Violence;
there were made a World of Crevices and
Chinks, which being in Time inlarg'd by little
and little, its structure at last, all of a sudden
fail'd, and broke in Pieces; whereupon its
Ruins fell in part of the Water below it, of
the <hi>second Story,</hi> and forc'd it above them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was less weighty; and that's the <hi>Water</hi>
which constitutes the <hi>Seas.</hi> Some Parts of the
Vault were still upheld, and remain'd suspended,
as it often happens in the downfal of great Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
these were not drown'd, and they were
these that made the <hi>Plains,</hi> and level Parts of
the Earth. Lastly, some Pieces, as they fell,
were shelv'd and supported against one another,
and raised above the rest; and thus came the
Inequalities of the Earth, which we call
<hi>Mountains.</hi>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:54814:124"/>
You plainly see then, said <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> that
to shew you the Train of all these Things would
demand a great deal of Time: But the Hour of
your Departure hastens on, I remit you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to my Book for Satisfaction in all those Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
I am going now to make an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all those Motions, and to shew you in
as little Time as we are speaking on't, this
Earth, exactly like yours, with Mountains, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
Plains and Seas. No sooner said than
done: He falls to determining the Motion of an
infinite Number of those long and flexible Parts
of the <hi>third Element,</hi> and agitating them, by
playing among them the Parts of the <hi>second,</hi> in
the several Places, where he had heap'd them
to gether, we saw presently a kind of Sea
diffuse itself over the Face of the Earth; it was
a less Trouble to him to raise Mountains, by only
amassing together an abundance of the <hi>branchy</hi>
Parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> and causing them to
link and graple with each other, whereby there
stood in many Places great and mighty Piles,
nothing differing from our <hi>Mountains.</hi> That
Earth look'd very bare and naked, without
Trees, without Herbs, without Flowers; for
to produce all those Things that are the greatest
Ornaments to our Earth, was a Business that
would take up longer Time.</p>
            <p>This done, he employ'd the rest of the Time
that we staid with him, in the consideration
chiefly of two Things: First, of the <hi>Gravity,</hi> or
rather of the Motion of Bodies we call Heavy,
towards the Centre. And secondly, of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flowing</hi> of the Sea. He
began with the first, and explained it at this
rate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54814:125"/>
Take notice, <hi>said he,</hi> that this Earth turns
upon its <hi>Axis</hi> in its <hi>Vortex;</hi> it has not that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Moving of itself, but it is carried about
by the Stream of the Celestial Matter that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds
it, which whirling with a more rapid
Motion than the <hi>Earth,</hi> spends the overplus in
making other Motions in all Parts, and especially
in squeezing and pressing Terrestrial Bodies
against the Earth; a Pressure so necessary, that
take it but away the whole Earth would crumble
all in Pieces, and all the Men and Animals on the
Surface of the Earth of your World would be
hurl'd into the Fluid Space, according to my
grand Principle of Motion; that every Body
that turns circularly, as does the Earth with all
that is upon it flies fromward the Centre of its
Motion, if not prevented by the other Bodies
that keep it in, as does the Pression of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Matter.
<figure>
                  <head>S the Sun. T the Earth. AB CD the little
Vortex of the Earth. NA CZ the great Orb

               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:54814:125"/>
And it is for the same Reason, that a Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Body forc'd into the Air, is oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
towards the Centre of the Earth, because
it has less Force to digress from the Centre than
has the Mass of Air, which it ought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to get into its Place: And the Reason
why it hath less Force to digress from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
is, because it contains much more Matter of
the <hi>third Element,</hi> and much less of the <hi>second</hi>
than the Mass of Air equal to it in Bigness.
Now the Matter of the <hi>third Element</hi> is dull and
more unactive, and unable to get rid of the
Centre, than the Matter of the <hi>second,</hi> it must
therefore descend. Your <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Quality,
<hi>continu'd he,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Gassendi</hi>'s Chains
made of link'd <hi>Atoms,</hi> are not worth a Straw,
in comparison of what I say, and with that
he cast a Stone on high, to shew us by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
the Truth of what he had been
Teaching.</p>
            <p>The next thing was the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of
the Sea: For the better understanding this, he
bade us first conceive, That the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the
Earth was of an oval Figure. Secondly, That
that of its <hi>Diameters,</hi> in which was the <hi>Moon,</hi>
both in the <hi>New</hi> and in the <hi>Full,</hi> was the least
of them all. Thirdly, That the Centre of the
<hi>Earth</hi> was not the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> but was
a little distant from it, 'cause of the <hi>Moon,</hi> that
in whatever Part of the Circumference she was
found, made the Space betwixt her and the
Earth more strait; and by consequence hindred
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54814:126"/>
the Celestial Matter from flowing in so free a
Course betwixt
<figure>
                  <head>1 The Figure of the Vortex of the Earth.</head>
               </figure>
them; and hence it follows, That the <hi>Earth,</hi>
whose Place and Station, is no otherwise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
than by the Equality of Opposition, that
presses it on every Side, ought to recoil a little
towards that part of the <hi>Vortex</hi> that is opposite
to the <hi>Moon.</hi> Fourthly, Whereas the Celestial
Matter, that circuits with far greater Speed than
the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> must find the Passage that
lies betwixt them very narrow, in comparison
of that Liberty and Room it had before, it must
inevitably flow more rapidly in that Place, and
at once press more violently upon the Air and
Water: And to conclude, there ought to be an
almost equal Pressure in the opposite Part of the
<hi>Vortex,</hi> by the same reason of that Recoiling of
the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:54814:126"/>
He made us forthwith acknowledg the Truth
of all those Principles and Effects that naturally
follow them; for upon his placing the <hi>Moon</hi>
perpendicular to the <hi>Equator</hi> of the Earth, we
immediately saw first the Sea press'd by that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to sink lower, and its Waters thus press'd
and crowded hurry towards the Poles, and
spread themselves successively on the Shores,
proportionably to their Distance from the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
2. The Terrestrial Globe rowling on his
Axle from West to East, we beheld the Pressure
of the Moon to light on several Places after one
another, according to the Succession of <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
3. That successive Pressure of the different
Parts of the Sea had this necessary effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
to cause it to swell and fall in several Places,
according to the plain and evident Rules of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
which gave us a most exquisite and natural
Idea of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, consisting
in this, that by how much it is mounted, by so
much it is depress'd, and as often as it mounts in
one Place it is depress'd in another; all these
Motions going on regularly after each other,
and being set, and punctual, as to Space of
Time.</p>
            <p>Again, since the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Vortex,</hi>
wherein this little <hi>Moon</hi> must necessarily be in its
Conjunctions and Oppositions, was the least of
all; and on the contrary, that in which it would
be found in its <hi>quadratures</hi> the greatest, it was
evident to us, that the depression and sinking of
the Waters must be far greater in the <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and <hi>Oppositions</hi> than in the <hi>Quadratures,</hi> and
consequently that the Sea must flow with greater
impetuosity and Vehemence towards the Shore,
or which is all one, that the Tides be far greater
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54814:127"/>
in the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moons than at any other
Time, and in the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> than in the <hi>Solstices,</hi>
as it really happens in our World.</p>
            <p>He next observ'd to us the particular Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's
of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux,</hi> founded on the
same Principles, and minded us especially of the
Reason, why we never see any Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Lakes and Ponds, let them be never so
great, unless they have some Communication
with the Sea: For if, said he, those Lakes and
Ponds be beyond the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> they are never at
all press'd by the <hi>Moon;</hi> and for those that are
under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> within the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> they
take not up a compass of Ground, enough to
cause that one Side of their <hi>Superficies</hi> should be
more press'd than the other by the <hi>Globe</hi> of the
<hi>Moon.</hi> Now that Inequality of Pressure is the
only cause of that Vicissitude of Motions, which
we call the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea.</p>
            <p>I was wonderfully taken with this Explication,
and that way of solving the Flux and Reflux is
so handsome, that those that demonstrate to
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> cannot have a <hi>Vortex,</hi> at
least an Oval one, ought upon that Consideration
to shew themselves a little merciful to him: <hi>But
these Philosophers are a very ungentile and brutish sort
of Creatures, and know not what it is to be generous
towards their Adversaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mean while all the other Motions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in the little World with all possible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness,
<hi>Mercury, Venus, Mars,</hi> and the rest of
the Planets, having once obtain'd their Post in
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Sun, were extraordinary pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to their Courses. He began to exhale Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,
and to form them into Clouds, about the
little <hi>Earth.</hi> To say no more, I was charm'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54814:127"/>
with all these Prodigies: But we must now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
on our Departure, and 'twas high Time
we were a going. It was well-nigh four and
twenty Hours since we left the Earth, and
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> who, as I have noted before, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd
of their Conduct that deserted their
Body before <hi>Death,</hi> and the Orders of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Being,</hi> had dismiss'd them, advis'd us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to defer the entire Satisfaction of our Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
till another Time. I made him a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Acknowledgment and Resentment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
assuring him of the vast Esteem I had
both for his Person and Doctrin. I beg'd the
Favour of proposing to him the Scruples that
might occur hereafter upon his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I had an Opportunity of sending a Letter
to him. He express'd on his Part a World of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for me, exhorted me to a most sincere and
hearty Love of Truth, and presented me with
two <hi>Hyperbolical Glasses</hi> to make me a Perspective
Glass, wherewith, he assur'd me, I might stand
on the Earth, and discover all the Curiosities of
the <hi>Globe of the Moon,</hi> and the Animals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,<note place="margin">Let. de Descart.</note>
if there were any. He hath demonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his <hi>Dioptricks</hi> the Excellence of that Figure,
for the Glasses of a <hi>Telescope,</hi> beyond all other.
He endeavour'd to have them made in <hi>Holland,</hi>
and contriv'd an Engine for that Purpose, but
he could not find Artists capable of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Design and his Idea with that Exactness
as was necessary. He brought us on our Way as
far as the <hi>second Heaven,</hi> which is that of Stars,
and left <hi>Father Mersennus</hi> with us, to conduct us
Home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:54814:128"/>
Some distance from the Stars, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
meeting some Philosophers of their
Country and Acquaintance, desir'd us not to
take it amiss, that they accompanied them, and
took their Leave, but indifferently satisfied
with their <hi>Voyage</hi> and Negotiation. Seeing we
were in great haste, we stay'd no where on the
Road, and avoided all Harangues and Disputes
with every Person whatsoever, though we met
in diverse Places very many Spirits, that would
willingly have joyn'd Discourse with us. <hi>Father
Mersennus,</hi> as we pass'd along, made me observe
the Disposition of the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> and the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the different Elements that compos'd
them, and especially the Balls of the second Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that I had no Apprehension of so long as
I was stock'd with <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Notions, but that
I saw take up the greatest part of the Universe,
since I was turned <hi>Cartesian.</hi> In less than six
Hours Time we arriv'd at my House, where
there fell out a most unfortunate Disaster; for
in pitching with a most violent descent, and not
considering the Glasses I had with me, as I
pass'd athwart my Chamber-wall, and my Glasses
in <hi>Bodily Quality,</hi> could not enter, they were
stopt, and dash'd in a thousand Pieces, by the
reason of the unaccountable Swiftness wherewith
they flew against the Stones; and thus I was
depriv'd of the Pleasure of making the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had warranted, of
seeing from our Earth all the Occurrences in the
<hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> as distinctly as if I was perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
there.</p>
            <p>I found my Body somewhat fainty and very
feverish, by the reason of a Fast of above thirty

of her Ideas; and complimented her self with
the honourable new Character of <hi>Cartesian,</hi>
wherewith I began to be distinguisht amongst
the Learned. I found my self immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for the Humour and Spirit of that Tribe
of Philosophers; and could not mention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54814:129"/>
with empty and confus'd Ideas, and fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to entertain the vanity of a Pedant.
<hi>Descartes</hi> was the first, and indeed the only Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
the World has ever known; the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
in respect of him were mere Children Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Legendaries. Being invited some days
after to a <hi>Thesis</hi> of Philosophy, it cannot be
imagin'd what Violence it was to me to resolve
to go. I could not forbear gaping all the while
I staid, looking down from the exaltation of
my Soul, with pity on all I heard. One of the
first things I did, was the degrading the <hi>Suarez's,
Fonseca's, Smigletius's</hi> and <hi>Goudin's,</hi> &amp;c. in my
Library, cashiering them of the considerable
Post they held, and abandoning them to a
mouldy Chest of Lumber, there to lye at the
Mercy of the Dust and Vermin, to be succeeded
by <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> bound in a fine Turky Cover,
and all his illustrious Disciples.</p>
            <p>Before my Conversion to <hi>Cartesianism,</hi> I was
so pitiful and Tender-hearted, that I could not
so much as see a Chicken kill'd: But since I was
once persuaded that Beasts were destitute both
of Knowledg and Sense, scarce a Dog in all the
Town, wherein I was, could escape me, for the
making <hi>Anatomical</hi> Dissections, wherein I my
self was <hi>Operator,</hi> without the least inkling of
Compassion or Remorse; as also at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Disputes and Assemblies of the
Learn'd, which I thought good to keep at my
House, for the inhancing and propagating the
Doctrin of my <hi>Master</hi> in the Country; the first
Oration I made before them, was an Invective
against the Ignorance and Injustice of that Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithstanding, I must ingenuously confess,
that as resolv'd a <hi>Cartesian</hi> as I was, I was not
insensible of some weighty Scruples, the more
Ingenious sort rais'd in me, in our Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I perceived also that the farther I went,
the more they increas'd, and if <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
does not settle and compose the Fluctuation of
my Mind, by a just and clever Answer to the
Letter I have wrote him on that Subject, I have
great Fears the Traces of my Brain will change,

Current. This is the Copy of the Letter I sent

from you, during that transitory Stay I
made in your Parts of the <hi>highest Heavens:</hi> The

by those extraordinary Favours you have heap'd
upon me.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Father <hi>Mersennus,</hi> who readily
condescended to the trouble of this Letter, will
inform you more at large, both what my real
Sentiments are of your Person and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.
My Behaviour, since my return, hath
throughly convinc'd him, that there never was
a Disciple more Zealous than my self, for the
Honour, Growth and Advancement of the Sect.
In less than a Month, since my Arrival from
your World, I have cast Terror and Confusion
in the Face of <hi>Peripateticism</hi> throughout the Land.
I have inspirited with new Life and Courage,
those few drooping <hi>Cartesians</hi> that remain'd,
but liv'd in Obscurity and Silence, solacing
themselves with the private enjoyment of Truth,
but were very remiss in promoting her Interest
there, where she had been but ill receiv'd. Twice
every Week I hold publick Disputes at my
House, and indeavour therein, as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to give Vogue and Reputation to your
Doctrin; I have already made some Conquests
among the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> many whereof appear
there, and excepting two or three, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governably
headstrong and conceited, they will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54814:131"/>
all be my own, as soon as I shall have answer'd
some pretty substantial Objections, they have
propos'd against several Points of your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
The chief of which respect the general
<hi>Construction</hi> of your <hi>World.</hi> And whereas in
that Affair, they pretend to destroy your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
by your own Principles, and some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them are Men of Parts, that give a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and probable turn to their Arguments, in
so much that I have sometimes been put to't to
find the Fallacy, I thought my self oblig'd to
have recourse unto the Oracle, and that I could
do nothing better than consult <hi>You</hi> your self, as
you gave me Permission, and intreat you to
communicate your Thoughts, as soon as possible
thereupon. A Voyage from the <hi>third Heaven</hi> to
this Place, is no great business for your little
<hi>Moor.</hi> Thus then these Gentlemen, to my best
Remembrance, fell to Work.</p>
               <p>They began by proposing two or three trite
Arguments, daily made use of in the <hi>Desks,</hi> to
confute your <hi>System;</hi> and to shew that it is a
meer <hi>Chymera,</hi> and not to be suffered as a simple
<hi>Hypothesis,</hi> should they grant the Principles you
your self lay down. <hi>M. Descartes (say they)</hi>
supposes, first, That God creates Matter; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That he divides it into infinite little
cubical Parts, and lastly, determining several
great Portions of this Matter, he puts them in
a circular Motion, and at once makes the little
cubical Parts, of which the great Portions,
call'd by him <hi>Vortexes,</hi> are compos'd, to turn
about their proper Center. But it is impossible,
they adjoyn, to conceive the <hi>division</hi> and <hi>motion</hi>
of Matter upon his Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:54814:131"/>
For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as to the <hi>division,</hi> it can be conceiv'd but
by one of these two ways; either by supposing
betwixt the Parts divided some empty Spaces,
or imagining those Intervals fill'd up with some
Bodies or Matter of a different Nature from the
Parts. And thus though Nature every where
is full, we conceive four Dice laid close to one
another, as four distinct cubical Bodies; for
though there is nothing of a void betwixt them,
we yet perceive a little Interval fill'd with Air,
that hinders our Conception of them, as of one
single Body: But by the Principles of <hi>Cartesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi>
we can conceive it neither one way nor
the other. For we must not suppose a Vacuity
betwixt the Parts divided, since a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
thrown out of that System. Nor is it
easier to conceive a Body of a different Nature,
since the distinction of Bodies, according to the
Author of the System, is not to be conceiv'd,
till after the agitation and motion of Matter.
That division therefore is an Absurdity.</p>
               <p>As to the business of <hi>Motion,</hi> that's in a worse
Case still; for how is it possible to conceive that
all those cubical Parts, that are universally hard,
impenetrable and incapable of Compression,
should turn about their Center, and break in
pieces, unless they find or make a <hi>Vacuum?</hi> For
the diminutiveness of them will not help us
out, since let them be as little as you can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, they are still hard and impenetrable
as Adamant, and all combine together to desist
the Motion of each Particular. That <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
therefore is indefensible, and <hi>Descartes</hi> his very
first Supposition is deny'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:54814:132"/>
These, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> were the first Passes these
Gentlemen made at me, the first Blows I was
to ward off, in the Defence of the <hi>System of
your World.</hi> They had been taken out of the
Books of very Ingenious Men; and whereas
the Gentlemen, your Disciples (as if it was
their Maxim and their Method, never to be put
out of their own Road, which is barely to give
an Exposition and a Proof of their Doctrin)
trouble not much their Heads with Objections
that are made them, since they are not oblig'd
to the formal Answer of the Desk; these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pass'd for unanswerable, and such as at
the very entrance of Dispute baffled the <hi>Cartesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
But the more impregnable my Adversaries
appear'd in so good Accoutrements and Arms,
the more my Honour was advanc'd in disabling
and disarming them.</p>
               <p>As I had diligently read your Works, and
above all, the Book of Principles, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled,
a <hi>Treatise concerning Light,</hi> or <hi>M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s
<hi>World,</hi> I answer'd the first Argument, by
pleading a false Indictment charg'd on you, for
making a distinction of Instants betwixt the
<hi>Division</hi> and the <hi>Motion,</hi> as if you had held that
God divided the Matter in one Instant, and
mov'd it another: I said you never suppos'd
that Matter was divided before its Motion:
That the manner of proposing your System in
the <hi>third Part</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> suppos'd no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
and that in the <hi>Treatise of Light,</hi> where
you describ'd the formation of the World, you
said positively the contrary; advertising your
Reader, That that Division of Matter consisted
not in God's separating its Parts, so as to leave
a Vacuity betwixt them; but that all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54814:132"/>
you suppos'd God made in them,
consisted in the diversity of Motions that he
gave, causing some from the first instant of their
Creation to commence their Motion one way,
some another; so that in this Instance Division
and Motion were the same Thing, or at farthest
one could not be without the other. That you
would be as forward as any of them to confess,
That nothing was more absurd, in reference to
your other Principles, than to suppose the Parts
of Matter still and in Repose, and yet divided,
since, according to you, the Union of the Parts
of a solid Body, such as Matter must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
before its Motion, consists in that Rest
they enjoy by one another: And farther, that
it was full as easie to comprehend how Division
was made by Motion, and yet cotemporary with
the same Motion, as to understand how I can
tear a Sheet of Paper, by dividing it in two half
Sheets, one whereof I hand towards the East,
the other towards the West. I hereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the Books that I had cited, and shew'd
them the very Places in dispute: They were
convinc'd by plain Matter of Fact, and had no
more to urge against it.</p>
               <p>But we had not so soon done with the Motion
of Matter; we must necessary still dispute, tho'
very calmly, without the least Passion or wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
since the generality of those I had to deal
with were well bred, honest Gentlemen, that
would submit to Reason. The Question was, to
explain, how the Parts of Matter, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
so closely press'd against one another, as
not the least Interval was left betwixt them,
throughout the Mass, and which we also suppos'd
solid, from a settl'd Rest could skip into Motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:54814:133"/>
After these Gentlemen had copiously discours'd
upon the Subject, I ask'd them, If as stanch <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi>
as they were, they were throughly
convinc'd, that the Fludity of Water, for
instance, Was an <hi>absolute Quality,</hi> that when it
was congeal'd it became Solid, by an <hi>absoute Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi>
call'd Solidity, and that when it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
it became Liquid by an <hi>absolute Accident</hi>
call'd Fluidity? That one of these Accidents
made Lead run when heated, and the other
fixed it when it began to cool? And on the
contrary, if having read the Delicate Natural
and Intelligible Way of <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Nature of Fluidity, and the Properties
of Fluid Bodies, by the Motion of the insensible
Parts of those Bodies (a Motion which the
meer Dissolution of Salts in common Water, and
of Metals in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> evidently demonstrates)
they were not at least come over to us in that
Point? The most of them answered, That as
they were persuaded there was no doing without
<hi>absolute Qualities,</hi> in the explication of an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Phenomenas,</hi> that which they could most
easily part with was <hi>Fluidity,</hi> and that they
would not quarrel with me thereupon.</p>
               <p>This suppos'd (<hi>said I</hi>) Gentlemen, you
shall be speedily satisfied, or more perplex'd
than <hi>M. Descartes;</hi> for in short, in your own
<hi>System,</hi> the World is full, there's an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> through the whole: Motion,
notwithstanding, both is and does continue, the
Sensible and Insensible Parts of Bodies are mov'd,
nor does their Hardness and Impenetrability stop
their Progress. Why may not <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s
Matter, that is no more impenetrable than yours,
enjoy the same Priviledg and Charter? Why
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54814:133"/>
must his Motion be more impossible? both you
and us suppose the self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> same Thing, and we
have no more to do than defend our selves
against the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who think they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
by Motion, the Necessity of their little
insensible Vacuities interspers'd throughout all
Bodies. Their pretended Domonstration amounts
to this; To the end a Body may move, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it disturb another Body from its Place:
That other cannot stir, because it has not where
to go, if all is full: Therefore Motion will be
impossible, if there is no Receptacle or a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
On the other Hand, supposing a <hi>Vacuum</hi> among
Bodies, they may be compress'd in lesser Room,
and consequently may make Way for such as
press against them; and thus Motion will be
made. This is a meer Fallacy of theirs, which
both you and we can easily unriddle, by only
telling the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> That to conceive how
<hi>Motion</hi> is perform'd without a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> we need
only understand, That a Body is never mov'd
alone, but that in the same Instant one Body
quits its Place, another crowds in and takes it:
And when I conceive one Body may in the same
Moment take the Place another Body leaves, I
perfectly conceive Motion, for there lies all the
Mystery.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Peripateticks</hi> seemed surpriz'd to see me
come over them thus readily, with so neat a
Conclusion, drawn from a Principle they had so
freely granted me, and doubtless repented them
of their Condescention: But I proceeded, by
telling them, I scorned to take an Advantage
over them from their Courtesie, though they
were oblig'd to it by the Evidence of the Truth,
and I was unwilling they should reproach me,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54814:134"/>
as perhaps they did already in their Hearts, for
having us'd Surprize, and abus'd their good
Nature to insnare them; and therefore I would
endeavour by their own Principles to enforce to
them, at least the Probability of the Truth I was
defending.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen (<hi>said I</hi>) there are Prejudices in
the Case that we are upon, proceeding from the
Imagination more than Reason: We imagine,
in the first Place, That a Body which we fancy
in the midst of the Matter of the World, is far
more press'd, if we suppose that Matter Solid,
than it would be upon Supposition it were Fluid,
which is manifestly false: For if the World be full,
whether with Solid Matter or with Fluid, there
is neither more nor less of it, but an equal
Quantity in each Supposition; and consequently
its Parts are no more close and crowded, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it Hard than if you suppose it Fluid.
Again, we are apt to believe, That a Body,
whilst it is Liquid, is ever ready to give way to
the Motion of another Body; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
whilst 'tis Solid, it is incapable of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
if incompassed with other Solid Bodies.
The first is prov'd evidently false, by a very
common Experiment: Fill a Glass Bottle with
Water, whose Neck is long and slender, then
turn the Mouth of it downwards, placing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
upright, the Water by its own
Weight is forc'd towards the Earth, it meets
no other Body in its Way but Air, that is still
more Liquid than it self; yet notwithstanding
the Gravity and Propensity of the Water to put
itself in Motion, notwithstanding the Fluidity of
the Air that is below it, its Motion is impossible,
and the Air makes as great an Opposition as could
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54814:134"/>
a Solid Body, wherewith you should have firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stopt the Orifice of the Bottle: What is it
then that thus obstructs the Motion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
'Tis the Air and Water's being in such a
Situation, as no Tendency or Attempt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of the Water can determine the Air, or
any other Body, to come and fill its Place in the
same instant that it leaves it: For as soon as it
can, that is to say, as soon as you shall incline
the Bottle a little Side-ways, and consequently
make Way for a little Line of Air, to wind it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in by the Side of the Water, the Motion
will follow proportionably to the Space that the
Air shall fill. We must not then suppose that a
Liquid Body is ever disposed to yield to the
Motion of other Bodies: Nor ought we more
to imagine, that when a Body is Solid, and
surrounded with other Solid Bodies, it never
is inclinable to be mov'd, which I thus prove.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose an hollow Globe perfectly full,
partly with Water, and partly with a vast many
little solid Bodies, of every Make and Figure,
dispers'd all over this Mass of Water. Let us
conceive all these Bodies settled and at rest; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Water fills all the Spaces betwixt
these little Bodies, we imagine the Parts of this
Water of all sorts of Figures, as are the Spaces
which they fill. Thus we conceive in those Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
your little <hi>Globes</hi> of Water, little <hi>Triangles,</hi>
little <hi>Cubes,</hi> little <hi>Hexagons,</hi> &amp;c. Let us suppose
now, that Water and all those little Bodies put in
Motion.</p>
               <p>Making then Reflection on the Figure of the
Parts of this Water, before the Motion, we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
conceive an Alteration in all these Figures,
in the instant of Motion; that is to say, the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54814:135"/>
little <hi>Globes</hi> of Water are divided in two <hi>half-Globes,</hi>
the <hi>Cubes</hi> of Water lose their <hi>Angles,</hi> and
so on. Of these little Parts, whether Solid or
Liquid, some receive more Motion, some less,
and briefly all so determine one another, as not
the least empty Space is left, but upon one's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of a Place another repossesses it in the
very instant: And all this is easily perform'd
by the proneness of the watery Parts to break
and disengage themselves from one another.
Thus in the first instant of the Motion, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that there happen'd a Change of infinite Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures;
that this Change was made only by the
Fraction or Separation of the Parts; that that
Fraction was occasion'd by the Motion, and that
the Motion was impossible without that Fraction:
That the Impulse that serv'd to put these Bodies
in Motion, was the Cause of both the Motion
and Fraction: That the Fraction of a Part was
caused immediately, whether by one of the Solid
Bodies, or by another part of the Water; for
instance, the Angle of a Cube was no otherwise
separated from the rest of the Mass, or any other
Part to which it was joyn'd, than by another
part that slipt in betwixt them both, or so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
seiz'd its Place, as to fit it to an Hair;
and finally that nothing could prevent the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Fraction of the Parts, except such a
Situation among themselves, as rendered it
impossible for one Part to take the Place of
another in the Moment of Desertion; For
all being full before the Motion, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the Motion all remain full still.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose at present, all this Water and
all these little Bodies restated in the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they were in before the Motion: And let
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54814:135"/>
us conceive instead of the parts of Water, that
possess'd all the Intervals betwixt the solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
some other solid Bodies that precisely take
up the same Space the Watry parts took up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Or let us only suppose the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd,
but without any diminution or augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of its Mass. Let us farther suppose,
that God made an attempt to move this Matter;
and that he indeavour'd at once to divide all its
parts exactly in the same manner as the parts of
Water, whose place it fills, were divided in the
instant of their Motion. I suppose not any
Motion yet, but only an Effort for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it, and there's no Contradiction in that
Effort: But I maintain, that from that Effort
or Attempt, Motion and Fraction must inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follow: And thus I argue.</p>
               <p>From that Attempt which I suppose, Motion
and Fraction must needs follow, if nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
But nothing hinders: For the disposition
to Motion and to Fraction is the same in this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
wherein I suppose nothing but <hi>solid</hi>
Bodies, as it was in the foregoing, wherein I
suppose <hi>liquid</hi> Bodies mixt with <hi>solid</hi> ones; and
if the repugnancy to Motion and to Fraction,
which some imagine in the latter, be invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
it would be invincible in the former
too.</p>
               <p>For if in the first <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>liquid</hi> Bodies
mingled with <hi>solid</hi> ones, we imagine the parts
so crowded and determin'd, as that one going
to move another is unable to gain its place, in
the same instant we imagine that the Motion
and Fraction of parts can never be: As it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in the Experiment of the Bottle before
mentioned: Because an absolute fulness being
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54814:136"/>
suppos'd, all the parts combine in the resistance
of the Motion of each Particular: But whilst
we conceive the parts of this Matter so push'd
and determin'd, that supposing one to move,
another in the same Instant takes its place, and
another the place of that; thus we conceive
Motion and Fraction infallibly must follow the
Impulsion. But in the second <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>solid</hi>
Bodies, supposing God to force and determine the
parts of those <hi>Bodies</hi> precisely in the same manner,
as the Parts of Water had been determin'd in
the first <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> at the first instant of Motion
and Fraction; it is plain, that in case one move,
another must instantly take its place, since it is
exactly driven and determined, as the parts of
Water was that took that place. Therefore
Motion must follow in the second <hi>Hypothesis</hi> as
in the first.</p>
               <p>All the difference lyes in this, that the parts
of Water being with the greatest ease imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
divided, but a very inconsiderable force is
required to move them; and the parts of solid
Bodies being more difficult to be divided, a far
greater impulse would be required to do it:
But <hi>M. Descartes</hi> has liberty, if he pleases, to
suppose this Infinte; and that resistance which
God would find, would not be of all the parts
in general, against the division of each in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
a resistance we find insurmountable in
Plenitute that's fluid: But would only be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of each part against its own Division,
which we can most distinctly conceive not to
come up to invincible.</p>
               <p>In a word, the Motion and Division of solid
Bodies is possible <hi>in Pleno,</hi> whilst we conceive the
different parts of these same Bodies push'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54814:136"/>
all parts imaginable of the Space, and so
determin'd that upon one's Desertion of a place
another immediately fills it: For without this
Proviso, Motion is impossible even in Fluids,
and with it, it is necessary though in solid Bodies.</p>
               <p>Although, said I unto them, this Explication
seems to me a true Demonstration, yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to recommend it unto you as such. I
am satisfied if it only staggers your Opinion of
the certainty of the contrary Arguments, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
made use of in this matter; and I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not but, that after you have considered it
with Attention, you will grant me more than at
present I demand.</p>
               <p>In effect my <hi>Academicks</hi> seem'd well enough
satisfy'd with what I said; scarce above one
Scruple more stuck by them proceeding from a
Supposal of theirs, that in the first Instant of
division you gave a <hi>cubical</hi> Figure to all the parts
of Matter. A Circumstance that still blunted
their Imagination. To this I answer'd, that
would they but reflect on what I had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
to them, they would clearly perceive
that Circumstance made no particular Difficulty;
but throughly to dispossess them of all uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I assur'd them, you never had made that
Supposition, as your own Words might easily
convince them; that in your <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi>
you suppose no more than this, That all the parts
of Matter were not <hi>Spherical;</hi> and that in your
Discourse of <hi>Light,</hi> you give them all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Figures: I farther shew'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them the places,
and brought them to confess the little Honesty
or Exactness of some Authors, who thus adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Exposition of your Doctrin to their
Phancy, and the way that lay most advantagious
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54814:137"/>
to attack you in. Lastly, in two or three
Words I gave them your own Thoughts and
Sense thereupon, which I always took to be the
same with this, <hi>viz.</hi> That God in the first agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and division of Matter, reduc'd it into all
kind of Figures, which he forc'd and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
every way towards all sides of the Space:
That he thereby made a liquid Body; great
Portions whereof he after took to move them
circularly and make <hi>Vortexes,</hi> wherein the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the insensible parts that constitute
them, turn'd round about their Centre; that by
this Motion there was made a continual change
in the parts of Matter, some losing their Angles,
others uniting and linking themselves to one
another. That I, after you, believ'd the same
thing happen'd every moment among the insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
parts of all liquid Bodies; and thence it
was that you infer'd the Existence and Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of your three Elements. I flatter my self
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> you will not be much dissatisfy'd at
my Answers, and that you will acknowledg that
how far soever I am behind-hand with the rest
of your <hi>Disciples</hi> in Parts and Penetration, there
are but few that exceed me in the Attention you
desire your Readers to bring with them in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
on your Books, and Application requisite
before they pass their Judgment, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before they venture to oppose them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them.</p>
               <p>But to persue in giving you the Account of
my Conferences: This I have been mentioning
had two Effects. The first was to break a little
our <hi>Peripateticks</hi> of that mischievous Opinion,
they had admitted of your Doctrin, which they
had till then regarded as full of Contradictions
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54814:137"/>
and Absurdities, absolutely incapable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and as a System that undermin'd it self.
The other was, to cause two or three of the
most subtil and discerning of them, to apply
themselves closely to the reading and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your Books; whereby they have found
Difficulties in earnest, that seem to me to be
truly so, and upon which, as I at first observ'd to
you, I was forc'd to make my Appeal to you
your self. For I must confess that as Haughty
as I was, upon my first Success, I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to such a Maze, as makes your Light and
Assistance necessary to extricate me the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce.</p>
               <p>'Tis now a Fortnight that these Gentlemen
have desisted to urge any thing against your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin;
and three or four Conferences in the
<hi>Interim</hi> have pass'd in the explaining your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and resolving some Questions they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to me, upon several particular Passages
of your Books, of which they thought, at
least pretended that they thought, they did not
rightly take the meaning. This was only a
Stratagem they made use of to trapan me. I
was well aware of that petty Conspiracy, which
doubtless would have given me some disturbance,
having to deal with Men of admirable Sense,
had not the goodness of the Cause I manag'd,
bore up my Courage and Resolution. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
two Days since they brav'd it at an high
rate; and promising or threatning in a short
time, to confute the greatest part of your <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks</hi>
and your <hi>Physicks,</hi> they told me they
would immediately fall aboard the System of
your <hi>Vortexes:</hi> That that was to attack you in
the main part; and they question'd not but
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54814:138"/>
they had upon that Article, wherewith to ruin
your <hi>Physicks</hi> to all Intents and Purposes.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, whereas they are as Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Obliging, as Ingenuous and Judicious,
and besides were well persuaded of the difficulty
of their Arguments, to save me that Perplexity
and Confusion, in the trouble they foresaw I
should be put to, in giving the Solution, they
would not oblige me to answer them on the
place: But were content to give them me in
Writing, that I might return my Answer at my
leisure: They only read them over to me, to
see if I comprehended their Sense; and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to you, though I seem'd to Vapour, I was
extraordinary pleas'd in my Mind, with those
little Differences which they paid me: For
they argu'd only from Matter of Fact and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
drawn Word for Word out of your
Books, which they turn'd one against another,
and made them destroy themselves in so plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and probable a manner, as requir'd <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
himself, at least one better skill'd than I am,
to refute them. I shall transcribe the principal
things of their <hi>Memoire,</hi> and in their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
They have given it this Title.</p>

                  <head>Objections offered a Cartesian by
some Peripateticks, against the
general System of M. Descartes's
World.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, they pretend to prove that the
Posture and Array in which <hi>M. Descartes</hi>
has marshal'd his Matter, or his three Elements
in his <hi>Vortexes,</hi> thwarts and contradicts his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules of Motion, which he gives himself,
and the Properties he attributes to every of
those Elements. And thence they'l draw such
Consequences as intirely overthrow his Doctrin
touching the <hi>Nature of Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they will shew that his manner of
explaining <hi>Light</hi> is no ways consistent with (not
to repeat his Position of the Elements in the
<hi>Vortexes,</hi> but) the very disposition of his <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes</hi>
amongst themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they will prove, that by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> no more than
any other Planet, can be priviledg'd with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<hi>Vortex</hi> in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Which
being once more Demonstrated, all <hi>M. Descar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s
<hi>Astronomy</hi> is turn'd topsy-turvy, and the
whole <hi>OEconomis</hi> of his <hi>World</hi> utterly routed and
destroy'd.</p>

               <div n="1" type="argument">

                  <head>The first Argument.</head>
                  <p>1. We forthwith take for granted, that
Master-Principle of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> That every
Body circularly mov'd constantly endeavours
to eccentrick it self, and escape from the Circle
it describes.</p>
                  <p>2. From that universal Principle immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follows this particular Consequence, that
in a <hi>Vortex,</hi> where the Matter of the first, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third <hi>Element</hi> are circularly mov'd,
all three endeavour to acquire a Motion eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrick
to the <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We infer yet farther, from the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
another Conclusion, That in that general
Attempt, made by different Bodies thus agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and confus'd, to deviate from the Centre of
their Motion, those that are most agitated and
are most fit for <hi>Motion,</hi> those, I say, must have
the advantage and ascendent over the rest, to
gain the Circumference of the Circle the Vortex
describes, and consequently to compel the less
agitated, and less fit for Motion towards the
Centre of the <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this Conclusion should have no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and necessary Connection with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as indeed it has: Yet we might warrant
our use of it, by producing <hi>M. Descartes</hi> to
vouch the same thing, in several places of his
Books, and particularly in his <hi>fourth Part</hi> of the
<hi>Book of Principles.</hi> Where he gives the reason
for the Motion of heavy Bodies towards the
Centre by this same Proposition.<note place="margin">Numb. 23.</note> That it was
by vertue of that Principle, that in the Vortex
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54814:139"/>
of the Earth, Terrestrial Bodies are below the
Air, and the Air below the Celestial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>To these we only add one more that <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
frequently repeats, especially in the <hi>third</hi>
and <hi>fourth Part</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> and in the eighth
Chapter of his <hi>Tract of Light,</hi> viz. That the
<hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Element</hi> have much more agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and are far more fit for Motion than the
<hi>third,</hi> whose parts are ragged and branchy, and
of a very irregular Figure.</p>
                  <p>All this suppos'd, let us agree with <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes,</hi>
that Matter having been created such as
he advances, God was able to divide, and actuate
it with Motion, and that he effectively has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it and mov'd it. Let us stop now, and fix our
Imagination and our Thoughts upon that great
Partition of Matter, or upon that Vortex, that
hath the polar Star for its Centre. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that portion of Matter, made up of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of little insensible Parts it self
turn'd round, whilst all the little Parts are also
turn'd about their proper Centre.</p>
                  <p>From this Motion must arise the <hi>three Elements,</hi>
that is, the most exquisitely subtle <hi>dust</hi> of the
<hi>first</hi> Element, the <hi>little Balls</hi> of the <hi>second,</hi> and
the <hi>ramous Parts</hi> of the <hi>third,</hi> all which are Parts
of the same Matter differing from one another
meerly by their Figure and their Bigness.</p>
                  <p>Whether the <hi>third Element</hi> be cotemporary with
the other <hi>two,</hi> as <hi>M. Descartes</hi> seems in some
measure to suppose in his <hi>Treatise of Light:</hi> Or,
whether it be form'd by the Conjunction of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts of the <hi>first Element</hi> hook'd to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he seems to teach in the <hi>Book of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:</hi>
That Philosopher pretends, that in that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54814:140"/>
justling and concussion of Matter, when it hath
lasted long enough to break the Angles of most
of the agitated Parts, the Matter of the <hi>first
Element</hi> must be posted in two principal places.
First, in the whole Space of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> where
it ought to be dispers'd, to fill exactly all the
Intervals found betwixt the Balls of the <hi>second
Element,</hi> whereof the whole Substance of the
<hi>Vortex</hi> or the Heaven is compos'd; Secondly, at
the Centre, whither it must be forc'd by the
Balls of the <hi>second Element</hi> to descend, to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a Spherical and Fluid Body, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Star it self, that by the circular
agitation of its Matter, and the struggle that
Matter makes to procure its Inlargement from
the Centre of its <hi>Vortex,</hi> thrusts the Globules
of the <hi>second Element</hi> that is above it, to all
Points imaginable, and communicating by their
means that Impression to our Eyes, produces in
them the sensation of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Sum of all <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s fine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
on this Subject. But we offer to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to him, by the aforesaid Principles, which
are all his own, that it is not the Matter of the
<hi>first</hi> Element, but the <hi>third</hi> that ought to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortex;</hi> and thus the Stars
must not be luminous, nor the Sun any more
than they, but all must be opaque Bodies, as are
the Planets, the Earth, and solid Masses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of the unactive and almost motionless
Parts of the third Element, entangled and link'd
with one another.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                  <p>When several Bodies or Parts of Matter are
circularly mov'd together, those which have the
least Agitation, and are least dispos'd for Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are the least able to make their escape from
the <hi>Centre.</hi> And on the contrary, those that
have most agitation, and are best dispos'd for
Motion, are most able to make their escape, and
compel the other downwards to the Centre.
This is the third Principle I have suppos'd, after
having deduced it from <hi>M. Descartes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Matter of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have much more agitation, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
better dispos'd for Motion than the
Matter of the third. This is the fourth Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which <hi>M. Descartes</hi> constantly supposes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Matter of the <hi>third</hi> Element,
not that of the <hi>first,</hi> ought to take up the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the <hi>Vortex.</hi> Which is the Proposition to
be demonstrated; and is contradictory to that
of <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> on which he founds his whole
System concerning Light. Therefore the Sun
and Stars must be dark, not resplendent Bodies.
We charge nothing upon him here, but what is
expresly his own; and we demand at the same
time by which of his Principles, not knowing
what to do with the <hi>Fragments</hi> of the blotches
of the Sun, nor what use to put them to at the
Centre, or near the Centre of the <hi>Vortex</hi> where
they are gathered and dispersed, he makes them
wrest and force themselves in to the midst of the
Circumference, as branch'd and incapable of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54814:141"/>
Motion as they are; and constitute a sort of Air,
which, according to him, is extended as far as
the Sphere of <hi>Mercury</hi> or farther? How comes
it to pass that the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>second</hi> Element,<note place="margin">P. 3. Prin. cip. numb. 100.</note> that
are either at the Centre or near the Centre, or
immediately below these broken parts, resign
so patiently the right they have by Vertue of
their vehement agitation and proneness unto
Motion, to the place the others get possession
of towards the Circumference? And if once
that irregularity and disorder, so opposite to
the Laws <hi>M. Descartes</hi> hath establisht in his
World be tolerated towards the Sun; why must
a Stone that near our Earth shall be cast into the
Air be violently retorted towards the Centre,
by the Matter of the second Element below it,
under pretence that the Stone hath usurp'd a
place unbefitting its Quality, and only due to
the Matter it hath displac'd, on account of its
vehement Motion?</p>
                  <p>And thus it is that <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Principles
agree. Thus he is so very frugal as to make
them serve for several purposes, even for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Conclusions, with the assistance of
some little Comparisons he can well enough ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
to the blinding those that read his Works
but carelesly, and are commonly design'd for
nothing but to disguise his <hi>Paralogisms,</hi> and
put off his Propositions that Reason cannot
justify.</p>

                  <p>In order to comprehend this Difficulty, we

In the third place we must recollect <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>'s
manner of explaining <hi>Light,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in that endeavour the Matter of the <hi>first Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
makes at the Centre of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> to get
farther from the Centre, whence, pressing on
the Celestial Matter, or the second Element in
all imaginable Points, that impulse and that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54814:142"/>
pressure light on all the Lines that reach to the
Circumference of the <hi>Vortex;</hi> some of which
necessarily falling on our Eye, when directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Star or Sun, make such a Pression and
Vibration there, as determine our Soul to that
Perception which goes by the Name of <hi>Vision.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Figure will easily explain it, where the
little Points at the Centre of the Circle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Matter of the <hi>first Element,</hi> or the Body
of the Star. The Lines drawn out to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
represent the Celestial Matter,
whose Rays concenter in the Eye plac'd at the

                  </p>
                  <p>We presume to affirm, That in this Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

Let us add to the preceding Figure, four other
<hi>Vortexes,</hi> supposing them the Vortexes of four
Stars that are nearest to that of the Sun.

                  <p>Let the Eye, plac'd in the other Figure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

that it is not possible to be seen.</p>

               <div type="demonstration">
                  <head>The Demonstration.</head>
                  <p>The Eye can no ways obtain the sight of the
<hi>Star</hi> B, but by means of the Rays or Lines of the
Celestial Matter, push'd by that Impulse the Star
B. causes in strugling to get from the Centre of
its <hi>Vortex,</hi> which Impulse is communicated to
the Eye, by its pressure and concussion of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54814:143"/>
Strings of the Optick Nerve. But this is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
supposing the Eye placed in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of
the <hi>Sun.</hi> And thus we prove it.</p>
                  <p>That Impulse must be communicated to the
Eye by one of these two ways; either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by a Ray, or Line of Matter drawn from
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi> and Terminating in the
Eye; or mediately by a Line of the <hi>Solary Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi>
in which the Eye is plac'd, retorted on the
Eye by the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Star.</hi> As if the Line
B, A. of the <hi>Stellary Vortex,</hi> should retort upon
the Eye the Line A. C. of the <hi>Solary Vortex.</hi> For
it is impossible to conceive the <hi>Star</hi> should cause
any Impression on the Eye but by one of these
two ways: But neither the one nor the other
will serve our turn.</p>
                  <p>Not the first, because the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> according
to <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> have each their circumscrib'd
and separate Sphere of activity, and a Motion
altogether different. Insomuch that the Lines
of the one are never blended with the Lines of
the other: But end severally at the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their own <hi>Vortex;</hi> and if once that
Communication or rather Confusion should be
admitted, all would speedily return, into that
confus'd and disorderly Chaos, from which
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> will have his World extracted, by
the only Laws of Motion; and farther, since
there is no point in the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
wherein we cannot see the <hi>Star,</hi> the Matter of
the <hi>Stars Vortex</hi> must necessarily possess all the
Space of the <hi>Vortex of the Sun;</hi> than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more absurd.</p>
                  <p>There remains the second way, which will
prove as useless as the former to <hi>M. Descartes,</hi>
proceeding on his Principles; forasmuch as with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54814:144"/>
him the <hi>Vortexes,</hi> though unequal perhaps in Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
must be ever equally matcht in Power and
Efficacy. For, says he, unless there was that
equality betwixt them, they would infallibly
destroy each other. Now that equality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from this, that the <hi>Star</hi> of a <hi>Vortex</hi> mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still uniformly round, presses the Matter of
its Sphere towards the Circumference, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the neighbouring <hi>Vortexes</hi> precisely with
so much force as the <hi>Stars</hi> of the other <hi>Vortexes</hi>
press the Matter of their Sphere in opposition
to it. Which is the reason, according to him,
that they always maintain their Ground against
each other: But from hence also we manifestly
conclude, That the Matter of one <hi>Vortex</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of repelling that of another, or causing
it to recoil towards the Centre, from whence it
struggles and contends to move with all its force,
reliev'd also with the whole <hi>Posse</hi> of the <hi>Star</hi>
that pushes it. Therefore that Effort, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a <hi>Star</hi> makes to get farther off the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
can make no Impression on our Eye, so
long as it is in the <hi>Solary Vortex;</hi> since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of that Impression is utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> that
with all its might and main resists it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
hinders that pressure on the Organ,
which is the only cause of Sight. To explain
our selves by a comparison much like that so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
made use of by <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> Let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a blind Man, whose Hand stirring neither
one way nor other, touches the end of a Staff.
Let us again suppose his Hand so capacitated and
dispos'd, that for the Perception of the Staff
it is not sufficient that it be immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to it, but that there be besides that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54814:144"/>
some pressure of the Staff against the
Hand. Let us in the third place suppose another
Hand, pushing it strongly against that of the
blind Man. Lastly, let us suppose that a third
Person, holding the Staff in the middle, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to withhold it from the Hand of the blind
Man, and that this indeavour be exactly equal
to that the second Hand makes the contrary
way. In this case the Staff, will advance neither
one way nor other, it will make no pressure on
the Hand of the blind Man, and consequently,
according to the first part of the Supposition,
he will not be sensible of it.
<figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us apply this to the Case in Dispute: We
will imagine a Line of Celestial Matter reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Eye to the Circumference of the
<hi>Solary Vortex.</hi> The immediate Conjunction of
that Line with the Eye is insufficient to produce
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54814:145"/>
the sensation of Light, unless something more
be added. That then which must be added, is an
impulse and pressure of that Line against the
Eye, which will determine it to see; and this is
the Doctrin of <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> But now whence
comes that pressure in the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> before us?
It cannot proceed precisely from that Line of
Celestial Matter, seeing it makes a directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Attempt, to withdraw it self from the
Eye towards the Circumference of the <hi>Solary
Vortex.</hi> It must then, if at all, proceed from
the Line of the neighbouring Star's <hi>Vortex,</hi> that
reflects the aforesaid Line against the Eye. But
this making as forcible an Attempt to get from,
as that to press it on the Eye; it is plain, that
Effort and Impulse can no more reach the Eye,
than can the Effort of the Hand that pushes the
Staff, arrive to the Hand of the blind Man; and
that the Eye admits no pression from the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Matter requisite to cause the Perception of
Sight: Like as the blind Man's Hand receives no
Impression of the Staff, requisite to excite the
Sense of Feeling, or to cause the Perception of
the Staff; and consequently the <hi>Eye,</hi> plac'd in
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> will be as far from <hi>seeing</hi>
the <hi>Star,</hi> as the <hi>blind Man</hi> from <hi>feeling</hi> the
<hi>Staff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for a Confirmation of all this, we must
remember, that in the Principles of <hi>Descartes,</hi>
not only what interrupts that Effort and that
Pressure, but also what ever weakens or curtails
one or the other, consequently frustrates
the effect of the luminous Object on the Eye;
and thus it is that Philosopher explains the spots
of the Sun, or those defailures of Light, that
appear in several parts of the Convex of that
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54814:145"/>
Luminary. For, according to him, the parts of
the <hi>third</hi> Element, hookt and ingendred with
each other on the Surface of the Sun, keep the
Matter of the <hi>first</hi> Element, of which the Sun
is made, from pushing the Celestial Matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Eye, with so much force as formerly:
Which is the reason that the Lines of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Matter, which touch my Eye, and which
we suppose extended to that Matter of the third
Element flak'd upon the Body of the Sun, are
no longer Rays of Light, that should represent
to me that part of the Sun as bright as all the
rest. So that the Light, which I perceive in all
the Sun besides, causes me to perceive in that
part of the Sun a defect of Light, which we call
a Spot or Stain. Now it is evident that this
Portion of Matter of the <hi>third Element,</hi> that
only floats upon the Surface of the Sun, breaks
the force, wherewith the Matter of the Sun
pushes the Celestial Matter against my Eye,
much less, than if a force equal to that of the
Matter of the Sun stood determin'd, and fully
bent against it, as it happens in this Case,
where the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Effort of the <hi>Star,</hi> and consequently
hinders it from making any Impression on my
Eye. And here let <hi>M. Descartes</hi> shuffle and cut,
and make what stir he pleases to recover his
Reader, by an Explication of <hi>Refractions</hi> made
in the Rays of the Star, upon their passage
through the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Sun; his only Design
is to lurk and secure himself in that Darkness
and Obscurity with which he purposely benights
the Question. Let him only tell us what he
means by those Rays of the Star that arrive to
the Earth athwart the Solary Vortex. But what
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54814:146"/>
we have said will sufficiently evidence, how
groundless and trifling will appear whatever shall
be urg'd thereupon.
<figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it be impossible to conceive the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the Effort and Impulsion of a Star,
whose Vortex immediately borders on the Suns,
what will become of the other Stars, whose
<hi>Vortexes</hi> are infinitely distant from that of the
Sun, and which must make a sensible impression
on our Eye across a great many <hi>Vortexes,</hi> whose
Matter is differently mov'd, and are all so many
Obstacles to that Communication? Doubtless,
though all we have been urging amounted not to
a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> in respect of the Stars situate
near the Sun, it would infallibly, in respect of
all the other. So that instead of those infinite
Stars, we see sparkling in the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:54814:146"/>
What now if we should add it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to see the Sun it self? Yet this may be
prov'd by the same Principles; for no more is
requisite for this, than that the <hi>Earth</hi> should
have a particular <hi>Vortex,</hi> whose Motion should
equalize and resist that of the Celestial Matter
which the <hi>Sun</hi> pushes towards our Eyes. But so
much is true, according to <hi>Descartes</hi> himself;
for he expresly teaches, That the <hi>Earth</hi> hath a
particular <hi>Vortex,</hi> whose Matter struggles as
much as possible from the Centre. That effort
is contrary to the effort of the Matter of the
<hi>Solary Vortex</hi> on that side which is inlightned by
the <hi>Sun.</hi> That effort is equal to that of the
Matter of the Sun: Otherwise the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the
<hi>Earth</hi> would run to ruin. Therefore the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of the <hi>Sun</hi> cannot be communicated to
our <hi>Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we say of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Comets,</hi>
which are seen by the help only of the reflected
Rays of the Sun, and that consequently are not
so strong as if they were direct? If the <hi>Earth's
Vortex,</hi> arguing on <hi>Descartes</hi>'s Principles, is able
to obstruct the latter, how much easier is it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
the former, and hinders us from seeing
all those Stars?</p>
                  <p>All this seem'd very difficult; and before we
turn'd <hi>Cartesians,</hi> we had a mind to be satisfy'd
thereupon. But one thing yet remains, and
perhaps something better than ordinary, upon
the particular <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is
Matter of a third Difficulty in us.</p>

                  <p>This third Difficulty is well grounded on

weighty Consequences against the System of
his <hi>World,</hi> as though all the rest were insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
would alone unravel the finest Contexture
in it. He supposes the <hi>Earth</hi> to have a <hi>Vortex</hi>
particular to it self in the great <hi>Vortex</hi> of the
<hi>Sun.</hi> A Priviledge also he confers on <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
but denies the <hi>Moon.</hi> He explains this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in a plain and very familiar way, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying
it by those great <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
see in Rivers. In the midst of these great
<hi>Whirl-pools</hi> there are several little ones, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Motion of the bigger, and are carryed
round their Centre, and at once whirl Chips and
Straws about their own. Nothing could be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

how the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when carried about
the <hi>Sun</hi> by the Matter of the <hi>Grand Solary Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi>
at the same time cause the other <hi>Planets</hi> to

Matter which carries the <hi>Planet</hi> round the
<hi>Sun</hi> moves far swifter than the <hi>Planet.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
<hi>I say,</hi> this Supposition by the <hi>Simily</hi> of a
Boat falling down a River, which goes on much
slower than the Water that flows under it: A
plausible comparison at first sight, but that has
nothing solid in it: Since the reason of the Boats
tardy Motion in respect of the Water that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it along, is wanting in the Planet, steer'd in
the midst of the Celestial Matter. The reason
is this, that part of the Boat, which stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Water, meets with the opposition of
the Air, which bends its course differently from
the Water, and consequently resists the Motion
wherewith the Water influences the Boat. And
the greater that resistance is, as in a contrary
Wind, the slower is the Motion of the Boat, in
comparison with that of the Water. And the
less the resistance is, as when the Wind stands
fair, the swifter is the motion of the Boat:
But this is not to be found in the Planet, plung'd
in the midst of the Celestial Matter: It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
intirely all that Motion the Celestial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can impress upon it, free from all external
Opposition. Besides, being of it self indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to Motion, or to rest, to such or such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Motion, or this or that Determination,
it offers no resistance, as <hi>M. Descartes</hi> himself
speaks to the Matter of the <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gives next the reason of that inequality of
Motion of the Celestial Matter, and of the <hi>Planet</hi>
carried by it; which is (<hi>says he</hi>) that though
such little Bodies, as are the insensible parts of
the Celestial Matter, conspiring all together to
act confederately against a great one, may be as
prevalent as <hi>that;</hi> notwithstanding they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54814:149"/>
move it in all respects so swift, as they are
mov'd themselves; 'cause though they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in some of their Motions which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto it, they infallibly disagree in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which they cannot communicate. Either
we are mistaken, or this is a meer <hi>Gipsy-talk,</hi> at
least in relation to the Business we are upon; and
one of these Slights of Hand, we have observ'd
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> from time to time to make use of,
designedly to blind his Reader, and to conceal
from him the Lameness and Imperfection of a
Conclusion necessary to his System; which he is
well aware of, but is unwilling any one else
should see. 'Tis but bringing some pretty sort
of Comparison that may prepare the Mind, and
sooth and tame (if we may so speak) the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of his Reader, though commonly it
never comes up to the stress of the Difficulty;
and then clapping on it for a Confirmation some
abstracted Reason, that few either can or
will take pains to understand, and the Business
is done; fore-seeing that being half-gain'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
by the Comparison, they will easily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
themselves to the least appearance of
Truth, which he shall give them a glimpse of in
his reason, that often is a meer fallacy at bottom.
And as for this before us: What matters it,
though the little Bodies, that drive on a great
one, should have several Motions? What tho'
they do not communicate all these several Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
provided they have still Strength enough to
force it on, that the Body makes no resistance,
that they all combine, as we suppose, with <hi>M.
Descartes,</hi> to communicate the Motion requisite,
and that we conceive them all pressing on its
Surface, so as to push it towards the place where
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54814:150"/>
they are push'd themselves? For certainly in all
these Circumstances, we must conceive it going
at as great a rate as they.</p>
                  <p>And yet from a Principle so weakly establisht
as this, he concludes, That the Celestial Matter
ought to move the Planet round its own Centre,
and constitute a little Heaven about it, to turn at
the same time as the great one. But not now to
controvert that Supposition, as poorly prov'd as
it is, let us persue him in his reasoning; and to
see if it be good, let us imagine the Earth T. as
it were suspended in a Void, and let us fancy a
Circle of Celestial Matter as thick as the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earth, that viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntly rushing like a
Torrent, carries it suddenly away: But as we
suppose this Torrent to be swifter than the Earth,
methinks without having puzzled our Heads
much with the Rules of the Determinations of
Motion, we might readily conceive it, upon its
violent dashing against the Earth, to be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
divided in two Parts or Arms, whereof
one should run above, the other below it; and
whether we conceive this Stream of an equal, or
a greater depth, than the Diameter of the Earth,
it would diffuse it self round its Surface, above,
below, and on every side. Whence it follows,
that it would impress no Motion on it about its
own Centre, but would moreover deprive it of
that Motion if it had one; all the Lines of the
Torrent counterpoizing one another, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Determinations they should meet with in
the Earth contrary to their own.</p>
                  <p>Here ought to be the foregoing Figure, p. 278.</p>
                  <p>Now methinks in explaining these things thus,
it is not a bare <hi>Similitude</hi> that we offer, but a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54814:150"/>
                     <hi>perfect Idea</hi> of that which ought to happen in the
Motion of the Celestial Matter, wherein the
<hi>Earth</hi> is carried round the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore then will <hi>Descartes</hi> have the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Matter that carries the Earth, and insists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
its Superficies towards A, making greater
haste than the Earth, bend its whole Current
from A to B, not suffering half of it to run from
A to D? For 'tis impossible for things to be, or
to be conceiv'd otherwise. But if it ought to
fall out thus, as questionless it ought, the Earth
no longer-has a <hi>Vortex;</hi> since the Matter flowing
from A to D, prevents that which flows from A
to B from returning by C. D. Nothing can be
more plain and evident than this Demonstration.</p>
                  <p>But let us suppose <hi>per impossible,</hi> that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when arriv'd at A, should entirely make a
double, to run towards B. Would it make a
Vortex? No by no means. For advancing from
B. to C. and arriving at C. it ought to deviate
from the Centre of its Motion, and continue its
Progress towards Z. The Reason given for it in
the Principles of <hi>Descartes,</hi> is, That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the
very place in all the little Circle it had begun to
describe, where it finds least resistance. First,
because the Matter it meets in that same Point is
already on its Motion towards Z. and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
its place. Secondly, because that which is
below it, that is to say betwixt D. and C. resists
it, and hinders its Descent, being more weighty,
according to <hi>M. Descartes.</hi> And thirdly, because
the Circle C Z. is its natural place, according to
the same <hi>Philosopher.</hi> It will flow therefore more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Z. than D. and consequently make no <hi>Vortex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us farther suppose a <hi>Vortex</hi> made, and
the Matter continuing its round, from A. to B.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54814:151"/>
from B. to C. and from C. to A. would this <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi>
last? Not at all. For we must suppose one of
these three things: Either that it is stronger than
the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is, its Matter has a
stronger bent and tendency from its Centre, than
the Matter of the <hi>Sun's Vortex</hi> has from his, or
that it is weaker; or that they both are equal. If
it is weaker it must be destroy'd by the <hi>Vortex</hi> of
the <hi>Sun.</hi> If stronger it must ruin his. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
then that its Strength be equal with the
Suns: And <hi>M. Descartes</hi> must unavoidably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it: But how will he prove it to us, I say
not by a Demonstration (we will not put him on
so hard a Task) but how will he bring the least
Conjecture to give this Supposition a pretence to
probability? Cannot we on the other side pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
several Reasons to destroy this Supposition?
Cannot we shew, in case the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi>
was as strong as that of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the little <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules</hi>
wrested themselves as forcibly from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of their <hi>Vortex,</hi> that the Earth it self would
appear a Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so would <hi>Iupiter</hi> to boot? Since
that which makes the Centre of a <hi>Vortex</hi> to us
seem luminous, is only the vehement Motion of
its Matter? Though <hi>Descartes</hi> says the Centre
would be drain'd of all its Matter, might not we
however, imitating the Stile of that <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
compare the Vortex of the Sun quite from S. to
D. to a vast <hi>Ocean,</hi> whose boystrous Tide swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against the Stream of a little <hi>River,</hi> by
which we illustrate the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it to fall back again, and adds a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to its Waters quite contrary to its former?
But with <hi>Descartes</hi> for a <hi>Vortex</hi> to be destroy'd,
and for the Matter of the <hi>Vortex</hi> to take the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Determination of another, is one and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54814:151"/>
the same thing. Let <hi>M. Descartes</hi> but <hi>prove</hi> his
<hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> with the least part of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we have brought <hi>against</hi> it, or by as natural
a Comparison as we have us'd to demonstrate it
a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> and he need not fear to stand
the Test, Sallies and Assaults, of the best of his
Adversaries.</p>
                  <p>What now if we should fall to examining the
Difficulties that may be gather'd from the little
<hi>Planet</hi> in particular, I mean the <hi>Moon</hi> consider'd
in the petty <hi>Vortex</hi> of the Earth? Should we
probably find less Matter of Objection?</p>
                  <p>Here ought to be the foregoing Figure, p. 278.</p>
                  <p>We advance no more than this, that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Moon</hi> when arriv'd at A. was carried on
towards B. she ought to deviate from her <hi>Vortex</hi>
in C. For first, That's the external Superficies
of the little <hi>Vortex,</hi> as <hi>M. Descartes</hi> will not deny.
Secondly, She Attempts to leave her Vortex,
by his grand Principle of circular Motion. He
pretends she cannot make her escape towards B.
because the Matter of the <hi>Solary Vortex</hi> in that
place is more light and active, and repels her
towards the Centre. Nor can she, according to
him, make downwards towards K. for that,
says he, the Celestial Matter on that side is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than the <hi>Moon,</hi> and equally opposes her
Descent: But we say she will get out of her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
at C. and continue her Progress toward Z.
For being in C. she finds no resistance, since the
Matter of C. Z. is that of her own Circle, which
is already on its March, and willing to give up
its place. Besides, being in that place, she actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
makes an Attempt to get rid of the Centre
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54814:152"/>
of her Motion, that is to say, of T. she therefore
will accomplish her escape, since there is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
in that as is found in the other Points; and
being cast out of her Circle, she will be oblig'd
to continue her Journy towards Z. by the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plac'd above, and below her in the Circle,
for the self-same Reasons as are given by <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet in spite of all this, it cannot be deny'd,
but that <hi>M. Descartes</hi> had good reason to order
his Suppositions of these things as he did. His
<hi>System</hi> was too far advanc'd to think of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at so small an Obstacle as a <hi>Moon.</hi> All the
<hi>Grandee-Planets</hi> were plac'd severally, according
to the Quality and Preeminence their Solidity
had given them. <hi>Madam Luna</hi> too was seated
in the Circle of the <hi>Earth.</hi> There was only one
little Inconvenience in the case, which was, that
she must necessarily take a turn about the <hi>Earth,</hi>
and consequently must be sometimes in the
Earths own Circle, and sometimes out of it. She
must therefore have a little <hi>Vortex</hi> of her own.
And this is the best, as also only reason that can
be given for his making one on purpose: And
setting this aside, the Laws of <hi>Staticks</hi> alone
could never have prevail'd with his Frugality,
to put it self to that extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense.</p>
                  <p>We had not insisted so long upon this Article,
had not we consider'd it as the capital Point in
the <hi>Cartesian System;</hi> and as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that prodigious Edifice, which has
been taken in our days by so many, for the
compleatest Mastery of a Human Mind. Let
us see the Importance of our <hi>Demonstration</hi>
by the <hi>Corollaries</hi> drawn from it.</p>

                  <p>The first Consequence belongs to <hi>Astronomy</hi>
and the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of the <hi>Planets.</hi> For first of all,
there being no such thing as a <hi>Vortex,</hi> the Moon
turns no longer round the Earth, since, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> the only reason of her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiting
is the <hi>Vortex</hi> that carries her aloft. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the four <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> must be
cashier'd of their Dignity and Employment,
which they only injoy on account of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<hi>Centry</hi> they keep about him, and that by
means of a particular <hi>Vortex</hi> attributed to that
Planet, as well as to the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the grand <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi>
of the <hi>Sun.</hi> For all that we have said of the
<hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> ought to be
apply'd to <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his <hi>garde du Corps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two Particulars in <hi>Astronomy</hi> are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
enough to assure us that the <hi>World of
M. Descartes</hi> is not that of Gods own making,
which we live in, but of a very different Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
and Contrivance.</p>
                  <p>The second Consequence respects almost all
the principal <hi>Phenomena's</hi> of the lower World in
general, whereof wee'l only concern our selves
with the most considerable and easiest to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
'Tis by the means only of the <hi>Vortex</hi>
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> following their
<hi>Master,</hi> explain the <hi>gravity</hi> of Bodies, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for the Motion which they have towards
the <hi>Centre</hi> of the Earth. For to instance, say they,
when you cast a Stone up in the Air, it forces
below it a Mass of the <hi>second Element,</hi> and Air
equal to its bulk: But that same Mass has a far
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54814:153"/>
greater agitation, and is better dispos'd for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and consequently has more power to
spring fromward the Centre of its <hi>Vortex</hi> than
the Stone that scarce contains any thing but the
Matter of the <hi>third Element;</hi> and therefore must
be compell'd by the Matter of the <hi>second,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
towards the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> which
is to say, the <hi>Centre</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> We may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say then, that without a <hi>Vortex</hi> heavy Bodies
would not fall downwards, on the contrary they
would naturally fly upwards, and thus we should
see Miracles and Wonders.</p>
                  <p>According to the new <hi>System,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> as far
out of Gun-shot of the <hi>Earth</hi> as he is, could not
warrant his own Security, in case there should
be a People that inrag'd at the heat and scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Rays, should sometime joyn to give
him an innumerable flight of Arrows. For these
Arrows shot from the <hi>Earth,</hi> against the Sun,
would fall in the circumference of his <hi>Vortex,</hi>
and in the midst of the Matter of the <hi>second Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which strugling all it can to get farther
from the Centre of its Motion, would constrain
the Bodies less capable of Motion than it self, to
descend towards the <hi>Centre,</hi> that is to say, the
<hi>Sun.</hi> Now these Arrows would be Bodies far
less capable of Motion than the Matter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Element, therefore it would constrain them
to fall towards the Sun: Undoubtedly a very
surprizing thing. And now we may easily give
a reason for the Experiment that <hi>Father Mersen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
formerly assur'd <hi>M. Descartes</hi> he had made;
that in discharging a Musquet perpendicularly
towards the <hi>Zenith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Let. 3. Tom. 2.</note> the Bullet never came down
again; for it must have infallibly been carried
to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:54814:153"/>
According to this System, when we have a
mind to make a <hi>Voyage,</hi> I do not say to the
<hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> as did <hi>Cyrano de Bergerac,</hi> but to
the <hi>Sun</hi> it self, it will be the easiest thing to be
accomplish'd of a thousand. We need but turn
our Head perpendicularly towards the <hi>Sun,</hi> then
give a little Spring to put our selves in Motion,
and to make room for the Matter of the <hi>Solary
Vortex,</hi> that would come bounce against the
Earth, to give our Heels a hoise, and this is all;
For, according to the Principles of <hi>Descartes,</hi> it
would give us such a flirt, as in a trice would dart
us to that <hi>Luminary.</hi> In short, <hi>heavy Bodies</hi>
would no longer make towards the <hi>Earth,</hi> but all
would be upon the gallop to the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we say of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the
Sea; which is one of the choisest places in all
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> Philosophy, and on which account
there's no one but ought to lament the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the <hi>Vortex?</hi> For by the assistance of
that <hi>Vortex, M. Descartes</hi> and <hi>M. Rohault</hi> speak
Marvels upon that insearchable <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of
Nature. Which not only depends upon the
<hi>Vortex</hi> it self, but upon the very <hi>Figure</hi> of it,
which was made <hi>oval</hi> on purpose, and singularly
for it, though probably it was not at first in
the intention of the <hi>Philosopher.</hi> For never did
<hi>Tragick Poet</hi> better and more artificially prepare
the <hi>Incidents</hi> of his Piece, than <hi>M. Descartes</hi> has
contriv'd his <hi>Conclusions.</hi> It would surprize one
to see, in his deducing them, that one word,
which he let fall careless by the way, and one
would think without Design, should have been
big with such an Infinity of Delicate Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
A Man wonders in the third part of
his Principles, to see the figure of that <hi>Vortex,</hi>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:54814:154"/>
which is no better grounded than the Vortex is
it self: But when in the fourth he sees the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> had of it, to explain the <hi>Flux</hi>
and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the Sea, he cannot choose but
commend his Foresight and Precaution. Not
but that, for all these pretty and specious Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of the Phenomena of the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of the Sea, the <hi>Cartesian System</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
false in that very Particular. We
are convinc'd of this by those Reflections and
Observations we have drawn from the best <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians</hi>
since <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s time. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
by the Observations of the Distances
of the <hi>Moon,</hi> determin'd by her apparent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters,
that that <hi>Planet</hi> is as remote in many of
her <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppositions,</hi> as in some of her
<hi>Quadratures,</hi> and as near in some of her <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratures,</hi>
as in several <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppositions.</hi>
Hence it is false that the <hi>Apogy</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in her <hi>Quadratures,</hi> and the <hi>Perigy</hi> in her
<hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Oppositions.</hi> Wherefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be suppos'd that the <hi>Moon</hi> being in <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Opposition,</hi> is always in the <hi>little</hi> Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Elliptick Vortex,</hi> and in her <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
always in the <hi>great one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet it is upon this only Supposition that
<hi>M. Descartes</hi> explains, and can explain, the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
of the Tides in the <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi>
and in the <hi>Quadratures,</hi> as also of those
we see in the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, if when the <hi>Moon</hi> pass'd our <hi>Meridian,</hi>
the pressure of the Air was remarkably so much
stronger, than in an other Hour of the Day, it
would be perceivable by the ordinary Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Torricellus</hi> his Tube. Yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
has never been observ'd, though it must be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54814:154"/>
very great: We could still give many other
weighty Reasons against this System: But let it
be how it will, take away its <hi>Vortex,</hi> and the
<hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> must needs follow it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, according to <hi>M. Descartes</hi> it is the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Matter of this <hi>Vortex,</hi> that having more
Motion than is necessary to turn in twenty four
Hours time about the <hi>Earth,</hi> imploys the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to diffuse it self all manner of ways,
and together with the Matter of the <hi>third</hi> and
<hi>first Element</hi> causes that great variety of Effects
and Bodies which we so much wonder at. So
the Vortex being ruin'd, all goes to Wreck and
Confusion, and returns to its Native <hi>Chaos.</hi>
Wherefore it makes not only for the glory of
<hi>M. Descartes,</hi> but for the Interest of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to save this <hi>Vortex.</hi> For what remains,
we protest we should be wonderful glad to see
the Solution of the Difficulties we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
against this and the other Points, upon
which we shall resign our selves intire and sincere
<hi>Proselytes</hi> to <hi>Cartesianism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in answering us let no one think to put
upon us, nor quote a place in <hi>M. Descartes,</hi> to
convince us he has not contradicted it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when 'tis a plain and notorions Case.
That Wheedle might take with those that have
but perfunctorily read his Works, but must
shew them the Contradiction in a clearer Light,
that shall take pains to compare the opposite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
We farther desire succinct and neater
Answers, than the generality of those himself
hath formerly given to those many Objections,
propos'd against his <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> Those very
Answers raise in our Minds more Scruples than
they cure: And yet because they have been
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54814:155"/>
Printed, set off and tinsell'd with High-strain'd
Praises of the Author, because he gives them a
Magisterial and usually a disdainful Air, and we
never see any Replies affix'd to them, many are
habituated to reverence them as <hi>second</hi> Oracles,
wherewith he hath confirm'd and explain'd those
<hi>former</hi> of his own pronouncing. We shall not
be such tame Asses, as to be impos'd on by
<hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Reputation and Authority, no
more than we would be Vassals to the esteem we
have for some of his <hi>Disciples.</hi> We praise and
highly approve the Advice he gives those who
are on the Inquest after Truth, to beware of
Prejudices, and shall put in Practice. These,
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> are the chiefest of the things contain'd
in my <hi>Peripatetick Memoir.</hi> They added some few

That you would have been most horribly pester'd
if any one would have track'd you step by step,
in the <hi>fourth Part of your Book of Principles,</hi>
especially from <hi>Number</hi> 32. to 45. where you
are so particular, in posturing and disposing
those parts of the <hi>third Element,</hi> of which you
form your <hi>Earth:</hi> That there were many things
there unsatisfactory to the Mind, and that there
was not a Page wherein it might not be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
again and again demanded, why such a
thing ought to be rather so than otherwise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your being able to give a tolerable Reason
for it: That they believ'd that piece of your
<hi>Physicks</hi> was one of those that had most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to make your Philosophy pass with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

without troubling themselves to refute the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
that you make there, the Discussion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54814:155"/>
whereof must needs be very tedious, had no

                  <p>They proceeded farther to say, you us'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<hi>Properties</hi> to your Elements, which you
was sure to take away again when they were not
for your purpose. They gave me an Instance
in the Matter of the <hi>first Element:</hi> You attribute
as a Property to that Matter a great facility of
division and readiness to change its Figure, so as
easily to insinuate its self in every place, and fill
all sort of Space whatever. But when 'tis
brought for the Explication of the Nature of
the Loadstone, that Propriety growing disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious,
<hi>Descartes</hi> thinks fit to change it for
a contrary. There is occasion for a <hi>little Vortex</hi>
of chamfer'd Matter round the <hi>Earth,</hi> and about
each particular Loadstone, to give a Reason for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54814:156"/>
the Qualities of that miraculous Stone.<note place="margin">Part 3. princip.</note> These
<hi>chamfer'd</hi> parts belong to the <hi>first Element.</hi> It
formerly was nothing to them to accommodate
themselves with the Figure of a <hi>Skrew,</hi> to pass
and repass betwixt the Globules of the second
Element. And now in issuing from the <hi>Earth,</hi>
or from a <hi>Loadstone,</hi> the parts of Air are able
to detain them. Instead of breaking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning
themselves to the Figure of the Parts
of Air, and second Element mingled with it,
they flock and settle in heaps about the <hi>Earth</hi> and
about the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> where they constitute a
<hi>Vortex.</hi> Those that enter by the Southern Pole
are incapable of passing by the Northern, since
their Figure can no longer be adapted to that
Passage; and they farther demanded, upon that
occasion, how it was possible those Snail-work'd
Parts, confin'd and stopt thus in a definite Space,
having an intricate and confus'd Motion, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
another, approaching the <hi>Pole</hi> of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Magnet</hi> that was proportion'd to them,
could so conveniently turn themselves an end,
and present so cleverly their Point against the
Pores, in order to their entrance in those Bodies.
They pretended the contrary was more likely,
and that generally the parts would present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
across, and thereby make a Confusion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of stopping all the rest, and damming up
the Pores of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Magnet,</hi> so as to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
all those admirable Effects we see there.
They advanc'd one <hi>Paradox</hi> more, which was a
good Humour enough. Hitherto, said they,
the most rational Philosophers have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that no Physical Argument could be
brought against <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to prove the Earth
was not turn'd about its Centre. But <hi>M. Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:54814:156"/>
who sides with that <hi>Astronomer</hi> in his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi>
has furnish'd us with a very conclusive
one against that Motion. His topping Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is, That every Body circularly mov'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to wheel off the Centre of its Motion:
This Principle is true: He thence concludes,
that the <hi>Earth</hi> turning on its <hi>Axle,</hi> would fly in
Pieces, unless the Bodies, of which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
were closely press'd, and squeez'd against
one another by the Matter of the <hi>second Element.</hi>
This Consequence is moreover evident in his
System: But now let us see if that pressure of the
Matter of the second Element is strong enough
to overpower the Effort which the Parts of the
Earth make to disengage themselves and get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from their Centre. This difficulty, said
they, falls only on <hi>M. Descartes:</hi> For the School-Opinion
is so far from owning such a Propensity
in the parts of the Earth, to deviate from the
Centre, as to suppose a quality and inclination
that naturally buckles them unto it. Now upon
comparing the pressure of Terrestrial Bodies one
against another, by the Matter of the second
Element, with the Effort Terrestrial Bodies
make to get far off the Centre, the Effort must
surmount the pressure: For the Effort is as great
as the Motion that causes it, and the Motion is
very great indeed, that can carry the Earth seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Leagues each Minute; and on the contrary,
Experience shews there needs but a very little
Effort for the conquering the pressure, since no
greater is requisite, than that a Child of four
years old imploys in Walking, to lift his Foot
and separate it from the Ground, whereto the
pressure of the second Element did fasten it.
Wherefore it seems to be reasonably concluded,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54814:157"/>
That the Earth turns not on its Axis, since if it
did, we should all be hurl'd in the Air, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant,
to <hi>M. Descartes</hi>'s Principle, which yet at
bottom is true in sound Philosophy. Thus <hi>this</hi>
System affords an excellent Argument against
<hi>that</hi> of <hi>Copernicus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They yet farther observ'd to me some peculiar
Places and Points of your System, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Importance, which you advance, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
not only stript and naked of all Proof, but
against all Reason in the World; they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
intreated me to read considerately and
without prepossession, the <hi>second Number</hi> of the
<hi>fourth Part</hi> of your <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
explain'd how the <hi>Vortex</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> was
destroy'd, and how there grew round that cak'd
and crusted <hi>Star,</hi> a spacious <hi>Fleece</hi> of Air, you
not only plunge it a great depth in the <hi>Solary
Vortex,</hi> but also make that Sphere of Air keep
pace, and wait upon it thither, and ever incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
it as it still descends. They pretend that
Supposition which you throw in <hi>Gratis,</hi> and
without all Confirmation, is inconceivable; and
yet if it be false, it were impossible at present
to have Air about our Earth: It is inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
say they: For, according to <hi>M. Descartes,</hi>
the Air is nothing but an heap of the Parts of
the <hi>third Element,</hi> exceeding small, and very
loose and disunited from each other, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
obsequious to the Motions impress'd on
them by the Globules of the second Element,
in which they swim. But this being so, how
comes it to pass the <hi>Earth,</hi> traversing those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Spaces quite from its setting out, at the
brink of the <hi>Solary Vortex,</hi> to the place in which
it is, should still so preserve all the <hi>Air</hi> about it?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54814:157"/>
How by the <hi>Principles</hi> of that <hi>Philosopher</hi> could
that Mass of Air, being far less solid than the
Mass of <hi>Earth,</hi> have the same Motion, the same
Determination, and same Swiftness as the <hi>Earth?</hi>
How chance those little Parts so loose and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of each other, and so obedient to the
Motions of the Celestial Matter, have not been
dispers'd by the rapidness of that Matter, which
they stemm'd, as the Dust is scatter'd by the
Wind? But added they, how is this Mass of
Air at present driven along with the Earth by
the Celestial Matter? How has it all the same
Motions? Is it against the Body of the Earth, or
against the Globe of Air the Celestial Matter
presses, to give both one and the other a Diurnal
and an Annual Motion? Would not a <hi>Copernical
Cartesian</hi> be hard put to't to unperplex himself
of this Affair?</p>
                  <p>I omit, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> many other Difficulties
whose Solution probably I may find in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
your Goodness will, I hope, vouchsafe the
others I have already noted in this Letter. But
for what remains, I desire you to take the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness
wherewith I write to you, as an effect of
that passionate Love you have inspir'd me with,
of Truth, and especially to put a favourable
Construction on my meaning. I have only tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
your <hi>Adversaries Memoire</hi> in their own
proper Terms and Language, and I presum'd
the respect I ow'd you, could not warrant my
concealing or dissembling their insulting way of

how much it is for my Interest, and the Honour
of our Sect, not to suffer them to triumph
