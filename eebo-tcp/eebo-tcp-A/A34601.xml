         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CORPORATION of WEAVERS At <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> do Humbly Offer to the Conſideration of The Honourable Houſe of COMMONS.</head>
            <head type="sub">That this Kingdom will ſuſtain great Evils and Dammage, if a Bill now depending in this Houſe ſhould paſs into a Law; which Bill enjoyns the Wear of Cloath or Leather, and conſequently Reſtrains the Wear of Silks and Stuffs, mixed with Wooll, Silk und Hair, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE reſtraint of wearing ſuch Silks and Stuffs by the Nobility and Gentry ſeven Months in the Year, and by the Commonalty at all times, will neceſſarily impoveriſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate this Kingdom, there being no Trade that imploy ſo many people as thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Manufacturing of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Hair;</hi> for upon the moſt modeſt Computation they are judged to be ſeveral Hundreds of Thouſands of <hi>Weavers, Throwſters, Windſters, Dyers,</hi> and other Dependants thereupon; many of which have (according to Law) ſerved Seven Years Apprentiſhip to their ſeveral Trades, and have no other Freehold or Inheritance for themſelves and Families to ſubſiſt on, and who by ſuch a Law wil (in a manner) be deprived of their Trades, and thereby neceſſitated to ſeek their Living in other parts, or become chargeable to the places of their abodes; For that the Merchant cannot give Credit, nor the <hi>Weaver, Throwſter,</hi> &amp;c. ſupply their Journeymen and <hi>Windſters</hi> the year round, without returns of Moneys for their Commodities; And their Journeymen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> poſſeſs nothing but what they get by their daily Labour to ſupply their daily Wants, Nor can their Journeymen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expect to be imployed in the Manufacturing of Cloath, for that (as hereafter is evident) Exportatien of Cloath to <hi>Turky</hi> will be abated, and conſequently the preſent Manufactures of Wooll want imployment.</p>
            <p>That although this Bill provides that Stuffs made of <hi>Mohair Yarn</hi> (being lined with Cloath or Stuffs made of Wooll) may be worn in upper Garments by men only, yet ſuch Stuffs (if Camlets are meant thereby) do not conſume the 8th. part of <hi>Mohair Yarn</hi> imported, nor will they imploy a 30th. part of the Manufactures that <hi>Mohair Yarn</hi> do now imploy: For that <hi>Hair Shaggs,</hi> the Ground and Shoot whereof is <hi>Woollen Yarn,</hi> and the ſeveral Commodities hereafter mentioned, <hi>viz. Hair Prunella,</hi> which are cuſtomarily worn by the Clergy in the Summer ſeaſon, together with <hi>Camlets, Barratines, Criſpiana</hi>'s, <hi>Tamalta</hi>'s, <hi>Calamancces, Mohair, Farrendiens, Morella</hi>'s, and divers other Stuffs are made of three parts of <hi>Mohair Yarn,</hi> and but one part <hi>Silk,</hi> and theſe are chiefly for the uſe of Women in the Winter ſeaſon who are not allowed to wear the ſame.</p>
            <p>And although this Bill provides that Womens Garments may be lined with Silk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſuch Linings have Cuſtomarily been imported from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> by ſuch Proviſion no wayes benefited.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a Law will deſtroy the intention of the Bill it ſelf, by leſſening the Conſumption of <hi>Engliſh Wooll,</hi> and impoveriſhing the Manufactures thereof. For that the greateſt part of our coarſe Cloths and Stuffs made of <hi>Engliſh Wooll</hi> are Tranſported beyond the Seas, and chiefly to <hi>Turkey,</hi> in return whereof the Merchants neceſſarily import <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Mohair Yarn</hi> wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manufactured, which imploys ſo many Thouſands in this Kingdom. Now it the Conſumption of <hi>Silk</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> be abated, as it muſt be by the reſtraint of the wear thereof, the Exportation of Cloth which goes out fully manufactur'd, muſt proportionably abate thereunto for that <hi>Turky</hi> doth not afford Commodities proper for <hi>England</hi> to be brought in returnes, other than <hi>Raw Silk</hi> and <hi>Mohair Yarn.</hi> So that Whereas the <hi>Turkey</hi> Company have ſo late Exported 25 or 30 thouſand Cloths in one Year, they will by this Reſtraint be greatly reduced. And for that every of the Nobility, Gentry, and better ſorts of Tradeſmen and their Families will not wear our coarſe Clothes made of <hi>Engliſh Wooll,</hi> but fine <hi>Dutch Clothes,</hi> and Clothes made of <hi>Spaniſh Wooll.</hi> It being evident, and the <hi>Clothiers</hi> themſelves will acknowledge that <hi>Salisbury, Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Worceſter Clothes</hi> from 11 <hi>s. per yard</hi> and upwards have not one Lock of <hi>Engliſh Wooll</hi> contained in them, except Clothes made of that ſmall quantity of <hi>Engliſh Wooll</hi> which <hi>Lempſter</hi> affords, the quantity whereof is very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Upon which it is manifeſt, That the more <hi>Silks</hi> are worn in <hi>England</hi> (if Manufactur'd here) the greater is the Conſumption of <hi>Engliſh Wooll,</hi> for ſuch perſons as wears a <hi>Silk</hi> or <hi>Mohair</hi> Garment doth certainly expend more <hi>Engliſh Wooll,</hi> that being return of <hi>Engliſh Woollen Cloth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Conſumption of Wooll will alſo be leſſened by the Reſtraint of the wear of Stuffs, made of part Wooll, and part Silk; for that the ſeveral Stuffs hereafter mentioned, <hi>viz Bombazines Anthorines, Silk-Sayes, Crape, Silk Maſquerade, Strip'd Cheneys, Virgins Beauty, Drafts</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Druggets</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Silk ſhades, Worſted Barratines, Glaſſamines, Katharina's, Tameenes, Eſtameenes,</hi> and all other or moſt <hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, with great Numbers of other ſluifs too many to be here inſerted, having but one part of Silk in them and nine parts of Worſted (which is our Engliſh <hi>Sheeps Wooll;</hi> yet becauſe of that little part of Silk, muſt not be worn in Apparel.</p>
            <p>That this Reſtraint will not only ruine the Engliſh Manufactures of Silk and Hair, but alſo great Numbers of French Proteſtants that fled hither from the Perſecurions in <hi>France,</hi> who will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to depart into other parts, for it is well known that the farr greater Numbers of ſuch Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Strangers have been imployed and wholly ſubſiſt by Manufacturing of Silk and Mohair Yarn.</p>
            <p>But now if it ſhall pleaſe the Parliament inſtead of Reſtraining the Wear of our own Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to prohibit the Wearing of Silks and ſtuffs Manufactured the Forreign part, and that be cauſe Manufactured ſilks heretofore Imported from <hi>France</hi> was the return or product of Cloth, made of Engliſh Wooll, but of late Years hath been the return of Money only, whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptlon of Wooll hath been abated about fix hundred thouſand 1. <hi>per. Annum,</hi> this would certainly inrich this Nation; and cauſe a greater Conſumption of Wooll.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons and for that the ſaid Reſtraints will in a manner prohibit the uſe of Silk &amp; Hair ſtuffs, and be the preſent ruine of many Mercers and others, whoſe Stocks conſiſt in Silks and Hair ſtuffe. It is humbly prayed, That this Honourable Houſe will be pleaſed to lay aſide the aforeſaid Bill.</p>
