            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM XCIV. v. 16.</bibl>
               <q>Who will rise up for me against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-doers,
or who will stand up for
me against the Workers of Iniquity?</q>
               <bibl>Or as 'tis in the Old Translation.</bibl>
               <q>Who will rise up with me against the
Wicked, and who will take my part
against the Evil-doers?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF these Words had not been spoken
by God himself, or, which is the same
thing, by the Psalmist in his Name
and by his immediate <hi>Inspiration,</hi> 'tis
certain that any who should now have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Question, must at least have
expected the Censure of two much heat
and forwardness, or the yet more severe
one, of designing a Factious Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
instead of a Religious Union. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58623:4"/>
Occasion of them, as well as of the whole
Psalm, is judg'd to have been the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Gods People in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where
they had no Friend or Helper; in which
Condition they address themselves in the
pathetic words of this Psalm, to him who
<hi>never fails those who trust in him:</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their firm Faith and dependance on
the Almighty, and, that notwithstanding
all they had endur'd,—<hi>The Lord would not
cut off his People, nor forsake his Inheritance,</hi>
but that at the last <hi>Iudgment should return
unto Righteousness.</hi> The time should come
under the Reign of the Messiah principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ultimately, tho immediately and
imperfectly under <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>'s and <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s
Administration of Affairs, when there
should be a more equal distribution of
things, and all good Men should with
one mind and one mouth glorifie God,
and adore his wonderful Providence and
Goodness.</p>
            <p>And then it follows in the words of
the Text, <hi>Who will rise up for</hi> (or with)
<hi>me against the Evil-doers; who will stand
up for me</hi> (or take my part) <hi>against the
workers of Iniquity?</hi> Who is there that
has Courage or Zeal sufficient for such an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58623:4"/>
Undertaking, and to assist the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Governours to accomplish
these happy Alterations; to reform Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
punish the Wicked, depress the Proud
and raise the Humble? Which great Work
the Psalmist [<hi>v.</hi> 17.] ascribes primarily
and immediately to God, tho not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Man's free Agency and Co-operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet not depending upon them nor
expecting much from them—<hi>Unless the
Lord had been my help, my soul had well nigh
dwelt in silence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall not, in my Discourse from
these words, insist any further on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of them, or their connexion with
the preceeding or subsequent Verses, but
consider them as independant on the rest
of the Psalm, and desire you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that the—<hi>Rising up</hi> for or <hi>with</hi> the
Psalmist, here mentioned against Bad men,
implies Zeal and Courage, which he was
then so solicitously enquiring after,—as
the <hi>standing</hi> up <hi>for him,</hi> or as 'tis in the
<hi>Syriac, fitting</hi> and <hi>preparing</hi> a Man's self
for such an Enterprise, may denote that
<hi>caution</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> which was necessary
on so emergent an Occasion; as both of
these Expressions imply an Union of good
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58623:5"/>
Men with the firmest Resolves and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
Endeavours, against the workers of
Iniquity.</p>
            <p>From the Words we may deduce these
Two Propositions.</p>
            <p>I. That it is very difficult to persuade
Men to engage in the Cause of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Wicked Persons and Evil-doers.
Thisis fairly imply'd in the Words of the
Question—<hi>Who will rise up with me? Who
will stand up for me?</hi> What need of such
a careful and exact Enquiry, if the
Answer had been obvious and easie?</p>
            <p>II. That 'tis the indispensible Duty of
Good Men, with united Councils, and
with the utmost Zeal and Prudence, to
oppose Vice and Wickedness.</p>
            <p>The former of which Propositions I
shall insist on more briefly; the second
more at large in the Body of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and then apply the whole.</p>
            <p>First then, We may learn from these
Words, that it is very difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
Men to engage in the Cause of
God, against wicked Persons and Evil-doers.
The matter of fact is too plain
and obvious, since neither Mens Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to God, nor those to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58623:5"/>
nor the Dictates of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
nor the Persuasions and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of better Men, nay, nor even their
own solemn Oaths, can oftentimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon them to the Performance of
this hazardous Duty. Nor are the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
less evident than the matter of <hi>Fact</hi>
is. The Singularity of such an Attempt,
the Disuse of the Laws, the Opposition
of the Guilty, the Coldness of those who
might and ought to encourage such as
act in this manner; the Disobliging Mens
Friends or Neighbours, the Fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
their own Temporal Interest, but
above all, the backwardness of those
who are in Publick Offices, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Dis-regard which most Men seem
to have of their own and others Souls;
together with the want of a true Love
to God and concern for his Glory, are
but too plainly at the bottom of such
an unexcusable Negligence.</p>
            <p>I shall not therefore need to insist any
further on this Proposition, but proceed
to the</p>
            <p>II. That 'tis the indispensible Duty of
Good Men, with united Councils, and
with the utmost Zeal and Prudence to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Vice and Wickedness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58623:6"/>Which Point may be divided into
three Parts.</p>
            <p>1. That Good Men ought to oppose
Vice and Wickedness?</p>
            <p>2. That they should do this with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Councils and Endeavours. And</p>
            <p>That 3. With the utmost Zeal and
Prudence that a Matter of so high an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
needs and deserves.</p>
            <p>In speaking to the first of these Heads,
I shall first enquire into the strong Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
Men are under to the performance
of this Duty; and then prove, that 'tis
their true Interest to answer those Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
            <p>And one would think there should be
but little need to insist on the <hi>former</hi> of
these Heads, to any who remember their
Baptism; for by their Renouncing the
World, the Flesh and the Devil, they
have actually entred into a War against
them; they have listed themselves under
the <hi>Banner</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> and have taken
a virtual Oath to be Christs faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Soldiers to their Lives end.
Now we cannot make this War Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
only without great Disadvantage, nor
will it be policy to expect it at home,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58623:6"/>
but rather to carry it into the Enemy's
Country, where we may expect, if not
wholly to put an end to it, yet, at least,
more successfully engage against it. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and open Wickedness is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the Almighty, and High-Treason
against the Majesty of Heaven;
against him who is a great God, and a
great King above all Gods: and are not
all his Liege Subjects under the deepest
Obligations to oppose it for that reason;
to hate that which his <hi>Soul hates,</hi> and
which <hi>hates him,</hi> and would if possible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him? Lest otherwise they be dealt
with as <hi>Saul</hi> was for sparing the <hi>Amele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi>
when he ought to have obey'd the
Commandment of the Lord, and to have
utterly destroy'd them.</p>
            <p>But we have yet a further Relation to
the Almighty, which obliges us to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
in his Cause and to fight his Battels.
We are his <hi>Servants</hi> as well as his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and his Subjects; he sav'd us from
our Enemies, he sav'd us when Rebels,
he rescu'd us from the Devil, he ransom'd
us by the Blood of his Son; he has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by all imaginable Titles the Right
of Dominion over us; we are not our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58623:7"/>
own, but are bought with a Price, and
are therefore to glorifie God with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Souls, which are his, and can
by no means be accounted either grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or faithful Servants, if we desert the
Interest of our Master; if we refuse to
engage in his Cause, or are patient while
he is Dishonoured.</p>
            <p>Now if these <hi>Obligations</hi> (and to which
many others might be added) did really
cross our true <hi>Interest,</hi> there might be
some Pretence for our not pursuing them;
but if, instead of that, it shall appear,
that the Publick opposing of Vice does
highly conduce to our Private, our Civil,
our Temporal and Spiritual, and Eternal
Happiness, what excuse can we make
for our Negligence in this matter?</p>
            <p>As for our Civil Happiness, we are all
born Members of a Community, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
must desire the Good of the
Whole, unless we can hate our selves,
who are Parts of it. Now 'tis hard to say
whether has done greater Mischief to the
Publick, either Ill Principles, which have
taken Men off from that Passionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their Country, which was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
and so glorious among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58623:7"/>
               <hi>Heathens,</hi> or else a Bad Life and a
Dissolution of Manners, which from a
complication of many unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
has of late so visibly broken in
upon us, both of which have so plain an
Influence upon each other. Thus much
is however certain, that whoever truely
loves his Country, will heartily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it <hi>better,</hi> which cannot be
expected, considering the <hi>Disingenuity</hi> of
the <hi>Bulk</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> without the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Discipline, and the Punishment
of those that do Evil.</p>
            <p>But this is an <hi>Article</hi> which has been
so often toucht and so much <hi>exhausted,</hi>
that I shall insist no longer on it, only
leaving it to the Consideration of every
prudent Person, whether there would be
so much Baseness, so much Falshood,
Treason, Bribery and Injustice; so much
<hi>Unrighteousness and Strife</hi> every where,
were Persons generally influenc'd with
the Principles of Probity and Virtue;
nay, had they not, on the contrary, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
themselves to the Stream of
<hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Lewdness,</hi> which therefore 'tis
the <hi>concern</hi> of every Good Man to oppose
with all his Might; to prevent, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58623:8"/>
that threatning <hi>Deluge</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to break in upon us, and cover the
<hi>Face of our Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the Opposition of Vice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the <hi>suppressing,</hi> or at least the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining</hi>
of it, less conducive to <hi>domestick
Happiness</hi> than 'tis to that of the <hi>Publick;</hi>
it being evident, that the want of <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
is the <hi>Ruine</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> and that the
<hi>restoration</hi> thereof would make better <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi>
better Children, better Masters,
and render all <hi>Relations</hi> much more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and comfortable, and happy.</p>
            <p>But Vice is further injurious to every
Mans <hi>personal</hi> Happiness; to his <hi>Profit</hi> as
well as <hi>Reputation,</hi> to his <hi>Body</hi> as well as
his <hi>Mind,</hi> by innumerable Inconveniences
it brings upon him. Of how base a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
therefore he must be, who yields to
that <hi>Sin</hi> which as it first brought <hi>Death</hi> into
the World, so it continues daily to slay
its Thousands; brings the Judgments of
God upon us, emaculates <hi>Mankind,</hi> taints
and poisons the very first <hi>Threads</hi> of Life,
projects its Mischief beyond the <hi>present
Age,</hi> and loads <hi>Posterity</hi> with a feeble
and a miserable <hi>Offspring?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58623:8"/>Let us next reflect on what passes in
our <hi>own Minds,</hi> and the necessity there is,
if we consult <hi>their</hi> Happiness, to oppose
<hi>Vice</hi> in others as well as in our selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its <hi>Contagion</hi> is so very spreading
and dangerous. Mistaken Men may call
the Proud <hi>happy,</hi> and so of other Sinners,
but 'tis impossible they should <hi>be so,</hi> and
they know the contrary themselves: for
what more severe <hi>Tormentor</hi> can a Man
have in his own Breast, than any uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd
Vice or sinful <hi>Habit.</hi> There are
few Men who are altogether lost to the
sense of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and to that natural <hi>Tast</hi>
of <hi>Goodness</hi> at first imprinted on the Mind,
and consequently <hi>Vice</hi> must needs be a
<hi>Torment</hi> to the Mind as well as to the
Body, since 'tis so contrary to our true
<hi>Nature,</hi> and a Man must be as <hi>uneasie</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, as a wounded Person with an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
sticking fast in his Body. Its true,
an Ill Man makes as good a Show as he
can, and thinks he bears it well out, but
'tis all Paint and <hi>Vernish;</hi> he has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within that denies him Ease; all
his <hi>Triumphs</hi> are but like the miserable
Ravings of one in a <hi>Fever,</hi> who perhaps
looks as fresh as ever, and tells you he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58623:9"/>
feels no <hi>pain,</hi> when 'tis but an unnatural
<hi>flushing,</hi> he's still sick at <hi>Heart,</hi> all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is <hi>disorder'd,</hi> and he's not far from his
End.</p>
            <p>Nor is the <hi>eternal Interest</hi> of every Man
less concern'd in these matters than the
present <hi>quiet</hi> of his <hi>Mind:</hi> For unless we
<hi>oppose Wickedness,</hi> 'twill as certainly gain
<hi>ground</hi> upon us, and hurry us away in
the <hi>stream,</hi> as the Sea will break in upon
a <hi>Level,</hi> if there be no Beach or Banks
to resist it. We know that the Wages of
<hi>Sin</hi> is <hi>Death,</hi> both <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi>
we know 'tis an <hi>acceptable Service</hi> to God
to oppose and resist it, that he himself
has told us—<q>Those who Honour him he
will Honour;</q> and that our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
has assured us, <q>That those who
confess him before Men, he will also
confess them before his Father which is
in Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>II. I proceed to the second thing—That
as good Men are oblig'd to oppose Vice
and Wickedness, so they are to do this
with <hi>united Councils</hi> and <hi>Endeavours.</hi> What
is a single Persons Duty in this matter
cannot <hi>alter</hi> its nature when it falls into
the Hands of Communities or <hi>Bodies</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58623:9"/>
Men, but may be much more hopefully
and <hi>successfully</hi> attempted by them; for
the <hi>Offenders</hi> may sometimes be such <hi>Sons
of Zerviah,</hi> that they'll prove too hard
for any single Person: Their <hi>Numbers</hi>
may be so great, that there will need one
somewhat <hi>proportionable</hi> to oppose them,
since <hi>Miracles</hi> are generally ceas'd, and
tho <hi>Sampson</hi> and others of old could slay
their <hi>Heaps</hi> upon <hi>Heaps,</hi> yet 'tis not now
for single Persons to attack whole Armies;
nor will a <hi>greater Number</hi> of undisciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, who fight <hi>loose</hi> and stragling,
gain equal Advantages on the Enemy,
with a much <hi>smaller Body</hi> who engage
with <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Order.</hi> Its true, that
the <hi>Kingdom of Darkness</hi> is likewise the
Kingdom of <hi>Confusion;</hi> but still Satan will
not <hi>fight against Satan,</hi> and all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>unite</hi> themselves against the <hi>Lord
and against his Christ,</hi> to <hi>break their bonds
in sunder, and cast away their cords from
them.</hi> Now in opposition to those <hi>infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Legions,</hi> did our blessed Lord institute
his <hi>Church;</hi> being a regulated <hi>Society</hi> of
Men, by their very Nature and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
most firmly <hi>united</hi> together, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to love one another; by virtue of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58623:10"/>
which <hi>mystical</hi> and indissolvable <hi>Union,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
well with Christ their <hi>Head,</hi> as with al<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
their <hi>Fellow-Members,</hi> sealed and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> they obtain
that <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Stability</hi> that the <hi>Gates
of Hell shall never prevail</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>And indeed were all the <hi>outward</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the visible Church, but real Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
likewise of that which is internal
spiritual and invisible; in short, did all
who bear the name of Christ walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of their Holy Profession, there would
be no need of <hi>Discipline,</hi> nor of any such
subordinate Union as I am now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
in any Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
any more than there would be
need of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Sanctions</hi> annexed unto
them in the Civil Government, did all
Men regulate themselves by the <hi>true Law</hi>
of Nature and Principles of <hi>right Reason:</hi>
but since none can be so <hi>sanguine,</hi> as to
expect such a happy <hi>state of things,</hi> it
lies upon Good Men to do what they
can, and to use all those prudent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
which are in their <hi>power,</hi> to make
the <hi>World</hi> a little better; to unite their
<hi>Hands</hi> and their <hi>Hearts,</hi> in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
at least to <hi>repress</hi> notorious Vice and
<hi>punish</hi> Gods <hi>Dishonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58623:10"/>It's almost incredible, to say, what
happy Effects we shoud soon see from such
a <hi>close</hi> and firm <hi>Conjunction</hi> of all good
Men in the prosecution of these desirable
Ends. Very considerable things have by
Gods Blessing been already done by <hi>some
few</hi> who have devoted themselves to the
Service of God and their Country on this
occasion; who have born the Burden and
Heat of the day, and entred themselves
into <hi>Societies for the Reformation of
Manners,</hi> both in this and our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nation of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And may God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
their Number as he will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their <hi>Labour.</hi> There's a great Door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
and no other can be expected but that
they shou'd still meet with many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries:
There's yet but too much Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <hi>more Hands,</hi> and 'twou'd be the
<hi>Honour</hi> as well as the <hi>Interest</hi> of all good
Men, to joyn with them in this <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi>
(nay of the greatest Prince on
Earth to own his Cause from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
his Crown) that by <hi>mature</hi> and
<hi>united Councils,</hi> mutual <hi>assistance,</hi> more
earnest <hi>application</hi> and greater numbers,
they might successfully prosecute what is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58623:11"/>
so well began, and what can scarcely be
accomplished by any other <hi>methods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. I come now in the third place to the
<hi>manner</hi> how we are to set about this great
Duty. It ought certainly to be managed
with the greatest <hi>Zeal</hi> and the greatest
<hi>Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. With <hi>Zeal.</hi> For since 'tis <hi>good to
be Zealously affected in every Good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
much more is it so in <hi>this,</hi> which has
so immediate an <hi>Influence</hi> on so many
great and momentous Ends. <hi>Zeal</hi> in <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Affairs</hi> seems to have much the same
surprising <hi>Effects</hi> which <hi>Motion</hi> has in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi>
and <hi>Mechanical;</hi> it produces what
seem'd at first impossible, it gives a new
<hi>Mould</hi> and <hi>Turn</hi> to every Action; it sets
on work all the secret <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi>
of the Mind, and makes them act with
such a <hi>Force</hi> and Vigour as is almost <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible.</hi>
God and Man hate a <hi>lukewarm
Temper,</hi> which has often created greater
Obstructions to good <hi>Designs,</hi> than the
most open <hi>Opposition</hi> against them;—<hi>Who
will</hi> rise <hi>up with me, who will stand up for
me against the workers of Iniquity?</hi> Who
has <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> and <hi>Bravery</hi>
equal to so <hi>glorious,</hi> an Underatking? As
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58623:11"/>
that <hi>Zeal</hi> is <hi>Madness</hi> which pushes a Man
on to <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>indefensible</hi> Actions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the <hi>motive</hi> of his engaging in
them; so that <hi>Wisdom</hi> is <hi>Folly,</hi> which
hinders a Man from doing his Duty, and
vindicating Gods <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But still we must take care that our
<hi>Zeal</hi> be temper'd with <hi>Prudence;</hi> and if
ever we are to be wise as <hi>Serpents,</hi> we
are certainly to be so in these Matters,
wherein we are sure to have the <hi>old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
himself our sworn and inveterate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy:
He may bruise the <hi>Heel</hi> of the
<hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> of the Members, as
well as of Christ their Head, by <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting</hi>
and <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and by all the
Calumnies that Hell can invent, or its
<hi>Emissaries</hi> utter. What need then have
all those good Men who engage in this
<hi>honourable and weighty Affair</hi> of stemming
the Tide of Vice amongst us, what need
have they to be always upon their <hi>Guard,</hi>
and to take <hi>care</hi> of their <hi>Steps,</hi> since there
are so many who <hi>watch for their Halting.</hi>
To act by the most <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Methods,</hi> to be <hi>zealous</hi> without being
<hi>passionate,</hi> which perhaps is one of the
most <hi>difficult</hi> things in the World. To
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58623:12"/>
give no <hi>just Offence</hi> to any, to prepare
themselves against the <hi>doubtful Combat;</hi>
to expect to be <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>slander'd</hi> by <hi>bad
Men,</hi> as was their Master before them,
and for the same Reason too, because
they <hi>testifie against them that their deeds are
evil:</hi> to be <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>vigilant,</hi> to avoid
what is <hi>scandalous</hi> as well as what is <hi>sinful,</hi>
and so on the contrary. By no means
to forget themselves, their own <hi>Persons,</hi>
or their own <hi>Families,</hi> while they are so
busie in reforming others; and to suffer
no <hi>Beam,</hi> or so much as a <hi>Mote</hi> in their
own Eye, while they are endeavouring
to <hi>clear their Brothers Eye,</hi> which could
not fail of having an <hi>happy influence</hi> on
their own Minds, as their <hi>instructive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
would on those of <hi>others;</hi> and be
one of those <hi>natural</hi> and inseparable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
which even in this Life attend <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and which in some sort
may seem to <hi>antedate</hi> an <hi>happy Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to draw some practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
from what has been said.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Use</hi> 1.) And the first may be to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi>
those who are so far from opposing
<hi>Vice</hi> and Wickedness, that they rather
<hi>encourage</hi> it and support, as it well as <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58623:12"/>
others who are engag'd against
it: so far from <hi>rising up against Evil-doers,</hi>
that they <hi>rise up together</hi> with them; and
'tis to be fear'd, that too many will come
under this <hi>Reproof</hi> who think themselves
wholly <hi>innocent;</hi> such are those who any
ways <hi>countenance</hi> wicked Men in their
<hi>lewd Practices</hi> and infamous Behaviours:
who <hi>chuse</hi> the Company of <hi>ill Men,</hi> and
therefore seem to <hi>stand</hi> in the way of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
and are in great danger of <hi>sitting in
the seat of the scorner</hi>—tho they cannot be
ignorant who has said, <hi>That he who walks
with wise men shall be wise, but a companion
of fools shall be destroy'd:</hi> not that all <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence</hi>
with Ill Men is forbidden, as
to the necessary <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Private</hi>
Life; for then as the Apostle says, must
we go <hi>out of the World;</hi> but I speak of a
<hi>voluntary Intimacy,</hi> a peculiar unnecessary
<hi>Endearment</hi> with bad Men, which if it
does not make them better, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make others worse, whose Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is so pestilentially infectious, than
which the <hi>Enemy</hi> has scarcely a more
dangerous Snare for the Souls of Men:</p>
            <p>Unless, perhaps, some certain <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in the Nation, of a quite different
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58623:13"/>
sort from those already mention'd, and
who, one would think, had for some
years last past enter'd into a <hi>sworn Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi>
against <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There scarce seems any need to explain
my self, that hereby I mean our <hi>Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Theatres,</hi> which seem to have
done more Mischief, than <hi>Hobes</hi> himself
or our new <hi>Atheistical Clubs,</hi> to the <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Morals</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> Moral Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
are own'd to be in their own
Nature, not only Innocent, but even useful
as well as pleasant; but what is this to those
which have no <hi>Morals</hi> or Morality at all in
them, and which are the most <hi>Immoral</hi>
things in the World; which the more any
<hi>good Man is acquainted</hi> with them, the <hi>less</hi> he
must still <hi>like them,</hi> and at which any <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Heathen</hi> would <hi>blush</hi> to be present.
If we ever hope for an entire <hi>Reformation</hi>
of <hi>Manners,</hi> even our <hi>Iails</hi> and our <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi>
must have their shares. With as
much reason may we exclaim against our
<hi>modern Plays</hi> and Interludes, as did the
old <hi>zealous</hi> Fathers against the <hi>Pagan Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctales,</hi>
and as justly rank these as they
did the others, among those <hi>Pomps</hi> and
<hi>Vanities</hi> of this wicked World which our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58623:13"/>
               <hi>Baptism</hi> obliges us to <hi>renounce</hi> and to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor.</hi>
What <hi>Communion</hi> hath the <hi>Temple</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> with <hi>Idols,</hi> with those abominable
<hi>mysteries of Iniquity</hi> which outdo the old
<hi>Fescennina</hi> of the Heathens, the lewd <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the impious <hi>Feasts</hi> of
<hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Priapus?</hi> I know not how any
Persons can <hi>profitably,</hi> or indeed <hi>decently,</hi>
present themselves here before Gods <hi>Holy
Oracle,</hi> who are <hi>frequently</hi> present at those
<hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Vice,</hi> and <hi>Nurseries</hi> of <hi>Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Lewdness,</hi> to unlearn <hi>there</hi> what
they are <hi>here</hi> taught, out of <hi>Gods Holy
Word.</hi> It recals to my mind a Passage
not unlike it, in the Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi>
(2 <hi>Kings</hi> xvii. 30, 33.) concerning those
<hi>Samaritans</hi> who inhabited the Land of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
after the <hi>Captivity</hi> of the Ten Tribes;
'tis said of them, That every Nation
made <hi>Gods</hi> of their own; the Men of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
made <hi>Succoth-Benoth,</hi> that is, as
Learned Men are of Opinion, the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
or <hi>Temples,</hi> or if you please, <hi>Scenes</hi> or
<hi>Theatres</hi> of <hi>Venus;</hi> and others of them
<hi>burnt</hi> their Children in the Fire to their
<hi>Idols:—so they feared the Lord and served
their own Gods.</hi> The Application is but
too <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>easie;</hi> would you suffer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58623:14"/>
your <hi>Friend</hi> or your <hi>Child</hi> to resort every
day to a <hi>Pest-house,</hi> or a Place infected
with any <hi>contagious</hi> and deadly <hi>Disease,</hi>
whence you had seen many Persons carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out <hi>dead</hi> before you? If none would
do this who pretended to be in his <hi>right
senses,</hi> what <hi>excuse</hi> can be made for those
who do <hi>worse,</hi> and are themselves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>present,</hi> as well as suffer others
to be so, at that place which is so nearly
ally'd to <hi>hers</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> describes;
<hi>whose House is the way to Hell, and her
Gates lead down to the Chambers of Death.</hi>
And are they not too like those <hi>Iews E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi>
mentions, who when they had <hi>slain</hi>
their <hi>Children</hi> in the <hi>Fire</hi> to their <hi>Idols,</hi>
came into Gods <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to profane it.</p>
            <p>How can such Persons pray every day
<hi>Lead us not into Temptation,</hi> when they
themselves wilfully <hi>rush</hi> into the very
<hi>mouth</hi> of it? 'Tis true the <hi>Stage</hi> pretends
to <hi>Reform Manners,</hi> but let them tell us
how many <hi>Converts</hi> they can name, by
their means, to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
these last thirty or forty years, and
we can give <hi>numerous</hi> and sad <hi>Instances</hi>
to the contrary, even of a brave and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi>
Nation too generally <hi>depraved</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58623:14"/>
corrupted, to which there cannot perhaps
be any one thing <hi>assigned,</hi> which has more
highly contributed than these unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and abominable <hi>Representations;</hi> the
<hi>Authors</hi> of which, tho the Publick should
continue to take notice of them, would
either be forc'd so far to alter them that
they would hardly be known, or else they
would <hi>fall</hi> of themselves, if Men would
but withdraw their <hi>Company</hi> from them,
as their pretence there does actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and support them. To close the
Head, whereon I'm sorry there's so much
cause of insisting, since there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of whom we may without <hi>Breach</hi> of
<hi>Charity</hi> believe, that they'd rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the <hi>Church</hi> than the <hi>Theatre,</hi> by their
being so much more <hi>frequently</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully</hi>
present at the <hi>latter</hi> than they
are at the former.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Oaths,</hi> if <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> if perpetual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of the glorious Name of God
and of our <hi>Blessed Redeemer,</hi> if making a
<hi>scoff</hi> and a <hi>laughter</hi> at his Holy <hi>Word</hi> and
<hi>Institutions,</hi> and I know not why I should
not add his <hi>Ministers</hi> too, which is
the very <hi>Salt,</hi> and almost the <hi>Imprimatur</hi>
to <hi>most</hi> of the Comedies of the present

Age. If <hi>Filthiness</hi> and <hi>foolish Talking</hi> and

at all, or <hi>slighty</hi> punishing them, or even

then to <hi>defend</hi> or hide their <hi>Wickedness,</hi>
or at least to think <hi>Virtue</hi> ridiculous and

for none but old People, <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi>

and <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>odium</hi> of our <hi>Nation;</hi>
for the truth of which we may appeal to
all the <hi>unprejudiced</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> part of
Mankind: Then we may further ask,
whether these are fit Places for the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of our <hi>Youth,</hi> the <hi>Diversion</hi> of those
of <hi>riper Age,</hi> or indeed so much as <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
as they now are, and without a great
and unexpected <hi>Reformation</hi> under any
Christian Government. If they are so,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58623:15"/>
they may then continue in their <hi>present
state,</hi> and we may still <hi>frequent</hi> them;
but in the mean time how can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to come hither unto <hi>Gods House</hi> and
his <hi>Holy Table,</hi> unless we could answer
that pathetick Expostulation of God to
his own People, who liv'd not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Profession, <q>What hast thou
to do to tread my Courts, or take my
<hi>Name</hi> into thy <hi>Lips,</hi> seeing thou <hi>hatest</hi>
to be <hi>Reformed</hi> and hast cast my Words
behind thy back, and wert <hi>Partaker
with the Adulterer.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But to go on with the other Inferences;
and the</p>
            <p>II. Shall be to recommend that <hi>Zeal</hi>
and that <hi>Prudence</hi> to your Practice, which
is so highly necessary in those who set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Reforming</hi> others.</p>
            <p>And First for <hi>Prudence.</hi> Let every Man
act in the <hi>station</hi> wherein God has plac'd
him, and by those <hi>Laws</hi> which are the
<hi>Strength</hi> of our happy Constitution,
and with that <hi>meekness, patience</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>temper</hi> of Mind, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
recommends to his Disciples, and
then they cannot <hi>err</hi> in this matter.
<hi>Humility</hi> is certainly a great part of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:58623:16"/>
and a noble Christian <hi>Virtue,</hi> tho
hardly ever known or mentioned in the
<hi>Ethics</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and is highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to those who are <hi>engaged</hi> in this
<hi>Work.</hi> For 'tis not easie to be <hi>singular</hi>
without a too great Opinion of our selves
and being <hi>embittered</hi> and <hi>soured</hi> by the
<hi>Censures</hi> of others, as well as by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
to <hi>assist</hi> us in what we know to be
a <hi>necessary</hi> and an <hi>honourable Undertaking
&amp;c.</hi> those must have a great <hi>Command</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
of their own Minds, who never
felt any <hi>risings</hi> in them on such <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
However thus much is sure, that
<hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> did never yet hurt
a good Cause, and are so far from that
<hi>meanness</hi> and <hi>demission</hi> of Mind which <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi>
whatever they undertake; that after
all, they are Arguments of the <hi>clearest
Courage</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity.</hi> To close this
Head, let us always remember, that we
are not to <hi>rise</hi> up <hi>tumultuously</hi> even against
<hi>Evil-Doers,</hi> but in an <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>legal</hi>
way. Those that strive <hi>must strive law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
in this, as well as in all other parts
of our <hi>Christian Warfare,</hi> and <hi>prudently</hi>
too, and therefore with <hi>united Councils</hi>
and <hi>Endeavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58623:16"/>Which will be no <hi>prejudice,</hi> but rather
an <hi>advantage</hi> to their <hi>Zeal,</hi> when it has
so <hi>stable</hi> and so rational a Foundation.</p>
            <p>And what further <hi>Encouragement</hi> can
we desire, to set us about this necessary
tho <hi>invidious</hi> Employment with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> than those we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
have? What <hi>stronger Arguments</hi> to
persuade us to fix our selves as <hi>Iron Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
and <hi>Brazen Walls</hi> against the <hi>Workers
of Iniquity?</hi> To set our <hi>united Breasts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Stream of <hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi>
which if we did, it must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
give way, since <hi>Vice</hi> cannot act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any <hi>settled Principles,</hi> but is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
cowardly and unstable. Is it <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
that we want to encourage us? Why
we have a thousand on our side even in
the <hi>Breast</hi> of every Ill man whom we
bring to <hi>just Punishment.</hi> We have now,
blessed be God, the glorious <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Superiours,</hi> that the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
shall no longer lye <hi>rusting</hi> and <hi>idle,</hi>
but be drawn and <hi>furbished</hi> up for the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
and <hi>glitter</hi> against the <hi>Faces</hi> of Gods
and our Countrey's Enemies. We may

to God, without <hi>exception</hi> and without

            <p>Let us read often the <hi>Lives of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
and see what they suffer'd, for his
sake who <hi>loved them, and washed them from
their Sins in his own Blood. (Heb. 11.)</hi>
               <q>They were stoned, were sawn asunder,
were tempted, were slain with the Sword,
they endured <hi>Tryals</hi> of cruel <hi>mockings</hi> and

                  <hi>Scourgings,</hi> and Bonds and Imprisonments</q>
and the most infamous and painful Deaths,
not accepting <hi>Deliverance</hi> that they might
obtain a better Resurrection, a new and
happier <hi>State</hi> of things in a better World.
They endured all this, in <hi>opposition</hi> to <hi>all
the World,</hi> for his sake whom they lov'd,
and who, they knew, did then <hi>see</hi> them,
and would unspeakably <hi>reward</hi> them.
Here was the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of the

the Flesh and conquered the Devil,

of <hi>Perjury</hi> and Injustice; he's neither

Now when Judgment thus emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently returns unto Righteousness, who
is there that is upright in Heart but will
gladly follow it? None will be refused
who sincerely <hi>offer</hi> themselves even at the
<hi>Eleventh Hour.</hi> Shall we then stand all

calls us out to this painful</hi> but glorious
Work? Is not the <hi>punishment</hi> of Evil-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
a thing highly <hi>acceptable</hi> to Almighty
God, and were not <hi>Magistrates</hi> institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, as for other <hi>great Ends,</hi> so
to <hi>execute Wrath</hi> on those that do <hi>Evil;</hi>
or have not those whose <hi>proper business</hi>
'tis to do so and yet neglect it, just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear lest God should execute his
Wrath against them, and that their <hi>Lives</hi>
should go for the <hi>Life of the Offender?</hi> Or
is there not still something very <hi>bad</hi> at
the bottom of such a <hi>general Negligence,</hi>
and if Men were really <hi>virtuous</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would they not heartily encourage
<hi>Virtue,</hi> and discourage and punish <hi>Vice</hi> in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58623:20"/>
others, and even <hi>root</hi> out all <hi>Evil-doers</hi>
from the <hi>City of our God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who those <hi>Evil-doers</hi> are, is easily
resolved, and they are but too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
met with; such as Blasphemers, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Profane and Atheistical Persons, the
Unclean, and the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> with whom
our Streets do in some parts of the City
still too much abound, and any other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and <hi>Scandalous Sinner.</hi> These the
<hi>Laws of God,</hi> the Law of Nations, and
the Laws of our Country have justly
<hi>branded,</hi> as <hi>infamous Persons</hi> and <hi>Evil-doers.</hi>
They were certainly esteem'd such in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages,</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Vice</hi> and
<hi>Virtue</hi> is as unalterable and <hi>eternal</hi> as that
of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> and one would think
they should not change with the <hi>mode,</hi>
and that nothing should make the latter
a <hi>Disgrace,</hi> the former a matter of <hi>Glory,</hi>
or at least a subject of <hi>Diversion</hi> and
Laughter only in any <hi>civilized Nation.</hi>
But so it is, and is likely to be still worse
if the Magistrate does not exert himself,
and put the Laws in Execution against
all such <hi>Offenders:</hi> and indeed if all People
do not more <hi>heartily</hi> and unanimously join
to <hi>assist</hi> the Magistrate in so doing; for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58623:20"/>
which there is no other effectual way but
by giving <hi>Information</hi> against <hi>Ill-men</hi>
and <hi>scandalous Livers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Manners</hi> are the <hi>Bond and Cement</hi>
of all <hi>Societies,</hi> and <hi>good Laws</hi> the life of

well <hi>executed,</hi> 'tis the same thing as if we
were <hi>without</hi> them, if not yet worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>contempt</hi> of the Laws enhances
the Guilt of the <hi>Offender,</hi> and Impunity
renders him still more <hi>obdurate,</hi> and they
can never be <hi>executed,</hi> unless <hi>Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Magistrates,</hi> tho they are called <hi>Gods,</hi>

our own and our Neighbours <hi>spiritual
Welfare?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say the Truth, <hi>Compassion</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
as well as <hi>Iustice,</hi> oblige us to act
in this <hi>Affair,</hi> and will teach us to behave
our selves both with <hi>Concern</hi> and with
<hi>Temper</hi> in it. O <hi>pity, pity</hi> poor Sinners,
and pray to God to <hi>pity</hi> them, who want
the <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>pity</hi> themselves;
but show your <hi>pity</hi> to them, not by a
<hi>cruel Fondness,</hi> but by a kind and <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58623:21"/>
Severity.</hi> Would you suffer your
<hi>dearest Friend</hi> to dye for want of <hi>Cupping</hi>
or <hi>Bleeding</hi> him when you saw him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
under the <hi>extremest Agonies?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
these are all our Friends, for a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
has no enemies:</hi> we are all <hi>Brethren</hi> in
the Profession of <hi>Christianity;</hi> we have all
one common Lord, should have <hi>one Faith,</hi>
as we have one <hi>Baptism,</hi> one <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Father</hi> of us all, tho too many are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of him, or <hi>rebellious</hi> against him. Why
should we suffer such as these to tumble
over a <hi>fatal Precipice</hi> for fear of disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or <hi>disobliging</hi> them, by pulling them
back with some <hi>hast</hi> and <hi>violence?</hi> Why
should our <hi>poor Brother perish for whom
Christ dyed?</hi> I'm mistaken if here be not
oftentimes the main <hi>point</hi> and <hi>stress</hi> of
this Affair. As one great <hi>end</hi> of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Offender</hi> is for the <hi>Example</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
so another end is to make him <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
where he is not <hi>notoriously incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
now if you can but once convince
him that you <hi>love</hi> him, and that even your
<hi>punishing</hi> of him is an effect of it, you are
in a fair way to <hi>work</hi> upon him; and you
have ground to <hi>hope</hi> that you shall <hi>save a
Soul and cover a multitude of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58623:22"/>As for that part of the <hi>Application</hi>
which relates to that <hi>Union</hi> which ought
to be among good Men against the <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> I shall turn it chiefly to
those who are already concern'd in any
<hi>Societies</hi> for the <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi>
or in the Religious Societies. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
not, my Brethren, any <hi>Flattering
Titles,</hi> nor dare I give any, lest my <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
should <hi>take me away.</hi> But Truth must
be <hi>spoken,</hi> and all due <hi>Encouragement</hi> ought
to be given to such <hi>glorious Undertakings.</hi>
You are engag'd in the best of <hi>Works,</hi>
the preventing <hi>Gods Dishonour;</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
his <hi>Glory</hi> and your Countrey's
<hi>Happiness:</hi> you have not rested satisfied
with a <hi>monastick</hi> Piety or <hi>Virtue,</hi> with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Good your selves</hi> and then letting the
<hi>World run</hi> which way it pleas'd; but
have endeavour'd to <hi>better</hi> others as well
as your <hi>selves.</hi> Go on in the <hi>Name of
God</hi> to fight the <hi>good Fight</hi> and finish your
Course, for you know what is laid up
for you; let not go your <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
in your great <hi>Lord</hi> and Master!
Believe, be assur'd, that if you act <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely</hi>
and <hi>regularly</hi> in this Affair, he will
<hi>accept</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> you. Never look back
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58623:22"/>
now you have once put your <hi>Hand to the
Plough.</hi> Since you are so well assur'd the
<hi>Work is of God,</hi> and it <hi>does</hi> and <hi>will</hi> pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
tho how <hi>much</hi> and how <hi>long,</hi> must
be left to him who is the <hi>wise disposer of
all things.</hi> Who can tell what <hi>Mercies,</hi>
what undeserved <hi>Mercies</hi> God may yet
have in store for a most Sinful, Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Nation, For he has mercy on whom he
will have mercy.</hi> This we are sure, that
none shall miss of his <hi>Favour,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
those <hi>Conditions</hi> on which it is offer'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>suffer</hi> a little, my
Brethren! the <hi>Word of Exhortation;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Eyes of <hi>God, Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>
are upon you; be <hi>sober,</hi> be <hi>vigilant,</hi> and
forget not who is your Adversary fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
remember what <hi>spirit</hi> you ought
to be of, that of the Gospel of Christ,
of the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>lowly Followers</hi> of Jesus.
Avoid, as a <hi>pest,</hi> the saying to your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like the proud <hi>Hypocrites</hi> of old,
<hi>Depart from me I am Holier than thou:
Forbid</hi> none from <hi>casting out Devils</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he follows not with you. Have a
care of calling for <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those who do not <hi>receive</hi> you; a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof two of Christs best Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58623:23"/>
were guilty. Be <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>watchful</hi>
and <hi>humble,</hi> and all <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> can
never hurt you. <hi>Praise</hi> the Lord of Life
and Glory, if he has <hi>toucht</hi> your Minds
with a true <hi>sense</hi> of your <hi>Sins,</hi> and given
you <hi>rational grounds</hi> to believe they are
pardoned, for the sake of his dear Son
our Lord, on your hearty and habitual
<hi>Repentance.</hi> Endeavour more and more
to <hi>pull</hi> others out of the <hi>Fire.</hi> Think
not a <hi>private Admonition</hi> is sufficient in
the case of <hi>open</hi> and <hi>Scandalous Offences,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more than it would excuse you in the
<hi>concealment</hi> of a <hi>Traytor,</hi> or any other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<hi>Offender.</hi> Be willing, be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be accounted the <hi>Filth</hi> and <hi>Off-scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
of the World; the <hi>Disturbers</hi> of the
<hi>publick Peace</hi> (by those who themselves
notoriously break it) and such as <hi>turn
the World upside down,</hi> as you know who
were called before ye. Think much of
<hi>Heaven.</hi> Forget not <hi>Death.</hi> Be <hi>constant</hi>
at <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in Prayer Publick, Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
and <hi>Private,</hi> never neglecting the
<hi>latter,</hi> never when you can with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
be present at it, the <hi>former.</hi>
Neglect not to <hi>Sing the High Praises of
God.</hi> Remember the <hi>Poor,</hi> especially Gods
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58623:23"/>
               <hi>Poor.</hi> Pity the <hi>Afflicted,</hi> especially our
dear Brethren who now <hi>suffer for the Word
of God and the Testimony of Iesus.</hi> Bless
God <hi>servently,</hi> tho you can never do it
<hi>sufficiently,</hi> for that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> which
our Nation now enjoys, and for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Discouragement of open and publick
Wickedness, and be ready to make more
<hi>vigorous Attacks</hi> than ever against it, now
there's so great Encouragement for it, and
so fair an opportunity is offered. <hi>Follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goes,</hi> who came
into the World for this very purpose, that
he might destroy the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi>
conquer the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Satan, and <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish</hi>
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of
Men; which consists not in <hi>Meats</hi> and
<hi>Drinks,</hi> in little <hi>distinctions</hi> and <hi>particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi>
but in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<hi>Ioy</hi> in the Holy Ghost. Follow him in
<hi>meekness, patience</hi> and <hi>humility;</hi> bearing
the <hi>Cross</hi> as he himself did before us, who
when <q>he was <hi>revil'd, revil'd</hi> not again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when he suffer'd threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himself to him that <hi>judgeth Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eously,</hi>
and for the <hi>Ioy</hi> that was set before
him endured the Cross, despis'd the
<hi>Shame,</hi> and is now sat down at the Right
<hi>Hand</hi> of the Majesty on High.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58623:24"/>To conclude all. Let every <hi>serious
Christian,</hi> who has that Integrity and <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness</hi>
of Heart which the Psalmist here
mentions, now consider more earnestly
than ever, how eminently such <hi>Designs</hi> as
these would tend to the <hi>exercising,</hi> and
consequently the <hi>improving</hi> and <hi>increasing</hi>
of many Graces or <hi>Holy Habits,</hi> of his
<hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Couroge,</hi> and
<hi>Zeal,</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of the
World, and <hi>Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> and
yet further, what great <hi>Rewards</hi> will he
receive for his Faithfulness to God, even
in this World: supposing the worst, that
he should suffer in his Estate or Good
Name by the Discharge of his Duty; O
the <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Ioy,</hi> the <hi>Triumph,</hi> the <hi>exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of mind</hi> which a <hi>good Man</hi> possesses,
when he reflects on any <hi>Sufferings</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes
for the sake of God, and for the
Cause of despised <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
How <hi>light</hi> are these <hi>Afflictions</hi> unto him,
which others would be ready to <hi>sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and how <hi>little</hi> does he think they
<hi>deserve that Name,</hi> when they <hi>work</hi> out
for him <hi>such an exceeding and etenral weight
of Glory!</hi> He <hi>believes, he knows</hi> this from
<hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> Causes; he <hi>knows</hi> in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58623:24"/>
whom he has <hi>believed:</hi> he bids the <hi>World</hi>
do its <hi>worst,</hi> he has a <hi>Reserve</hi> beyond it;
his <hi>Treasure</hi> is not in it; he <hi>aspires</hi> to that
<hi>better World,</hi> where he <hi>knows</hi> who will
<hi>meet</hi> him when this <hi>painful Life</hi> is ended,
<hi>receive</hi> him into everlasting <hi>Habitations,</hi>
and say unto him, <hi>Well done good and
faithful Servant, enter thou into the Ioy of
thy Lord.</hi>
