            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HAving been several times importun'd, to give you my sentiments as to the late Presbyterian Plot (as it was called) against his late Majesty, and the then D. of <hi>Yorks</hi> Lives, tho' I am sensible of my inability for so important a work, not only as it is an undertaking vastly transcending my Talents, but also as being wholly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any of the Persons accused thereof: Yet lest I should seem morose, I shall endeavour as briefly as may be, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to you, what I could collect, after a diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal of the (pretended) <hi>true Account of the late Horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,</hi> and other Papers that have been published about it, and what Information I could procure otherwise from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were more or less acquainted with some of those that were charged therewith.</p>
                  <p>Who the Author of that true Account is, I never made it my business to enquire, nor was I in this Kingdom for two years after publication thereof, only if the old Proverb hold true, <hi>Ex ungue Leonem,</hi> I am ready to believe that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may possibly have been one of those who were so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental in carrying on Arbitrary and Despotick Power, and introducing Popery and Slavery.</p>
                  <p>But seeing I design to give it you in as few words as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, I shall forbear unnecessary digressions, only seeing the Author seems to look back a little upon the Ingratitude of that Party, <hi>in exposing his late Majesties most Just and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government, unto contempt,</hi> &amp;c. I judge it may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary to reflect upon some of the most remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages since his late Majesties Restauration. And the first place let any one consider how much of his <hi>Justice</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37461:3"/>
to them in punctually performing the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> or of his Mercy, either in this or the Neighbouring Kingdom; witness those severe Acts that were passed here against them without the least remorse, upon a pretended, and which was afterwards prov'd a Sham-Plot, as appear'd by the Relation of it published several years ago, wherein the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher of it was so particular as to mention the Names of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral substantial Persons about this City of undoubted Credit, with the places of their abode, who would avouch the truth thereof) whereas when the Bill for Uniting of Protestants, and the ease of Protestant Dissenters had past both Houses, it was put by that it might not pass into an Act; which if it had, would both have prevented what designs they might afterwards have on foot, either for their own security in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or of preserving their Liberty, and the Protestant Religion in general, and that Inevitable Danger the whole Protestant Interest, not only in these three Kingdoms, but even all Europe over was exposed to, had not God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously inspired that Renowned Prince (whose Noble Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have been signally honoured by God to be Instruments of bringing back the Captivity of his <hi>Sion,</hi> and delivering them from the Insupportable Burthens laid upon their backs by Idolatrous, and beyond all comparison, inhumanely Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Merciless Papists:) I say, had it not pleased God to eat up as it were that Religious Prince with the Zeal of his House to that height, that he resolved to hazard not only his Estate, but even his Life it self, rather than not appear for the Defence of the Protestant Religion at such a Juncture when Popery was coming in like a Flood to overflow our Land, and to Crown him with Success suitable to so Pious and Noble an Enterprize. This in short may satisfie the World how great sharers the Dissenters in this Kingdom were either of his Justice or Mercy.</p>
                  <p>As for those of the Neighbouring Kingdom, 'twould swell
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37461:3"/>
a Book to a Volume, to recount the many Oppressions they groaned under, even before they could be charged with any Rebellion, save that in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, wherein the generality of both Nations were concerned: And I may truly say, that the ground of that Association of the Nobility and Gentry, of that Kingdom, and taking up Arms against their Soveraign, was the Imposing of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-Book without having the Concurrence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereto, with some other Oppressions of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's well known that several Persons were Executed in <hi>Scotland</hi> after the late King's Restauration, who could not have been charged with any Crime more than what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the People there, might have been accused of, meerly upon the account of being Presbyterians. And how severely those in <hi>Galloway,</hi> and places adjacent, were opprest, having Souldiers quartered upon them, to whom they were not only obliged to give Free Quarters, but likewise six pence a day to each Souldier; all which they patiently lay under so long as they had wherewith to pacifie that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Crew; but at last, all being eat up, their long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Oppression, which according to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth even the wise man mad; upon an accidental Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their own defence with some of the Souldiers, wherein some few of them were killed, the Country People fearing they should be severely punished, although they had only defended themselves against the Outrage of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, got to a Body, and took up Arms in the year 1666. for their own defence; after which time, not only the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were actually concerned, who were but a very small number in comparison of the rest, but the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Presbyterians there were branded with the names of Rebels and Enemies to the Government; and what Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many of them have had since that time, was little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to that the French Protestants had from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37461:4"/>
These things I only thought fit to mention in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to shew that even before they had appeared in Arms, the Mercy that was extended to them was not such as some men would make the World believe. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>He tells you in the first place how his Majesty, When he had suffered such Abuses, and personal Affronts from those seditious Persons, yet could have no Redress here while by their packing the Juries, as in <hi>Colledge</hi>'s case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but was forced to remove that Infamous Person into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How conformable that was to the Laws of the Land, I will not determine; however this I may say, that whatever that Person might be guilty of, it may be shrewdly suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that several of his Evidence were no honester men than those who are so meerly by profession.</p>
                  <p>Another Instance he gives is the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who whatever this Gentleman may say in general of his Notorious Crimes for which he was discarded, yet he does not, and without doubt could not, lay any thing in particular to his charge, during his Discharge of that Office, and some of his greatest Enemies have acknowledged him to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himself as well as any that ever was in that Station, he having till that time behaved himself with the height of Loyalty, even in the acception of those who under that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name palliated their Arbitrary designs: Nor can he much stain his Memory by any thing that he charges him with, when acquitted by the <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Jury, especially if we consider what Captain <hi>Wilkinson</hi> declared as to his having been tampered with, and that with such Temptations as might in all probability have prevailed upon those who were not a great deal above the common size of Honesty, and that the Persons that came to him among other things after such large proffers as they made him, told him, that though they had several Witnesses, yet they were such Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, (as honest men, as our Gentleman terms them) that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37461:4"/>
no Body would believe; and that it could enter into the mind of no rational man, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> if either his Quality or Wisdom were considered, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such Persons into his Company, much less joyn Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels with them; but that such a man as the Captain was, both in regard of the Reputation he had in the World for Honesty, and of his having been known to have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently admitted into the said Earls presence, about his Concerns in <hi>Carolina,</hi> would be easily believed; and so could they have then perverted this Honest Gentleman, they might have taken off this (for ought I could ever yet hear then Innocent) Nobleman, meerly because he was so indefatigably Industrious in unravelling that Hellish Popish Conspiracy that had been a hatching for the overthrowing the Protestant Religion in these Kingdoms; Nay, his late Majesty himself was pleased to say to the Captain in Council (when he was sent for before them upon his Emitting this Narrative) that if he would really say upon his honest word that what he had published therein was true, he would believe him, which he did: Yet the Accusers of that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to salve their Credit, were pleased to Indict him of High Treason, but we never yet heard that they called him to answer to the Indictment. And besides, it cannot but be fresh in the Memories of a great many, that the very same honest Men the Witnesses, a little before the Tryal, were drinking in a Tavern without or near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and in their Cups quarrelled with one another, and saluted one another with the names of Perjured Rogue, you had—<hi>pounds</hi> for swearing against <hi>Colledge,</hi> &amp;c. The Man of the house, and some that were with him having over heard them, had them before a Justice, but the Justice either out of Fear, or some other sinister Motive dismissed them. Now let our Author brand that Jury with what Ignominious Names he pleases, I appeal to all the World, whether, these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37461:5"/>
considered, that <hi>Ignoramus</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jury, as it was then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously called, could according to Conscience proceed otherwise than they did. And besides, my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> himself, who was afterwards one of the Evidences, in all his Depositions mentions nothing of this, who undoubtedly had the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> been projecting any such design at that time, would have had it readilier communicated to him, than any Irish Evidence, and was a Person that could have contributed much more Assistance. So that I humbly conceive our Author might have done himself and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he espoused much more service had he omitted this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for every reasonable man must needs conclude this to have been a meer Sham; and if our Author commits such a grand escape as this in the beginning of his History, he may run the risque of forfeiting the Credit of the whole. But I perceive that he has been carried out with such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant Zeal in vindicating my Lord Mayor's Absolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in Chusing Sheriffs, and the Taking away the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Charter, that he has a little forgot himself, and so veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Old Proverb, <hi>Canis festinans coecos parit catulos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But seeing our Author glories so much in this Piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that now things were returned into their right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; I think, seeing we may say so now from a much better ground, that as the Arbitrary Proceedings of several Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men are now like to be called in Question; it would not be amiss if Sir <hi>John Moore,</hi> who introduced those Sheriffs contrary to the Vote and Election of the Livery, be made give an Account of his then Proceedings; and that if he can prove that as he was Mayor he had such a Power inherent in him, then he shall satisfie the World that he has done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what became a good Patriot, tho' I will not say but he might have made choice of better Persons: And if he has Usurped that Power at the Instigation of the Court, that then the said Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> is as liable to punishment, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37461:5"/>
not more, than any Person now in Custody, he having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the Hedge of our Security, and made the first Breach for Tyranny and Arbitrary Power, for besides the introducing such Sheriffs as furnisht us with such Juries as were wholly at the devotion of the Court, whereby origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Guilt of all Innocent Persons that were executed since that time is to be laid to his door, so likewise the same action of his made way for the turning out old Aldermen, taking away of the City Charter, upon which ensued the taking away of all other Charters throughout the Kingdom, which has proved of so fatal Consequence to us since.</p>
                  <p>He next proceeds to set forth the indirect ways used by the Factious Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of whom he says the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and President of the Session were the Heads, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom he vomits up his Gall for wording of the Test, and adding thereto the very same Clauses that have since given any colour of scruple to themselves. But pray what were those Clauses? I doubt the Author was afraid to name them, lest he should have discovered himself of what Kidney he was. However for satisfaction to the World I shall here set them down; The said Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the Session being two of the Lords of the Articles, whose business it is to draw up all Bills that are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Parliament in order to be passed into Acts, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mentioning of the Bill made no Opposition against it, only the said Noble Patriots said, That as it was very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to preserve the Succession in the right Line, so it was no less requisite that at the same time a Clause should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in it for the maintaining of the Protestant Religion; which motion, tho' it galled some then at <hi>Helm</hi> there, as being a great Obstruction in their way, yet could not be refused, lest there designs should appear above-board, and then it would have been wholly rejected. And this Action of the said Earls brought down that wrath upon his Head
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37461:6"/>
which was afterwards the cause of all his Troubles and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. For a little afterwards he was Impeached of High Treason, and illegally condemned, as all the most Eminent Lawyers in that place gave it under their hand; which Paper the said Earl had with him at the time of his Escape, otherwise could those in Power then have found it, they had been served with the same sawce. As for the Jury that condemned him, tho' our Author affirms them to have been most of his own Relations, yet it is well known that the Marquess of <hi>Montrose</hi> (who was Foreman of the Jury) tho' his Cousin, yet always bore a great hatred to him, there having been for above these hundred years an irreconcileable Hatred betwixt these two Families, nor was there any of the Jury that were well affected to him. And for the other Nobleman, he being warned of his Danger by the Earls Treatment, thought it requisite for him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself, that he might not likewise become a Sacrifice to the rage of his inveterate Enemies, and went into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he staid till of late; in all which time he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himself so well, that malice it self could not charge him with any seditious practices. It is no less false, that his Life was not intended to be taken away; for it is well known that the Gentleman who was sent up in order to procure his Pardon, found it utterly impossible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and therefore dispatcht an Express to his Friends, wherein he acquainted them, that unless he could make his escape out of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he was then Prisoner, he would certainly be Executed in a few days; this Express arrived but four hours before the Post, and when the Post was come, which among other things had the Warrant for his Execution, the Captain of the said Castle being not to be found for an hour or two after, the Earl in the mean while made his Escape. When the Captain came home, which was about Nine or Ten a Clock at Night, he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37461:6"/>
sent to the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>'s Apartment to shew that he must speak with his Lordship, they having been privy to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, answered, that he was not well, and was then asleep; notwithstanding he came into his Chamber, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the day of his Execution, and after search found no man there but his Page lying on his Bed.</p>
                  <p>But, to proceed to this Plot, as it was pretended to be managed here, the Designs were said to be to Assassinate the King, particularly at the <hi>Rye-house,</hi> as he was coming from <hi>New-Market,</hi> and to raise a Rebellion. And these Bloody Designs were said to have been carried on by two different Clubs, to wit, one of several Commoners, and the other of a Council of six, whereof most were Noble-men.</p>
                  <p>I shall first make a little scrutiny into the former; <hi>viz.</hi> that wherein <hi>Keeling, West, &amp;c.</hi> were concerned. And about the pretended Discovery of this Plot (or rather Trapan) for to gain the further Credit to it, a great Noise was made about the Fire that a little before was in <hi>New-Market,</hi> which, said they, had it not happened, His Majesty and the Duke had undoubtedly been cut off; <hi>viz.</hi> if His Majesty had not by reason of that Fire been forced to come unexpectedly to <hi>London,</hi> and that a fortnight before the time he used to part thence at; and it is well known how many Pulpits resounded with this. And as, after the best observation I could make of all the Passages that I heard of, I always was, so I still am of opinion, that that Fire was set on purpose by some of the Popish Party to gain Credit to this Plot.</p>
                  <p>For, had not this Fire consumed some of the King's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, he would have staid his usual time at <hi>New-Market,</hi> and then having incurred no danger by the way, this Plot would have lost all its Nerves and Sinews; for then few would have believed they had any such design; seeing if they had, they would not have neglected such an opportunity as that. Nor were the Preparations suitable to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37461:7"/>
such an undertaking made; and tho' there were some very foolish persons among them, yet 'tis well known that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> and some others were of greater Policy than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake such a dangerous Enterprize, and not have all things suitable for it prepared before-hand, and rather than sailed of it, would have waited thereabouts a fortnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not had some likewise at <hi>New-Market</hi> to give them certain notice of the day; But instead of that, no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations at all; but <hi>West,</hi> as he said, had bought forty stand of Arms, for which he said he had the money at last from Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>; tho' it's more probable, as will appear afterwards, that <hi>West</hi> might have this money some other way, may be from some of the Popish Faction, to the end that those Arms being seized, might prove a Confirmation to their Depositions, which so much stood in need of it. Nor are their Depositions restricted to this only, at the <hi>Rye-House,</hi> for they say that they would do it there, or at the <hi>Play-House,</hi> or as he went to <hi>Windsor,</hi> or at <hi>Whitehall, &amp;c.</hi> A plain Demonstration that they had not fixed upon that particular place; and that being the place in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they could have most easily effected that design in, consequently they had not agreed upon any such design.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, this may be confirmed by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Testimony of all the persons that were Executed, who denied their ever having given any consent to any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, as to Assassinate the King, (<hi>Hone</hi> only excepted, who talked more like a Mad-man than any thing else, he having declared that he was for killing the King, and saving the Duke, and when both the Judges, and that Gentleman D.C. since Bp. of <hi>C</hi>—(who has lately been obliged to run his Country) wondring thereat, askt him why he was for killing the King, and saving the Duke, he at last replyed, that he was a poor ignorant man. He likewise declared that he was brought in by <hi>Keeling,</hi> who, he said, was more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37461:7"/>
guilty than any of them. So that what this <hi>Hone</hi> said sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified not much as to the rest, for he having been a person of so mean parts, might be easily brought to say any thing Monsieurs the Witnesses pleased.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> at the place of his Execution, tho' he died with all the signs of one that had a suitable impression of another World upon him, and so would no doubt have cleared his Conscience by confession of so foul a Crime, and begging pardon for it, had he been guilty of it, yet utterly denies his having ever consented to such an horrid Design; besides that the said Captain is said by Coll. <hi>Rumsey</hi> to have been a long time at least against it. And the said Captain likewise declared that 'twas Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> that first introduced him into those Meetings, where, such dangerous things were discoursed of; and that he, and <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>Keeling,</hi> were the forwardest to talk of such things.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Rouse</hi> likewise utterly denies his having ever assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any such design; and besides, that the words which were spoke by the Witnesses in their hearing were made use of as Evidence against them.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> who was taken at <hi>Nevis,</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the many Questions proposed to him by Sheriff <hi>Daniel,</hi> particularly as to this design of Assassinating the King and Duke, confirms the same: For he utterly denied that any such thing was agreed upon; nay on the contrary, that there were but very few for it, to use his own words, not above four or five, of whom <hi>Rumsey, West</hi> and <hi>Keeling</hi> were three, and that the rest looking upon it as a design which so small a number could not accomplish without their Aid and Assistance, took no further notice of it. And being askt in particular if Captain <hi>Walcot, Rouse,</hi> and <hi>Ferguson</hi> were for that design of cutting off the King, he answered in the negative. And it is worth the while to take notice how severe a check this Sheriff had at Court,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37461:8"/>
for his proposing so many Questions to this Prisoner, which plainly shews that some there were afraid lest their Tricks should appear to the World; and the truth is, by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of this person a great deal of the <hi>Odium</hi> of this Plot was removed, the most hainous part of it then seeming in in all probability to have been a Contrivance of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> himself, who is said by them to have been one of the deepest in this Conspiracy, at his Execution in <hi>Scotland</hi> utterly denied his in the least consenting to any such Barbarous Design.</p>
                  <p>And Mr. <hi>Nelthrope,</hi> at his Execution in the West of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the year 1685. protested that it was a thing highly against his Judgment, and which he always detested, and that he never was in the least concerned in it, neither in purse nor person, nor ever knew of any Arms bought for that intention, nor did believe there was any such design, or that he ever heard of any disappointment in such an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, or Arms, or Time, or Place, save what after the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral design, Mr. <hi>West</hi> spoke of as to Arms bought by him.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Zachary Bourne,</hi> who was likewise one of the Evidence, and who had the Plot communicated to him by <hi>Ferguson,</hi> in whose House he lodged never mentions Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s speaking any thing to him of that Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' he says that one <hi>Roe</hi> spoke to him of it, and <hi>West.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all which it plainly appears that there was no design of Assassinating the King and Duke; but that this horrid project of taking off the King, was at first proposed by the Witnesses, on purpose to ensnare others, and that the same, tho' some few were brought over, was absolutely upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal rejected by most of them, and those who did reject it, being three times the number of the others, knew that they could not effect it by themselves, and so took no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice of it. I say, it plainly appears to have been so,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37461:8"/>
if we consider, under what suitable apprehensions of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty all those that were Executed, went off this World. And that they were so ingenuous as to confess there had been some design on foot, which, how honest soever it might have been, yet seeing it would be interpreted an Association against the Government, could not excuse them, as matters then went, from being made Examples of Justice. And it is well known that the Principles of the Protestant Religion do not allow any man to go out of this World with a Lye in his Mouth, tho' those of the Romish (if I may so call it) Church do. And I cannot but wonder when I reflect how a great many Protestants should have been so lavish in their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Papists, as to conclude, because they all went off the World, denying the Crimes for which they were justly condemned, (especially when they know what Injunctions are laid upon them by their Priests; <hi>viz.</hi> that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess nothing that may prejudice Mother-Church under pain of Damnation) that they were Innocent of the Crimes they were accused of, and yet have so little to spare to those of their own Faith, who yet they know cannot die with any Comfort, or hopes of Pardon, except they make a frank Confession of the Crimes they are guilty of, much less if they persist in an obstinate Denyal thereof. But it is well known that the Papists not only went off the World with a Lye in their Mouths as to their being guilty of the Horrid Crimes they were condemned for, but likewise as to their having ever before their Tryal been with any of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that appeared against them, when yet 'twas well known that they had been very familiar with them. To mention only one of them, the late Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> in his last Paper declared with great asseverations that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> before his Tryal, whereas a little after his Execution, it was proved by the Depositions of above fifteen Witnesses, who all lived by his Countrey
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37461:9"/>
House, that the said <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> was often familiarly entertained by the said Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and that he has left the Company of several considerable Gentlemen to discourse with the said <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and that they had been observed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing several times above an hour together; which may fully inform us what credit is to be given to any of that Persuasion, as to any thing relating to the advancement of Mother Churches Interest.</p>
                  <p>I shall now proceed to the Plot said to be managed by that Council of Six; <hi>viz.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Collonel <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Hambden,</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior. Where we shall briefly take notice of what is most Remarkable in the Tryals of those of them who were Arraigned, and what is observable as to others who were not.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal, and first in the Evidence of Colonel <hi>Rumsey,</hi> I find this seeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; <hi>viz.</hi> That he being sent by the Earl of <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to the said Lord then at Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguson,</hi> to know if the Rising in <hi>Taunton</hi> went on, and that they, or some of them returned answer that it did not go on, and that yet they afterwards had a discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout viewing the Guards, in order to seize them, when notwithstanding he says afterward that they were only to seize the Guards, when the Rising went on. Besides, it is more than probable that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> or Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Armstrong</hi> knew well enough before what posture the Guards were in, and how to surprize them, without all that debate which he says was held there. And this is all the Evidence this Souldier of Fortune gives in, which yet might have been done without any design against the Kings Person.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37461:9"/>Another thing is in Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi>'s Evidence, who was at the same time at that meeting in his own House, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his saying in one place that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was at two Meetings in his House, and afterwards acknowledging that he could not be positive whether or not, was of so unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Memory, as to forget a remarkable passage which he had discovered before, to wit, that of <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s reading a Declaration, which he said nothing of till Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> askt him about that Declaration, and then he returns, <hi>Yes now I recollect my self, I remember one Paper was read.</hi> Now he could not have known that, if he had not heard it of <hi>Sheppard</hi> before, for <hi>Rumsey</hi> declared he was not there when it was read, tho' <hi>Sheppard</hi> seemed to be as positive in that, that he was present then, till the other contradicted him, as he was in what he gave in against my Lord <hi>Russel.</hi> Now I say the Loyal <hi>Scimus</hi> Jury-men might have taken notice that the Evidence of a Person so forgetful as <hi>Sheppard</hi> seemed to be, in forgetting so material a passage which he had given in Evidence but two or three days before, should not have been accounted of so great weight in Case of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemans Life, as they reckoned it.</p>
                  <p>The next Evidence was my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess the Jury with a belief of this Plot, begins with such a base insinuation, that I think had any of the Jury had the least common either honesty or discretion, they would have suspected the Evidence of this Lord; for he first begins so low, that they could not hear what he said, which did more argue a guilty Conscience than any thing else, and when he was desired by my Lord Chief Justice to raise his voice, he pretended that the news of my Lord <hi>Essex</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal End had sunk his voice; whereas all that are acquainted with his Lordship, know very well that he was not of that Temper; only this was said, to insinuate, as was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sufficiently buzz'd about, that the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37461:10"/>
escape the hand of Justice had cut his Throat, that the Jury might have a deeper impression upon them of the reality of this Plot. As to the deplorable Murder of this Nobleman, I need not say any thing of it here, there having been lately some Informations published relating to that Noble Lord's Murder, of that weight, that few honest men now doubt of the said Earls having been Assassinated and Murdered by barbarous Russians; and I doubt not but in a little time those Bloody Cannibals, the Horrid Actors thereof, shall be brought to condign punishment. Only this I may say, that this was made use of to persuade the Jury of my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s guilt, that one who was engaged in the same Plot, out of a sense of such unpardonable guilt, that he who had received such singular marks of his Majesty's Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour should be so inhumane as to Embark in such a horrid design against his Life, to evite that disgrace that must needs attend him here, had laid violent hands on himself: And this very thing had such influence on the Jury that they brought in my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> Guilty; some of them having since declared that had it not been for this they had found him not Guilty. But when men are forced to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to such unheard-of Villanies to carry on their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and malicious designs, it is easie to imagine what shall be the Fate of those Persons they have a Pique at. And this barbarous Murder of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> in order to gain credit to their Plot, and to be an additional, if not main Evidence against my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> is sufficient with all think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to invalidate this Plot. For they that imployed those Russians knew well enough that if any could expect a Pardon that Earl might, and that besides, his Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such a respect for him, and so firm a persuasion of his Honesty, and consequently, that he would not be engaged in any such Design against his Life, might have doubted of the reality of this Plot, which indeed he did at first (as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37461:10"/>
our Author well observes) having sufficiently known what Counter-plots had been hatched before, and proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and therefore to gain credit to it, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to have redress to such unchristian means; and the success did not deceive them, for after his having been given out by the Inquest for <hi>Felo de se,</hi> his late Majesty did really believe it.</p>
                  <p>The next thing remarkable in my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, that he says in his Hear-say Evidence, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told him, that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was with <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> being conveyed to him by <hi>Rumsey</hi>; who undoubtedly, had he conveyed him to my Lord <hi>Shaftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> would have been admitted with him, he being, as he pretended, so much in the said Earls Councils, and so might have given some account in his Evidence either of what past between them, or at least, that he conveyed the said Lord to my Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> which he does not in the least make mention of. But my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> might say what he pleased, there being no body to contradict him, as to this.</p>
                  <p>Another thing remarkable, is, that upon the Attorney Generals asking my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in these words; <hi>Did he sit there as a Cypher, what did my Lord say</hi>? The said Lord <hi>Howard</hi> answered him in these; <hi>Every one knows my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>is a person of great Judgment, and not very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish in Discourse.</hi> And upon Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>But did he consent?</hi> My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> answered; <hi>We did not put it to the Vote, but it went without contradiction, and I took it, that all there gave their consent.</hi> Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. So that here was no positive Evidence that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> gave his consent, but only that my Lord took it so; so that all that was Sworn here against my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was, that he was present when such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was talkt, and because he did not say any thing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37461:11"/>
therefore my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> believed he consented to it. So that had those Gentlemen of the Jury had the least Grain either of Conscience or common Sense, they would not have brought in this Nobleman of High Treason upon such Evidence as this, seeing (as the said Lord says in his last Speech) this could be termed no more than Misprision.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the said Lord <hi>Howard</hi> declares, that there was no way condescended upon for raising of Money, which yet must be the first step to Levying War, the main point of his Indictment that what Evidence was given concerned.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, what I could observe from this Tryal, the Evidence that came in for this Noble Lord were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have invalidated that of my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> against him, for they declared that the said Lord <hi>H.</hi> in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with hands lifted up to Heaven, and with great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severations protested that he knew nothing against my Lord <hi>Russel.</hi> Now I appeal to all the World (how strongly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Court carried it otherwise) whether a Man that dare solemnly appeal to God as to any Mans Innocence, if he afterwards Swear against him, be not formally perjured. For pray what is it that constitutes Perjury? Not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Judge I hope, for if a Judge meerly asks a Man a question, and he answer with a Lye, no Man can call him perjured; but his adjuring him by God and all that is Sacred. Now that a Man can do this to himself, is evident from the Holy Scripture, and has been ever acknowledged by all Casuists, that whosoever privately takes Gods Name to a falshhood, is equally Guilty of Perjury as if he did it before a Judge. Nor were any of the Kings Council able to answer this Objection; for all that they say about it in summing up the Evidence, is my Lords not revealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them; whereas here was more than a not granting of it, which he might easily have done as effectually, and much more safely by waving it, and saying, How should
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37461:11"/>
he know? or what did it concern him? or some such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, by which he might have been sufficiently secured from their informing against him; and not had recourse to such an Expression as this, As I shall Answer to God, I know nothing against him.</p>
                  <p>And thus much as to the Tryal of this Noble Lord. By which the Reader may sufficiently see what an honest Jury he had, who without any valid Evidence could contrary both to the Law of God and Man condemn this Innocent Nobleman.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiss in the next place to hint at some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Tryal, whose Jury though not the same Men, yet were of the same Loyal Consciences; the Crimes laid to his Charge were Levying of War, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring the Death of the King, and writing a Treasonable Book. Now it could not be said that those were two Overt Acts in the same Treason, for he might have writ that Book, and yet not conspire against the Life of the King; and besides, 'tis more than probable that Book was writ long before there were any such Designs or Discourses on foot, and therefore both particulars ought to have been proved by two Witnesses; whereas for the former, though to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess the Jury there were two or three Hear-say Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evidence only was positive; and though there was Evidence enough to have invalidate his, yet the Court was pleased not only not to take any notice of it, but even to discourage and check them; there were besides those who appeared at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal several others brought, proving the above said Asseverations, one of L.<hi>H</hi>'s intimate Friends declaring, That if he had been upon his Oath before the King he could not have more firmly believed him. The same Witness said that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof he had at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal had made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get some particulars (which shews what Ingenuity was in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37461:12"/>
the Gentlemen of the Court when any Person was before them they had a mind to bring in Guilty.) And when the same Gentleman in the Conclusion said according to his Conscience, That if he were of that Gentleman's Jury he would not believe him, Mr. Attorney was pleased to say, <hi>That he ought to be bound to good Behaviour for it.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> another Witness for Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> deposed, that when he asked my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Six Weeks before his Tryal why he had not his Pardon, his Lordship replyed, <hi>I can ascribe it to no other reason; but I must not have my Pardon till the drudgery of Swearing is over.</hi> One would think the Jury might have considered that a Man under so strong a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as Swearing for Life is, might be easily induced to stretch things to the utmost, if not to go beyond the Truth; and therefore should not have laid so much stress upon his Evidence. Then <hi>Trace</hi> and <hi>Penwick</hi> declared that my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> protested before God, Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> knew nothing of it; and the former declared, that he likewise said Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Goods might be sent to his House. And the latter, that he desired to have his Plate, and promised to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it for him. As for the other part of his Indictment, the Book which was found in his Closet (though the same Book now would not be accounted so Heretical, especially if it were not cull'd out in pieces here and there, but read as continued with the rest of the Matter of the Book, that then so much preacht up Loyalty, which was nothing else but a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to Popery and Slavery, whereof we have had sufficient experience since, being abated several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, Reason having got some more Ascendant over it) all the proof of this was, that some Gentlemen deposed, that they believed it was his hand, which is no full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Law (as has been admitted in other cases.) But besides, one Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> declared, that it was so easie a Hand, that if he had but any of those Sheets of Paper for a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37461:12"/>
small time, he would undertake to imitate it so as they should not know which is which. But this was taken no notice of. But this Labour of calling in Witnesses might have been well spared: For it might have easily been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen that those who had confirmed the Belief of their Plot by the Treacherous and (that wants a due name to express the heinousness of it) Assassination of one Nobleman, and made that a means to take off another by such Law as was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed then, would not let it suffer in its Reputation by his being cleared, though they had had no other than Hear-say Evidence. And had an Angel been sent from Heaven to give in Evidence for him, they would have observed the same advice which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave as to new Doctrines, <hi>viz. Not received it.</hi> And well they might, for there was never a Plot of such advantage to them as this was, which took off those who were for stripping them of their <hi>Diana</hi> Madam Arbitrary.</p>
                  <p>As to Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> none will deny but he had very hard measure dealt him; for when he pleaded the Statute of 6 <hi>Edward</hi> 6th. which allows that before Sentence be pronounced upon an Outlawry, a year must expire, yet though the year was not expired, he was condemned upon it. Nor was it to the purpose what the then Chief Justice answered, to wit, that he had not delivered himself up; for he ought to have had the full time allowed him that was mentioned in that Statute, before Execution should be awarded. And when Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> desired the benefit of the Law, he after a domineering manner insulted over this Gentleman in his Misery, ordering him to be Executed on <hi>Friday</hi> next according to Law; whereas I suppose there's no Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> deserves to have the full benefit of the Law in his own sense more than his Lordship.</p>
                  <p>The last of the Persons Executed for this Plot, was Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff <hi>Cornish,</hi> of whose Tryal I need not say any thing, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37461:13"/>
the whole Nation is sufficiently sensible of the hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he was served with; who making more solemn Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God for Vindication of his Innocency, has brought down the Vengeance of God upon some of the Jury alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there being three our four of them who have died sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unnatural deaths, the last of whom is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; (<hi>viz.</hi> the Vintner on <hi>Fish-street-Hill,</hi> the same person who in the beginning of the last Summer (by his stingy covetous humour) occasioned the Death of that worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Charles Pynn</hi>) who having been present at the late dreadful Fire in <hi>Thames-street,</hi> was, at the blowing up of a House, killed by a piece of Timber, by Carpenters called the <hi>Cornish.</hi> It may not be amiss here to insert a Passage of Sheriff <hi>Cornish</hi> and his Son, with my L. <hi>Howard</hi>; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whom encountred with my Lord at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> about the time the heat was in chusing Sheriffs, and going into a Tavern with his Lordship, he endeavoured to inflame this Gentleman against the Government, with all the specious pretexts he could, telling him the Citizens were Asses; that it was in their own power to redress themselves, if they would; but the Gentleman replied, that it was their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to mind their own private Affairs and Trade, and not to meddle with matters of Government; he being wary, and not so easily to be brought in as might be supposed. The Gentleman going home, gave account of it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who forbid his Son the said Lord's company. The other, of the Sheriff himself was thus; My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> a little after dined at Sheriff <hi>Cornish</hi>'s House; and after dinner my Lord desired to speak with him in private, but Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff <hi>Cornish</hi> refused, telling his Lordship, if he had any thing to say that was lawful, he might freely speak in presence of the company; if any thing that was unlawful, he would not hear it; nor would he go into a room with him, lesthis own friends might think that they had some business
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37461:13"/>
betwixt them that might not be talkt of before company; so that the said Lord had at that time no private discourse with him; and suspecting him more, he gave a Watch word to his Brethren the Aldermen that were for the preserving the Privileges of the City, and were therefore hated at Court, to have a care of coming into my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s company, for that he was sure he had a design of ensnaring some People. So that had it not been for Mr. <hi>Cornish,</hi> it's like we should have had some of the Aldermen brought in as Actors in this Plot.</p>
                  <p>As to what our Author says as to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being privy to the pretended Assassination of the King; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he basely asperses him; for there is no positive Evidence for this in his whole History. For Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> in his further Information, page 14. of the Copies of Informations, says, that when it was asked by some present, whether the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would not revenge his Fathers Death, that <hi>Ferguson</hi> undertook to have it under the Duke's hand against the next Meeting, and that when they met again, he told them there was no saying any such thing to the Duke: A plain Evidence that the Duke knew nothing of that design. And whereas my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> in his Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his former Information, page 72. of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations (by the Title you may observe that, as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man declared at Mr <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Tryal, this was part of his Drudgery-work) has these words; <q>About the 10th or 12th of <hi>October,</hi> after a stop put to the then intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told me, that he had seriously thought of it, meaning the Insurrection, and that after diverse ways proposed and seriously considered of, he was clearly of opinion that there was nothing so easie to be accomplished, nor so probable to do the Work so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as to fall in upon the King about <hi>New-Market</hi> [<hi>Observe, not the</hi> Rye-House] with a smart Party of Horse,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37461:14"/>
about forty or fifty, which he said he could soon have in a readiness. To which I answered, That I was of the same Opinion, but whether or not it would be decent for him to appear in person in an Attack to be made when the King was in person, deserved his consideration. Two days after I spoke to him of it again, and askt him what thoughts he had of it; he answered me, that it could not be brought about soon enough.</q> In his Deposition at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal, page 45 he has these words;
<q>And this had carried it to the latter end of <hi>October.</hi> About the 17th or 18th Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> came to me and told me, now they were resolved positively to Rise, and did believe that a smart Party would meet with some Great Men. Thereupon I told the Duke of it; I met him in the Street, and went out of my Coach into his, and told him, That there was some dark Intimation, as if there might be some Attempt upon the King's Person; with that he struck his Breast with a great Emotion of Spirit, and said, God so, Kill the KING! I will never suffer that. Then he went to the <hi>Play-House</hi> to find Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and sent him up and down the City to put it off, as they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and it was done with that success, that we were all quieted in our minds that at that time nothing could be done.</q> Now I desire the Reader to judge how these two Depositions can be reconciled together: and yet betwixt the one passage and the other, according to his Deposition, but four or five days intervene. I do not know if any things so contradictory are to be found in Dr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, for which he has been enjoyned four years severe Penance. These are all the Depositions I could meet with that relate as to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being privy to the Assassination of His Majesty; and the former, to wit, that of Coll. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> seems to acquit him from being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy thereto. And as for my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s, the one accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37461:14"/>
him as guilty of it, and the other plainly acquits him. So that had the Author of that History been at the pains to peruse my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal, he would have had so much respect either to his own, or the Credit of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, as to have left out this passage in my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Supplement.</p>
                  <p>As to the Depositions taken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I cannot think any of them valid in Law, nor will any reasonable Man, when he considers what Tortures two of them were put to there, which were nothing inferior to those of the <hi>Spanish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Carstairs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Spence</hi>; the latter of whom had first his Leg put into the Boot (an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there never much in use till of late, wherein they put in their Leg, and drive in Wedges till the Bone is bruised) afterwards his two Thumbs were put in an Instrument they call Tomikins, wherewith they squeezed them till the Bones were likewise bruised; which any Body may know must needs cause exquisite pains, and then he was kept ten or eleven days without sleep, there having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly been by him day and night two Sentinels with Iron pricks to keep him from sleeping, who, when-ever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to slumber job'd him with those Iron pricks. Now a Gentleman tortured in this manner you may be sure, though he endured so long a time that he extracted Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration even from his Enemies, though their cruel Hearts harboured no such Guests as Pity and Compassion, yet he could not long subsist, and therefore was necessitated to condescend to their Demands: Mr. <hi>Carstairs</hi> though he was exempted from the Boot, as may be, supposing him none of the best of Horsemen, yet his Thumbs severely paid of it, they having squeezed them thirteen or fourteen times; the pain whereof did so torture him, that, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his shrieks might have been heard a quarter of a Mile off, and when he was wearied out with their Cruelty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37461:15"/>
he promised to confess to them what he knew, provided they would not make use of it against any man, which they did; and yet they made use of it against Mr. <hi>Bailie</hi> of <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viswood</hi>: And they not only broke their promise to him, but also left out and put in sentences and words, (may be to make it better sense, that our Author might have the less Trouble in composing his History) which mightily altered the sense of his Deposition, and taught them to speak more of a Plot than ever he did himself. And the said Mr. <hi>Carstares,</hi> after having acquainted his Friends, as I have heard it of several of their own Mouths (knowing that having been so Ingenuous as to tell his Friends how he had been abused in this particular, he might have been brought before my Lord's Inquisitors, to have been examined again) quickly withdrew himself from that Kingdom. Now as to the rest of the Evidence there, you may easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that they, seeing what treatment those two had, would take what care they could to save themselves from the like; and so what pain might extort from the former, fear might do the same from them. And if served in their Evidence as Mr. <hi>Carstare</hi>'s was, they durst not say any thing against it, as remaining still there, and so further questionable for it.</p>
                  <p>By what has been above said, it plainly appears that there was no design of taking off the King concluded upon in either of their Meetings, but that it was first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in discourse by the Evidence, as the most compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way to free themselves and the Nation from the Fears they at that time were possessed with; but that very few of the rest ever assented to so barbarous a design, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their greatest detestation of it; nor can they be blamed so much for not discovering of it, especially seeing they knew it could not be accomplished without their Aid. Nor is it probable that either my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> or any of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37461:15"/>
their Club, had it ever directly communicated to them, whatever my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would suggest to the contrary, in the words immediately following those last mentioned in my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Tryal; <hi>viz.</hi> that upon the day that the King came from <hi>New-Market</hi> they dined together, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> with others being there, <hi>that a Notion was conveyed among them</hi> (by whom he does not mention, and therefore 'tis most probable 'twas done by himself) <hi>that some bold Action should be done that day,</hi> which, says he, comparing it with the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they concluded it was designed upon the King, and that my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> affirmed with an Oath, that if they attempted any such thing it could not fail. <hi>That they were in great Anxiety of Mind</hi> till they heard the King's Coach was come to Town, and that Sir <hi>Tho. Armstrong</hi> not being there, he was supposed to be one of the Party. Now why such a Notion should be conveyed among them at that time, I cannot understand; (especially when it was false, there having been no preparation made thereto, except it was <hi>conveyed</hi> to ensnare them) and that by his Lordship himself; and I am apt to think, that, to use his own words in his Supplement, this might be the first time it was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that when his Lordship could not have such entertainment for it amongst those Lords as he wished, he committed it to his Brethren the Evidences, to have the <hi>Notion conveyed by them</hi> to the others, who he thought would entertain it more favourably. One thing the Reader may take notice of, that his Lordships words in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, are very ambiguous, and may be taken in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral senses, particularly these words, <hi>We were in great Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Mind, till we heard the King's Coach was come in,</hi> &amp;c. But I shall not further trouble the Reader with it, not doubting but that every honest English man is by this time satisfied of the Innocency of all the Gentlemen that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37461:16"/>
suffered, as to the pretended design of taking off the late King.</p>
                  <p>As to the other part of the Accusation; <hi>viz.</hi> Levying War, with design to alter the Government; if every thing be duly weighed, we shall find this nothing near as it was represented to be, tho' there is not the least doubt but they have had some Consultations among them as to the securing their Religion and Properties, in a time when there were such apparent dangers hanging over their Heads, and that in those Meetings many things might be proposed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> But that Noble-men of that Integrity and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> were, should be concerned in any design to overturn the Government, no man that was ever intimate with them will believe. It is too plain now that those whom it most concerned to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Government and Established Religion, were the persons that made the greatest breaches therein, and that their Illegal Proceedings gave just ground of fear and suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a design on foot by them to overturn the old Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, and to introduce Popery and Slavery: For in the first place, the Popish Plot was endeavoured by all means to be stifled, and several attempts made to turn it upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; and tho' it pleased God several times to bring to Light their hidden Contrivances, yet were they still coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by Authority; and tho' there had been some of the Branches lopt off, yet all persons that were not wholly blinded, might easily have seen that the Body it self remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed untouched, yea rather cherished. And it is well known how those that were most active against it were discountenanced. Parliaments were dissolved and laid aside, as finding that it was impossible to support that Cause, and carry on their Designs so long as that great Court fate. All underhand means were used to divide Protestants among themselves, and to stir up Feuds and Animosities between them, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37461:16"/>
they so far prevailed in, that one party of them used their utmost endeavour to ruine another, never considering the common Enemy that was hovering over their heads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour both. Manifest Breaches were made upon their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by endeavouring to set up such publick Ministers as would be wholly at the Interest of the Court; issuing out <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s against Cities and Corporations, that they might become wholly in the Power, and at the Devotion of the Court. And this once obtained 'twas easie to imagine what treatment every Honest Protestant might expect. A party was employed, and others by their Rewards allured, to cry up boundless Monarchy, to assert its absolute Power, and that if Kings should Act the greatest Tyrannies, yea greater than ever yet were perpetrated in the World, even against the whole Body of the People, yet it was their bounden Duty to submit, and to hold out their Throats if they had a mind to cut them; yea, that it was one of the most damnable sins that could be committed, for people to use any means for their own preservation. And this, as it was a great Temptation to Princes, while they hoped by this means to carry on whatsoever designs they pleased, and made them assume the boldness to Act things which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would never have hazarded upon, so it could not but be very terrifying to all those who had not quite shut their Eyes. And this Terror was encreased while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that if it was so with them, even under one who was a profest Protestant Prince, what could they expect when one should rule over them who was wholly abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Counsel of Priests and Jesuits? I say, all these things considered, it is none of the greatest matter of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration if those who had as lively an impression of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and unspeakable danger of being left to the mercy of the Jesuits, as if they had been already sprawling under their feet, were roused up to act some things they had otherwise
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37461:17"/>
never thought of, much more be easily drawn into a snare by such as were set on to trapan them. So that what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs some of those Honest Noblemen and Gentlemen had, and the great Zeal they expressed towards their Religion and Liberties, ought not to have been requited with that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and Disgrace that their Memories have been loaded with by too many of late years. We may easily imagine with our selves, that if it had pleased God to have punished us so far for our sins (which undoubtedly have deserved greater Judgments than were ever yet inflicted upon Mortals) as to have put a stop to our late glorious Preservation, by blasting the Designs of those whom he made use of as Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the final Deliverance of his Church from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies and Idolatries of that Scarlet Whore, those Noble Lords and Gentlemen who joyned in so good and pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, had been maligned and defamed in the same manner; nay, and no doubt had been mete with the same measure they were; and there would not have been wanting Court-Parasites who would have represented them as the basest Miscreants. And yet I hope there is no sincere Protestant, but does, and always did, from his first hearing of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of so glorious an undertaking, and sent up his most ardent Prayers to God Almighty for his Success on so Just an Enterprize, whatever some wicked wretches, who are a stain to Humane Nature, would have persuaded us to the contrary, that so having stript us of what God and the Laws of our Country had conferred upon us for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they might have satiated their barbarous Cruelty with our Blood. And therefore seeing we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World to believe that the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and some other honest Patriots, had no design either against the late King's Person or Government, nor any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster aim before them, but entred upon those Counsels meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Good of the King and People in general, it would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37461:17"/>
be the height of Uncharitableness as well as Ingratitude, to suffer our selves any more to be imposed upon so far, as to give heed to the undeserved Aspersions, the Writer of that History of the Plot, or any other Court Historian hath cast upon them. But I hope there are some now here, who, both as being persons of known Abilities, and likewise such as can give a more particular Account, as having been privy to all of it themselves, will both do those Lords the Justice, and themselves the Favour, as to vindicate their own Innocency, and expose the Falshoods of that History.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I shall only reflect a little on the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of some hot-headed men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> since the pretended Discovery of this Plot, who took occasion thence to inveigh afresh, with all the Raileries that Malice it self could invent, against Protestant Dissenters, representing them as the worst of Men, worse than Papists, yea even than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; and by this means they did so far prevail upon the ignoranter sort of common people, that till this day many of them harbour most uncharitable Sentiments of them; so that 'tis very usual for them to say, that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Papists than Presbyterians. Which very expression is enough to render them Odious to all good Christians, and shews how little they have of that Religion they profess; while they thus malign persons who agree with them in all the Substantials of Religion, meerly because they cannot condescend to the use of some Ceremonies, which all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men have acknowledged to be in themselves indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and which may be used or omitted as the Church shall see expedient, without any sin; and yet have such a favourable Opinion of the Papists, tho' they are guilty of gross Idolatry, and have so corrupted the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as in a great measure to render it useless for that great end for which it was instituted? <hi>viz.</hi> the Salvation of Souls. Nor did their Malice rest in traducing of Dissenters, but they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37461:18"/>
vomited up their Call against most of the Churches abroad, particularly the Church of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those they call damnable Common-wealth Principles. They also cast Dirt in the Face of the most renowned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, such as <hi>Calvin, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> and represented them as the worst of men, meerly because they had written against Arbitrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and Boundless Power; and it is not long since, at the Instigation of those men, (tho' to the great dissatisfaction of all Honest men, and Good Patriots of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) some of their Works were publickly burnt at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> Whereby in effect they strengthned the hands of Papists, and joyned with them in aspersing the Memories of those whom God had made so instrumental in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om the Tyrannies and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently in blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reformation it self. Yea it is too well known how they hated and maligned the Learnedest and Gravest of the Clergy, &amp; the Body of the Discreet &amp; Religious Laity of our own Church, (who, blessed be God, were 3 times their number) and branded them with the Opprobrious name of <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who in effect have under God preserved these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from Bloodshed and Confusion, which must needs have ensued, had those hot-heads had the upper hand, so far as to have filled up the House of Commons in Parliament. And these were the Men who were generally preferred at Court, as being the only persons whose Principles and Interest led them to advance Arbitrary and Despotick Designs. And I may justly say, that next to that Hellish Crew of Jesuits, none have had a greater hand in all the Confusions and Distractions that have been in these Kingdoms for a great many years past than these very men.</p>
                  <p>I might have reflected on their Carriage since our late glorious Deliverance, but since I design'd to confine my self within these bounds I shall forbear, and in the mean while am yours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
