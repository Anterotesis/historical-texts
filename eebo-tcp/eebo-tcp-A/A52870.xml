            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> and the Limits of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> is <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> about 320 Miles upon the vulgar Account, and generally every ſuch Mile is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile and a half of meaſured Miles; and from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> about as much, and ſo may reaſonably be allowed and accounted to be 400 meaſured Miles ſquare (that is <hi>Land</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> together) but by reaſon that the Form, as to the <hi>Land</hi> only, is very irregular, it may be reaſonable to take off for the <hi>Sea</hi> three eight Parts, though that be manifeſtly too much.</p>
               <p>Now where the Form is regular, and all <hi>Land,</hi> 400 meaſured Miles ſquare would contain 160000 ſuch meaſured Miles ſingly ſquare; but cutting off three <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccounted of 100000 ſuch ſingly ſquare meaſured Miles.</p>
               <p>One meaſured Mile ſingly ſquare, contains 640 Statute-Acres, though there were no Hills, but all a Flat, in all 64000000 of Statute-Acres. — I allow or account that at leaſt the one eighth part of this (generally) is Plowed and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owed every year (beſides all that is laid every year Fallow) that is 8000000 of Acres.</p>
               <p>In the now common way (one with the other) they allow at leaſt two <hi>Buſhels</hi> and a half for the Seed for one Statute-Acre, one ſort of Corn and Grain with the other; and ſo 20000000 <hi>Buſhels,</hi> or 2500000 <hi>Quarters</hi> is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one years Seed.</p>
               <p>In my way I allow at moſt but half a <hi>Buſhel</hi> for one Statute-Acre, which is but the fifth part of their allowance; that is 500000 <hi>Quarters</hi>; that is, 2000000 of <hi>Quarters</hi> leſs than what is ſowed in the common way.</p>
               <p>Wheat is commonly (one time and place with the other, at, at leaſt 30 <hi>s. per Quarter,</hi> Rye at 24 <hi>s.</hi> Barly at 20 <hi>s.</hi> and Oats at 12 <hi>s.</hi> ſo all accounted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, comes to above 20 <hi>s.</hi> a <hi>Quarter,</hi> and 2000000 of <hi>Quarters</hi> to 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> which is too much to be caſt away every year, for two <hi>Quarters</hi> is more than enough to ſupport one Perſon all the year with Bread and Drink, and ſo to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port every year 1000000 Perſons, Men, Women, and Children.</p>
               <p>When the Husbandman hath twelve times his Seed again, or more, ſay 32 <hi>Buſhels</hi> or 4 <hi>Quarters,</hi> he counts himſelf in a good proſpering way; and when it is generally ſo, it is a plentiful year, and 4 <hi>Quarters</hi> may be ſo worth 4 <hi>l.</hi> and when every Acre, one with the other in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. yields 4 <hi>l.</hi> that is for 8000000 Acres 32000000 <hi>l.</hi> for an Increaſe of the Stock, or Wealth of the Kingdom in this Part, that is by Tillage only.</p>
               <p>In my way (though at double Charge to the common way, as by a ſtrange miſtake it is accounted) I have ſufficient cauſe to hope, and in all Submiſſion to Gods Will to be certain that every Acre, one with the other, ſhall yield 10 <hi>l.</hi> and clear 4. <hi>l.</hi> So that if 8000000 of Acres were Ploughed and Sowed my way, the Crops (according to but the former account) would be worth 80000000, and the <hi>Tythes</hi> 8000000, and the 4 <hi>l. per Acre</hi> cleared, amounts to 3200000 <hi>l.</hi> That is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Kingdom would be enriched 24000000 ever year more than in the common <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay.</p>
               <p>But I expect to have it objected, that if my way was generally uſed upon <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>000000 of Acres, it would be too great Cheapneſs and Plenty, which (though <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t be hard that men ſhould repine at Plenty, which is a Bleſſing from God) may be thus prevented — by Tilling leſs — ſay by 3200000 of the 8000000 of Acres aforeſaid, and laying down 4800000 Acres — And thus the Ballance between the common way and mine, would be about even, and the Kingdom as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, as now it may be judged to be, as aforeſaid, and the <hi>Tythes</hi> as much, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly not ſo much ſaved out of the Seed, though as much proportionably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That if there were found or made Manure enough (competently) for 8000000 of Acres before, when 4800000 Acres ſhall be laid down for other Uſes, and conſequently more Cattel of all ſorts, and ſo more Manure; and but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>00000 Acres in Tillage to be there with enriched, the Land muſt neceſſarily be made more Fertile, and productive of better Crops than formerly.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That if 4800000 Acres be taken from Tillage, and laid down for other uſes, it will be long, (if ever, the more barren part of it eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) before it can be brought to produce good Graſs for Paſturage or Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grounds — To this I truly Anſwer, That I do certainly know how to make it bear indifferent good Graſs the very firſt Year, and better and more yearly for many Years after.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, That Tillage imploys more Hands than other ſorts of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: And that by ſo leſſening the Tillage, great Numbers of the poorer ſort will be undone for want of Work — To this I anſwer faithfully and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, That I know divers honeſt, beneficial, and not enſlaving ways, which if proſecuted (as I could demonſtrate in act, were I in Stock ſufficient) may ſet not only all the Poor in <hi>England,</hi> but five times more, if we had them to work all the Year.</p>
               <p>All thoſe that out of a Generous and Noble Love to, and Zeal for the Publick Good, ſhall freely Contribute what they pleaſe, more or leſs, (I need not ſay any more, but that Vertuous Deeds are their own moſt proper Reward) and he that loves the publick good, deſerves Love, Honour and Thanks from all; and in this caſe from me peculiarly.</p>
               <p>And for thoſe that ſhall advance any thing more or leſs, for obtaining a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Profit to themſelves; this buſineſs in my Management, ſhall and will afford to them 20 <hi>l.</hi> for each 100 <hi>l. p. annum</hi> for ſo many Years as ſhall be agreed on, and their Money again at the end of thoſe Years.</p>
               <p>Thoſe three great Difficulties (which I hope) this Paper rightly conſidered will take off, are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though I mean moſt Faithfully, I cannot give ſuch Security as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expected in Money matters; my own Faith as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and Honour as a <hi>Gentle-man,</hi> together with my own Bond or Judgment is all I offer, or that the Advancer can reaſonably demand or expect, all things conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Perſons may perhaps have an unkind ſuſpition, that I will not put the Money, to be thus obtained, to this uſe intended — But he that in any good meaſure underſtands that I ſhall have a much more great and certain advantage, by perſuing this courſe (having fit encouragement) than by any other that can be taken, will eaſily believe; that Self-Intereſt will deny that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether in my way there may be produced 10 <hi>l. per</hi> Acre, <hi>per annum.</hi> one with the other — The anſwer and demonſtration of this you ſhall be fully ſatisfied in, when you ſhall come and fairly diſcourſe it with me; for it would be too long and inconvenient to enlarge upon that here; and then you will find it to be a moſt Evident Truth — And whoever gets over theſe three firſt Stiles, hath no cauſe of any other Doubt or Objection.</p>
               <p>My now Lodging is in <hi>White-Friars</hi> at Mr. <hi>Standen's</hi> Houſe next Door to the <hi>Golden Bottle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where whoſoever (having read this Paper, and rightly conſidered it) ſhall incline to be concerned in any way, may find me, or by leaving a Note ſealed for me, appointing ſome certain time and place, I ſhall meet accordingly to ſuch juſt Directions — For it would be equal to <hi>Hercules</hi> his Labours, for me, among ſuch vaſt Numbers and various Humours, to ſeek and find, fit, and willing Perſons to be concerned with me in this great buſineſs.</p>
               <p>If any Pious, Generous Perſon ſhould happen to fall ſick before he hath had time fully and effectually to conſider of this Paper and its Contents, in caſe he ſhould dye, may do an Excellent and Hourable Work, to appoint in their Wills expreſly—So that ſuch Legacy may be ſure to come to my Hands, and be rightly and duly paid me, without delay, ſuit or trouble, which the very Nature of this buſineſs is againſt — ſuch Legacy, be it more or leſs, will tend to the advancing this Buſineſs to its proper height and beſt Perfection.</p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to underſtand theſe Truths, that the <hi>Propoſer</hi> is a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and was a Col. of Horſe in his late Majeſties Armies; Hath been ſeveral times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by, or for his Fidelity, having loſt a conſiderable Eſtate he had in Poſſeſſion, and a greater he had Right to; hath ſerved and ſuffered about forty three Years, and not yet effectually relieved, which is the cauſe he wants Stock to carry on this great and good Work without help; And therefore takes this courſe to obtain a conſiderable Stock, and all that ſhall Contribute to it any way, ſhall thereby Advance a publick good, Augment (if they engage in it that way) their own Intreſts or Eſtates, and raiſe a deep Sufferer and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily out of his undeſerved Ruins — which even alone is a Noble act, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together much more.</p>
