            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

want of skill to reade thoſe

God often writes in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer

when voyages prove long,

            <p>I have endevoured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this ſmall Treatiſe to
convince beleevers of the
grand importance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is ſo full of gaine:
To diſcover likewiſe the
cauſes of the neglect herein,
and remove the temptations
and diſcouragements which
doe occaſion it; and have
<pb facs="tcp:18137:13"/>
briefly reſolved ſuch caſes
as doe more uſually occurre
in the practiſe of it. But
principally, my deſire was to
give in ſome few experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and obſervations,
which may help to teach the
weaker ſort, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to reade, yet here and
there to ſpell, (and eſpecially
out of the impreſsions in
their own hearts) Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
towards them in his
anſwers. I have caſt in ſome
ſcattered calculations of
broken praiers caſt up, which
though they wil not amount,
to make generall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Tables out of, yet may
ſerve, as Inſtances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
for yong beginners,
to direct them in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of this moſt uſefull skill,
<pb facs="tcp:18137:13"/>

and ballance their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
by comparing their
<hi>prayers</hi> and their <hi>returnes</hi>
together.</p>
            <p>This ſmall and imperfect
embryon, I have preſumed to
ſend forth into the world;
and directed it firſt of all to
preſent its ſervice unto <hi>you;</hi>
and make an honourable and
thankefull mention of <hi>your</hi>

that which emboldned me
was the neere affinity which
meditations of this nature
doe hold, with thoſe other
<hi>your</hi> more retired thoughts
<hi>you</hi> thinke to none but <hi>God</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>Pſalme</hi> was
penned, in the

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18137:19"/>
Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> both
as a Prophecie of, and a
Prayer for their returne
out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and the flowing in
again of that ancient glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
peace, adminiſtration
of Juſtice, liberty of Gods
Ordinances, plenty and
increaſe, which formerly
they enjoyed, but had
now ſuffered an ebbe of
ſeventy yeares continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And firſt he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with Prayer, from
the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> to this wee
have in hand, putting the
Lord in minde of, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Him with His graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
dealings in former
times unto His Church:
this is not the firſt time
(ſaith he) that the Church
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18137:19"/>
hath beene in Captivity,
and that thou haſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, (as out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
&amp;c.) and therefore wee
hope that thou wilt doe ſo
againe; <hi>Thou haſt beene fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
unto thy Land,</hi> &amp;c.
His Prayer being finiſhed
and hee having ſpoke, he
now ſtands, and liſtens, as
you uſe to doe when you
expect an Eccho, what
Eccho hee ſhould have,
what anſwer would bee
returned from Heaven,
whither his Prayer had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, <hi>I will heare
what the Lord will ſpeake:</hi>
or as ſome reade it, <hi>I heare
what the Lord doth ſpeake:</hi>
for ſometimes there is a
preſent Eccho, a ſpeedy
anſwer returned to a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18137:20"/>
mans heart, even ere the
Prayer is halfe finiſhed, as
unto <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9. 20. 21.
And in briefe it is this,
<hi>The Lord will ſpeake peace
unto His people:</hi> this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

               <p>The obſervation is this;

to bee obſerved. <hi>I will

that is, how Hee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
them: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he confidently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
an aſſurance, that <hi>God
will ſpeake peace.</hi> Thus
doth the Church, <hi>Mich. 7.
7, 8. I will looke to the Lord,
I will wait, my God will
heare mee:</hi> Shee was both
ſure of gracious audience
with Him, <hi>my God will

<hi>I will looke to the Lord:</hi> and

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18137:21"/>
hee having made a

<hi>Ioh. 5. 14, 15. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

an enemy, but to

<hi>hearing</hi> there meant; and
is ſo uſed in our ordinary

that he hath the
Kings eare; and if a man
bee <hi>obſtinate</hi> to a mans
<hi>counſell,</hi> we ſay, <hi>hee would
not heare,</hi> though hee give
the hearing; ſo here, <hi>to
heare</hi> is a word of gracious
inclination to doe the
thing required; and thus
<hi>Gods eares</hi> are ſaid to bee
<hi>open to their prayers;</hi> and ſo
it followes there, that <hi>if
he heareth us, whatſoever we

of Him.</hi> Aſſoone as wee
have prayed, wee are ſaid
<hi>to have our petitions,</hi> that is,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18137:23"/>
they are then granted, and
we may be confident they
are aſſented unto by <hi>God;</hi>
although in regard of

when the <hi>word of the King

done, though it paſſeth
not the ſeale, or bee not

And like as when a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the act is committed, ſo
ſoone <hi>doth ſentence</hi> from
God goe forth againſt the

as the words imply,

when a godly man praies,
that as ſoone as the praier

prophecy,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that not a

ought to bee of <hi>Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
not a word of them
ſhould fall to the ground:</hi> as
there doth, if you by your

therunto catch them not
(as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants are
ſaid to doe <hi>Ahabs</hi> words,)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18137:27"/>
apprehend, and obſerve
them not: &amp; by the ſame
reaſon, that you are to
obſerve the fulfilling of
<hi>Gods</hi> promiſes, you are of
your prayers alſo: now,
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 56. it is ſaid,
<hi>not one word failed of all hee

this by a particular

and there is
the like reaſon both of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to prayers, (for <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> brings

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18137:27"/>
firme their faith in this,
that no prayers made,
would faile, being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

his owne heart to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence

the <hi>Lord</hi> not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

to anſwer, becauſe hee
ſees it will be thus in vain.
When a man is talking to

and leave off ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18137:28"/>
and ſo will <hi>God.</hi> So as
that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
ſaith of <hi>faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 36.</note> that it is <hi>not

<hi>you may inherit the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
may bee alſo ſaid, and
is alike true of praying:
it is not enough to pray,
but after you have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you have need to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
for an anſwer, that
you may receive your
prayers; <hi>God</hi> will not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill

<hi>the Sermon was not done,</hi>
when yet the Preacher
had done, becauſe it is not
done, till practiſed: ſo our
prayers are not done,
when yet made, but you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18137:28"/>
muſt further waite for,
and attend the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</p>
               <p>5. If you obſerve not

bleſſe <hi>God,</hi> and returne
thankes to him for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your prayers: <hi>Pſal.
116. 1, 2. I love the Lord,
becauſe hee hath heard my
voice, and my ſupplication,</hi>
and therefore he goes on
to thanke him, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Pſalme.
You <hi>are to watch unto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with thankſgiving:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note> and
therefore, as to watch, to
obſerve, and recollect
your owne wants, which
you are to pray for, that
you may have matter of
requeſts to put up, ſo alſo
to obſerve Gods anſwers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18137:29"/>
for matter of thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
and many fill that
common place head full
of matter, to furniſh them
for petitioning, but as for
this other of thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
they watch not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it againſt they come to
pray, nor ſtudy matter for
that head alſo; and if any
ſtudy will furniſh you this
way, it is the ſtudying out
of Gods anſwers to your
prayers: The reaſon you
pray ſo much, and give
thankes ſo little, is, that
you minde not Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers:
you doe not ſtudy
them. When we have put
up a faithfull prayer, God
is made our debtor by
promiſe, and wee are to
take notice of his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18137:29"/>
and give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the

               <p>6. As God loſeth,<note place="margin">

of GOD and his

cauſe in you, hope and

of one eminent in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
upon occaſion of the

<hi>I have tryed</hi> God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18137:30"/>
                  <hi>often, now</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
I will truſt him;</hi> if the
hearing the prayers of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
will encourage us
to goe to <hi>God,</hi> (as <hi>Pſal. 33.
5. For this cauſe ſhall every
one that is godly pray unto
thee)</hi> much more when
we obſerve, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
that our owne
are heard: Therefore
(ſayes <hi>David) Pſal. 116.
1, 2. The Lord hath heard
me, and I will call upon him
as long as I live:</hi> as if hee
had ſaid, Now that <hi>God</hi>
hath heard mee, now I
know what to doe: this
experiment, if I had no
more, is enough to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me for ever to pray
unto God: I have learned
by it to call upon him,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18137:30"/>
as long as I live. And alſo
2. by obſerving Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to your prayers,<note place="margin">2. Of our owne hearts and wayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</note>
you will gaine much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
into your own harts,
and wayes, and prayers;
and may thereby learne
how to judge of them. So
<hi>Pſal. 66. 18, 19. Davids</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
iniquity in his heart,
was ſtrengthned by Gods
having heard his prayers:
for thus he reaſons, <hi>If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
iniquity in my heart,</hi>
God <hi>will not heare me: But</hi>
God <hi>hath heard me.</hi> For 1.
if God doth not grant
your petitions, it will put
you to ſtudy a reaſon of
that his dealing: &amp; ſo you
will come to ſearch into
your prayers, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18137:31"/>
of your hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to ſee whether you <hi>did
not pray amiſſe;</hi> according
to that, <hi>Ye luſt &amp; have not,
becauſe ye aske amiſſe, Iames</hi>
4. 3. As if you ſend to a
friend, who is punctuall in
that point of friendſhip
of returning anſwers, and
uſeth not to faile, and you
receive no anſwer from
him, you will beginne to
thinke there is ſomething
in it: And ſo alſo here,
When a Petition is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you will be jealous of
your ſelves, &amp; inquiſitive,
What ſhould be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſo by that ſearch
come to ſee <hi>that</hi> in your
prayers, which you will
learne to mend the next
time. Or 2. if they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18137:31"/>
yet becauſe that
therein uſually <hi>God</hi> deales
in a proportion with you
to your prayers, (as you
might perceive if you
would obſerve his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with you) you would
by this meanes come to
have much inſight into
<hi>Gods</hi> acceptation, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of your wayes:
For you ſhould ſee His
dealings with you, and
yours with Him, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
parallel and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent,
and hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
each with other.
So <hi>Pſal. 18. 6. In my diſtreſſe
I called upon the Lord,</hi> and
ſo <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8, &amp;c. hee goes
on to deſcribe his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which was the fruit

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18137:32"/>
at 20, 21. <hi>verſes,</hi> &amp;c. hee
addes his obſervation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </p>
               <p>7. You will loſe much

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. We ſhall loſe much comfort.</note> there is
no greater joy than to ſee

<hi>Iohn 16. 24. Aske and you

anſwers makes joy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
and overflow. Yea,
even when we pray for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if our prayers be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
for them, our joies
are exceeding great; much
more when in our owne
behalfe: and therein, even
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18137:32"/>
in the ſmalleſt things
which a Chriſtian doth
enjoy, doth his comfort
exceed anothers, that hee
hath them by vertue of
prayers, and promiſes: he
knowes how hee came by
them; <hi>If ſtolne waters bee
ſweet, And bread eaten in

                  <note place="margin">Pro. 9. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies)
to wicked men; <hi>beg'd meat
is much more ſweet</hi> to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men: yea, in the very
praying for outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
there is more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
than they have in
enjoying them. As it is
joy to a good heart to ſee
any one converted, but
much more to him that
is the meanes of it. <hi>I have
no greater joy</hi> (ſaies S. <hi>Iohn)
then that my children walke
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18137:33"/>
in truth:</hi> So to ſee God
doe good to his Church,
and heare others prayers
is a comfort, but much
more to ſee him do it at a
mans own praiers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when God reſtores
comfort to a drooping
ſoule, he is ſaid, <hi>Eſay 57. To
reſtore comfort alſo to his
mourners,</hi> that is, to thoſe
that prayed and mourned
for him, as well as unto
that ſoule it ſelfe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a comfort to them to
ſee their praiers anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Comfort it is many
wayes: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The heare from
God; as to heare from a
friend, though it bee but
two or three words, and
that about a ſmall matter,
if there be at the bottome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18137:33"/>
this ſubſcription, <hi>Your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Father,</hi> or, <hi>Your aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
friend,</hi> it ſatisfies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly:
ſo alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To know
that God is mindfull of us,
accepts our works, fulfills
his promiſes: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> How doth
it rejoice one to find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his mind in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie:
but that <hi>God</hi> and
we ſhould be <hi>of one mind,</hi>
and concurre in the deſire
of the ſame things;<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>not two
in the earth onely agree,</hi> but
<hi>God</hi> who is in heaven and
we to agree, this rejoiceth
the heart exceedingly.
And thus it is when a man
perceives his prayer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
Therfore you loſe
much of your comfort in

the prayers of the Church
for three hundred yeeres
in the Primitive times,
That <hi>Kings</hi> might <hi>come to

the knowledge of the truth,</hi>

Thou ſhalt <hi>raiſe up the

have influence into many

there are <hi>bottles of teares</hi> a

and that may bee one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

why God will do ſuch

overflowes and runs over,
that he will heare us, not
onely for our ſelves, but
for others alſo: which is
a ſigne we are in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
favour. So <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
concerning <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>

as for our ſelves, ſo for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, to <hi>God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
and it is a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

made us Kings and Prieſts,</hi>

token and pledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

God heares a mans pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for others, much more
for himſelfe in his owne

Onely as where God hath
ſet his Ordinance of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
it is more then a
probable ſigne hee hath
ſome to convert, and
uſually the word takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſome, though often
but a few: So when hee
hath ſtirred up our hearts
to pray for others, it is a
ſigne God will heare us
for ſome of thoſe we pray
for: yet ſo as we may be
denied. For God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it as a duty on our
parts, becauſe it is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes ordained by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18137:42"/>
God, by which ſometimes
Hee uſeth to bring things
to paſſe: but yet not as ſuch
a certaine, and infallible
meanes, as hee hath tied
himſelfe univerſally unto,
to bring the thing to paſſe
on his part.</p>
               <p>And though indeed his
promiſe to heare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the praier is generall
and univerſal:<note place="margin">Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to hear us for others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall.</note> yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to heare it, by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the very thing it ſelfe
praied for, is but an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
promiſe; ſuch as he
makes to other meanes
of doing men good, as to
our admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes,
and to our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
&amp;c. <hi>Hee makes ſuch
promiſes, becauſe ſometimes
hee doth heare</hi> and convert
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18137:43"/>
by them. For inſtance, that
<hi>promiſe, Iam. 5. 15. of healing
the ſick,</hi> cannot be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall:
for it might then be
ſuppoſed as a truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

ſuppoſed that the Elders
may at all ſuch times of

the meaning is, that it is
an Ordinance, which God
hath made a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
unto, becauſe <hi>he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
doth reſtore the ſick
at their praiers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon every ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
occaſion, wee are
to rely upon God for the
performance of it, by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18137:43"/>
an act of recumbencie;
though with an act of full
aſſurance that we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>Of the like nature are all

               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed, that

then hee is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it thus in particular:
as when Hee gave power
to any to work miracles,
(as to his Apoſtles Hee
did, with a Commiſſion
to work them,) then they
were bound to beleeve
that ſuch and ſuch a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
ſhould infallibly bee
wrought by them; as that
the Devils ſhould be caſt
out by them, &amp;c. And
therefore in this caſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18137:47"/>
Chriſt rebukes His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
for not beleeving
thus upon ſuch particular
occaſions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 20.
And then it is alſo true,
that if God give ſuch a

ſo that, when God works
ſuch a faith, and wee are
called to it, we are bound
to beleeve with a certain
perſwaſion that ſuch a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18137:48"/>
thing will be done, and it
ſhall bee done: but unto
ſuch a kinde of ſpeciall
faith in temporall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

God doth not now
alwayes call us. If indeed
at any time wee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
and doubted not, by

wrought by God, that
GOD would remove a

or beſtow any outward
mercy, it ſhould be done:
for he that ſtirred up ſuch
a <hi>faith,</hi> would accompliſh
the thing: but it is not
that, which God requires
of beleevers, that they
ſhould without doubting
thus beleeve concerning
outward things; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18137:48"/>
thereof being not

and therefore anſwerably
a man is not abſolutely

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18137:59"/>
which was prayed for by
others helping thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
what cauſe haſt thou
but to thinke that it was
granted for thy owne
prayers, and not for
theirs onely? ſeeing God
ſtirred up their hearts to
pray for thee, and gave
thee a heart to pray for
thy ſelfe, and beſides, gave
thee the thing which thou
deſiredſt: which argues
thou art beloved aſwell as
they, and accepted as well
as they. <hi>I know this ſhal turn
to my ſalvation through
your prayers,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,
Phil.</hi> 1. 19. though their
prayers went to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yet had not S. <hi>Paul</hi>
beene accepted himſelfe,
the prayers of all the men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18137:60"/>
in the world, would have
done him but little good.
God may heare the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the godly, for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, when they doe
not pray themſelves, in
temporall things; ſo hee
did heare <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,
Abraham</hi> for <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech;</hi>
and he may heare
godly men the ſooner for
others prayers; ſo hee
heard <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi>
the ſooner, for <hi>Moſes</hi> his
ſake, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 13: But
if God ſtirs up thy heart
to pray for thy ſelfe, as
well as others for thee;
then God that gave thee a
heart to pray, hath heard
thy prayers alſo, and hath
had a reſpect to them
more in it then to theirs,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18137:60"/>

when God beſpeakes a

that is, when God ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

I expreſſe it thus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Pſal. 27. 8. <hi>Thou ſaidſt
ſeeke my face:</hi> and I ſaid,
<hi>Thy face Lord will I ſeeke:</hi>
now God then ſpeakes to
the heart to pray, when
not onely hee puts upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18137:61"/>
the duty by ſaying to the
conſcience, this thou
oughteſt to doe: but
Gods ſpeaking to pray is
ſuch, as his ſpeech at firſt
was, when hee made the
world, when hee ſaid, <hi>Let
there be light, and there was
light:</hi> ſo hee ſayes, Let
there be a prayer, and
there is a prayer, that is,
hee powres upon a man <hi>a
ſpirit of grace and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
a praying diſpoſition;
hee puts in motives, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts
arguments and pleas
to God; all which you
ſhall finde come in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and of themſelves; and
that likewiſe with a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of affections, and
with a lingring, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18137:62"/>
and reſtleſſeneſſe of
ſpirit to bee alone, to
powre out the ſoule to
God, and to vent and
forme thoſe motions and
ſuggeſtions into a prayer,
till you have laid them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and made a prayer
of them. And this is a
<hi>ſpeaking</hi> to the heart: and
obſerve ſuch times when
God doth thus, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them not; then to
ſtrike, whileſt the iron is
hot; thou haſt then his
eare, it is a ſpeciall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſuch an one as thou
mayeſt never have the

<hi>molliſsima fandi tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora,</hi>
their times of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
when they have

thus that phraſe of <hi>Pſal.</hi>
10. 17. is underſtood by
ſome, that <hi>God prepares the
heart, and cauſeth the eare
to heare;</hi> that is, hee faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it, and compoſeth it
into a praying frame. And
ſure it is a great ſigne that
God meanes to heare us,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable urging us to pray, and Gods moving us.</note>

indite the Petition.</p>
               <p>And by the way let me
give this note of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betweene theſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18137:63"/>
                  <hi>ſpeakings</hi> to the heart, and
thoſe whereby Satan puts
us upon ſuch duties at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
houres and
times; as when we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
neceſſarily to be
imployed in our callings,
to eate, or to ſleepe, &amp;c.
then to put upon praying,
is a device of his he uſeth,
to tire out new converts
with. The difference will
appeare in this, the devill
comes in a violent impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manner upon the
conſcience, but inlargeth
not the heart a whit unto
the duty: but whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God at ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
by-times doth call
upon us, hee fits and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the heart, and fills
the ſoule with holy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18137:63"/>
as materialls for
the duty; for whatſoever
he calls to, he gives abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
withall to the thing
he calls for.</p>
               <p>And thus uſually, when
hee will have any great
matters done &amp; effected,
hee ſets mens hearts a
worke to pray, by a kinde
of gracious pre-inſtinct;
hee ſtirres them up and
toucheth the ſtrings of
their hearts, by his Spirit
ſent downe upon them:
Thus againſt the returne
of the captivity he ſtirred
up <hi>Daniels</hi> heart, <hi>Dan. 9. 1.
Hee knowing by bookes,</hi> the
time to be neere expiring
was ſtirred up to <hi>ſeek God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 2.</note>
and ſo hee that made this
Pſalme, <hi>Salvation being
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18137:64"/>
then nigh, ver.</hi> 9. 10. then
God ſtirred him up to
pray, and pen this prayer
for their returne: which
God had foretold hee
would doe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 10, 11,
12. For having promiſed
<hi>ver. 10. I will cauſe you to
returne after ſeventy yeares:
Then</hi> (ſayes he, <hi>ver. 12.)
ſhall ye call upon me, and ye
ſhall goe and pray unto mee,
and I will hearken unto you:</hi>
he ſpeakes it not onely by
way of command, what it
was they ought to doe;
but as prophecying alſo
what they ſhould doe; for
then he meant to ſtirre up
their hearts; as then hee
did, as appeares by thoſe
forementioned inſtances.
Therefore obſerve what
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18137:64"/>
things, God, thus by an
inſtinct doth inlarge thy
heart to pray for at times,
and ſometimes at extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
by-times, when
haply thou diddeſt not
think to pray about any
ſuch thing, yet hee then
ſtirred thee up moſt, it
may be, as thou wert wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
&amp;c. and having ſpare
time, he drawes thee into
his preſence and moves
thee in that maner ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

thus ſpeakes to the heart
to pray, ſo alſo <hi>in praying;</hi>
and his <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to the
heart <hi>in prayer</hi> may bee
diſcerned by theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18137:65"/>
and calmes, and contents
the heart in <hi>prayer,</hi> which
is done by ſpeaking ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the heart, though
what is ſpoken, be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
diſcerned: If you
ſhould ſee one, who was
an earneſt and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſuitor and exceeding
anxious when he went in
to a great man, but behold
him after comming out
from him contented, and
quieted, and cheerefull in
his ſpirit, you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that certainly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
had beene ſaid to
him, which gave him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
ſatisfaction
and contentment in his
ſuit; Thus when thou
goeſt to God, and haſt
been importunate in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18137:65"/>
(as ſuppoſe for
Chriſt, <hi>Oh give me</hi> Chriſt,
<hi>or elſe I die!)</hi> and thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
were exceedingly up
for it; But thou riſeſt up
with thy minde calmed
and ſatisfied, and feeleſt
the anxiouſneſſe, the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude
of thy heart about
the thing taken off, and
diſpelled; This is a good
ſign that God hath heard
thy <hi>Prayer,</hi> and hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſomething to thy
heart, which makes it
thus compoſed. When
<hi>Hannah</hi> out of much bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
and with ſtrong
deſires (which by a long
delay had bin made more
violent, ſo as her heart
was much diſquieted (for,
<hi>Prov. 13. 12. Hope,</hi> and by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18137:66"/>
the ſame reaſon, deſire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
deferred makes the ſoule
ſick) when out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of her griefe,
<hi>ſhee had poured her ſoule out
before the Lord,</hi> 1. Sam. 1.
16. <hi>Eli</hi> the <hi>Prieſt</hi> joyning
in prayer alſo for her, <hi>The
Lord grant thy petition!</hi>
after that <hi>prayer</hi> ſhe found
her heart ſo quieted, <hi>that
ſhee looked no more ſad,</hi> as
the Text ſayes there; She
aroſe quieted, and calmed,
and it was that prayer,
that did both fill <hi>Elies</hi>
mouth, with that word of
prophecie, and her heart
with quietneſſe, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
word from God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, that did
ſtill thoſe waves: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
God gave her a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18137:66"/>
Son, a Son of her deſires.
And the like God doth
now, by ſpeaking (as I
ſaid) ſomething to the
heart: as by dropping in
ſome promiſe or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart, or ſome like
conſideration; ſaying as
it were to the heart, even
as <hi>Eli</hi> from God did to
her, <hi>The Lord grants thy
petition;</hi> As to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when
he was earneſt with God
about removing his buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings
by <hi>Satan</hi> (which
whether they were the
ſtirring up a luſt, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> I
doe not now diſpute) <hi>I
beſought God thrice,</hi> that
is, earneſtly (ſayes hee,)
<hi>that it might depart;</hi> and to
this hee had an anſwer in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18137:67"/>
the meane time given
him, till it ſhould bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

12. 8, 9. And <hi>he ſaid,</hi> that
is, in <hi>prayer</hi> the Lord did
put in this conſideration
and promiſe into his
thoughts, And <hi>he ſaid unto
me, my grace is ſufficient for
thee, and my power is made
perfect in weakneſſe:</hi> This
anſwer thus comming in,
this promiſe thus ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

So hee did in
<hi>David, Pſal. 27. 3. David</hi>
was then in great hazards
by reaſon of <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1</note> yet at other

uſed not to be ſo, in other

<hi>In this, &amp;c.</hi> As there is a
witneſſe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
immediate to the heart,
ſealing up adoption to a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18137:73"/>
mans perſon, ſo in ſome
caſes, there is the like te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
for the obtaining
of ſome eminent thing we
have aſked. Which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſpeciall faith, doth in
a kind of ſimilitude anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to the faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of old, whereby a man
had a particular confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
that God would doe ſuch
a miracle by him: ſo in &amp;
by meanes of prayer, in
ſome things there may be
a particular ſtrengthning
&amp; aſſuring the heart, that
God will doe ſuch a thing
for a man: which I confeſſe
is rare and extraordinary,
as alſo that immediate te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
concerning our
perſons is, which many
want that goe to heaven.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18137:73"/>
And haply this other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſpeciall mercies,
is much more rare; and
but in ſome buſineſſes;
and is a thing which ſome
men are not acquainted
with, but yet may bee in
ſome caſes exiſtent to
ſome mens ſpirits, as it
was to <hi>Davids</hi> in the
thing mentioned.</p>
               <p>And concerning this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
I will alſo adde a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">A caution, that herein a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be not taken for abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</note> as about the former.
That it doth not alwayes
fall out upon all ſuch kind
of evidences made to a
mans ſpirit, and that by
God, that the thing pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for doth come to paſſe.
For theſe very perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtirred up by God,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18137:74"/>
may bee and are often but
<hi>conditionall,</hi> though thus
immediately made to a
mans ſpirit, and are ſo to
bee underſtood, and not
peremptory and abſolute.
It cannot bee imagined
that all theſe ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be of greater abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe
and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe,
than were many
of thoſe revelations made
by God to the Prophets,
wherein Hee manifeſted
his gracious purpoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſuch a man or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
either to vouchſafe
them ſuch a mercie,
or bring ſuch a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
though they were
particular and expreſſe,
yet limited and intended
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18137:74"/>
with a condition, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the performance,
or not performance of
which, it fell out, either
the judgement expreſly
threatned was diverted,
or that good thing which
was as directly and fully
promiſed, was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed:
as it was in the
caſe of <hi>Ionas</hi> threatning
the deſtruction of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veb;</hi>
and ſo in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
concerning <hi>Ely's</hi>
houſe, 1. <hi>Sam. 2. 30. I ſaid
indeed that thy houſe, and
the houſe of thy father ſhould
walke before mee for ever,
but now the Lord ſayes, it
ſhall not bee ſo:</hi> For they
had broken the condition
which was implied in it;
they had deſpiſed the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18137:75"/>
Lord; <hi>and them that deſpiſe
me,</hi> ſayes God there, <hi>I will
deſpiſe.</hi> In like manner is
Gods meaning, expreſſed
towards us in ſuch like
perſwaſions wrought in
us by prayer, to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
as that ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
will ſurely come to
paſſe, but ſtill under a
condition of obedience,
and performing of thoſe
vowes, which a man joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with thoſe his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to move the Lord to
grant the things; which if
a man faile in, or ceaſeth
to goe on to beleeve, it
may and doth often come
to paſſe, that things fall
out contrary to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
and then wee are
apt to queſtion whether
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18137:75"/>
it was from God or no;
which it might bee, and
truely wrought by his
Spirit and yet not alwaies
abſolutely meant (that
was your miſtake ſo to
take it) but conditionally
onely. For in ſuch great
requeſts of the ſoule unto
<hi>God</hi> there uſe to paſſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
covenants betweene
God and us; and Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are drawne and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto by us, that is, we
in prayer, offer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to doe thus and thus,
if God will vouchſafe us
ſuch a mercy, and pleade
it to God to move him to
beſtow it; and God, hee
thereupon (it may bee)
ſeales a covenant on his
part to grant the thing, &amp;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18137:76"/>
works ſuch an undoubted
perſwaſion; but if wee in
that <hi>interim</hi> of waiting
for that mercy, doe deale
falſely in that covenant
which we made; and this
even whileſt wee are yet
in dependance upon God
for it; whereby it appeares
that we would have done
ſo much more after wee
ſhould have received it
once, in this caſe God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the thing, and yet
notwithſtanding, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
and evidence was
from God that heard the
prayer. He ſaid indeed he
would doe thus and thus
for thee: (as he told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
I would have given thee
much more:)</hi> becauſe thou
ſaidſt to him, thou wouldſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18137:76"/>
walke thus and thus, or
didſt vow this or that to
him; thou faileſt in thy
word, upon which <hi>God</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
his; and thereupon
ſayes <hi>God</hi> as to <hi>Ely, Now it
ſhall not be ſo,</hi> and yet God
had ſpoken it afore, and
not Satan, nor thine owne

<hi>after praying:</hi> there is much
in that: that which was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18137:78"/>
the Spirit of ſupplication
in a man when he prayed,
reſts upon him as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

hee hath upon God
for the mercy hee ſeekes

in duty; to looke to
his paths to walke and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelfe as becomes
a ſuitor, as well as to come
and pray as a ſuitor. Thus
<hi>David,</hi> he walked by this
principle, <hi>Pſal. 66. 18. If I

himſelfe behind-hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

what ground hee had
got by praying. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 145. 8, 9,
10. when he was to pray,
even as for his life, (as
then he did, it being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
he ſought) he ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
prayes God to direct
him and keepe him, that
hee might not ſin againſt
him; for he knew by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hee ſhould enervate

not onely <hi>heare me ſpeedily</hi>
(ſayes he) but alſo <hi>Cauſe
me to know the way wherein

prayes for, and more
then for deliverance, for
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18137:79"/>
elſe he knew God would
not heare him. Therefore
when thou art in treaty

obſerve, doth God ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

more obedient frame of
ſpirit? it is a ſigne hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to anſwer thee; as
in like manner, when hee
keeps thee from uſing ill

meant to give <hi>David</hi> the
Kingdome, hee kept him
innocent, and his heart
tender, that it <hi>ſmote</hi> him
but for <hi>cutting off the lap of
Sauls garment:</hi> he was not
ſo tender after. Therefore
in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. when hee was

hee ſayes, <hi>God dealt

we have the very

them from God:
but we are apt, when once

the thing prayed for,
whereby you may diſcern

thou ſeeſt <hi>God</hi> in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

<hi>David, Pſal. 18. 24. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

me, &amp;c.</hi> His ſpeech notes
ſome ſimilitude or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
as for example, The
more by-ends or carnall
deſires you had in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the more you
mingled of theſe with
your holy deſires, and the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18137:98"/>
more want of zeale, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,
&amp;c. were found in
your prayers, the more
you ſhall (it may be) finde

in the ſame <hi>Pſal. verſe
25. 26. With the pure thou

Pure prayers have pure

as you in praying
ſometimes ſlackened and

ſee the buſineſſe in like

were <hi>lifted up, Iſrael</hi> had
the better, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 12.
God let him ſee a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which argued his
prayer was the meanes of
prevailing. A man findes
in praying, that his ſuite
ſometimes ſticks, and goes
not on as he expected, this
is becauſe he gives not ſo
good a fee as he was wont,
and doth not ply <hi>God,</hi> and
ſolicite him; but on the
contrary, when hee was
ſtirred up to pray, then
ſtill hee found things to
goe well: by this a man
may clearely ſee, that it
was the praier which God
did heare and regarded.
Thus likewiſe when a
man ſees hils and dales in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18137:99"/>

and then all daſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and the thing in the

him looke back upon his

and thought thou hadſt
even carried it, then daſh
all againe, by interpoſing

and ſecondly, in this alſo

He now calls for what

in that alſo he doth accept

Thus <hi>David, Pſal. 66.

when God inableth

50. 15. Call upon me in the

when the heart hath pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much for a mercy, with
dependance before the

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18137:106"/>
is enabled to exalt God

For there is that connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

when hee deſired to build
the Temple and an houſe
to God, for the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
God denied it, but
yet honoured him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the materialls, and to

in that his Son did it, who

of <hi>Canaan,</hi> hee did it with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18137:120"/>
much reſpect (as I may ſo
ſpeak with reverence) to
<hi>Moſes:</hi> he yeelded as far
as might bee, for hee let

ſee that good Land, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him up to an hill, and
(as it is thought) by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
inabled his ſight to
view the whole Land;
and the man hee choſe to
performe this work, was
his ſervant, which was a
great honour to <hi>Moſes;</hi>
that one brought up by
him ſhould ſucceed him.
So when <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed
for <hi>Iſhmael, Oh let Iſmael

God went as far in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<hi>I have heard thee, and I have

when in caſting that

becauſe thou art his child,

performance in it ſelfe be
weake, yet confidered as
a prayer, it may be ſtrong,
becauſe a weake prayer
may ſet the ſtrong God a
worke, as faith for the act
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18137:129"/>
of it, as produced by us
may be weak, yet becauſe
its object is Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it juſtifies: ſo it is in
prayer, it prevailes, not
becauſe of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

of the name, which it is
put up in, even Chriſts
name; and therefore as a
weake faith juſtifies, ſo a
weake prayer prevailes as
well as a ſtronger; and
both for the like reaſon in
both, for faith attributes
all to God, and ſo doth
prayer; for as faith is
meerly a receiving grace,
ſo prayer a begging grace.

that they are accepted,
then they muſt be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as prayers, now if they
be accepted as prayers,
then as effectuall motives
to prevaile with God to
grant the thing you aſke;
for if hee ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them to that end, for
which they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it is as if hee accepted
them not at all. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for which it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
which is to ſave
and juſtifie, and to this
end doth as fully accept
the weakeſt act of faith,
as the ſtrongeſt; ſo is it
with their prayers, which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18137:130"/>
being ordained as a means
to obtaine mercies from
him, if hee accepts them
at all, it is with relation
to the accompliſhment
of them, which is their
end.</p>
               <p>4. Men are miſtaken
in judging of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their prayers, they
judge of the weakneſſe of
their prayers by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and gifts in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them, or by the
ſtirring and overflow of
affections, whereas the
ſtrength &amp; vigor of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſhould be eſtimated
from the faith, the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the obedience, the
deſires expreſt in it. As it
is not the lowdneſſe of a
Preachers voice, but the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18137:131"/>
weight and holineſſe of
the matter, and ſpirit of
the Preacher, that moves
a wiſe, and an intelligent
hearer: ſo not gifts, but
graces in prayers are they
that move the Lord. The
ſtrength of prayer lies not
in words, but in that it is
fitted to prevaile with
God; one prayer is not
more ſtrong then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
further then it is ſo
framed as it hath power
with God more or leſſe; as
of <hi>Iacob</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

prayers move God, not as

is looking at <hi>prayer</hi> onely
as a duty to be performed,
and ſo performing it as a

out of deſires ſtirred up
after the things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
nor out of faith
that we ſhall obtain them;
which is as if a <hi>Phyſitian</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:18137:136"/>
having a ſick ſervant, to

his man ſhould take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and preſcribed
by his maſter, looking at
it as an act of duty as hee
obeyes him in other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
but not as looking
at it as a medicine, or

Thus doe moſt in the

this performance, not as

we had in any buſineſſe. If
I perform any Ordinance,
but as a duty, then I reſt
therein, and expect no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

backe againe, meetes as it
were with the anſwer,
which is Gods meſſenger,
and cauſeth it to returne
to heaven againe. How
often when God had even

newly written, and the

an act of treaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
betweene, ſtops it

it, blots and blurreth all,
both prayer and grant
when newly written, and
leaves a guilt in the mind,
which quells our hopes,
and then wee looke no
more after our <hi>prayers;</hi> and
this eſpecially if when we
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18137:139"/>

are you not in dependa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

how then dare you doe

when in this caſe the

all the <hi>prayer,</hi> and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
a man; for ſaith the
conſcience, will God hear
<hi>ſinners?</hi> (as he ſaid.) And
thus farre it is true that
<hi>ſinning</hi> thus between, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts
and hinders the

that anſwerably as wee

comes ſome accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

Reaſon firſt: Becauſe
<hi>God</hi> is the <hi>King of all</hi> the

conſult with their ſubjects

Warre and Peace with

at whoſe ſuite all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts

doe come; now when a

condemned man ſtands at

he cannot be at reſt in his

ſpeakes pardons; and ſo

of conſcience which are
in Gods people, are of
that quality, that none but
God can cure them; for,
the chiefe thing that
wounds them, is the loſſe
of <hi>Gods</hi> favour, not ſimply
his wrath: for it is the
glory of God, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18137:149"/>
not ſelfe-love onely
that makes them ſeeke
him; therefore nothing
gives peace, but the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his favour, and the
light of his countenance;
the ſame dart that woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
muſt heale againe;
<hi>Iſay 57. I ſmote him, and I
will heale him:</hi> And as one
that is ſick with love, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
love is the diſeaſe, no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
no perſwaſion of
friends can cure it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but onely the love
of the party beloved; ſo
when a ſoule is wounded
for the loſſe of Gods love,
not all the things in the
world can cure the heart,
but one word from him,
one good looke, one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
from him that wee
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18137:149"/>
are his, ſtills all, and onely
can give peace. Like to a
poore child, that cryes for
its mother, let who will
dandle it, and play with it,
and uſe it never ſo kindly,
yet it will not be ſtilled
till the mother comes; ſo
it is with a poore ſoule
that cryes after God day
and night.</p>

               <hi>Laban,</hi> and forbade

infallible light, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a ſatisfying light; ſo
as when it comes, it muſt

ſayes he in <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 29. No

            <p>1 It is a certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
light, which God
gives, when hee ſpeakes
peace; The <hi>anointing from

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18137:153"/>
a mans eyes, <hi>is truth, and is
no lie, 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 27. that is, in
<hi>teaching a man</hi> (of which
hee there ſpeakes, not
onely what hee is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but what hee is in
teaching us) he doth it ſo,
as a man is not deluded
by it, and therefore it is
added, <hi>None elſe need teach</hi>
him; for did the ſpirit,
(whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did ſpeak peace)
ſpeak ſo, as that that man
to whom it is ſpoken, did
not infallibly apprehend
it, hee ſhould ſpeake in
vaine: for ſo the Apoſtle
reaſons in caſe of <hi>unknown
tongues,</hi> that if a <hi>trumpet</hi>

ſhall not be knowne what
hee ſpeakes, <hi>hee beats the

therefore ſurely God,
when hee ſpeakes peace,
ſpeakes it ſo infallibly,
and diſtinctly, that the

of it; It is not a voice elſe;
for, ſayes the Apoſtle
there, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The <hi>end of

as the Holy Ghoſt in

ſuch a teſtimony, as is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <p>And therefore in the

our ſelves and others. Yea,
and ſometimes when hee
doth ſpeake peace, hee
gives ſuch ſatisfaction to
a mans ſoule in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that hee would bee
content to bee as many
yeeres more, in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
conflicts, to enjoy

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18137:156"/>
is it, for God to ſpeake
peace. Though thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
thy ſelfe never ſo <hi>far

thoſe who are neere:</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

for, ſayes hee, it is <hi>I</hi> that
ſpeake it. And when hee
doth it, then all thy doubts

as the paines of

that moves him to ſpeake

God lets fall the rod, and

the aggravation of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſinne, 1 Kings 11. 9.
That God had appeared to

and though ſuch doe now

ſuch as are analogicall to

by ſhedding abroad his

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18137:163"/>
into the heart, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
by the former

him,</hi> and after he ſaith, <hi>wee
will come to him, and make
our abode with him, ver. 23.
and 27. My peace I will give
unto you.</hi> Now ſuch appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
will be ſet upon the
ſcore of every <hi>ſin,</hi> many
yeares after, as they were
upon <hi>Solomons.</hi> And the
reaſon is, becauſe nothing
wounds an ingenuous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Nature more, then
matter of unkindneſſe:
<hi>if it had beene my enemy</hi>
ſayes <hi>David, I could have
borne it, Pſal. 55. 12, 14.
but it was thou ôh man, mine

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18137:164"/>
friend to whom I had
committed my ſecrets, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
my heart: Thus
when God hath unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed
himſelfe as it were
to a man, and told him
what was in his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, this goes nigh
him, if hee lifts up the
heele againſt him. And
the reaſon of that further
alſo is, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> becauſe of all
things elſe, a man cannot
endure to have his love
abuſed, you come nigh
him when you doe ſo, for
his love is himſelfe, and
commands all in him, ſo
that abuſe his love, and
you ſtrike at his heart; it
is leſſe to abuſe any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in a man, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and extenuate his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18137:164"/>

theſe are deare to him,
but his love is his bowels.
And therefore, when God

nothing more hatefull, or

when God doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

1. Becauſe, before a

for GOD never ſpeakes

<hi>A burnt Child dreads the

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18137:166"/>
this is <hi>your playing</hi>

for it is bitter, it
reacheth to the heart,</hi> it
woundeth the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the wounding of
which, of all elſe is the

once a man after this hath
peace reſtored to him, and
hee comes newly out of
ſuch a diſtreſſe, aſke him
then how he likes turning
to ſuch a <hi>ſin</hi> againe, and he
will tell you, it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

aske <hi>David</hi> if hee will

his bones have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

            <p>2 Thou wilt eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
it is folly to

it not folly now to loſe
that in an inſtant, thou
haſt beene a getting ſo

and with ſo much paines

excuſe to prodigalls to
ſay, things lightly come
by, are lightly gone; and
yet you count them, and
call them fooles for it, as
not knowing what it is to
earne a penny: how much
more folly is it, when a
man having afore morga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his peace, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
it again after much
ſuite, and waiting many a
term, then to come home,
and venture to caſt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at one throw at dice?
ſuch a fool art thou, when

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18137:168"/>
drink that at one draught,
which thou haſt been get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
many a yeare, what
madneſſe is it? when thou
haſt taken much paines,
to waſh thy ſelfe, then to
wallow in the mire again,
and make thy ſelfe new
worke, what folly is it?
who but Children and
fooles will doe thus?
That which the Church
ſaid in another caſe, may

<hi>Cant. 5. 31. I have waſhed

            </p>
            <p>3 Conſider, what it is

is better than life.</hi> If it
were propounded to thee,
thou muſt loſe thy life
next moment, if thou
ſhouldſt commit ſuch a
ſinne, wouldeſt thou ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if thou didſt beleeve
it? Now <hi>The loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God is better than
life,</hi> and wilt thou loſe the
enjoying of it, though but
for a moment?</p>
            <p>4. It is folly to returne
againe, becauſe the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſin will be much
leſſe to thee after thou
haſt had peace ſpoken.
Take them at the beſt,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18137:169"/>
when they are freſheſt,
and when thy palate was
moſt in reliſh, and taſte
with them, when thou
wert carnall, and ere thou
kneweſt what ſweetneſſe
was in God, and they then
were but poor ſorry plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
but now, they will
prove farre more empty
than before; they are
empty vaine pleaſures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him that hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in their flower, and in his
ſeaſon of ſinning; and
therefore all wicked men
are weary, and do inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complain of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
onely they cannot
finde ſweetneſſe in God,
and ſo are faine to keepe
themſelves to their huſks;
but alas, to thee they are
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18137:170"/>
farre leſſe worth than to
another man, who knows
not God, and therefore
thou art like to have a
worſe bargaine of it; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man can make more
money of a ſinne, and
get more pleaſure out of
it, than thou art able to
doe.</p>
            <p>For firſt, thy conſcience
having beene ſcorched
with ſinne, as ſcalt fleſh
deares more, and is more
ſenſible in comming to
the fire, than other parts
of the body, is become of
a quicker ſenſe; whereas
wicked mens is ſeared,
and ſo they commit all
<hi>uncleanneſſe with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
but thine is tender
&amp; galled in the act, which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18137:170"/>
allayes much of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of thy ſinne, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth
the more bitterneſſe
with it.</p>
            <p>And 2. beſides this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of conſcience, which
is common to thee with
many an unregenerate
man, thou haſt a principle
of grace, an inner man,
which is dead to ſuch,
pleaſures, that taſts them
not, that is like <hi>Barzillai,</hi>
who through age 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
19. 35. could not taſte ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what he ate or drank,
as young men doe; no
more can that <hi>New man</hi> in
thee, and therefore it can
be but halfe as pleaſant to
thee as to another man. If
one ſide of a man be taken
all with a numbe palſey,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18137:171"/>
what pleaſure is it to that
man, to exerciſe his limbs
in the actions of life? He
is but halfe a man, and
lives but halfe a life; ſo it
is with thee, when thou
haſt grace in thy heart,
but halfe thy heart can
take pleaſure in ſinning,
that new man the other
halfe, reluctates, grieves
for it, hates what thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
and all this muſt needs
ſtrike off much of the
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But 3. If wee adde to
this, that this new man in
him having once taſted
what ſweetnes is in God,
and <hi>How good the Lord is,</hi>
is then like a man that
hath eaten ſweet-meats,
other things are out of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18137:171"/>
taſte with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo it is folly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
<hi>No man</hi> (ſayes
Chriſt, <hi>Luke 5 ult.) having
dranke old wine deſireth
new, for hee ſaith the old is
better;</hi> a manuſed to high
fare cannot agree ſo well
with thinne dyet: ſo the
ſoule having beene uſed
to taſte of great pleaſures
in God, the impreſſion &amp;
remembrance of them
leaves his ſoule leſſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
than another mans; a
ſtomack that hath beene
enlarged to full diet, looks
for it, and riſeth more
hungry from a ſlender
meale: now communion
with God inlarges the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and widens them
and makes them more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:18137:172"/>
of greater joyes,
than other men have, and
therefore the creature is
leſſe able to fill them; ſtill
he remembers with much
griefe, whileſt he is eating
his huſkes, what fare hee
had in his fathers houſe:
and oh, <hi>Then it was better
with me, than now.</hi> Call me
not <hi>Naomi,</hi> but call mee
<hi>Marah,</hi> as ſhe ſaid, <hi>For I
went out full, and am come
home empty;</hi> ſo doth hee
ſay, when he comes from
the act of ſinning, he went
with his heart full of
peace, and meeting with
a bargaine of ſinning,
thought to eke out his
joy, and make it fuller,
but hee comes home
empty.</p>

1 Uſe, is to thoſe who
have had peace ſpoken to
them, let them at ſuch
times feare themſelves
and God moſt, for then
comes in this, as you ſee
here, as the moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
admonition that can
be given, to returne no
more to folly. 1. Feare
God then moſt: for of all
times elſe, then ſins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him moſt; to come
and call him <hi>Father,</hi> and
<hi>the guide of your mouth,</hi> and
yet to fall to ſinne, this is
<hi>to doe as evill as you can,</hi>
you cannot doe worſe.
<hi>Ier.</hi> 3 4, 5. So <hi>Ezra 9. After
ſuch an eſcaping, ſhould we
againe breake thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
wouldeſt thou not
be angry till thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18137:173"/>
us?</hi> In times of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
it is the property
of a good childe to love
GOD moſt: in times of
ſpeaking peace, to <hi>feare
God</hi> moſt and his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi>
and to fear to offend him
for his goodneſſe ſake.
Did I onely ſay, that God
is <hi>provoked</hi> moſt then, if
you return to folly? Nay,
I adde further, he <hi>is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
which is more then
to be provoked; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſhall marke that
expreſſion and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not to <hi>grive Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
then comes in, when
the <hi>Spirit hath ſealed us
up to the day of redemption,
Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. Then by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wee are ſaid more
properly to grieve him
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18137:173"/>
then before, when hee
hath ſo far ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to love a man, and
expreſſed himſelf to him,
and ſet his ſeale upon him
for his. God is angry with
wicked mens ſins, but hee
is grieved for yours. To
grieve him is more then
to anger him. Meere an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is an affection can eaſe
it ſelfe by revenge, and
by comming even againe
with the party, and when
wee can or intend to doe
ſo, our mindes are not ſo
much aggrieved, but
pleaſe themſelves rather
to thinke of the revenge
which wee meane to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute:
ſo when wicked
men ſinne whom GOD
meanes to meet with, hee
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18137:174"/>
is ſaid to be angry rather
then grieved; and ſayes,
<hi>I will eaſe my ſelfe of mine
adverſaries: Iſay 1. 24. and
avenge my ſelfe of mine
enemies.</hi> But here, as when
a mans wife that lies in his
boſome, or his child ſhall
wrong him: ſo is it when
one ſins, whom God hath
ſet himſelfe to love, and
done much for, and made
knowne his everlaſting
kindneſſe unto, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
this goes to his
heart, grieves him rather
then angers him, and ſuch
are the trueſt and deepeſt
griefes. What ſhould hee
doe with you in this caſe?
if afflict you, and by that
meanes goe about to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18137:174"/>
turne you from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
therein he ſhall but
afflict himſelfe as it were;
for <hi>Though they rebelled,
yet when they were afflicted
hee was afflicted, Eſay</hi> 63. 9,
10. As when a Father that
is a Magiſtrate, or as one
that maintaines a Student
in a Colledge, if either
puniſheth a childe, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill
in his purſe, he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
himſelfe, ſo muſt
God afflict himſelfe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
you. Put not the
Lord into theſe ſtraits if
you have any love in you.
And 2. as thou art there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to feare God moſt
then, ſo thy ſelfe moſt,
and to be more watchfull
over thy own heart; thou
art then apt to returne to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18137:175"/>
folly, if thou takeſt not
heed; as when a man hath
beene very hot, or ſweat
much, hee is apt to take
the greateſt cold. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
after GOD ſealed
peace to him and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his prayers, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the leaſe of his life, his
heart got cold, he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to folly. The reaſon
is, becauſe then the heart
is apt to grow leſſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and to thinke it ſelfe
fortified enough againſt
any tentation. As S. <hi>Peter</hi>
having ſeene Chriſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
in the Mount,
grew confident in his own
ſtrength. And know that
the Devill watcheth ſuch
an opportunity moſt, for
hee gets a great victory if
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18137:175"/>
he can foile thee then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee hath beene foiled
himſelfe, and when thou
art moſt triumphing over
him; how many battels
have beene loſt through
ſecurity of victory and
recoyling of the enemy?
and beſides our corrupt
nature ſo farre as unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
is apt to gather
heart to it ſelfe, to ſlight
ſinne, as thinking its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
eaſily gotten.</p>
            <p>Therefore when thou
art tempted, labour often
to renew thoſe thoughts,
which thou hadſt of thy
ſinne at that time, when
thou wert ſuing for peace,
before thy peace was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
when thou wouldeſt
have given a world for
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18137:176"/>
Gods favour; &amp; alſo what
thoughts thou hadſt of it,
when God ſpake peace,
how thou didſt abhorr it,
yea, thy ſelf, &amp; look what
ſin was moſt bitter to thee
&amp; an enemy to thy peace;
as if uncleanneſſe, Idlenes,
neglect of prayer, ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
&amp;c. and preſerve in
thy heart thoſe bitter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of it, &amp; ſay of
it, thou haſt <hi>bin a bloody ſin
to me,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> wife ſaid of
her huſband: and though I
have got peace, &amp; my life
ſaved, yet it was a bloody
ſin to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his blood was
ſhed to purchaſe this my
peace, &amp; ſhal I return to it?</p>
            <p>And when tempted to it
again, have recourſe to the
kindnes God ſhewed thee
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18137:176"/>
in pardoning, and ſay, how
ſhall I do this, and ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God? ſay as he ſaid,
<hi>Is this thy kindneſſe to thy
friend? 2. Sam.</hi> 16. 16. and
what, ſhall I <hi>Abſalom</hi>-like,
now I am new reconciled
to my Father, fall a plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
treaſon again? what,
ſhall I make more worke
for prayer, more worke for
God, breake my bones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
&amp; lie roaring again?
Think thus, I was burnt in
the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afore, I ſhal be rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſurely now. <hi>Sin no more
leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. The doctrine of
aſſurance (if not abuſed)
and of Gods ſpeaking
peace to men is no dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
doctrin to make men
ſecure and preſumptuous
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18137:177"/>
in ſinning: when peace is
preached in any mans
heart, this uſe naturally
flowes from that Doctrin,
<hi>returne no more to folly.</hi> The
very ſcope of the whole
Epiſtle of S <hi>Iohn</hi> is to help
all beleevers to aſſurance,
as appeares by the 1. <hi>Iohn</hi>
1. 4, 5. and the 5. <hi>Chap. 13.
Theſe things I write to you,
that yee might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, and that
your joy might be full.</hi> But
this will open a way to all
licentiouſneſſe. No ſayes
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 2. 1. <hi>Theſe
things I write unto you that
ye ſin not;</hi> nothing guards
the heart more againſt
tentations, then the peace
of God: it is ſaid to <hi>guard</hi>
the heart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 2. Yea
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18137:177"/>
and if you doe ſin, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of Gods love is
the ſpeedieſt way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
you; ſo it followes:
<hi>If any one doth ſinne, wee
have an Advocate with the
Father, &amp;c. And hee that
hath this hope in him,</hi> that
is, to live with Chriſt, and
<hi>knowes what manner of love
the Father beares us, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
himſelfe as hee is pure,
1. Iohn</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. If there
were no more but ſelfe-love
in a man, it were
then no wonder if he doth
abuſe it. For ſelfe-love,
where the love of God is
wanting, is unthankfull
and ungratefull, willing
to take all the love and
kindneſſe which is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and abuſe it, and work
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18137:178"/>
upon it for its owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and it is true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that becauſe wee have
too much of this principle
unmortified in us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God truſteth ſo few
with much aſſurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would abuſe it.
But where true love to
God is ſeated, and much
of it implanted, there the
love of God &amp; the peace
of God doth as kindly and
naturally enkindle and
enflame and ſet it awork,
even as arguments ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſelf-love doe work
upon, and ſtirre that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
For grace is more
for GOD then for our
ſelves, it being the image
of Gods holineſſe, whoſe
holineſſe conſiſts in this,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18137:178"/>
to aime at himſelfe in all:
and therefore when Gods
free grace towards a man
is revealed, it raiſeth him
up to higher ſtraines of
love to God, and hatred
of <hi>ſin.</hi> And therefore it is
obſervable, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51. 12. that
<hi>David</hi> when he <hi>prayes for
the reſtoring of the joy of his
ſalvation,</hi> hee <hi>prayes</hi> not
ſimply for it, or alone, but
withall <hi>prayes</hi> for a <hi>free
ſpirit, Eſtabliſh me with thy
free ſpirit:</hi> that is a ſpirit
of ingenuity, which is
kindly, ſweetly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought upon: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we have a free
ſpirit wrought in us,
then that free love that is
in God towards us will
worke moſt kindly upon
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18137:179"/>
it, and conſtraines us to
<hi>love him that loved us firſt.
The love of Chriſt conſtrains
us, 2. Cor. 5. 14. Becauſe we
thus judge, that if Chriſt
died for all, then they which
live ſhould not live unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
but unto him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them:</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives
the reaſon, why this love
of Chriſt did thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
him, becauſe hee
<hi>did thus judge,</hi> that is, this
conſideration of Chriſts
love, hee having a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of love in his heart to
Chriſt, hee found to be a
powerfull prevailing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to perſwade him to
live to Chriſt. Having a
new judgement hee ſaw
force and ſtrength in the
argument. And ſo ſhall
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:18137:179"/>
we if we thus judge, and
it will have this naturall
conſequence as naturally
to follow upon it in our
hearts, as any reaſon in
any other kinde hath, that
is brought to enforce any
other concluſion. And
therefore as the minde is
<hi>conſtrained</hi> (as it were) to
aſſent to a truth proved
by force of reaſon, that if
you grant this, then this
or that will follow: ſo
becauſe we judge this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
by an argument
drawne out of <hi>loves To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
that if Chriſt died
for all, who otherwiſe muſt
themſelues have died, that
then they ſhould live to him,</hi>
this will <hi>conſtraine</hi> us to
love him, and live to him.

that a man after a ſecond

comfort of ſome poore
ſoules whoſe caſe and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
this may be, I will
ſpeake ſomewhat though
ſparingly and with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>1. The Scripture no
where excludeth thoſe
from the ſtate of grace, or
barrs mercy from thoſe,
that have relapſed into
the ſame <hi>ſinne,</hi> eſpecially
ſo long as in regard of the
manner of their <hi>ſinning</hi> it
be but folly, not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or wilfull <hi>ſinning,</hi>
that is, rather proceeding
out of errour of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and heat, and
impetuouſneſſe of fooliſh
affections, then obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and malice in the will,
and with <hi>deſpite of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18137:181"/>
of grace, Heb.</hi> 10. 27.</p>
            <p>Yea: 2. In Scripture
wee meet with ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
and promiſes, as
may undoubtedly uphold
any ſoule, that hath ſo
fallen after peace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
into the ſame <hi>ſinne,</hi>
and preſerve him from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
therefore from
mercy and the ſtate of
grace: As <hi>Hoſea 14. 4. I will
heale their backſlidings, I
will love them freely;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they had fallen after
repenting &amp; former hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
it could not have
been called backſliding,
and yet this hee promiſes
to heale, &amp; withall ſhewes
the ground that mooved
him to it, his loving them
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18137:181"/>
freely: for if in any thing
his free love is ſhewne to
any of his children and
drawne out, it is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
againe ſuch a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding
ſoule after recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and peace given. For
the falling into the ſame
<hi>ſinne,</hi> which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of and healed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
God more then a
thouſand other acts of
<hi>ſinnes</hi> formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
though of the ſame
kind. And therein alſo to
ſhew his free love, that he
can pardon even the abuſe
of love it ſelfe, he leaves
ſome thus to <hi>ſinne</hi> after
his love ſhed abroad in
their hearts. Some hee
ſhewes his free love unto,
in keeping them from
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18137:182"/>
               <hi>ſinning,</hi> others in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and giving them
repentance: they are but
ſeverall wayes of drawing
it forth; ſo that if in any
thing, herein his free-love
is ſhewne, for if it were
not free, it would never
endure it ſelfe to bee abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And likewiſe the ſure
mercies of <hi>David</hi> are then
ſhowne, when God <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to pardon:</hi> ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.
3. having mentioned the
promiſe of the <hi>ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of David,</hi> He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to <hi>multiply to pardon,</hi> as
it is in the Originall <hi>verſe</hi>
7: which are thus joined,
both becauſe the ſureneſſe
of his Covenant, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhewne, and becauſe
wee might haply multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18137:182"/>
to <hi>ſinne;</hi> and at leaſt it
ſuppoſeth the poſſibility
of it againe. God likewiſe
runs upon ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that expreſſion of
his, to his owne people,
<hi>Iere.</hi> 3. 1, 2. They <hi>ſay if a

ſhee becomes another mans,
ſhall not the Land be greatly
polluted? but thou haſt played
the harlot with many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
yet returne againe to
me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. Hee
ſpeakes to her as to one,
had been his Wife, who
though ſhee had not been
put away by him, but had
put away her ſelfe and
run away, not once but

            <p>3 Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a man,

was yet three ſeverall

feare: once when hee
tempted Chriſt, not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
himſelfe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
where Chriſt had told
him, that he was to ſuffer:
<hi>Matth. 16. 21, 22, 23. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:18137:186"/>
(ſayes hee) <hi>ſpare thy

Chriſt calls him, <hi>Satan,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh
him more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then at any other time,
for which ſurely there
was a more then ordinary
cauſe. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> thought
that if his Maſter ſhould
ſuffer at Jeruſalem, that
himſelfe, and the reſt
ſhould not be ſafe: That
ſpeech therefore procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from feare, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
thereupon call for
ſelfe deniall, and taking
up the Croſſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 24.
And this was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after peace ſpoken,
<hi>verſe</hi> 16, 17, 18. CHRIST
had never more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
given teſtimony to

Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and his <hi>faith,</hi>
then there. Yet againe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this Chriſt had him up

himſelfe, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him againſt that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to come, which made
him ſo confident; yet
then hee denied him, at
his arraignment: when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
Chriſt immediatly
upon that lookt back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him with ſo ſweet a
looke as broke his heart
for this his folly; and ſo he
returned againe, and it
coſt him many a tear; and
Chriſt after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
owned him againe,
more then any of the reſt,
bad them that firſt met
him, <hi>Goe tell Peter,</hi> Hee
mentions him by name,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:18137:187"/>
and in eſpeciall, <hi>goe tell</hi>
him the firſt newes of it:

            <p>In the fourth place, if

be of the greater efficacie

that put ſuch ſpirits

then raiſe it above all
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18137:192"/>
thing here below: yet
when a man hath beene

that luſtre weares away,
as the glory that ſhined in

and have but an humane
created power which is
not alwayes efficacious;
eſpecially ſeeing GOD
hath ordained us <hi>to live by

for faith is appointed by

<hi>kept by the power of God</hi> as
the principall ſupporter,
and guardian, <hi>through faith</hi>
as the inſtrumentall, and
by it rather then by ſenſe
or any other grace of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
or repentance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
faith caries the heart
out of it ſelfe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it ſelfe wholly into
the hands of God <hi>as a
faithfull Creator</hi> (who is
the ſtrength of Iſrael, to
<hi>keepe</hi> a man <hi>from everie

or ſtrength that any

grace hath built, no not
for one moment; and
therefore is as dependant
upon God after a fall, and
a renewed repentance out
of it, yea and more then
before hee fell, and his
owne wofull experience
hath reaſon to make him
ſo. The like inſtance to
illuſtrate the truth of this
wee may draw from the
aſſurance of faith it ſelfe.
For even the aſſurance of
faith it ſelfe, (which is an
act properly belonging to
that grace, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>the aſſurance of faith,
Heb. 10. 22.)</hi> which doth
ſtrengthen us as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
doubting when it

and glorious, as

repentance can do againſt
any other <hi>ſinne:</hi> and

that hee ſhall never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
Gods love any

his <hi>ſinnes:</hi> and yet, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ſhewes it, that the
guilt of ſinne prevailes
ſometimes againe, after
this, and the ſame doubts
ariſe, and prevaile as much
as ever; neither will the
remembrance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aſſurance be alwayes
of force enough to reſiſt
them; for hee may come
to queſtion that aſſurance
it ſelfe alſo; and ſo <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18137:195"/>
that hee was purged
from his old ſinnes.</hi> And if
the guilt of ſin prevaile in

to preſerve a man;
yet, but in the ſame maner

as Prayer, and the word

preacht, and admonition,
&amp;c. with which GOD

that which they
ſerve to.</p>
            <p>5. If there were not
ſuch a poſſibility, as might
and doth ſometimes fall
out; then every regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man, after ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
act of repentance,
might ſecure himſelfe
againſt the committing
that groſſe act againe for
ever; but ſo he can never
doe againſt any particular
act of ſinne, but that
ſinne againſt the Holy
Ghoſt. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exhorts, when a
brother is fallen into a
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18137:196"/>
ſinne, <hi>to reſtore ſuch an one
with the ſpirit of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
upon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<hi>conſidering thy
ſelfe, leſt thou alſo bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi>
and hee layes the
exhortation upon thoſe
who are moſt <hi>ſpirituall;
Yee that are ſpirituall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch an one, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thy ſelfe leſt thou alſo
be tempted, Gal.</hi> 6. 1. ſo as
hee ſpeakes of ſuch, as
have their hearts raiſed up
to the beſt frame, through
the moſt deepe, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
repentance: and now
wee will ſuppoſe one, that
hath formerly fallen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into the ſame ſinne,
which another is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but not yet reſtored,
but himſelfe is returned
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18137:197"/>
by repentance out of it:
(for indeed, ſuch a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
man, is of all other like
to bee the meekeſt bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetter
of a man fallen,) &amp;
even ſuch doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
exhort to conſider, that
themſelves may for the
time to come, be alſo or in
like manner tempted, that
is, fall as this man fell; and
therefore <hi>ſo bee tempted</hi> as
to fall into the ſame ſinne
againe, that he was fallen
into. And if any man
could bee ſecure from the
like fall againe, hee had
beene out of the reach of
this exhortation to this
duty upon that ground
mentioned, as not capable
of it. But the Holy Ghoſt
hath elſe where, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
13.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18137:197"/>
told us, that there is
<hi>no tentation which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to man,</hi> but is incident
to befall any man, at any
time; and therefore <hi>verſe
12, exhorts him that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to take heed leſt be fall:</hi>
indeed, that temptation
which is <hi>common to Devils
with men,</hi> the ſinne of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
deſpaire, and againſt
the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
man may through
the grace of Chriſt, ſecure
himſelfe againſt: but, all
ſuch <hi>ſinnes as are common
to man,</hi> from theſe or any
of them, no man in any
ſtate, can without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

himſelfe from the

of corruptions. Firſt,
more groſſe corruptions,
which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
of the world, 2. Pet.</hi>
2. 20. they being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mire, or kennell,
wherein the uncleane
ſwine of this world wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
calls ſuch <hi>workes of the
fleſh as are manifeſt, Gal.</hi> 5.
19. even to the light of
Nature; ſuch as are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
fornication, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
&amp;c. and by thoſe two
expreſſions doe they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
them from a
ſort of more ſpirituall and

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18137:198"/>
there are corruptions
more ſpirituall, as pride,
ſecret love of the world.
Now, for thoſe groſſe
corruptions, which are
contrary, even to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
honeſty, and (to uſe
<hi>Iobs</hi> phraſe) <hi>are puniſht by
the Iudges, 31. Iob</hi> 11. which
profane men wallow in,
a godly man hath more
ſtrength againſt them, ſo
as it is not ſo ordinary for
him to bee entangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe with
theſe; for where but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
principles are, theſe
are abſtained from, as we
ſee in the Phariſee, <hi>I am no

where grace is, much
more. And ſome <hi>ſinnes</hi> are
more oppoſite to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18137:199"/>
of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and leſſe
compatible with grace,
as uncleaneſſe, of which
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>God hath
not called us to uncleaneſſe,</hi>
but to holineſſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.
7. it is in an eſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

are <hi>works of the fleſh</hi> which
are <hi>manifeſt,</hi> even to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to civill men: and
therefore when they are
often fallen into, they doe
manifeſt, that the heart is
but fleſh. And although
the limits, how ſeldome
or how often, cannot bee
ſet concerning relapſes
into theſe, or any ſinnes;
yet, in an ordinary courſe
it may be ſaid, that few
<hi>godly</hi> men fall into ſuch
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18137:199"/>
ſinnes againe and againe:
God keepes them from
ſuch in an ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that ſcandalls
ſhould not ariſe: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinnes which all the
world takes notice of.
But thoſe other ſinnes of
raſh anger, and love of
the world, and ſpirituall
pride, &amp;c. theſe being leſſe
manifeſt, and ſitting more
cloſe to our ſpirits, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men are more ſubject
unto.</p>
            <p>Yet ſecondly: we muſt
againe diſtinguiſh.</p>
            <p>1. There are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
luſtings to thoſe
outward acts: now, though
grace weakeneth the very
luſtings within, yet, takes
them not wholly away:
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18137:200"/>
               <hi>The ſpirit that is in us,</hi> (that
is,) in us Saints, ſayes S.
<hi>Iames, luſteth to envy:</hi> and
as to envy, ſo to all other
<hi>ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, there are
the outward groſſe acts of
ſuch <hi>ſins;</hi> and there in the
weakneſſe of <hi>ſin</hi> in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
man, and ſtrength
of grace ſhewes it ſelfe
moſt in preferving from
them: for, as <hi>to will is
preſent with me</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Paul
to will what is good, yet how
to performe it I am not able,
Rom.</hi> 7. 18. So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to luſt the heart
may bee ready, and luſt
may ſoone riſe up in
rebellion, but when it
ſhould come to the act,
there is a weakneſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18137:200"/>
they come to the
birth, and want ſtrength
often to bring forth; the
contrary luſting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
of grace being
then ſeene and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelfe: that it fareth
with a regenerate man in
this caſe often as with a
man that is deadly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
who riſeth up to
ſtrike his enemy, and
thinkes to runne him
thorow, but ſinks downe
againe, <hi>medio conatu,</hi> when
his ſword is at his enemies
breaſt, through a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of ſpirits; or as a man
in a Palſie, or the Gout,
who thinks hee is able to
walke, til he comes to try,
and then he finds a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which makes him
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18137:201"/>
fall backe againe: Thus,
even when the whole
forces of luſts are muſtred
up, yet the weapons fall
out of their hands. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in a healthfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
may ſtirre, and
boake in the ſtomacke,
when yet they come not
up, nor prevaile unto vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting.
In that place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſeemes not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that in the moſt
regenerate, luſtings may
ariſe, for <hi>the fleſh</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>luſteth againſt the ſpirit, ver.</hi>
17. but yet, as for outward
acts, he tels them, <hi>verſe 16.
That if they walke in the
ſpirit,</hi> that is, in the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the ſpirit, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a holy frame of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18137:201"/>
heart above the fleſh, that
then <hi>yee ſhall not fulfill the
luſts of the fleſh:</hi> for that
frame of heart ſo kept up,
will hinder the outward
fulfilling of the luſt; which
is never done till fleſh
and corruption is actually
raiſed above the ſpirit, &amp;
gets more voyces to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it; till the ſpirit be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hatches, and the fleſh
above, and ſo ſteeres the
helme:otherwiſe the luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſpirit againſt
the fleſh, will hinder the
outward doing, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a luſt. For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
hee gives, <hi>verſe 17. ſo
as you cannot doe what you
would,</hi> implyes, that not
onely luſtings, which ariſe
without conſent, may be
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:18137:202"/>
in ſuch a man but further,
much of the will may
bee wonne to conſent to
them, to like them; when
yet there is not ſtrength
enough to carry it on to
the outward act; <hi>you cannot
doe what you would.</hi> And
what thoſe works of the
fleſh are, which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
workes of the fleſh,
and which Chriſtians
whilſt they walke in the
Spirit fulfill not, hee men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and reckons up in
the following words. And
this is the more ordinary
frame of a Chriſtians
heart; for <hi>verſe</hi> 24. (ſayes
hee) <hi>they that are Chriſts
have crucified the affections
and luſts,</hi> that is, ſo farre, as
not to fulfill them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:18137:202"/>
3. He may more eaſily
fall into a groſſe <hi>ſinne</hi> of
another kinde, then into
the ſame after ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for it, and peace
ſpoken in the pardon of
it. Becauſe true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
eſpecially fortifies
the heart againſt that <hi>ſin</hi>
which a man hath moſt
repented him of; and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
lies more in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over that <hi>ſinne</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other: ſo ſayes <hi>David,
Pſal. 18. I was upright, and
kept my ſelfe from mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
that eſpeciall <hi>ſinne</hi>
which was eminently his
<hi>ſinne.</hi> A mans arme that
hath beene broke, will, if
well ſet, rather breake in
ſome other place then
where it was broke at the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18137:203"/>
firſt. Hence ſometimes it
falls out, that that which
was a godly mans boſome
ſinne before converſion,
continues not to be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but, another ſteps up
in the roome of it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that hee then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
to waſh out that
great ſtaine, moſt; and
ſpendeth the moſt of the
Fullers ſope, to purge
himſelfe from it; and ſo
becomes, ever after, moſt
watchfull over it; and ſets
in this his weakeſt place,
the ſtrongeſt gariſon, and
a watch, to prevent the
enemy. And, as an act of
ſome preſumptuous <hi>ſinne,</hi>
though it inclines the
heart more to all <hi>ſinne,</hi>
then before, yet, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18137:203"/>
to commit that kinde
of <hi>ſinne</hi> againe, rather then
any other: ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
is it in a ſound and
ſolemne repentance, for
ſome eſpeciall ſinne; and
in the endeavouring, to
mortifie ſome eſpeciall
member of the body of
<hi>ſinne:</hi> (to mortifie which,
not only in the bulke and
generall, but alſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and apart in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
members of it, the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> exhorts, <hi>Coloſ.
3. 5.)</hi> though thereby, the
whole habit of the body
of <hi>ſinne</hi> is purged and
weakned, yet that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>ſinne</hi> which we aime
eſpecially to have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
more ſubdued then
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18137:204"/>
any other. We ſee Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
was the <hi>ſinne</hi> which
the people of Iſrael relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into, againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
yet when they
were once throughly
humbled by the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for it, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to it, of all <hi>ſinnes</hi>
elſe, not to this day: ſo as
it may bee ſaid, as was
foretold, haply in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe, <hi>Ezek. 16. 43.
Thou ſhalt not commit this
lewdneſſe of all thy abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
Ionah,</hi> though he
would haply never runne
away from God againe,
after his Gaole delivery
out of the <hi>Whales</hi> belly;
yet, immediately, after
peace ſpoken to his heart
hee falls into a ſin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18137:204"/>
kinde; into a paſſion
of extreme anger and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſſe,
and quarrelling
againſt God. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this eſpeciall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
to fall into the
ſame ſinne, is, becauſe the
Conſcience lookes upon
a relapſe into that ſinne,
to bee more hainous, then
into any other ſinne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kind; becauſe of
that aggravation of it,
which thereby would
ſtaine and die it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a ſinne of another
kind ſhewes the variety
of corruption more; yet,
this is more againſt the
power and worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
it ſelfe, which
was particularly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
about that ſinne: and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:18137:205"/>
alſo breaks, and diſſolveth
all bands of a mans vows,
covenants, prayers, &amp;c.
made againſt it in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and ſo is made more
grievous. And this wee
may ſee in <hi>Ezraes</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himſelfe for that
great ſinne of the people,
in joyning themſelves in
marriage with the people
of the land, when hee did
ſet himſelfe to humble
himſelfe for them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thoſe <hi>that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God, Chap.</hi> 9. 4. What an
hideous apprehenſion of
the hainouſneſſe of that
ſinne, if they ſhould again
fall into it, did that dayes
repentance raiſe his heart
up unto? as appears <hi>v. 14.
Should we againe breake thy
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:18137:205"/>
commandements, and joyn in
affinity with them, wouldſt
thou not deſtroy us, till thou
hadſt conſumed us,</hi> and <hi>till
there was no eſcaping?</hi> Into
which ſinne, yet, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did againe fall, after
they had repented of it,
with a ſolemne confeſſion
and promiſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is recorded,
<hi>Chap. 10. v.</hi> 11, 12. &amp;c. yet
they returned to it againe
the ſecond time, as wee
finde in <hi>Malachie,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the laſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and after this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Ezra.</hi> For <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 12.
the Prophet ſayes, <hi>An abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is committed in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
for Iuda hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
the daughter of a
ſtrange god:</hi> and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18137:206"/>
the aggravation, <hi>v.
13. This ye have done again,</hi>
that is, the ſecond time,
and in that reſpect are
challenged to deale trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly;
and that alſo in
reſpect they had repented
of it the firſt time, <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Altar with teares,
with weeping, and crying
out,</hi> as <hi>Malachie</hi> there
ſpeakes: ſo as <hi>God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not your offerings any
more.</hi> And therefore alſo
<hi>Pſal. 78. 40. How oft did they</hi>
(ſaith hee, as aggravating
their ſins) by murmuring
<hi>provoke the Lord?</hi> and
<hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 22. God reckons
up, and mentions the
times of their ſinning,
how often they had thus
ſinned, as an aggravation
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:18137:206"/>
of them, <hi>They have tempted
me theſe ten times.</hi>
            </p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Cautiō </seg>4</label> 4. He may fall into the
ſame ſinne againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
 untill hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himſelfe, and
his peace fully by a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
repentance, but
yet ſeldome after. <hi>Lot</hi>
committed inceſt two
nights together; but the
orifice of his luſt, was not
yet ſtopped by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the wound was not
cloſed, and ſo bled againe
afreſh; but when it is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
once, and the heart
made perfect with God,
and divorced from that
ſinne, and entred into
Communion with God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
then though it may
fall out, yet a man more
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:18137:207"/>
hardly returnes. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that is gone from her
huſband may play the
whore a long while with
him ſhe ran away withall,
till her husband fetches
her again: but to run often
away, after receiving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
is intolerable. That is
not ſo ordinary in Gods

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Cautiō </seg>5</label> 5. Though wee can
hardly ſet limits to ſay
when, or when not, this
ſhall fall out from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of mens repentings:
as that if they have ſuch or
ſuch a degree of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then they fall no
more: yet we may further
conſider a difference of
their returnings to <hi>God,</hi> &amp;
repentings; and of Gods
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:18137:207"/>
ſpeaking peace.</p>
            <p>1. Of their <hi>Repentings:</hi>
ſome are more imperfect,
and but as it were thaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the minde a little,
by meanes of a little Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
of Gods love: ſome,
are more thorow and
deep; that recover a man,
and put him into a ſound
and healthfull eſtate. As
for example, a man in an
ague hath well dayes, yet
his fits returne, and it may
be they leave him for a
month or ſo; and yet they
take him againe, as at
Spring and Autumne;
which is becauſe all this
while his body is not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
recovered to a ſtate
of health: ſo is it with a
mans heart in reſpect of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:18137:208"/>
his luſts; though he may
have many well dayes,
wherein hee may eate his
meate, and receive ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the word, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances:
yet at times his
diſtempers and aguiſh fits
returne, he being aguiſh
ſtill; but in the end, after
the peace of God hath
more thoroughly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his heart, he attaines
to ſome ſetled conſtant
victory over it; and when
it doth not prevaile to
victory, ſuch aguiſh fits
end uſually in conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in which long agues
often end: as in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries,
in whom, ſinne
overcomming GODS
ſtriving with them, it
eates all good beginnings
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:18137:208"/>
out; but if they belong
to GOD, then uſually
that aguiſh diſtemper, is
in the end by a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
repentance, ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as that they attaine
to more victory, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
againſt it then any
other ſinne; that as in
thoſe other kind of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
it often falls out,
that, that which a man
doubted of moſt, hee
comes in the end to bee
moſt aſſured of, and to
doubt no more; ſo alſo
here, a man becomes moſt
freed from that ſinne, hee
was long exerciſed with
of all other. So alſo</p>
            <p>2. For Gods dealings
with his, there is much
difference therein to bee
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:18137:209"/>
found: there are ſome
kinds of ſpeaking peace by
God, and meltings of the
heart of his people, which,
yet are not of that force as
to overcome, but wherein
God doth but (as it were)
ſtrive with them; which
ſtrivings doe ever and
anon worke their hearts
to a repentance, and that
true, and ſerious: which
yet is not ſo deepe, and
thorough, nor ſo healing
the heart at the bottome,
as it ſhould. For GOD
ſometimes uſeth more
imperfect kinde of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
even with his own
children, about ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſinne they are to
leave, which doe not ſo
fully, at firſt prevaile, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18137:209"/>
overcome in them; which
God doth, to let them ſee
the running iſſue of their
natures, how grace would
<hi>runne</hi> out at it,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 1.</note> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſpeakes) and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
grace in them, if hee
ſhould let it alone: and
ſo, lets out upon his child
after many yeeres ſome
luſt, which had been long
downe, which puts him to
it exceedingly, ſo that he
is in hazzard to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and is put into
feares of it; and yet God
viſiteth his ſpirit by fits,
and <hi>per intervalla</hi> at times
ſtrives with him; and
though hee falls, yet hee
puts under his hand, and
gives him well dayes, and
ſome comfortable viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18137:210"/>
yet ſuch as are not
deep enough to worke
him fully off from it. For,
as God ſtrives with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, ſo he ſometimes
ſtrives with his own alſo;
which may ſeeme to bee
the true meaning of that
ſpeech, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. where, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mentioned the ſinne
of his owne children, <hi>ver.</hi>
2. That the Sonnes of
God tooke to them wives
of that wicked ſeed of
<hi>Cain,</hi> hee ſayes, <hi>My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſhall not alwayes ſtrive
with man, for that [he alſo]
is but fleſh:</hi> Hee meanes
not this, of all mankinde,
for he ſayes, <hi>[hee alſo]</hi> is
but fleſh: now, with what
other creatures, doth hee
joyne them in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18137:210"/>
but with others
of the ſonnes of men? ſo
as the meaning is, I ſee my
Children, that they alſo
are corrupt, and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
as well as the reſt of
mankinde, and my Spirit
hath ſtriven with them.
In which ſtriving, GOD
lets them ſee, how if hee
did not in the end, ſhew
foorth his free love to the
full, in the reſcuing of
them, and healing their
backſliding, they would
bee undone: ſo as, in the
end, through his grace
which is ſufficient, they
obtaine the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
over that luſt of any
other; when the heart is
once thoroughly awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſetled in a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18137:211"/>
peace. And as,
thoſe doubts they were
moſt troubled with once,
(which though they had
at times ſome light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
yet by fits did ſtill
ariſe) are yet in the end,
ſo overcome, as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
no more, but they en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joy
the greateſt freedome
from them: So is it often
herein. And theſe <hi>ſtrivings
to not overcomming,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
to the thawings of
the Ice, in a great froſt, as
when in the day time, the
Sunne ſhines, and in the
Sunſhine it thaweth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
but yet, ſo as at night,
or in the ſhade it freezeth;
when ſometimes, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo begins to change
for a night, and yet falls a
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:18137:211"/>
freeing againe: ſo here,
there is not ſuch a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſhedding abroad the
love of God in the heart,
as ſhould make a thorow
generall thaw, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as wee ſay; and ſo,
when the heat of that is
withdrawen, it freezeth
againe: but in the end
there comes a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and generall thaw,
and change that carries all
away, melts the heart, and
ſo alters the temper and
conſtitution of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(as I may ſo ſpeake)
as it freezeth no more.
And ſuch a thawing of his
heart had <hi>David,</hi> when
<hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, and
not afore; though it may
bee hee had thoſe leſſer
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:18137:212"/>
relentings often before.</p>
            <p>But let thoſe that are in
ſuch a caſe, take <hi>heed they
bee not hardened thorow the
deceitfulneſſe of ſinne</hi> and
of all the times, that paſſe
over you, in your lives,
theſe are the moſt clima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiericall,
and criticall, and
moſt dangerous. For God
<hi>will not alwayes ſtrive,</hi> but
if thou beeſt his childe, if
ſuch thawings will not do
it, hee will uſe ſome great
afflictions, in the end to
divorce the heart, and thy
<hi>ſin;</hi> his love will one way
or other, overcome thee,
and in the end prevaile.
As when <hi>Iſrael went on
ſtubbornely in the way of his
heart,</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>I have
ſeene his wayes and will heale
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18137:212"/>
him and guide him, Eſay</hi> 57.
&amp; the Lord may ſo heale
thee, as thoſe luſts of all
other ſhall not in that
groſſe maner, breake forth
any more. And in thoſe
times, when God dealeth
thus with him, a man will
after ſay, that in ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of his life, hee had
more free love ſpent on
him, then in all his life
time, before or after: and
when he is freed and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
he will be more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and fearefull then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before, or then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would have been;
and ſo get ground by his
ſtumblings. If any of you,
being now in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
as this, in ſuch a viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude
and chance of war:
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18137:213"/>
If yet thou findeſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
fight againſt thy <hi>ſin;</hi>
and that thoſe breakings,
and meltings of thy heart
by God, do winne ground
of it; and that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
and hope, which at
times are vouchſafed, doe
ſtrengthen, <hi>&amp; ſtabliſh thy
heart in well doing:</hi> as 2.
<hi>Theſſ. 2. ult;</hi> and makes
thee more fearefull, every
time thou riſeſt, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
ſo as to looke upon
another fit if it ſhould
come, (which knowing
the deceitfulneſſe of the
heart, thou feareſt,) as
the fit of ſome great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
leſt it ſhould returne
againe: eſteeming it as
the greateſt croſſe that
can befall thee; which
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:18137:213"/>
thou wouldeſt buy off
with thy blood; and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
moſt of all to thinke,
that thou haſt ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
a heart, which as it
hath abuſed Gods love
formerly, ſo thou feareſt,
will doe ſo againe; if thus
thou go on to fight it out,
the love of God will in
the end overcome in thee;
but if thou findeſt that
thoſe encouragements fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God, do through thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
(which turnes
Gods grace into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
nouriſh thy luſts,
and make thee leſſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
againſt the next time;
and thy heart harder, and
ſecure, and to ſlight <hi>ſinne</hi>
more, becauſe thou haſt
beene ſo oft viſited from
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:18137:214"/>
on high, and pardoned:
thy caſe is dangerous, and
may prove deſperate.</p>
            <p>6. Though he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,

folly to runne into the

then, what folly is it in
them that utterly fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18137:214"/>
and after they
<hi>have beene enlightned, and
taſted of the good word of
God,</hi> then fall againe to
the pleaſures of <hi>ſinne</hi> and
never repent of them?
as many doe; that come,

God, and then returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to their vomits, and

<hi>Fooliſh ſoules, who

Folly</hi> indeed: to ſpend the

1. Sam.</hi> 22. 7: So, can

you thereby diſhonour

               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:18137:215"/>
and bring an evill report
