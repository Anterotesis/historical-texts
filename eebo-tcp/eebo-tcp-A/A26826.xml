            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Could the better have ſate down in ſilence under the <hi>Unchriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Slanderous Inſinuations</hi> in that Book caſt out againſt me, eſpecially when I conſider ſo many of the Lords antient and faithful Servants, by this <hi>Adverſary,</hi> are made my Companions herein: And alſo the <hi>Darkneſs, Envy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> in the ſaid Book manifeſted; having alſo the evidence of the Lords ſpirit for my own <hi>Innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32010:2"/>But ſome neceſſity is upon me to Write, and give forth a few Lines in Anſwer thereunto, and confutation thereof; and ſo much the rather, becauſe its not ſo much <hi>My Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, that this <hi>Adverſary</hi> ſtrikes at; and therefore alſo willing to be a companion with my Brethren, in a Teſtimony againſt this wicked undertaking.</p>
            <p>And this is my Teſtimony in general; That it is in its ſelf a <hi>Work of Darkneſs,</hi> and from the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> which muſt be caſt down for ever: And ſuch is the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Foulneſs thereof, That as yet, (though doubtleſs ſeveral were concerned in their purſes, to aſſiſt the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thereof) I have not heard of one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that owns the ſame: And am not without hope, that ſeveral of thoſe ſo concerned, may in time ſee their folly, and Repent thereof, as many others have done, who were beguiled by the ſame ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And now, as to my own particular, wherein Truth is concerned with me; for this is that which is chiefly in my eye, to anſwer to in this Book <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>pages</hi> 82, 89. he thus expreſſes himſelfe <hi>Doubtleſs ſhould any man accuſe</hi> Jaſper Batt (<hi>one of thoſe that judged</hi> John Story <hi>and</hi> John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon <hi>without hearing them ſpeak for themſelves) That he went about Preaching, thereby occaſioning ſomtimes Twenty Pound Fines, ſomtimes Forty Pound Fines, to be impoſed on the Hearers, and incourage them to be valiant for Truth, and to offer up all (whilst his Eſtate was well ſecured out of the Perſecutors reach, or at leaſt nothing to be found of his own to pay ſuch his Fines) he would think</hi> John Story <hi>very ill imployed, to have a hand in giving forth a publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt him, to be read in all the monethly and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings in</hi> England, <hi>before he had either ſpoken or written to him to know what he could ſay for himſelf, that he might have opportunity to huſh it up by writing a Paper of Condemnation, if ſo be he were guilty.</hi> [He farther ſaith] <hi>We cannot believe that</hi> Jaſper Batt <hi>hath not done as bad as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32010:2"/>
this in ſigning with the</hi> Sixty Six <hi>at</hi> E. Hooks'<hi>s Chamber; and if the caſe stated in his Name be not groundleſs, 'tis then notorouſly wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus plainly inſinuating, as if I had deſigned <hi>Firſt, to ſecure my own Eſtate, and then Exhort others to give up <hi>All</hi> for Truth, and occaſioned ſuch to be fined as aboveſaid.</hi> To which I Anſwer, this <hi>Inſinuation</hi> is <hi>Un-Chriſtian,</hi> being againſt the Rule that Chriſt gives, in caſe a <hi>Brother Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends</hi> which is; <hi>Tell him his Fault between thee and him,</hi> &amp;c. Now this I affirm, that <hi>W. R.</hi> nor any other on his behalf, never did in the leaſt queſtion me, or expreſs to me any diſſatisfaction concerning me, touching what he thus inſinuates; which according to Chriſts Rule he ought to have done: And therefore his thus proceeding is Un-chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And this I farther teſtify in the Lords Preſence, (who knows that I lye not) that <hi>I never diſpoſed of, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured any part of my Eſtate, to avoyd the loſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for Truths Teſtimony; but have managed the ſame according to the Vnderſtanding the Lord hath given me for its ſervice.</hi> For when I was firſt convinc'd of Truth, I ſoon received it in the love thereof, and gave up my ſelf and all I had to be ſerviceable therein; and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lord to ſpend near my whole time in its Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Lord in time ſo diſpoſed of my Condition, that I was neceſſitated, either to put off the management of the Eſtate which the Lord had given me, or give up my Teſtimony, as then required of me; that part of my Family being removed, that were any way capable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the ſame in my abſence, and intently waiting on the Lord for his Council, and adviſe with faithful Friends: I was fully ſatisfied (and ſo am to this Day) <hi>that my place was to keep my publick Testimony, and let my Eſtate</hi>; which I did accordingly, diſpoſing of part thereof to my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as becomes a Father to provide for his Family,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32010:3"/>
and this was done (the Lord knows) that I might be the more at liberty in the Lords Service; and as <hi>Paul</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that goes a warfare, intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les not himſelf with the things of this Life, that he may pleaſe him who hath Choſen him to be his Souldier.</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this ordering of my <hi>Affairs</hi> was <hi>not to avoyd Sufferings</hi> on the <hi>Act againſt Conventicles,</hi> is the more Evident, becauſe <hi>it was done a conſiderable time before that Act was made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this alſo I farther teſtify, that it hath been my care and diligence, ſince the Lord called me into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as on the one Hand, <hi>not to run when he ſent me not</hi>; ſo alſo, <hi>not to neglect the Duty he required of me:</hi> And this is my great Comfort to this day, whatever this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, or any other judges of me, I have walk't in the Simplicity of my Heart before the Lord, and have, and do enjoy the Teſtimony of his Love, and aſſiſtance of his Preſence, which is a large reward unto me; Glory to his Name for ever. And ſo this his <hi>Inſinuation</hi> is very <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Envious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. R.</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>giving out a Paper of Condemnation, for occaſioning others to be fined for my Preaching, and my Eſtate ſecured, and not to be found, as he inſinuates,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer, what would he have me Condemn? Is it the ſecuring my Eſtate from ſuffering? (<hi>I never did it</hi>) I am not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein, therefore no Condemnation belongs to me for that: Or would he have me Condemn my Appearance publickly, with a Teſtimony for God, when the Lord requires, and moves? And draw into Holes, Corners, and under Hedges, as ſome of our Oppoſers have done. his plainly appears to be of that Spirit that would lay waſte all our <hi>Meetings, and Extinguiſh the Doctrine and Life of Chriſtanity, that</hi> would <hi>juſtify</hi> the <hi>fearful</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> the <hi>Righteous,</hi> which is an Abomination to the Lord: what Darkneſs and Confuſion doth this Spirit run into!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:32010:3"/>And whereas <hi>W. R.</hi> inſinuates, <hi>my Fine to be laid upon others.</hi> If I am Fined, or any other, for ſpeaking in the Name of the Lord, and others ſuffer on that Account, its well for me to anſwer the Lords requirings in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for others alſo to frequent our Meetings; and ſo that Suffering being for well doing, ſhall not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Reward from the Lord: <hi>For happy are ye when ye ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake</hi>; and that were evil to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lords Requirings, either in frequenting, or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Meetings, and is for Condemnation by the Truth, what ever <hi>W. R's</hi> judgment is of it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>J. Story</hi> and <hi>J. W. were judged without a Hearing,</hi> is utterly falſe; they having been heard with Witneſſes face to face, at a Meeting where were preſent ſeveral of the Sixty Six mentioned: of which Meeting, and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>W. R.</hi> hath given a large Teſtimony of the Lords Peace amongſt them, and their great travel of Love and Life for <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> an Account whereof may be ſeen in <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Friends Anſwer to <hi>W. R's</hi> Book: at which Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after hearing of all Parties, they were judged to have entertained a <hi>wrong Spirit</hi>; and for ſeveral other Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the Church of Chriſt, as by a Narrative there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may appear. And from a Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> 1676. they were by many antient and faithful Brethren, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and warned in the Lords Name (as he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) <hi>not to offer their Gift, nor meddle in the publick Affairs of the Church, until ſatisfaction was given to the Church ſo offended:</hi> which Advice and Warning was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected by them. And then at the Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> 1677. in Unity with the former Judgment given after Hearing of Witneſſes face to face, and their rejecting the Advice and Warning (aforeſaid) given them the year before, a Teſtimony was given againſt them by more than Sixty Six: ſo as to the things for which they were judged, and a Teſtimony given againſt them, they were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32010:4"/>
fully heard before judgment; and ſo the <hi>Charge is Falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now all this truly weighed, the Caſe ſtated in my Name is groundleſs, and ſo <hi>Not <hi>notoriouſly wicked in</hi> Me:</hi> But then, whether it be not <hi>Notorious Wickedneſs in W. R.</hi> thus to Inſinuate, and publiſh in Print againſt me while Innocent, let Gods Witneſs in all judge: for <hi>I never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured my Eſtate from ſuffering for Truths Teſtimony, nor out of the Perſecutors Reach:</hi> for I have, and ſtill had an Eſtate Real and Perſonal, held in my own Name, and not made in truſt to any other. And if it be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſo to ſecure an Eſtate in Truſt, when no Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, but to ſave from Suffering for Truths Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>W. R.</hi> then ought to look nearer Home before he thus range abroad; but ſome will be medling while they count themſelves Wiſe. And ſo the <hi>Wickedneſs, Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Envy, and Confuſion,</hi> reſts on <hi>W. R's.</hi> own Head, for which in due time, the Lord will Reckon with him.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>W. R.</hi> ſpeaks of me and my three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, <note place="margin">Part 2. page 91.</note> that ſpeak of ſome in a Paper of ours, that deſpiſe Government, and ſpeak evil of Dignities, and he Accounts not us to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, that many of the Lords little Ones, and faithful Servants, have been deſpiſed, and ſpoken evil of by ſeveral that are joyned to that Spirit in which this our Adverſary appears to be; but as far as I have heard or underſtood, he have out-ſtript them all, as this his work of Darkneſs doth manifeſt. Now Chriſt Jeſus ſaith of his Diſciples, and little Ones, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And this is a Dignity rightly claimed by the Lords faithful Servants to be his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>little Ones:</hi> then if they that Reproach and Deſpiſe them, deſpiſeth God and Chriſt, ſuch deſpiſeth Dignities, and ſpeaks Evil of them.</p>
            <p>Many other <hi>Contemptible, Scornfull, Deriding,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32010:4"/>
Expreſſions</hi> againſt me, and many others of the Lords ſervants, he hath uttered in his ſaid Book: All which I Trample under foot, knowing my own innocency, and leave him to the Judgement of God for the ſame: but cannot yet well let paſs without ſome notice taken, how much he pretends a Conſcentious concern for truth, to print this his Book: And I well remember how <hi>Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> that blaſphemous <hi>General,</hi> could pretend as high for his War againſt the Lords people; who ſaith, <hi>And am I now come up <hi>without the Lord</hi> against this Land; the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid unto me, <hi>Go up againſt this Land and deſtroy it,</hi> Iſa.</hi> 36.10. And this alſo I cannot well omit without notice, what he ſaith, Part 2. Pag. 92. viz. <hi>A hoping, that for the future,</hi> Jaſper Batt <hi>will learn more modeſty, than to account himſelf a Governour, &amp;c.</hi> And I may ſay it would be well, if <hi>W. R.</hi> would learn ſo much modeſty as to forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate ſuch falſehood; for when, or where, did I ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my ſelf a <hi>Governour:</hi> But as the Lord hath given me a Teſtimony, againſt deceipt, and wickedneſs, and for his everlaſting truth, I hope he will preſerve me faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful therein to the end. Herein I may be ſcorned, and reproach't for the ſame by <hi>W.

            <p>
               <hi>William Rogers</hi> in his Book (falſly) Entituled the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 92. hath theſe Words. <hi>All theſe</hi> (viz) J. Batt <hi>and his Three Companions, and the reſt of the</hi> Sixty Six <hi>Subſcribers, are by their Paper Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, to have <hi>Run in the very way of</hi>
               </hi> Cain <hi>by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Brethren, and have appeared as <hi>Raging Waves of the ſea, foaming out their own ſhame</hi> by their</hi> hard <hi>Speeches, which are the very Marks and Fruits of thoſe who deſpiſe Government according to the Scriptures, which</hi> J. Batt <hi>and his Brethren hath directed us to peruſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>William Rogers</hi> Complains much againſt <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; but who amongſt us equalls him therein? Let his Words above Cited, as alſo what follows, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more of like Nature in his great Confuſed Book, ſpeak for him, or againſt him, in the Underſtandings and Conſciences of all Judicious and impartial Readers.</p>
            <p>Can he prove that <hi>J. Batt,</hi> or his <hi>Three Companions</hi> (and the reſt he here mentions) have ever <hi>Charged J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> and the <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Friends, or the <hi>Bristol</hi> Friends, who write and ſpeak ſeverely againſt them, to have <hi>run in the very way of</hi> Cain.</p>
            <p>How doth this his bitter falſe Judgment agree with the Scriptures Cited by him againſt judging <hi>part</hi> 2, and <hi>p.</hi> 90. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. Let the Reader Examine, and ſeriouſly Conſider the ſame. He hath rendred us in the <hi>very way of Cain</hi> (<hi>Obſerve</hi> the Emphaſis). The <hi>very way of Cain</hi> is not only <hi>Envy,</hi> but alſo <hi>Actual Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32010:5"/>
The living God knows, that this is a very uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, falſe, and wicked Judgement, for which the Lord will Rebuke him. Gods faithful witneſs in our own Souls, juſtifies us from his falſe and malicious Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What was written concerning <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> (of which <hi>W. R.</hi> complaineth) was not written in any degree of <hi>Envy</hi> againſt the ſaid perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God doth know, that we never endeavoured to <hi>murder</hi> the ſaid <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> nor any other perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Controverſy againſt us. But <hi>Cain</hi> did not only endeavour to <hi>murder,</hi> but did actually <hi>murder his innocent Brother.</hi> We being wholly clear, not only of the Act, but the very intention of <hi>murder,</hi> are therefore <hi>Not in the very way of Cain.</hi> For we could be very glad to ſee <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> and the reſt concerned with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that which is Evil, and return into Unity with Friends, who are in the Love of God towards them, and in peaceable Unity one with another in his Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. R.</hi> in his Book ſcoffingly writes againſt Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Excommunication.</hi> See <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 84. But hath not he, to the utmoſt of his power, endeavoured to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, not only <hi>J.B.</hi> and his <hi>Three Companions,</hi> but all the <hi>Sixty Six</hi> mentioned before, without giving them <hi>Goſpel-order</hi>; or at leaſt many of them he hath not dealt with, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Chriſt commands (Amongſt which the faithful Miniſters ſtruck at by <hi>W. R.</hi> are ſound in Doctrine, as well as in Life and Converſation) and his Apoſtles direct. Therefore his uncharitable dealing towards us, Chriſt and his Apoſtles teſtimony witneſſeth againſt.</p>
            <p>If <hi>W. R.</hi> could make the Church of Chriſt believe, that <hi>We are in the very way of Cain</hi>: then, no doubt, they would declare againſt us as perſons with whom they could have no Unity, in their Chriſtian-Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſo he would get us denyed by the Church of God, <hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> But they have a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32010:6"/>
true Senſe and Knowledge of us, to be <hi>Men fearing God,</hi> and <hi>lovers and practiſers of Chriſtian Vertue, in Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> led thereinto, and preſerved therein by the <hi>pure Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is Captain of our Salvation, and Biſhop of our Souls, and true Head of the living Body, his Church, who Reigns in, and over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member, who leads us into <hi>Love</hi> one to another, and to live in Peace and Unity one with another, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves therein; and teaches to love Enemies; to do good to them that deſpightfully Uſe and Perſecute. Theſe that are thus taught are far from the <hi>very way of Cain,</hi> which is <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> Theſe envy no man: But hate <hi>Pride, Arrogancy,</hi> and every <hi>evil way</hi>; ſuch Chriſt doth own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. R</hi>'s. Envy and bitter Words cannot get them Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated out of Chriſt's Church, though they may be denyed by him, and ſuch as he is. But his words or denyal is of no Value with us; and many others that fear God.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>W. R.</hi> ſaith in <hi>page</hi> 89. <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>We now are ſenſible, that the ſaid,</hi> J. Batt <hi>and his Three Companions (having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the place of Judges) will not think our Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from the Light within ſufficient, to Evidence their Ignorance and Weakneſs, no more than if they were <hi>four blind Prieſts,</hi> who neglecting the Heavenly Gift in themſelves, may ſeek a juſtification of their Prieſtly Juriſdiction from the Scriptures without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> His comparing us with <hi>four blind Prieſts,</hi> as aforeſaid, is both <hi>Scornful, Malicious,</hi> and greatly <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.</hi> Herein he renders us, 1ſt. <hi>As blind as the <hi>blind Prieſts</hi>.</hi> 2<hi>dly. As much neglecting the Heavenly Gift in our ſelves, as they.</hi> 3dly. <hi>As great Slighters and Contemners of the Light of Chriſt within, as they.</hi> Oh Unrighteous Judgment, I do deny <hi>W. R</hi>'s aforeſaid pretended Senſe, 'Tis groſly Falſe, and Slanderous. For we are of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32010:6"/>
Apoſtles Faith concerning the Light of Chriſt within; who ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is reproved is made manifeſt by the Light; and that which doth make Manifeſt, is Light.</hi> But neither the Light of Chriſt within us, nor the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth without, nor yet <hi>W. R</hi>'s Obſervations thereupon, hath manifeſted to us, that to be our <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>VVeakneſs,</hi> which he in his Uncharitable Lofty Mind calleth ſo. But ſuppoſe we were <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Weak,</hi> will no ſofter Words ſerve <hi>W. R.</hi> againſt us for this, than to Judge us to be in the <hi>very way of Cain,</hi> for <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Ignorance?</hi> if he could prove both againſt us, will not prove his Charge againſt us true. For they who are in the <hi>very way of Cain,</hi> are more than <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi>; they are groſly <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi> in <hi>Envy, Murder,</hi> &amp;c. O <hi>William!</hi> Thou want'ſt <hi>Charity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. Col. 3.14 2 Tim. 2.22. Tit. 2.2.</note> in this Judgment, <hi>which is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid. He alſo ſaid, <hi>If I want <hi>Charity,</hi> I am nothing</hi>; but he had it, and therein was accepted of God: But thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it wilt be rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. R.</hi> It appears in <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 91. that thou art offended at <hi>J. Batt,</hi> and his <hi>Three Companions,</hi> for citing the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> in their Reply to the <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Paper, and <hi>deſiring them to be read, and rightly apply'd, &amp;c.</hi> It appears as if thy offence were, becauſe they did not inform thoſe to whom they wrote, how to apply the aforeſaid Scriptures. And it appears, becauſe the ſaid Epiſtles are cited to be read, and rightly applyed; Thou takeſt occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>I. B.</hi> and his <hi>Three Companions,</hi> to <hi>Four Blind Prieſts, who neglecting the Heavenly gift in themſelves, may ſeek a Iuſtification of their Prieſtly Iuriſdiction from the Scriptures without.</hi> The unjuſtneſs of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is ſhewed before. But <hi>William,</hi> thou haſt brought Scriptures in defence of what thou writeſt in thy Book againſt Friends, and thou haſt not informed them how to apply them Right. Of which, I conclude, thou haſt heard
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32010:7"/>
ſomething already, and maiſt hear more hereafter. Some other of thy Companions, who write againſt Friends, have brought <hi>Scriptures</hi> to prove what they Write; but have not rightly applyed them, nor informed Friends ſo to do. Art thou willing to be Judged for not Teaching them, as aforeſaid, as thou haſt Judged U<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? Namely, to be <hi>As Blind as Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. Why ſhouldeſt thou be Offended at our citing thoſe wholeſome <hi>Epiſtles?</hi> doſt thou herein ſhew a right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for thoſe <hi>Holy Scriptures?</hi> cannot we cite <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and leave People rightly to apply them, as Guided by that <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that Guided the <hi>Holy Men</hi> in giving them forth; But for ſo doing, be by thee Judged <hi>To neglect the Heavenly Gift in our ſelves, and to be as Blind as Four Blind Prieſts?</hi> It ſeems to appear in thy Book, that thou haſt an Opinion, <hi>That the Tree of Knowledge is good for Food.</hi> But it were better for thee to wait upon <hi>God</hi> in the Light of his Son, and therein to be Obedient to Him, that ſo thou mayſt Eat of the <hi>Fruit of the Tree of Life</hi>; which Food would fill thee with <hi>Charity,</hi> without which thou canſt not be Accepted of <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Love</hi> (or <hi>Charity</hi>) as the Holy Apoſtle Teſtified.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Dignity</hi> expreſſed in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtles, cited by <hi>J. Batt,</hi> and his <hi>Thrre Companions, W. R.</hi> doth Paraphraſe upon, in a ſcornful manner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid Friends, and others; as may be ſeen in <hi>part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 92.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve,</hi> The word <hi>Dignity</hi> ſignifies <hi>Honour,</hi> as the <hi>Dictionaries</hi> render it. How often doth <hi>W. R.</hi> in his Book, call <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W. Honourable?</hi> And in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader, p.</hi> 3. he calls <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W. Two antient and honourable Labourers in the</hi> Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations and Doctrines, I have not known or underſtood to be exceeded in Godlineſs, by any Mortal Man whatſoever,</hi> ſaith he.<note n="†" rend="inter">But <hi>W. R.</hi> thus high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> as <hi>Not exceeded by any Mortal Man whatſoever,</hi> hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Witneſs of <hi>God</hi> in our Conſciences; and his <hi>Narrative,</hi> and their <hi>Paper of Condemnation</hi> prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: And hath not <hi>W. R.</hi> herein applauded <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> ſomewhat like, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did <hi>Sim. Magus?</hi>
               </note> Doth he not herein highly <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Dignify</hi> them? Why may not <hi>God Honour</hi> or <hi>Dignify</hi> his Servants; <hi>who ſeek not the</hi> Honour <hi>that comes from the</hi> Earthly Mind; <hi>but that which comes, from</hi> God <hi>only?</hi> God hath ſaid by the Mouth of the Prophet, <note n="*" rend="inter">Much more might be ſaid to this; and that from the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> as well as inward Experience. But this in ſhort at preſent.</note> 
               <hi>Them that</hi> Honour <hi>Me, I will</hi> Honour: <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> True Honour, <hi>goeth</hi> Humility. <note n="*" rend="inter">Much more might be ſaid to this; and that from the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> as well as inward Experience.

            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Government</hi> is alſo Paraphraſed on by <hi>W. R.</hi> in the two aforeſaid pages in a bitter and ſcornful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, againſt <hi>J. Batt,</hi> and many of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Servants. To which I ſay, on the behalf of Chriſt and his Church, That we own no other <hi>Government</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> but that which is upon his Shoulders; as God hath promiſed. <hi>He is one in the Male, and in the Female</hi>; as the Holy Apoſtle ſaid; who is Prince of Peace, and keeps his Subjects in Peace, and Unity one with another.</p>
