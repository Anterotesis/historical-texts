         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Papiſts, thoſe reſtleſs Enemies of the Proteſtant Religion, are
not more infamous for the unſoundneſs of their Doctrines, than for
the greatneſs of their Treaſons: where they cannot convince, they
labour to deſtroy; and rather than not ſubdue what they call (but
cannot prove) a peſtilent Hereſie, they will maſſacre the whole
Proteſtant Party; and will pull down a flouriſhing State, to build
a corrupt Church.</p>
            <p>Their Subjection to the Pope is in conſiſtent with their Allegiance to the Prince; and
if they are true Roman Catholicks, they cannot be good Engliſh Subjects: For when
they are deſigned by the Church to be made Saints, they never afterwards by the Law
can be made Rebels.</p>
            <p>And therefore when God is pleaſed, by diſcovering their Deſigns, to expoſe them to
Juſtice, there is not a man of them that is guilty, but as innocent as the Child unborn:
For unleſs their attempts ſucceed, and declare to all the World their actual Treaſon, in
deſpight of all other proofs, they will brag of their conſtant Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Willing enough they are to reap the fruits of Rebellion, but take care (if the caſe
be hazardous) to avoid the Scandal: And therefore ſometimes they ſtand behind the
Curtain, while they ſpur on others (more adventrous, though no more wicked) to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Counſels; and by expoſing them, ſecure themſelves from the Cenſure and
the Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>To be ſure, when they have Power they never want Cruelty: The <hi>Turks</hi> and the
<hi>Pagans</hi> have been out-done by their greater Perſecutions: The Stakes, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
and the Fire bear witneſs againſt them.</p>
            <p>And when they have no ſtrength, we know they want not malice, but labour by
Treachery to undermine, when by Power they cannot ſubdue; His Majeſty and our
Religion have been brought into great danger by their ſecret Plots and Conſpiracies;
The unhappy Quarrels and Diſſentions amongſt our ſelves are Tares of their ſowing.</p>
            <p>But if they want might or ſubtilty of their own, before they will deſiſt, they will
crave aſſiſtance from abroad; Foreign Powers ſhall be ingag'd to weaken us; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Popery ſhould be kept out, they will truck for an Invaſion.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is no Age, no place, but gives us too ſad Examples of their Villanies,
either Acted or Contrived.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſtrange, when men call Evil Good, that they run into all exceſs of
wickedneſs: With them 'tis lawful to tread upon the Royal Diadem to advance the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Crown; and meritorious to kill the Lords Anointed, who is really Gods Vicegerent,
for the Intereſt of the Man of Sin, who falſly calls himſelf Chriſts Vicar.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that theſe fiery Zealots ſo often ingage to Aſſaſſinate Soveraign Princes,
and imbroyl Peaceable Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53607:3"/>
The proofs hereof are too plain, and one would think needleſs, but that the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Adverſaries, that teaches them to deny the plaineſt Evidence, will not
ſuffer them to confeſs the moſt apparent Crimes.</p>
            <p>Wonder not (Good Reader) at this their boldneſs! For 'tis the old Roman-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
uſage, under a deep guilt, to proteſt an unſpotted Innocence; and then chiefly to
declare that it is not lawful to depoſe, or murther the King, when they are not able, or
want an opportunity.</p>
            <p>The truth is, 'tis no new thing for them, when they have done or intended evil, to
wipe their mouths, and ſay they have done or intended nothing: <hi>Treſham</hi> (one of
the Gunpowder Traytors) in King <hi>James</hi> his time, when he came to die, denied what
<hi>Garnet</hi> (the Provincial) proved againſt him, and what he himſelf had formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed:
And <hi>Garnet</hi> denied, upon his Salvation, with horrid imprecations, what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Oldcorn,</hi> alias <hi>Hall,</hi> proved againſt him; and at his Execution, he ſaid he was
ſorry for diſſembling with the Lords of the Council, but excus'd it, by affirming, he
did not think they had ſuch proofs againſt him: Theſe things are evident, and appear
by the Printed Tryals of thoſe Traytors.</p>
            <p>Here I preſent thee with a true and faithful account of <hi>William Parry's</hi> Treaſon,
againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of his behaviour after his Apprehenſion, upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment,
and at his Execution, written in the Year of our Lord 1584.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> p. 366. gives us a ſhort Eſſay of
all the remarkable paſſages thereof, which in this Treatiſe are more particularly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
at large, ſet forth, being done by an exact hand immediately after <hi>Parry's</hi> Execution.</p>
            <p>Peruſe it, and thou wilt find, that the Pope and the Cardinal, like <hi>Simeon</hi> and
<hi>Levi,</hi> have joyned hand in hand in wickedneſs, endeavouring, by hook or by crook, to
bring Popery into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that confederation with Foreign Powers hath heretofore been entred into to root
out Proteſtant Religion; Popiſh Forces uniting to cut off us poor Hereticks.</p>
            <p>And that 'tis commendable to deſtroy the Prince, and overthrow the Government,
to make way for the Popes Supremacy, and the Churches Vſurpation.</p>
            <p>Nay, that 'tis part of the Religion of Rome to commit Treaſon; the greateſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Mankind being the chiefeſt Darlings of that Church.</p>
            <p>And that the Laity, aſwell as the Clergy, may be influenc'd ſo far by the power of
wicked Principles, as to Eſpouſe the intereſt of the Church, to the loſs of their Allegiance.</p>
            <p>Read on, and thou wilt likewiſe find, that the Papiſts formerly have had brows of
Braſs, as well as wanted bowels of Compaſſion, and have been as unwilling to confeſs
Treaſon, as forward to commit it.</p>
            <p>And that the Papiſt, after he hath acknowledg'd his guilt, can deny his Confeſſion,
and impudently contradict, what himſelf hath freely owned: For ſhould he ſuffex as an
evil doer, he might forfeit the title of his Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>And that 'tis no new thing for a Papiſt to tell a lye with his dying breath; Rather
than a true Roman Confeſſor will be foiled, his laſt words ſhall be the falſeſt: For they
that are nurſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> are educated at <hi>Crete,</hi> and are as infamus for their Lies
as their Blood-ſhed.</p>
            <p>Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> keep ſuch a Religion to her ſelf, and God preſerve theſe
Nations from it, that we and our Poſterity may enjoy our true Religion, our Laws, our
Eſtates, our Liberties and our Lives: And let all good Proteſtants ſay Amen.</p>

DECLARATION
OF THE
Horrible Treaſons
Practiſed by WILLIAM PARRY
Againſt the Queens Majeſty;
AND OF
His Conviction and Execution for the ſame,
The <date>2d. of March 1584.</date> according to the account of England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>William Parry</hi> being a man of very mean and baſe
Parentage, but of a moſt proud and inſolent Spirit,
bearing himſelf always far above the meaſure of his
Fortune, after he had long led a waſteful and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
life, and had committed a great Outrage againſt
one <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> with an intent
to have murthered him in his own Chamber, for the which he was
moſt juſtly convicted; ſeeing himſelf generally condemned with all
good men for the ſame, and other his Miſdemeanours, he left his
natural Country, and gave himſelf to travel into forreign parts
beyond the Seas. In the courſe of this his Travel, he forſook his
Allegiance and dutiful Obedience to her Majeſty, and was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
and ſubjected himſelf to the Pope. After which, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with certain <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and others of like quality, he firſt
conceived his moſt deteſtable Treaſon to kill the Queen (whoſe
life God long preſerve;) which he bound himſelf by Promiſe,
Letters, and Vows, to perform and execute: and ſo with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
he returned into <hi>England</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1583; and ſince that
did practiſe at ſundry times to have executed his moſt deviliſh
purpoſe and determination: yet covering the ſame, ſo much as in
him lay, with a vail and pretence of great Loyalty to her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Inmediately upon his return into <hi>England,</hi> he ſought to have
ſecret Acceſs to her Majeſty, pretending to have ſome matter of
great importance to reveal unto her: which obtained, and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53607:4"/>
ſame ſo privately in her Highneſs's Palace at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had but one onely Counſellor with her at the time of his
Acceſs, in a remote place, who was ſo far diſtant, as he could not
hear his Speech. And there then he diſcovered unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
(but ſhadowed with all crafty and traiterous skill he had)
ſome part of the Conference and Proceeding, as well with the ſaid
<hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and other Miniſters of the Popes, as eſpecially with one
<hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> a Fugitive, reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> who above all others
did perſwade him to proceed in that moſt deviliſh Attempt, (as is
ſet down in his voluntary Confeſſion following,) bearing her
Majeſty notwithſtanding in hand, That his onely intent of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ſo far with the ſaid <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and the Popes Miniſters, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to no other end, but to diſcover the dangerous Practices de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
and attempted againſt her Majeſty by her diſloyal Subjects,
and other malicious perſons in forraign parts. Albeit it hath ſince
appeared moſt manifeſtly, as well by his ſaid Confeſſion, as by his
dealing with one <hi>Edmond Nevil</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> That his onely intent of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the ſame in ſort as he craftily and traiterouſly did, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to no other end, but to make the way the eaſier to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his moſt deviliſh and wicked purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And although any other Prince but her Majeſty (who is loath
to put on a hard Cenſure of thoſe that proteſt to be loyal, as
<hi>Parry</hi> did,) would rather have proceeded to the puniſhment of a
Subject that had waded ſo far, as by Oath and Vow to promiſe
the taking away of her life (as he to her Majeſties ſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;)
yet ſuch was her goodneſs, as inſtead of puniſhing, ſhe did
deal ſo graciouſly with him, as ſhe ſuffered him not onely to have
Acceſs unto her preſence, but alſo many times to have private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernce
with her; and did offer unto him, upon opinion once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his fidelity towards her (as though his wicked pretence
had been, as he proteſted, for her ſervice) a moſt liberal Penſion.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to the end that he might not grow hateful to the good
and well-affected Subjects of the Realm, (from whom he could in
no ſort have eſcaped with ſafety of his life, if his deviliſh purpoſe
had been revealed) her Majeſty did conceal the ſame, without
communicating it to any creature, untill ſuch time as he himſelf
had opened the ſame unto certain of her Council; and that it was
alſo diſcovered, that he ſought to draw the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> to have been
a party in his deviliſh and moſt wicked purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A very rare Example! and ſuch as doth more ſet forth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
goodneſs and bounty of her Majeſties Princely nature, than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53607:4"/>
commend (if it be lawful for a Subject to cenſure his Soveraign)
her providence ſuch as ought to be in a Prince and perſon of her
Majeſties wiſdom and quality. And as the goodneſs of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
nature did hereby moſt manifeſtly ſhew it ſelf to be rare in
ſo extraordinary a caſe, and in a matter of ſo great peril unto her
own Royal Perſon; ſo did the malice of <hi>Parry</hi> moſt evidently appear
to be in the higheſt and extreameſt degree: who notwithſtanding
the ſaid extraordinary grace and favour extended towards him,
did not onely perſwade the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> to be an Aſſociate in the
ſaid wicked Enterprize, but did alſo very vehemently (as <hi>Nevil</hi>
confeſſeth) importune him therein, as an Action lawful, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and meritorious, omitting nothing that might provoke him to
aſſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>But ſuch was the ſingular goodneſs of Almighty God, (who
even from her Majeſties Cradle, by many evident Arguments,
hath ſhewed himſelf her onely and eſpecial Protector) that he ſo
wrought in <hi>Nevil</hi>'s heart, as he was moved to reveal the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Majeſty; and for that purpoce made choiſe of a faithful
Gentleman, and of good quality in the Court, unto whom upon
<hi>Munday</hi> the 8th of <hi>February</hi> laſt, he diſcovered at large all that had
paſſed between <hi>Parry</hi> and him; who immediately made it known
to her Majeſty: whereupon her Highneſſes pleaſure was, That
<hi>Nevil</hi> ſhould be examined by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Hatton;</hi> who in the evening of the ſame day did examine
him; and he affirmed conſtantly all which he had before declared
to the ſaid Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, her Majeſty continued her ſingular and moſt
Princely magnanimity, neither diſmaid with the rareneſs of the
Accident, nor appaled with the horrour of ſo villanous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
tending even to the taking away of her moſt gracious life;
(a matter eſpecially obſerved by the Counſellor that was preſent
at ſuch time as <hi>Parry,</hi> after his return, did firſt diſcover unto her
Majeſty his wicked purpoſe; who found no other alteration in her
countenance, than if he had imparted unto her ſome matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;)
which ſheweth manifeſtly how ſhe repoſeth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
wholly in the defence of the Almighty. And ſo her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
following the wonted courſe of her ſingular Clemency, gave
order that <hi>Parry</hi> the ſame <hi>Munday</hi> in the evening (though not ſo
known to him) ſhould be ſent to Mr. Secretaries houſe in <hi>London,</hi>
he being then there; who according unto ſuch direction as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from her Majeſty, did let him underſtand, That her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53607:5"/>
(in reſpect of the good will ſhe knew he bare unto the ſaid
<hi>Parry,</hi> and of the Truſt that <hi>Parry</hi> did outwardly profeſs to repoſe
in Mr. Secretary) had made eſpecial choice of him to deal with
him in a matter that concerned her highly; and that ſhe doubted
not but that he would diſcharge his duty towards her, according
unto that extraordinary devotion that he profeſſed to bear unto
her.</p>
            <p>And thereupon told him that her Majeſty had been advertiſed
that there was ſomewhat intended preſently againſt her own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
wherewith ſhe thought he could not but be made acquainted,
conſidering the great Truſt that ſome of her worſt-affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
repoſed in him; and that her pleaſure therefore was, That
he ſhould declare unto him his knowledge therein: and whether
the ſaid <hi>Parry</hi> himſelf had let fall any ſpeech unto any perſon
(though with an intent onely to have diſcovered his diſpoſition)
that might draw him in ſuſpition, as though he himſelf had any
ſuch wicked intent. But <hi>Parry</hi> with great and vehement prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
denied it utterly; whereupon Mr. Secretary, the rather to
induce him to deal more plainly in a matter ſo important, declared
unto him, That there was a Gentleman of Quality, every way as
good or better than himſelf, and rather his Friend than Enemy,
that would avouch it to his face: Yet <hi>Parry</hi> perſiſted ſtubbornly
in his former denial, and juſtification of his own innocency; and
would not in any reſpect yield that he was party or privy to any
ſuch Motion, Enterprize, or intent. And being lodged that night
at Mr. Secretaries houſe, the next morning he deſired earneſtly to
have ſome further ſpeech with Mr. Secretary; which granted,
<hi>Parry</hi> declared to him, that he had called to remembrance that he
had once ſome ſpeech with one <hi>Nevil</hi> a Kinſman of his (ſo he called
him) touching a point of Doctrine contained in the Anſwer made
to the Book, entituled, <hi>The Execution of Juſtice in</hi> England; by
which book it was reſolved, That it was lawful to take away the
Life of a Prince, in furtherance of the Catholick Religion: But
he proteſted that they never had any ſpeech at all of any Attempt
intended againſt her Majeſties Perſon. Which Denial of his (at
two ſundry times, after ſo much light given him) doth ſet forth
moſt apparently both the Juſtice and Providence of God: His
Juſtice, for that (though he was one of a ſharp conceit) he had
no power to take hold of this Overture, thereby to have avoided
the danger that <hi>Nevil</hi>'s Accuſation might bring him into by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the ſame, as a thing propounded onely to feel <hi>Nevil</hi>'s mind,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53607:5"/>
whom before he had reported unto Maſter Secretary he found a
perſon diſcontented, and therefore his Confeſſion might to very
great purpoſe have ſerved to have cleared himſelf touching the
intent: His Providence, for that of his great Mercy he would
not ſuffer ſo dangerous and wicked a member to eſcape, and to
live to Her Majeſties peril.</p>
            <p>The ſame day at Night <hi>Parry</hi> was brought to the Earl of
<hi>Leiceſter</hi>'s houſe, and there eftſoons examined before the ſaid Earl
of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> Maſter Vice-Chamberlain, and Maſter Secretary:
He perſiſted ſtill in his denial of all that he was charged with.
Whereupon <hi>Nevil,</hi> being brought before him face to face, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Accuſation againſt him. He notwithſtanding would not yet
yield to confeſs it, but very proudly and inſolently oppoſed his
Credit againſt the Credit of <hi>Nevil,</hi> affirming that his <hi>No</hi> was as
good as <hi>Nevil</hi>'s <hi>Yea;</hi> and as by way of recrimination, objected
the Crime to <hi>Nevil</hi> himſelf. On the other ſide, <hi>Nevil</hi> did with
great Conſtancy affirm all that he had before ſaid, and did ſet
down many probable Circumſtances of the Times, Places, and
Manners of their ſundry Conferences, and of ſuch other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as had happened between them in the courſe of that Action.
Whereupon <hi>Parry</hi> was then committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi>
commanded by their Honours to ſet down in writing under his
Hand, all that which before he had delivered by words: which
he did with his own hand, as followeth.</p>

                           <hi>WIlliam Parry</hi> the laſt Summer, ſoon after his repulſe in
his Suit for the Maſterſhip of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> repaired
to my Lodging in the <hi>White Friars,</hi> where he ſhewed himſelf a
perſon greatly diſcontented, and vehemently inveighed againſt
Her Majeſty, and willed me to aſſure my ſelf, that during this
time and ſtate, I ſhould never receive Contentment. But
ſith, ſaid he, I know you to be Honourably deſcended, and a
Man of Reſolution, if you will give me aſſurance, either to joyn
with me, or not to diſcover me, I will deliver unto you the
only means to do your ſelf good. Which when I had promiſed
him, he appointed me to come the next day to his Houſe in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53607:6"/>
                           <hi>Fetterlane:</hi> and repairing thither accordingly, I found him in his
Bed; whereupon he commanded his men forth, and began with
me in this order. <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid he, (for ſo he called me) <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
before God, that three Reaſons principally do induce me to enter
into this Action, which I intend to diſcover unto you; the replanting
of Religion, the preferring of the</hi> Scotiſh <hi>Title, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Juſtice, wonderfully corrupted in this Commowealth:</hi> And
thereupon entred into ſome Diſcourſes what places were fit to be
taken, to give entrance to ſuch Forreign Forces as ſhould be beſt
liked of, for the furtherance of ſuch Enterprizes as were to be
undertaken. And with theſe Diſcourſes he paſſed the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he went to Dinner: after which, the Company being retired,
he entred into his former diſcourſes. <hi>And if I be not deceived,</hi>
(ſaid he) <hi>by taking of</hi> Quinborough-<hi>Caſtle, we ſhall hinder the
paſſage of the Queens Ships forth of the River.</hi> Whereunto when
he ſaw me uſe no contradiction, he ſhook me by the hand; <hi>Tuſh,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>this is nothing: If men were reſolute, there is an Enterprize
of much more moment, and much eaſier to perform; an Act honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and meritorious to God and the world.</hi> Which ſeeing me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to know, he was not aſhamed to utter in plain terms, to
conſiſt in killing of her Majeſty: <hi>Wherein,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if you will
go with me, I will looſe my Life, or deliver my Countrey from her
bad and Tyrannous Government.</hi> At which Speeches finding me
diſcontented, he asked me, if I had read Doctor <hi>Allen</hi>'s Book,
out of which he alledged an Authority for it. I anſwered, <hi>No,
and that I did not believe that Authority.</hi> Well, ſaid he, what
will you ſay, if I ſhew further Authority than this, even from
<hi>Rome</hi> itſelf a plain Diſpenſation for the killing of her, wherein
you ſhall finde it (as I ſaid before) meritorious? <hi>Good Couſin,</hi>
ſaid I, <hi>when you ſhall ſhew it me, I ſhall think it very ſtrange, when
I ſhall ſee one to hold that for meritorious, which another holdeth
for damnable.</hi> Well, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> do me but the favour to think
upon it till to morrow: And if one man be in the Town, I will
not fail to ſhew you the thing it ſelf: and if he be not, he will
be within theſe five or ſix days; at which time if it pleaſe you to
meet me <hi>at Chanon-row,</hi> we may there receive the Sacrament to
be true each to other, and then I will diſcover unto you both
the party, and the thing itſelf. Whereupon I prayed <hi>Parry</hi> to
think better upon it, as a matter of great charge both of Soul
and Body. I would to God, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> you were as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
perſwaded in it as I am, for then undoubtedly you ſhould
do God great ſervice.</p>

                           <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53607:6"/>
Not long after, eight or ten days, (as I remember) <hi>Parry</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to viſit me at my lodging in <hi>Herns</hi> rents in Holborn, as he
often uſed, we walked forth into the fields, where he renewed
again his determination to kill her Majeſty, whom he ſaid he
thought moſt unworthy to live, and that he wondred I was ſo
ſcrupulous therein. She hath ſought, ſaid he, your ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
why ſhould you not then ſeek to revenge it? I confeſs,
quoth I, that my caſe is hard, but yet am I not ſo deſperate as to
revenge it upon my ſelf, which muſt needs be the event of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
and unpoſſible an enterpriſe. Unpoſſible, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I
wonder at you; for in truth there is not any thing more eaſie:
you are no Courtier, and therefore know not her cuſtoms of
walking with ſmall train, and often in the Garden very privately,
at which time my ſelf may eaſily have acceſs unto her, and you
alſo when you are known in Court. Upon the fact we muſt have
a Barge ready to carry us with ſpeed down the River, where we
will have a ſhip ready to tranſport us if it be needfull: but upon
my head, we ſhall never be followed ſo far. I asked him, How
will you eſcape forth of the Garden? for you ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to carry any men with you, and the Gates will then be
locked, neither can you carry a Dagge without ſuſpition. As
for a Dagge, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I care not: my Dagger is enough.
And as for my eſcaping, thoſe that ſhall be with her, will be ſo
buſie about her, as I ſhall finde opportunity enough to eſcape,
if you be there ready with the Barge to receive me. But if this
ſeem dangerous in reſpect of your reaſon before ſhewed, let it
then reſt till her coming to St. <hi>James,</hi> and let us furniſh our
ſelves in the mean time with men and horſe fit for the purpoſe:
we may each of us keep eight or ten men without ſuſpition.
And for my part, ſaid he, I ſhall finde good fellows that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me without ſuſpecting mine intent. It is much, ſaid he, that
ſo many reſolute men may do upon the ſuddain, being well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
with each his Caſe of Dagges: if they were an hundred
waiting upon her, they were not able to ſave her; you coming of
the one ſide and I on the other, and diſcharging our Dagges
upon her, it were unhappy if we ſhould both miſs her. But if our
Dagges fail, I ſhall beſtir me well with a ſword ere ſhe eſcape
me. Whereunto I ſaid, Good Doctor give over this odious
enterpriſe, and trouble me no more with the hearing of that,
which in heart I loath ſo much. I would to God the enterpriſe
were honeſt, that I might make known unto thee whether I want
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53607:7"/>
ſolution. And not long after, her Majeſty came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s;
after which, one morning (the day certain I remember not,) <hi>Parry</hi>
revived again his former diſcourſe of killing her Majeſty, with
great earneſtneſs and importunity perſwading me to joyn therein:
ſaying, he thought me the onely man of <hi>England</hi> like to perform
it, in reſpect of my valure, as he termed it.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon, I made ſemblance as if I had been more willing
to hear him than before, hoping by that means to cauſe him to
deliver his minde to ſome other that might be witneſs thereof with
me; wherein nevertheleſs I failed. After all this, on Saturday
laſt, being the ſixth of <hi>February,</hi> between the hours of five and
ſix in the afternoon, <hi>Parry</hi> came to my Chamber, and deſired to
talk with me apart: whereupon we drew our ſelves to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
And where I had told <hi>Parry</hi> before, that a learned man
whom I met by chance in the fields, unto whom I proponed
the queſtion touching her Majeſty, had anſwered me that it was
an enterpriſe moſt villanous and damnable, willing me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my ſelf of it: <hi>Parry</hi> then deſired to know that learned
mans name, and what was become of him, ſaying, after a ſcornful
manner, No doubt he was a very wiſe man, and you wiſer in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
him: and ſaid further, I hope you told him not that I had
any thing from <hi>Rome.</hi> Yes in truth, ſaid <hi>I.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Parry</hi>
ſaid, I would you had not named me, nor ſpoken of any thing I
had from <hi>Rome.</hi> And thereupon he earneſtly perſwaded me eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons
to depart beyond the Seas, promiſing to procure me ſafe
paſſage into <hi>Wales,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Britain;</hi> whereat we
ended. But I then reſolved not to do ſo, but to diſcharge my
conſcience, and lay open this his moſt traiterous and abominable
intention againſt her Majeſty: which I revealed in ſort as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>IN the year 1570. I was ſworn her Majeſties ſervant, from
which time until the year 1580. I ſerved, honoured, and
loved her with as great readineſs, devotion, and aſſurance as any
poor ſubject in <hi>England.</hi> In the end of that year, and until Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer
1582. I had ſome trouble for the hurting of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the <hi>Temple.</hi> In which action I was ſo diſgraced and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by two great men (to whom I have of late been behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den)
that I never had contented thought ſince. There began my
misfortune, and here followeth my woful fall.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>July</hi> after, I laboured for licence to travail for three years,
which (upon ſome conſideration) was eaſily obtained. And ſo
in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I went over with doubtful minde of return, for that
being ſuſpected in Religion, and not having received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in twenty two years, I began to miſtruſt my advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>September</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to the Church, and adviſed to live without ſcandal, the
rather, for that it was miſtruſted by the Engliſh Catholiques, that I
had Intelligence with the greateſt Councellour of <hi>England.</hi> I ſtaied
not long there, but removed to <hi>Lions</hi> (a place of great Traffick)
where, becauſe it was the ordinary paſſage of our Nation to and
fro, between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> I was alſo ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>To put all men out of doubt of me, and for ſome other cauſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53607:8"/>
I went to <hi>Millain,</hi> from whence, as a place of ſome danger (though
I found favour there) after I had cleared my conſcience, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
my ſelf in Religion before the Inquiſitor, I went to <hi>Venice.</hi>
There I came acquainted with father <hi>Benedicto Palmio, a grave
and a learned Jeſuite.</hi> By conference with him of the hard ſtate
of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> and by reading of the Book <hi>De per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutione
Anglicana,</hi> and other diſcourſes of like argument, 1 <hi>I
conceived a poſſible mean to relieve the afflicted ſtate of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
if the ſame might be well warranted in religion and conſcience
by the Pope, or ſome learned Divines. I asked his opinion; he made
it clear, commended my devotion, comforted me in it,</hi> and after a
while made me known to the <hi>Nuntio Campeggio,</hi> there reſident for
his Holineſs. <hi>By his means I wrote to the Pope, preſented the ſervice,</hi>
and ſued for a Paſport to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to return ſafely into
<hi>France.</hi> Anſwer came from Cardinal <hi>Como,</hi> that I might come,
and ſhould be welcome. I miſliked the warrant, ſued for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I was promiſed: but it came not before my departure
to <hi>Lions,</hi> where I promiſed to ſtay ſome time for it. And being
indeed deſirous to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and loth to go without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<hi>I deſired</hi> Chriſtofero de Salazar, <hi>Secretary to the Catholick
King in</hi> Venice, <hi>who had ſome underſtanding by conference, of my
devotion to the afflicted Catholicks at home and abroad,</hi> to commend
me to the Duke <hi>di Nova Terra,</hi> Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to the
County of <hi>Olivaris Embi,</hi> then Reſident for the King his Maſter
in <hi>Rome:</hi> which he promiſed to do effectually for the one, and
did for the other. And ſo I took my journey towards <hi>Lyons,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came for me an ample Paſſeport (but ſomewhat too late,)
that I might come and go <hi>in verbo Pontificis per omnes juriſdictones
Eccleſiaſticas, abſque impedimento.</hi> I acquainted ſome good Fathers
there, of my neceſſity to depart towards <hi>Paris</hi> by promiſe, <hi>and
prayed their adviſes upon divers points; wherein I was well ſatisfied.</hi>
And ſo aſſuring them that his Holineſs ſhould hear from me
ſhortly, it was undertaken that I ſhould be excuſed for that
time.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>October</hi> I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> where (upon better opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of me amongſt my Catholick Country-men) I found my
credit well ſetled, and ſuch as miſtruſted me before, ready to truſt
and imbrace me. And being one day at the Chamber of <hi>Thomas
Morgan</hi> a Catholick Gentleman (greatly beloved and truſted on
that ſide) amongſt other Gentlemen, talking (but in very good
ſort) of <hi>England,</hi> I was deſired by <hi>Morgan</hi> to go up with him to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53607:8"/>
another Chamber, where he brake with me, and told me that it
was hoped and looked for, that I ſhould do ſome ſervice for God
and his Church. I anſwered him, I would do it, if it were to kill the
greateſt ſubject in <hi>England;</hi> whom I named, and in truth then
hated. No, no, ſaid he, let him live to his greater fall and ruine
of his houſe:</p>
                        <p>2. It is the Queen I mean. I had him as I wiſhed, and told
him it were ſoon done, if it might be lawfully done, and warranted in the
opinion of ſome learned Divines. And ſo the doubt once reſolved (though
as you have heard I was before reaſonably well ſatisfied) I vowed
to undertake the enterpriſe, for the reſtitution of <hi>England</hi> to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
obedience of the Sea Apoſtolick. <hi>Divers Divines were named.
Doctor</hi> Allein <hi>I deſired,</hi> Parſons <hi>I refuſed. And by chance came
Maſter</hi> Wattes <hi>a learned Prieſt, with whom I conferred, and was
over-ruled.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3 For he plainly pronounced (the caſe onely altered in name)
that it was utterly unlawful: with whom many Engliſh Prieſts
did agree as I have heard, if it be not altered ſince <hi>the book made
in anſwer of The execution of the Engliſh Juſtice was publiſhed,
which I muſt confeſs hath taken hard hold in me,</hi> and (I fear me)
will do in others, if it be not prevented by more gracious hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the quiet and obedient Catholick ſubjects, whereof there
is good and greater ſtore in <hi>England,</hi> than this age will extinguiſh.
<hi>Well, notwithſtanding all theſe doubts, I was gone ſo far by letters
and conference in</hi> Italy, <hi>that I could not go back, but promiſed
faithfully to perform the enterpriſe, if his Holineſs upon my offer and
letters would allow it, and grant me full remiſſion of my ſins.</hi> 4
<hi>I wrote my letters the firſt of</hi> January 1584. <hi>by their computation;
took advice upon them in confeſſion of Father</hi> Anibal <hi>a</hi> Codreto <hi>a
learned Jeſuite in</hi> Paris, <hi>was lovingly embraced, commended, confeſſed,
and communicated at the Jeſuites at one altar with the Cardinals of</hi>
Vandoſmi, <hi>and</hi> Narbone, <hi>whereof I prayed certificate, and encloſed
the ſame in my Letter to his Holineſs, to lead him the rather to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
me; which I required by my Letters, in conſideration of ſo great
an enterpriſe undertaken without promiſe or reward. 5 I went with</hi>
Morgan <hi>to the Nuntio</hi> Ragazzoni, <hi>to whom I read the Letter and
certificate encloſed, ſealed it, and left it with him to ſend to</hi> Rome:
<hi>he promiſed great care of it, and to procure anſwer: And ſo lovingly
imbraced me, wiſhed me good ſpeed, and promiſed that I ſhould be
remembred at the altar. 6 After this I deſired</hi> Morgan, <hi>that ſome
ſpecial man might be made privy to this matter, leſt he dying, and I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53607:9"/>
miſcarrying in the execution, and my intent never truly diſcovered, it
might ſtick for an everlaſting ſpot in my Race.</hi> Divers were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but none agreed upon for fear of beraying. 7 This being
done, <hi>Morgan</hi> aſſured me, that ſhortly after my departure, <hi>the</hi> L.
Fernehurſt (<hi>then in</hi> Paris) <hi>ſhould go into</hi> Scotland, <hi>and be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt news of the Queens fall to enter into</hi> England <hi>with 20 or</hi>
30000 <hi>Men</hi> to defend the Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (whom, and the
King her Son, I do in my conſcience acquit of any privity, liking,
or conſent to this, or any other bad action, for any thing that ever
I did know.) I ſhortly departed for <hi>England,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Rie</hi>
in <hi>January</hi> 1583. from whence I wrote to the Court, advertiſed
ſome, that I had a ſpecial ſervice to diſcover to the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty;
8 <hi>which I did more to prepare acceſs and credit, than for any care
I had of her Perſon,</hi> though I were fully reſolved never to touch
her (notwithſtanding any Warrant) if by any device, perſwaſion,
or policy ſhe might be wrought to deal more graciouſly with the
Catholicks than ſhe doth, or by our manner of proceeding in
Parliament meaneth to do, or any thing yet ſeen. I came to the
Court, (then at <hi>Whitehall,</hi>) prayed audience, had it at large, and
very privately diſcovered to her Majeſty this Conſpiracy, much to
this effect, <hi>though covered with all the skill I had:</hi> ſhe took it
doubtfully, I departed with fear. And amongſt other things, I
cannot forget he. Majeſties gratious ſpeech then uttered touching
the Catholicks, which of late, after a ſort I avowed in Parliament:
ſhe ſaid to me, that never a Catholick ſhould be troubled for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or Supremacy, ſo long as they lived like good Subjects.
Whereby I miſtruſted that her Majeſty is born in hand, that none
is troubled for the one or the other. It may be truly ſaid, that it
is better than it hath been, though it be not yet as it ſhould be.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>March</hi> laſt, while I was at <hi>Greenwich</hi> (as I remember) ſuing
for St. <hi>Katherines, came Letters to me from Cardinal</hi> Como, <hi>dated
at</hi> Rome, <hi>the laſt of</hi> January <hi>before, whereby I found the enterpriſe
commended, and allowed, and my ſelf abſolved (in his Holineſs name)
of all my ſins, and willed to go forward in the name of God.</hi> That
Letter I ſhewed to ſome in Court, who imparted it to the Queen:
what it wrought, or may work in her Majeſty, God knoweth:
onely this I know, 9 that <hi>it confirmed my reſolution to kill her, and
made it clear in my conſcience, that it was lawful and meritorious.</hi>
And yet was I determined never to do it, if either policy, practice,
perſwaſion, or motion in Parliament could prevail. I feared to be
tempted, and therefore always when I came near her, I left my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53607:9"/>
Dagger at home. 10 <hi>When I looked upon her Majeſty, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
her many excellencies, I was greatly troubled: And yet I ſaw no
remedy, for my Vows were in Heaven, my Letters and Promiſes in
Earth,</hi> and the caſe of the Catholick Recuſants, and others, little
bettered. Sometimes I ſaid to my ſelf, Why ſhould I care for
her? what hath ſhe done for me? have I not ſpent 10000 Marks
ſince I knew her ſervice, and never had peny by her? It may be
ſaid, ſhe gave me my life. But I ſay (as my caſe ſtood) it had
been Tyranny to take it: And I fear me it is little leſs yet. If
it pleaſe her gratiouſly to look into my diſcontentments, I would
to Jeſus Chriſt ſhe had it, for I am weary of it. And now to
come to an end of this tragical diſcourſe: In <hi>July</hi> I left the Court,
utterly rejected, diſcontented, and as her Majeſty might perceive
by my paſſionate Letters, careleſs of my ſelf. I came to <hi>London:</hi>
Doctor Alleins <hi>Book was ſent me out of</hi> France: 11 <hi>it redoubled my
former conceits: Every word in it was a warrant to a prepared mind:
It taught that Kings may be excommunicated, deprived, and violently
handled: It proveth that all Wars Civil or Forraign undertaken for
Religion, is Honorable.</hi> Her Majeſty may do well to read it, and
to be out of doubt (if things be not amended) that it is a warning,
and a Doctrine full dangerous. This is the Book I ſhewed, in
ſome places read, <hi>and lent it to my Couſin</hi> Nevil (the accuſer) who
came often to mine houſe, put his finger in my Diſh, his hand
in my Purſe; and the night wherein he accuſed me, was wrapped
in my Gown, ſix moneths at leaſt after we had entred into this
Conſpiracy: In which ſpace her Majeſty, and ten Princes in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Provinces might have been killed. God bleſs her Majeſty
from him: for before Almighty God, I joy and am glad in my
ſoul, that it was his hap <hi>to diſcover me in time,</hi> though there were
no danger near.</p>
                        <p>And now to the manner of our meetings. He came to me in
the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſpake to me in this or like ſort.
Couſin, let us do ſomewhat, ſithens we can have nothing. I
offered to joyn with him, and gladly heard him, <hi>hoping becauſe
I knew him to be a Catholick, that he would hit upon that I had in
my head:</hi> but it fell not out ſo. He thought the delivery of the
Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> eaſie, preſuming upon his Credit and Kindred
in the North: I thought it dangerous to her, and impoſſible to
men of our fortunes: He fell from that to the taking of <hi>Barwick:</hi>
I ſpake of <hi>Quinborough</hi> and the Navy, rather to entertain him with
diſcourſe, than that I cared for thoſe motions, <hi>my head being full
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53607:10"/>
of a greater matter:</hi> 12 I told him that I had another manner of
Enterpriſe, more honourable and profitable to us, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
Common-wealth, than all theſe, if he would joyn in it with
me, as he preſently vowed to do: He preſſed to know it; I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to ſleep upon the motion: He did ſo, (and belike over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken)
came to me the next morning to my Lodging in <hi>London,</hi>
offered to joyn with me, and <hi>took his Oath upon a Bible, to conceal
and conſtantly to purſue the enterpriſe for the advancement of Religion;
which I alſo did, and meant to perform: the killing of the Queen was
the matter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The manner and place, to be on Horsback, with eight or ten
horſes, when ſhe ſhould ride abroad about St. <hi>James,</hi> or ſome
other like place. It was once thought fit in a Garden, and that
the eſcape would be eaſieſt by water into <hi>Shepey,</hi> or ſome other
part: but we reſolved upon the firſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This continued as agreed upon many moneths,</hi> until he heard of
the death of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> whoſe Land and Dignity (whereof he
aſſured himſelf) bred belike this Conſcience in him to diſcover a
Treaſon in <hi>February,</hi> contrived and agreed upon in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> If it
coſt him not an ambitious Head at laſt, let him never truſt me.
He brought a tall Gentleman (whom he commended for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Piſtolier) to me to <hi>Chanon-Row,</hi> to make one in the match:
but I refuſed to deal with him, being loth to lay my head upon
ſo many hands.</p>
                        <p>Maſter <hi>Nevil</hi> hath (I think) forgotten, that he did ſwear to
to me at divers times, that all the advancement ſhe could give,
ſhould ſerve but for her ſcourge, if ever time and occaſion ſhould
ſerve: and that though he would not lay hand upon her in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
his heart ſerved him to ſtrike off her Head in the field. Now
leaving him to himſelf, this much (to make an end) I muſt confeſs
of my ſelf, I did mean to try what might be done in Parliament,
to do my beſt to hinder all hard courſes, to have prayed hearing
of the Queens Majeſty, to move her (if I could) to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon her Catholick Subjects; <hi>and when all had failed, to do as I
intended.</hi> If her Majeſty by this courſe would have eaſed them,
though ſhe had never preferred me, I had with all comfort and
patience born it: 13 but if ſhe had preferred me without eaſe or
care of them, the Enterpriſe had held.</p>

                  <p>MY Lords, now that the Conſpiracy is diſcovered, the
Fault confeſſed, my Conſcience cleared, and Minde
prepared patiently to ſuffer the Pains due for ſo heinous a
Crime: I hope it ſhall not offend you, if crying <hi>Miſerere</hi> with
the poor Publican, I leave to deſpair with curſed <hi>Cain.</hi> My
Caſe is rare and ſtrange, and, for any thing I can remember,
ſingular: A natural Subject ſolemnly to vow the Death of his
natural Queen (ſo born, ſo known, and ſo taken by all men)
for the Relief of the afflicted Catholicks, and Reſtitution of
Religion. The Matter firſt conceived in <hi>Venice,</hi> the Service
(in general words) preſented to the Pope, continued and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
in <hi>Paris;</hi> and laſtly, commended and warranted by
his Holineſs, digeſted and reſolved in <hi>England,</hi> if it had not
been prevented by Accuſation, or by her Majeſties greater
Lenity and more gracious Uſage of her Catholick Subjects.
This is my firſt and laſt Offence conceived againſt my Prince
or Country, and doth (I cannot deny) contein all other
faults whatſoever. It is now to be puniſhed by Death, or
moſt graciouſly (beyond all common expectation) to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
Death I do confeſs to have deſerved; Life I do
(with all Humility) crave, if it may ſtand with the Queens
Honour, and Policy of the Time. To leave ſo great a
Treaſon unpuniſhed, were ſtrange: To draw it by my Death
in example, were dangerous: A ſworn Servant to take upon
him ſuch an Enterprize, upon ſuch a ground, and by ſuch a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
hath not been ſeen in <hi>England:</hi> To Indict him, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
him, bring him to the Scaffold, and to publiſh his Offence,
can do no good: To hope that he hath more to diſcover
than is Confeſſed, or that at his Execution he will unſay any
thing he hath written, is in vain: To conclude, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him in time to make ſome part of amends, were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53607:11"/>
very hard, and againſt former Experiences. The Queſtion
then is, whether it be better to kill him, or (leſt the matter
be miſtaken) upon hope of his amendment to pardon him. For
mine own opinion (though partial) I will deliver you my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
The Caſe is good Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi> the Offence is
committed againſt her Sacred Perſon, and ſhe may (of her
Mercy) pardon it without prejudice to any. Then this I ſay,
in few words, as a man more deſirous to diſcharge his troubled
Conſcience, than to live. Pardon poor <hi>Parry,</hi> and relieve him:
for life without living is not fit for him. If this may not be, or
be thought dangerous, or diſhonourable to the Queens Majeſty
(as by your favours, I think it full of Honour and Mercy) then
I beſeech your Lordſhips (and no other) once to hear me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I be Indicted, and afterwards (if I muſt dye) humbly
to intreat the Queens Majeſty to haſten my Trial and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I pray God (with all my heart) may prove as
honourable to her, as I hope it ſhall be happy to me; who
will, while I live, (as I have done always) pray to Jeſus Chriſt

                  <p>RIght honourable Sir, when your Honour demanded me if
Mr. <hi>Parry</hi> did ask me, If it was reaſon to kill the
Queen, indeed and verity, then I had no remembrance at all
thereof. But ſince, thinking on the matter, I have called to
mind the whole faſhion of his dealing with me, and ſome of his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53607:12"/>
Arguments: for he dealt very craftily with me, I dare not ſay
maliciouſly. For I did in no ways think of any ſuch deſign of
his, or of any other, and did anſwer him ſimply after my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and knowledge to the verity of the queſtion. For after
that I had anſwered him twice before, <hi>Quòd omnino non liceret,</hi>
he returned late at Even, by reaſon I was to depart early in the
next Morning toward <hi>Chamberie</hi> in <hi>Savoy</hi> where I did remain,
and being return'd out of the Cloſe within one of the Claſſes of
the Colledge, he proponed to me of the new matter, with his
Reaſons and Arguments. Firſt, he alledged the utility of the
deed for delivering of ſo many Catholicks out of miſery, and
reſtitution of the Catholick Religion. I anſwered, that the
Scripture anſwereth thereto, ſaying, <hi>Non ſunt facienda mala, ut
veniant bona.</hi> So that for no good, how great that ever it be,
may be wrought any evil, how little that ever it be. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that it was not evil to take away ſo great evil, and induce
ſo great good. I anſwered, That all good is not to be done,
but that onely, <hi>Quod bene &amp; legitime fieri poteſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Dixi, Deum magis amare adverbia quàm nomina. Quia in
actionibus magis ei placent bene &amp; legitime, quam bonum. Ita
ut nullum bonum liceat facere, niſi bene &amp; legitimè fieri poſſit.
Quod in hoc caſu fieri non poteſt.</hi> Yet ſaid he, that ſeveral learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men were of the opinion, <hi>Quod liceret.</hi> I anſwered, that
they men perhaps were of the opinion that for the ſafety of
many in Soul and Body, they would permit a particular to his
danger, and to the occult judgment of God: Or perhaps ſaid
ſo, moved rather by ſome compaſſion and commiſeration of
the miſerable eſtate of the Catholicks, not for any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that they did finde in their Books. For it is certain, that
ſuch a thing is not licite to a particular, without ſpecial revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Divine, which exceedeth our Learning and Doctrine. And

the Priſoner to the Bar, to whom <hi>Miles Sandes</hi> Eſquire, Clerk of

ſo. Then ſaid the Clerk of the Crown, Thou art here Indicted
by the Oaths of twelve good and lawful men of the County of
<hi>Middleſex,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Indictment.</note> before Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wray</hi> Knight,

name of <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Gentleman, otherwiſe
called <hi>William Parry,</hi> late of <hi>London,</hi> Doctor of the Law; for
that thou, as a falſe Traitor againſt the moſt Noble and Chriſtian
Prince, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> thy moſt gracious Soveraign and Liege-Lady,
not having the fear of God before thine eyes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
thy due Allegiance; but being ſeduced by the inſtigation
of the Devil, and intending to withdraw and extinguiſh the
hearty Love and due Obedience which true and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhould bear unto the ſame our Soveraign Lady, didſt at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> on the firſt day of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
in the 26th year of her Highneſs Reign, and at divers other
times and places in the ſame County, maliciouſly and traiterouſly
conſpire and compaſs, not only to deprive and depoſe the ſame
our Sovereign Lady of her Royal Eſtate, Title and Dignity;
but alſo to bring her Highneſs to Death and final Deſtruction,
and Sedition in the Realm to make, and the Government thereof
to ſubvert, and the ſincere Religion of God eſtabliſhed in her
Highneſs Dominions to alter and ſubvert. And that, whereas
thou <hi>William Parry,</hi> by thy Letters ſent unto <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> didſt ſignifie unto the ſame Biſhop thy purpoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
aforeſaid, and thereby didſt pray and require the ſame
Biſhop to give thee Abſolution; that thou afterwards, that is to
ſay, the laſt day of <hi>March</hi> in the 26th year aforeſaid, didſt trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly
receive Letters from one called <hi>Cardinal de Como,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto thee <hi>William Parry,</hi> whereby the ſame Cardinal did
ſignifie unto thee, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had peruſed thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and allowed of thine intent; and that to that end he had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53607:14"/>
abſolved thee of all thy Sins, and by the ſame Letter did animate
and ſtir thee to proceed with thine Enterprize; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
thou, the laſt day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the 26th year aforeſaid,
at Saint <hi>Giles in the fields,</hi> in the ſame County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> didſt
traiterouſly confer with one <hi>Edmund Nevil</hi> Eſquire, uttering to
him all thy wicked and traiterous deviſes, and then and there
didſt move him to aſſiſt thee therein, and to joyn with thee in
thoſe wicked Treaſons aforeſaid, againſt the Peace of our ſaid
Soveraign Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity. What
ſayeſt thou, <hi>William Parry,</hi> Art thou guilty of theſe Treaſons
whereof thou ſtandeſt here Indicted, or not guilty?</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>Parry</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> anſwer to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</note> Before I plead not guilty, or
confeſs my ſelf guilty, I pray you give me leave
to ſpeak a few words: and with humbling himſelf, began in this
manner. God ſave Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and God ſend me grace to
diſcharge my duty to her, and to ſend you home in charity.
But touching the matters that I am Indicted of, ſome were in one
place, and ſome in another, and done ſo ſecretly, as none can ſee
into them, except that they had eyes like unto God; wherefore
I will not lay my Blood upon the Jury, but do minde to confeſs
the Indictment. It containeth but the parts that have been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
read, I pray you tell me? Whereunto it was anſwered, that
the Indictment contained the parts he had heard read, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
whereupon the Clerk of the Crown ſaid unto <hi>Parry, Parry,</hi>
thou muſt anſwer directly to the Indictment, whether thou be
guilty or not.</p>
                        <p>Then ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry</hi> confeſſeth that he is guilty of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Indictment.</note> I do confeſs that I am guilty
of all that is therein contained: And further
too, I deſire not life, but deſire to die. Unto
which the Clerk of the Crown ſaid, If you confeſs it, you muſt
confeſs it in manner and form as it is compriſed in the Indictment.
Whereunto he ſaid, I do confeſs it in manner and form as the
ſame is ſet down, and all the circumſtances therof. Then the
Confeſſion being Recorded, the Queens learned Council being
ready to pray Judgment upon the ſame Confeſſion, Maſter Vice-chamberlain
ſaid, Theſe matters contained in this Indictment, and
confeſſed by this man, are of great importance: they touch the
Perſon of the Queens moſt excellent Majeſty in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the very ſtate and well-doing of the whole Common-wealth,
and the truth of Gods Word eſtabliſhed in theſe her Majeſties
Dominions, and the open demonſtration of that capital envy of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53607:14"/>
the man of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath ſet himſelf againſt God and all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
all good Princes and good Government, and againſt good
men. Wherefore, I pray you, for the ſatisfaction of this great
Multitude, let the whole matter appear, that every one may ſee
that the matter of it ſelf is as bad as the Indictment purporteth,
and as he hath Confeſſed. Whereto in reſpect that the Juſtice of
the Realm hath been of late very impudently ſlandered, all yielded
as a thing neceſſary to ſatisfie the world in particular, of that
which was but ſummarily compriſed in the Indictment, though in
the Law, his Confeſſion ſerved ſufficiently to have proceeded
thereupon unto Judgment. Whereupon the Lords and others
the Commiſſioners, her Majeſties learned Councel, and <hi>Parry</hi>
himſelf agreed, that <hi>Parry</hi>'s Confeſſion (taken the 11th and 13th
of <hi>February</hi> 1584. before the Lord of <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> Maſter Vice-chamberlain,
and Maſter Secretary,) and Cardinal <hi>de Como</hi> his
Letters, and <hi>Parry</hi>'s Letters to the Lord Treaſurer and Lord
Steward, ſhould be openly read.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Parry,</hi> for the better ſatisfying of the people and ſtanders
by, offered to read them himſelf: but being told that the Order
was, the Clerk of the Crown ſhould read them, it was ſo reſolved
of all parts. And then Maſter Vice-chamberlain cauſed to be
ſhewed to <hi>Parry</hi> his ſaid Confeſſion, the Cardinals Letter, and his
own Letter aforeſaid; which after he had particularly viewed
every leaf thereof, he confeſſed, and ſaid openly they were the
ſame.</p>
                        <p>Then ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain, Before we proceed to ſhew
what he hath Confeſſed, what ſay you, ſaid he to <hi>Parry,</hi> is that
which you have Confeſſed here true, and did you Confeſs it freely
and willingly of your ſelf, or was then any extort means uſed to
draw it from you?</p>
                        <p>Surely, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> I made that Confeſſion freely without any
conſtraint, and that is all true, and more too: for there is no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that hath been ſithens the ſirſt year of the Queen, any way
touching Religion, ſaving receipt of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perſwading
of others, wherein I have not much dealt, but I have offended in
it. And I have alſo delivered mine opinion in writing, who
ought to be Succeſſor to the Crown, which he faid to be Treaſon
alſo.</p>
                        <p>Then his Confeſſion of the eleventh and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>February,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> Confeſſion of his Treaſons was read by his own aſſent.</note> all of his own hand writing,
and before particularly ſet down, was openly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53607:15"/>
and diſtinctly read by the Clerk of the Crown. And that done,
the Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> his Letter in Italian was delivered unto <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
hand by the direction of Maſter Vicechamberlain, which
<hi>Parry</hi> there peruſed,<note place="margin">A Letter of Cardinal <hi>di Como</hi> to <hi>Parry,</hi> alſo read.</note> and openly affirmed to
be wholly of the Cardinals own hand writing,
and the Seal to be his own alſo, and to be with a Cardinals Hat
on it: And himſelf did openly read it in <hi>Italian,</hi> as before is ſet
down. And the words bearing ſence as it were written to a
Biſhop, or to a man of ſuch degree, it was demanded of him by
Maſter Vice-Chamberlain, Whether he had not taken the degree
of a Biſhop? He ſaid, No: But ſaid at firſt, thoſe terms were
proper to the Degree he had taken. And after ſaid, that the
Cardinal did vouchſafe, as of a favour, to write ſo to him. Then
the Copy of that Letter in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as before is alſo ſet down,
was in like manner openly read by the Clerk of the Crown;
which <hi>Parry</hi> then acknowledged to be truely tranſlated.</p>
                        <p>And thereupon was ſhewed unto <hi>Parry</hi> his
Letter of the 18th of <hi>February,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry's</hi> Letter of the 18th of <hi>February</hi> to the Lord Treaſurer and the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> read.</note> written to

                           <hi>Theſe matters being read openly, for manifeſtation of the

ſaid,</hi> If you will ſay any thing for the better opening
to the world of thoſe your foul and horrible Facts, ſpeak on: but if
you mean to make any excuſe of that which you have confeſſed, which
elſe would have been and do ſtand proved againſt you, for my part,
I will not ſit to hear you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then her Majeſties Attourney-General ſtood up and ſaid.</hi> It
appeareth before you, my Lords, that this man hath been Indicted

hath confeſſed them, which is before you of Record; wherefore there
reſteth no more to be done, but for the Court to give Judgment
accordingly,<note place="margin">The Queens Atturny requires Judgment.</note> which here I require in the behalf of

                        <p>
                           <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Parry, I pray you hear me for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of my Conſcience. I will not go about to excuſe my ſelf, nor
to ſeek to ſave my Life, I care not for it; you have my Confeſſion of
record, that is enough for my Life. And I mean to utter more, for
which I were worthy to die. <hi>And ſaid,</hi> I pray you hear me, in that
I am to ſpeak to diſcharge my Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53607:15"/>
Then ſaid Maſter Vice-Chamberlain, <hi>Parry,</hi> then do thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                        <p>

commended and allowed of by his Holineſs, and was to have been executed
in <hi>England,</hi> if it had not been prevented. Yea, I have committed many

in taking Abſolution.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Parry</hi> had for his credit aforetime ſaid very ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he had been ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited beyond the Seas to commit the fact, but he would not do it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he craftily abuſed both the Queens Majeſty, and thoſe two Counſellers whereof he now would help himſelf with theſe falſe Speeches, againſt moſt manifeſt proofs.</note> There hath been no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſithens the firſt year of the Queens Reign tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

receiving of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and perſwading as I have
ſaid:) And yet never intended to kill Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I appeal to her own knowledge, and to
my Lord Treaſurers, and Maſter Secretaries.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then</hi> ſaid my <hi>L<hi rend="sup">d</hi>

thou ſhouldeſt have thy judgment according to that which thou haſt
Confeſſed thy ſelf guilty of, doeſt thou go back again, and deny the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of all? How can we believe that thou now ſayeſt?</p>
                        <p>Then ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain,<note place="margin">Maſter Vice-chamberlains Speeches, proving mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly <hi>Parry's</hi> Traiterous intentions.</note> This
is abſurd. Thou haſt not onely Confeſſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
that thou wert guilty according to the
Indictment, which ſummarily, and yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words doth contain that thou hadſt Traiterouſly compaſſed
and intended the death and deſtruction of her Majeſty; but thou
alſo ſaidſt particularly that thou wert guilty of every of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
contained therein, whereof the ſame was one, in plain and
expreſs letter ſet down, and read unto thee. Yea, thou ſaidſt
that thou wert guilty of more Treaſons too beſides theſe. And
didſt thou not upon thy examination voluntarily confeſs, how
thou waſt moved firſt thereunto by miſlike of thy ſtate after thy
departure out of the Realm, And that thou didſt miſlike her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
for that ſhe had done nothing for thee; How by wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and Popiſh Books, thou wert perſwaded that it was lawful
to kill her Majeſty; How thou wert by reconciliation become
one of that wicked ſort, that held her Majeſty for neither lawful
Queen nor Chriſtian, And that it was meritorious to kill her?
And didſt thou not ſignifie that thy purpoſe to the Pope by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersand,
receivedſt Letters from the Cardinal, how he allowed of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53607:16"/>
thine intent, and excited thee to perform it, and thereupon didſt
receive Abſolution? And didſt thou not conceive it, promiſe it,
vow it, ſwear it, and receive the Sacrament that thou wouldſt do
it? And didſt not thou thereupon affirm, that thy Vows were in
Heaven, and thy Letters and Promiſes on Earth to binde thee to
do it? And that whatſoever her Majeſty would have done for
thee, could not have removed thee from that intention or purpoſe,
unleſs ſhe would have deſiſted from dealing as ſhe hath done with
the Catholicks, as thou calleſt them? All this thou haſt plainly
Confeſſed: And I proteſt before this great Aſſembly, thou haſt
Confeſſed it more plainly and in better ſort, than my memory will
ſerve me to utter: And ſaiſt thou now, that thou never meant'ſt it?</p>
                        <p>Ah, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> your Honours know, how my Confeſſion upon
mine Examination was extorted.</p>
                        <p>Then both the Lord <hi>Hunſdon</hi> and Maſter Vice-Chamberlain

him.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Parry</hi> then ſaid, that they told him, that if he would not
confeſs willingly, he ſhould have torture: whereunto their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
anſwered, that they uſed not any ſpeech or word of torture
to him.</p>
                        <p>You ſaid, ſaid <hi>Parry,</hi> that you would proceed with rigour againſt
me, if I would not confeſs it of my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But their Honours expreſly affirmed, that they uſed no ſuch words.
But I will tell thee, ſaid Maſter Vice-chamberlain, what we ſaid. I
ſpake theſe words: If you will willingly utter the truth of your
ſelf, it may do you good, and I wiſh you to do ſo: If you will not,
we muſt then proceed in ordinary courſe to take your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereunto you anſwered, that you would tell the truth of
your ſelf.<note place="margin">

yielded unto.</p>
                        <p>And hereunto, her Majeſties Attourney-General
put <hi>Parry</hi> in remembrance what Speeches he uſed to the
Lieutenant of the Tower, the Queens Majeſties Serjeant at Law,
Maſter <hi>Gaudie,</hi> and the ſame Attourney, on Saturday the twentieth
of <hi>February</hi> laſt, at the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon that he was by them then
examined by Order from the Lords: which was, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
he was moſt mildly and favourably dealt with, in all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations:
which he alſo at the Bar then acknowledg'd to be true.</p>
                        <p>Then Maſter Vice-chamberlain ſaid, that it was wonder to ſee
the magnanimity of her Majeſty, which after that thou hadſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53607:16"/>
opened thoſe Trayterous Practices in ſort as thou haſt laid it
down in thy Confeſſion, was nevertheleſs ſuch, and ſo far from
all fear, as that ſhe would not ſo much as acquaint any one of her
Highneſs Privy-Council with it, to his knowledge, no not until
after this thine Enterpriſe diſcovered and made manifeſt. And
beſides that which thou haſt ſet down under thine own hand,
thou didſt confeſs, that thou hadſt prepared two <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
fit for ſuch a purpoſe; and thoſe being diſpoſed away
by thee, thou didſt ſay, that another would ſerve thy turn.
And withal, <hi>Parry,</hi> didſt thou not alſo confeſs before us, how
wonderfully thou wert appaled and perplexed upon a ſudden,
at the preſence of her Majeſty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> this laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ſaying, that thou didſt think, thou then ſaweſt in her, the
very likeneſs and image of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh? And that
therewith, and upon ſome Speeches uſed by her Majeſty, thou
didſt turn about and weep bitterly to thy ſelf? And yet didſt
call to minde that thy Vows were in Heaven, thy Letters and
Promiſes on Earth; and that therefore thou didſt ſay with thy
ſelf, that there was no remedy but to do it? Didſt thou not
confeſs this? The which he acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then ſaid the Lord</hi> Hunſdon,<note place="margin">The L. of <hi>Hunſdon's</hi> Speeches, convincing <hi>Parry</hi> manifeſtly of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Sayeſt thou
now, that thou didſt never mean to kill the
Queen? Didſt thou not confeſs, that when thou
didſt utter this practice of treachery to her Majeſty,
that thou didſt cover it with all the skill thou hadſt, and that it was
done by thee, rather to get credit and acceſs thereby, than for any
regard thou hadſt of her Perſon? But in truth thou didſt it, that
thereby thou mighteſt have better opportunity to perform thy wicked
Enterpriſe. And wouldeſt thou have run into ſuch fear as thou didſt
confeſs that thou wert in, when thou didſt utter it, if thou
hadſt never meant it? What reaſon canſt thou ſhew for thy ſelf?
<hi>With that he cryed out in a furious manner,</hi> I never meant to kill
her: I will lay my Blood upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and you, before God

                        <p>Then ſaid the Lord <hi>Hunſdon,</hi> This is but thy Popiſh Pride and

of that Faction, to make them believe that thou dieſt for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
when thou dieſt for moſt horrible and dangerous Treaſons
againſt her Majeſty, and thy whole Country. For thy laying
of thy Bloud, it muſt lye on thine own Head, as a juſt Reward
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53607:17"/>
of thy wickedneſs. The Laws of the Realm moſt juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee to die, out of thine own mouth, for the conſpiring the
Deſtruction both of her Majeſty, and of us all: Therefore thy
Bloud be upon thee; neither her Majeſty nor we at any time
ſought it, thy ſelf haſt ſpilt it.</p>
                        <p>Then he was asked, What he could ſay, why Judgment of

you ſhall finde what I mean.</p>
                        <p>I proteſt (ſaid his Honour) I know not what thou meaneſt:
thou doſt not well to uſe ſuch dark Speeches, unleſs thou wouldſt
plainly utter what thou meaneſt thereby. But he ſaid, he cared
not for Death, and that he would lay his Bloud amongſt them.</p>
                        <p>Then ſpake the Lord Chief-Juſtice of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>

                           </note>
being required to give the Judgment,
and ſaid, <hi>Parry,</hi> you have been much heard,
and what you mean by being ſettled, I know not; but I ſee
you are ſo ſettled in Popery, that you cannot ſettle your ſelf to
be a good Subject. But touching that you ſhould ſay, to ſtay
Judgment from being given againſt you, your Speeches muſt be
of one of theſe kinds, either to prove the Indictment (which
you have confeſſed to be true) to be inſufficient in Law; or elſe
to plead ſomewhat touching her Majeſties Mercy, why Juſtice
ſhould not be done of you. All other Speeches, wherein you
have uſed great Liberty, is more than by Law you can ask.
Theſe be the matters you muſt look to, what ſay you to them?
Whereto he ſaid nothing.</p>
                        <p>Then ſaid the Lord Chief-Juſtice, <hi>Parry,</hi> thou haſt been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time Indicted of divers moſt horrible and hateful Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
committed againſt thy moſt gracious Soveraign and Native
Country: the matter moſt deteſtable, the manner moſt ſubtle
and dangerous, and the occaſions and means that led thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
moſt ungodly and villanous. That thou didſt intend it,
it is moſt evident by thy ſelf. The matter was the deſtruction
of a moſt Sacred and an Anointed Queen, thy Sovereign and
Miſtriſs, who hath ſhewed thee ſuch Favour, as ſome thy betters
have not obtained: Yea, the Overthrow of thy Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wert born, and of a moſt happy Commonwealth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53607:17"/>
thou art a Member, and of ſuch a Queen, as hath beſtowed
on thee the Benefit of all benefits in this world, that is, thy Life,
heretofore granted thee by her Mercy, when thou hadſt loſt it by
Juſtice and Deſert. Yet thou her Servant, ſworn to defend her,
meant'ſt with thy bloudy hand to have taken away her Life, that
mercifully gave thee thine, when it was yielded into her hands:
This is the matter wherein thou haſt offended. The manner
was moſt ſubtle and dangerous, beyond all that before thee have
committed any Wickedneſs againſt her Majeſty. For thou,
making ſhew as if thou wouldeſt ſimply have uttered for her
ſafety the Evil that others had contrived, didſt but ſeek thereby
credit and acceſs, that thou mighteſt take the apter opportunity
for her Deſtruction. And for the occaſions and means that drew
thee on, they were moſt ungodly and villanous, as the perſwaſions
of the Pope, of Papiſts, and Popiſh Books. The Pope pretendeth
that he is a Paſtor, when as in truth, he is far from feeding of
the Flock of Chriſt; but rather as a Wolf, ſecketh but to feed on
and to ſuck out the blood of true Chriſtians, and as it were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
after the bloud of our moſt Gracious and Chriſtian Queen.
And theſe Papiſts and Popiſh Books, while they pretend to ſet
forth Divinity, they do indeed moſt ungodly teach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
that which is quite contrary both to God and his Word.
For the Word teaches Obedience of Subjects towards Princes,
and forbideth any private man to kill: But they teach Subjects to
diſobey Princes, and that a private wicked perſon may kill;
yea, and whom? A moſt godly Queen, and their own natural
and moſt gracious Soveraign. Let all men therefore take heed how
they receive any thing from him, hear or read any of their Books,
and how they confer with any Papiſts. God grant her Majeſty,
that ſhe may know by thee, how ever ſhe truſt ſuch like to come
ſo near her Perſon. But ſee the end, and why thou didſt it;
and it will appear to be a moſt miſerable, fearful, and fooliſh
thing: For thou didſt imagine, that it was to relieve thoſe, that
thou calleſt Catholicks, who were moſt likely amongſt all others
to have felt the worſt of it, if thy deviliſh practice had taken
effect. But ſith thou haſt been Indicted of the Treaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the Indictment, and thereupon Arraigned,<note place="margin">The Form of the Judgment againſt the Traitor.</note>
and haſt confeſſed thy ſelf Guilty of them, the
Court doth award, that thou ſhalt be had from
hence to the place whence thou didſt come, and ſo drawn through
the open City of <hi>London</hi> upon an Hurdle to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53607:18"/>
and there to be hanged and let down alive, and thy privy
parts cut off, and thy entrals taken out and burnt in thy ſight, then
thy Head to be cut off, and thy Body to be divided in four parts, and
to be diſpoſed at her Majeſties pleaſure: And God have mercy
on thy Soul.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Parry</hi> nevertheleſs perſiſted ſtill in his rage and fond Speech,
and ragingly there ſaid, he there ſummoned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
to anſwer for his Blood before God: wherewith, the Lieutenant
of the <hi>Tower</hi> was commanded to take him from the Bar, and ſo
he did. And upon his departure, the people ſtricken as it were
at heart with the horror of his intended Enterpriſe, ceaſed not,
but purſued him with out-cryes, as, Away with the Traitor, away
with him, and ſuch like: whereupon he was conveyed to the
Barge, to paſs to the <hi>Tower</hi> again by water, and the Court was
adjorned.</p>
                        <p>After which,<note place="margin">2. Martii. <hi>William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Traytor Executed.</note> upon the ſecond day of this
inſtant <hi>March, William Parry</hi> was by vertue of
proceſs in that behalf, awarded from the ſame Commiſſioners of
<hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> delivered by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the morning, unto the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
who received him at the <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and thereupon, according to
the judgment, cauſed him there to be forthwith ſet on the Hurdel.
From whence he was drawn thereupon threw the midſt of the City
of <hi>London,</hi> unto the place for his Execution in the <hi>Pallace</hi> at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi>
where, having long time of ſtay admitted unto him before his
Execution, he moſt maliciouſly and impudently, after ſome other
vain diſcourſes eftſoons and often delivered in Speech, that he
was never guilty of any intention to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſo
(without any requeſt made by him to the people to pray to God
for him, or prayer publickly uſed by himſelf for ought that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but ſuch as he uſed, if he uſed any, was private to himſelf)
he was executed according to the judgment. And now for his
intent, howſoever he pretended the contrary in words, yet by
theſe his own Writings, Confeſſions, Letters, and many other
proofs afore here expreſſed, it is moſt manifeſt to all perſons,
how horrible his intentions and Treaſons were, and how juſtly
he ſuffered for the ſame; and thereby greatly to be doubted,
that as he had lived a long time vainly and ungodly, and like an
Atheiſt and godleſs man, ſo he continued the ſame courſe till his
death to the outward ſight of men.</p>

               <p>FOr as much as <hi>Parry</hi> in the abundance of his proud and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
humour, hath often both in his Confeſſion, and Letters,
pretended ſome great and grievous cauſes of diſcontentment againſt
her Majeſty, and the preſent State: It ſhall not be impertinent,
for better ſatisfaction of all perſons, to ſet forth ſimply and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the condition and quality of the man, what he was by Birth
and Education, and in what courſe of life he had lived.</p>
               <p>This vile and Traiterous Wretch was one of the younger Sons
of a poor man, called <hi>Harry ap David:</hi> he dwelled in <hi>North-Wales</hi>
in a little Village called <hi>Northoppe,</hi> in the County of <hi>Flint:</hi>
there he kept a common Ale-houſe, which was the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtay of his living. In that houſe was this Traitor Born, his
Mother was the reputed Daughter of one <hi>Conway</hi> a Prieſt, Parſon
of a poor Pariſh called <hi>Halkin,</hi> in the ſame County of <hi>Flint:</hi> his
his eldeſt Brother dwelleth at this preſent in the ſame Houſe, and
there keepeth an Ale-houſe as his Father did before him. This
Traitor in his Childhood, ſo ſoon as he had learned a lttleto Write
&amp; Read, was put to ſerve a poor man dwelling in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> named
<hi>John Fiſher,</hi> who profeſſed to have ſome ſmall skill and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the Law. With him he continued divers years, and
ſerved as a Clerk, to write ſuch things, as in that Trade which his
maſter uſed, he was appointed. During this time, he learned
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and at ſuch times of leaſure, as the poor
man his Maſter had no occaſion otherwiſe to uſe him, he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to go to the Grammer-School, where he got ſome little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the Latin Tongue. In this his Childhood he was
noted by ſuch as beſt knew him, to be of a moſt villanous and
dangerous nature and diſpoſition. He did often run away from
his Maſter, and was often taken and brought to him again. His
Maſter, to correct his perverſe and froward conditions, did many
times ſhut him as Priſoner in ſome cloſe place of his houſe, and
many times cauſed him to be chained, locked, and clogged, to
ſtay his running away. Yet all was in vain: For about the third
year of her Majeſties Reign, for his laſt farewel to his poor Maſter,
he ran away from him, and came to <hi>London</hi> to ſeek his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
He was then conſtrained to ſeek what Trade he could to
live by, and to get meat and drink for his belly, and cloaths for
his back. His good hap in the end was to be entertained in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53607:19"/>
place of Service above his Deſert; where he ſtaid not long, but
ſhifted himſelf divers times from Service to Service, and from one
Maſter to another. Now he began to forget his old Home, his
Birth, his Education, his Parents, his Friends, his own Name,
and what he was. He aſpired to greater matters, he challenged
the Name and Title of a great Gentleman, he vaunted himſelf
to be of Kin and allied to Noble and Worſhipful; he left his
old Name, which he did bear and was commonly called by in
his Childhood, and during all the time of his abode in the
Country, which was <hi>William ap Harry</hi> (as the manner in <hi>Wales</hi> is.)
And becauſe he would ſeem to be indeed the man which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
he took upon him the Name of <hi>Parry,</hi> being the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
of divers Gentlemen of great Worſhip and Honour. And
becauſe his Mothers Name by her Father (a Prieſt) was <hi>Conway,</hi>
he pretended Kindred to the Family of Sir <hi>John Conway,</hi> and
ſo thereby made himſelf of kin to <hi>Edmund Nevil.</hi> Being thus
ſet forth with his new Name and new Title of Gentleman, and
commended by ſome of his good Favourers, he matched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Marriage with a Widow in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> who brought him
ſome reaſonable Portion of Wealth. She lived with him but a
ſhort time, and the wealth he had with her laſted not long: it
was ſoon conſumed with his diſſolute and waſtful manner of life.
He was then driven to his wonted ſhifts, his Creditors were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Debt which he owed great, he had nothing wherewith
to make Payment, he was continually purſued by Serjeants and
Officers to Arreſt him, he did often by ſlights and ſhifts eſcape
from them. In this his needy and poor eſtate, he ſought to repair
himſelf again by a new match in Marriage with another Widow,
which before was the Wife of one <hi>Richard Heywood;</hi> this matter
was ſo earneſtly followed by himſelf, and ſo effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by his Friends and Favourers, that the Woman yielded
to take him to Husband: a Match in every reſpect very unequal
and unfit; her Wealth and yearly Livelihood was very great,
his poor and baſe Eſtate worſe than nothing; he very young, ſhe
of ſuch age, as for years ſhe might have been his Mother. When
he had thus poſſeſſed himſelf of his new Wives wealth, he
omitted nothing that might ſerve for a prodigal, diſſolute, and
moſt ungodly courſe of Life. His Riot and Exceſs was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable;
he did moſt wickedly deflower his Wives own
Daughter, and ſundry ways pitifully abuſe the old Mother: He
carried himſelf for his outward port and countenance (ſo long as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53607:19"/>
his Old wives Bags laſted) in ſuch ſort, as might well have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for a man of very good haviour and degree. But this
laſted not long; his proud heart and waſtful hand had ſoon
poured out old <hi>Heywood</hi>'s Wealth. He then fell again to his
wonted ſhifts, borrowed where he could finde any to lend, and
engaged his Credit ſo far as any would truſt him. Amongſt
others, he became greatly indebted to <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
before-named; who after long forbearing of his Money,
ſought to recover it by ordinary means of Law. For this cauſe
<hi>Parry</hi> conceived great diſpleaſure againſt him, which he purſued
with all Malice, even to the ſeeking of his Life. In this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous
intent, he came in the night-time to Mr. <hi>Hares</hi> Chamber
in the <hi>Temple,</hi> broke open the door, aſſaulted him, and wounded
him grievouſly, and ſo left him in great danger of Life. For
this Offence he was Apprehended, Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
of Burglary, Arraigned, and found Guilty
by a very ſubſtantial Jury,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Parry</hi> Condemned for Burglary, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of the Queen.</note> 
                  <hi>and Condemned to be
Hanged, as the Law in that Caſe requireth.</hi> He
ſtanding thus Convicted, her Majeſty, of
her moſt gracious Clemency, and pitiful Diſpoſition, took com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
upon him, pardoned his Offence, and gave him his Life,
which by the Law and due courſe of Juſtice he ought then to
have loſt. After this he carried not long, but pretending ſome
cauſes of diſcontentment, departed the Realm, and travelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas. How he demeaned himſelf there from time to
time, and with whom he converſed, is partly in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
touched before. This is the man, this is his Race, which
he feared ſhould be ſpotted, if he miſcarried in the execution of
his Traiterous Enterpriſe; this hath been the courſe of his Life,
theſe are the great canſes of his Diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>And whereas at his Arraignment and Execution, he pretended
great care of the diſobedient Popiſh Subjects of this Realm,
whom he called Catholicks, and in very inſolent ſort ſeemed to
glory greatly in the Profeſſion of his pretenſed Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
The whole courſe and action of his Life ſheweth plainly,
how profanely and irreligiouſly he did always bear himſelf. He
vaunted, that for theſe two and twenty years paſt he had been
a Catholick, and during all that time never received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
Yet before he travelled beyond the Seas, at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times within the compaſs of thoſe two and twenty years, he
did voluntarily take the Oath of Obedience to the Queens Majeſty,
ſet down in the Statute made in the firſt year of her Highneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53607:20"/>
Reign; by which, amongſt other things, he did teſtifie and
declare in his Conſcience, that no Forreign Prince, Perſon, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
State, or Potentate, hath or ought to have any Juriſdiction,
Power, Preeminence, or Authority, Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Realm; and therefore did utterly renounce and forſake
all Forreign Juriſdictions, Powers, and Authorities; and did
promiſe to bear Faith and true Allegeance to the Queens High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
her Heirs and lawful Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>With what Conſcience or Religion he took that Oath ſo often,
if he were then a Papiſt indeed, as ſithence the diſcovery of his
Treaſons he pretended, let his beſt friends the Papiſts themſelves
judge. But perhaps it may be ſaid, that he repented thoſe his
Offences paſt; that ſince thoſe three Oaths ſo taken by him, he
was twice reconciled to the Pope, and ſo his Conſcience cleared,
and he become a new man; and (which is more) that in the
time of his laſt Travel, he caſt away all his former lewd manners:
that he changed his degree and habit, and bought or begged the
grave Title of a Doctor of Law, for which he was well qualified
with a little Grammar-School <hi>Latine;</hi> that he had Plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
and Remiſſion of all his Sins, in conſideration of his
undertaking of ſo holy an Enterpriſe as to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
a ſacred anointed Queen, his Natural and Soveraign Lady: That
he promiſed to the Pope, and vowed to God to perform it: that
he confirmed the ſame by receiving the Sacrament at the Jeſuits,
at one Altar with his two <hi>Beaupeers,</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Vendoſme</hi>
and <hi>Narbonne:</hi> And that ſince his laſt return into <hi>England,</hi> he did
take his Oath upon the Bible to execute it. Theſe Reaſons may
ſeem to bear ſome weight indeed amongſt his Friends the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and other Papiſts of State, who have ſpecial Skill in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſuch importance.</p>
               <p>But now lately in the beginning of this Parliament in <hi>November</hi>
laſt, he did eftſoons ſolemnly in publick place take the Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, of obedience to her Majeſty. How that may
ſtand with his reconciliations to the Pope, and with his Promiſes,
Vows, and Oath to kill the Queen, it is a thing can hardly be
warranted, unleſs it be by ſome ſpecial priviledge of the Popes
omnipotency.</p>
               <p>But let him have the glory he deſired, to live and die a Papiſt.
He deſerved it, it is fit for him, his death was correſpondent to
the courſe of his life, which was diſloyal, perjured, and Traiterous
towards her Majeſty, and falſe and perfidious towards the Pope
himſelf, and his Catholicks, if they will believe his ſolemn proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53607:20"/>
which he made at his Arraignment and Execution, that he
never meant nor intended any hurt to her Highneſs Perſon. For
if that be true, where are then his Vows which he ſaid were in
Heaven, his Letters and Promiſe upon Earth? Why hath he ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out of the Popes ſhop ſo large an Indulgence and plenary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of all his Sins, and meant to perform nothing that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?
Why was his Devotion and Zeal ſo highly commended?
Why was he ſo ſpecially prayed for and remembred at the Altar?
All theſe great favours were then beſtowed upon him without
cauſe or deſert: for he deceived the Pope, he deceived the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and Jeſuites, with a falſe ſemblance, and pretence to do
that thing which he never meant.</p>
               <p>But the matter is clear, the Conſpiracy, and his traiterous intent
is too plain and evident: it is the Lord that revealed it in time,
and prevented their malice: there lacked no will, or readineſs in
him to execute that horrible fact. It is the Lord that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
her Majeſty from all the wicked Practices and Conſpiracies
of that Helliſh Rabble: it is he that hath moſt gratiouſly deliver'd
her from the hands of this Traiterous miſcreant. The Lord is her
onely defence, in whom ſhe hath always truſted.</p>

them, for thy Names ſake: Suffer them not to prevail: Take them,
O Lord, in their crafty Wittneſs that they have invented,and let them
fall into the Pit which they have digged for others. Permit them not
ungodly to triumph over us: Diſcomfort them, diſcomfort them, O
Lord, which truſt in their own multitude, and pleaſe themſelves in
their ſubtile devices, and wicked Conſpiracies. O loving Father, we
have not deſerved the leaſt of theſe the Mercies which we crave: For

known the time of our viſitation: we have deſerved utter deſtruction.
But thou, O Lord, art merciful, and ready to forgive; therefore we
come to thy Throne of Grace, confeſſing and acknowledging thee to
be our only refuge in all times of peril and danger: And by the means
of thy Son, we moſt heartily pray thee to forgive us our Vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
