            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May it please Your Grace,</opener>
            <p>IT is not any Confidence that I have Dexterously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
this charge, that gives me the boldness to
present it to Your Grace. I have done it, as well as

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> For I took not this task upon my self, but was
entreated to it by them, who have power to Command
me. But yet it is very necessary that it should be addressed
to Your Grace, who are, as <hi>Sozomen</hi> said of <hi>Theodosius,
Certaminum Magister, &amp; orationum Judex constitutus,</hi>
You are appointed the great Master of our arguings, and
are most fit to be the Judge of our Discourses, especially
when they do relate and pretend to publick Influence and
Advantages to the Church. We all are Witnesses of Your Zeal
to promote true Religion; and every day find You to be a
Great Patron to this very poor Church, which groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Calamities and permanent effects of a War acted by
Intervals for above 400. years; such which the Interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Sun-shines of Peace could but very weakly repair: our
Churches are still demolished, much of the Revenues irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
swallowed by Sacriledge, and digested by an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
impunity; Religion infinitely divided, and parted
into formidable Sects, the People extreamly ignorant, and
wilful by inheritance; superstitiously irreligious, and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of reproof, and amidst these, and very many more
inconveniences, it was greatly necessary that God should send
us such a KING, and he send us such a Viceroy, who wedds
the Interests of Religion, and joynes them to his heart.</p>
            <p>For we do not look upon your Grace, only as a favourer of
the Churches Temporal interest, though even for that, the
Souls of the relieved Clergy do daily bless you; neither are
You our Patron only as the <hi>Cretans</hi> were to <hi>Homer,</hi> or the
<hi>Alenadae</hi> to <hi>Simonides, Philip</hi> to <hi>Theopompus,</hi> or <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
to <hi>Oppianus;</hi> but as <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi>
were to Christians; that is, desirous that true Religion
should be promoted, that the interest of Souls should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced;
that Truth should flourish, and wise Principles

In order to which excellent purposes it is hoped, that the
reduction of the Holy Rite of Confirmation into use and
Holy practice may contribute some very great moments.
For besides that the great usefulness of this Ministry will
greatly endear the Episcopal order, to which (that I may
use S. <hi>Hierom's</hi> words) if <hi>there be not attributed a
more than common Power and Authority, there will
be as many Schisms as Priests;</hi> it will also be a means of
endearing the Persons of the Prelates to their Flocks,
when the People shall be convinced, that there is, or may
be, if they please, a perpetual entercourse of Blessings and
Love between them, when God by their Holy hands refuses
not to give to the People, the earnest of an eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
when by them, he blesses, and that <hi>the grace of
our Lord Jesus,</hi> and the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of his Spirit,</hi> is conveyed to all Persons capable
of the grace, by the Conduct, and on the hands and
prayers of their Bishops.</p>
            <p>And indeed not only very many single Persons, but even
the whole Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath need of Confirmation.
We have most of us contended for false Religions and un-Christian
propositions; and now that by Gods mercy, and
the prosperity and piety of his Sacred Majesty the Church
is broken from her cloud, and many are reduc'd to the
true Religion, and righteous worship of God; we cannot
but call to mind, how the Holy Fathers of the Primitive
Church, often have declar'd themselves in Councils, and
by a perpetual Discipline, that such Persons, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from Sects and Heresies into the Bosom of the
Church, should not be rebaptiz'd; but that the Bishops
should impose hands on them in Confirmation. It is true,
<pb facs="tcp:98912:4"/>
that this was design'd to supply the defect of those Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Conventicles, who did not use this Holy rite; For
this Rite of Confirmation hath had the fate to be oppos'd
only by the Schismatical and <hi>Puritan Parties</hi> of old;
the <hi>Novatians</hi> or <hi>Cathari,</hi> and the <hi>Donatists;</hi> and of
late by the Jesuits, and new <hi>Cathari,</hi> the Puritans, and
Presbyterians; the same evil spirit of contradictions keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its course in the same channel, and descending regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
amongst Men of the same principles. But therefore
in the restitution of a Man or company of Men, or a
Church, the Holy Primitives, in the Council of <hi>C. P. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea,</hi>
and <hi>Orange,</hi> thought that to confirm such persons
was the most agreeable Discipline; not only because such
persons did not in their little and dark assemblies use this
rite, but because they alwayes greatly wanted it: For it
is a sure Rule in our Religion, and is of an eternal truth,
that <hi>they, who keep not the Unity of the Church, have
not the Spirit of God;</hi> and therefore it is most fit
should receive the ministery of the spirit, when they return
to the bosom of the Church, that so indeed they may <hi>keep
the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> And
therefore <hi>Asterius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Amasia</hi> compares Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ring, with which the Father of the Prodigal
adorn'd his returning Son; <hi>Datur nempe prodigo post
stolam, &amp; annulus, nempe Symbolum intelligibilis sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculi
spiritus,</hi> And as the Spirit of God, the Holy Dove
extended his mighty wings over the Creation, and hatch'd
the new-born World, from its seminal powers, to Light
and Operation, and Life, and Motion, so in the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the souls of Men, he gives a new being, and heat
and life, Procedure and Perfection, Wisdom and Strength,
and because, that this was ministred by the Bishops hands
in Confirmation, was so firmly believ'd by all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb facs="tcp:98912:4"/>
Church, therefore it became a Law, and an Vniversal
practice in all those ages, in which Men desir'd to be sav'd
by all means. The Latin Church, and the Greek alwayes
did use it, and the Blessings of it, which they believ'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to it, they expressed in a holy prayer, which in the
Greek Euchologion they have very anciently and
constantly used.<note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>Thou O Lord, the most
compassionate and Great King of all, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
impart to this Person the seal of the gift
of thy Holy, Almighty, and adorable spirit.</hi>
For as an Ancient Greek said truly and wisely.
<note n="b" place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>The Father is reconcil'd, and the Son is the
Reconciler; but to them who are by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
and Repentance made friends of God, the Holy
Spirit is collated as a gift.</hi> They well knew what they received
in this ministration, and therefore wisely laid hold of it and
would not let it go.</p>
            <p>This was anciently ministred by Apostles, and ever after
by the Bishops, and Religiously receiv'd by Kings, and greatest
Princes; and I have read that St. <hi>Sylvester</hi> confirm'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Emperour, and when they made their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
servants of the Holy Jesus, and Souldiers under his
banner, and bonds-men of his Institution, then they sent
them to the Bishop to be confirm'd, who did it sometimes
by such Ceremonies, that the solemnity of the ministry
might with greatest Religion addict them to the service of
their Great Lord. We read in <hi>Adrovaldus,</hi> that <hi>Charles
Martel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De miraculis. St. Benedict. l 1. c. 1. 14.</note> entring into a League with Bishop <hi>Luitprandus,</hi>
sent his Son <hi>Pipin</hi> to him, <hi>ut more Christianorum fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,
capillum ejus primus attonderet, ac Pater illi
Spiritualis existeret,</hi> that he might after the manner of
Christians, first cut his hair (in token of service to Christ)
and [in confirming him] he should be his spiritual Father.
<pb facs="tcp:98912:5"/>
And something like this we find concerning <hi>William</hi> Earl
of <hi>Warren</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> who when he had Dedicated the
Church of St. <hi>Pancratius,</hi> and the Priorie of <hi>Lewes;</hi>
receiv'd Confirmation, and gave seizure <hi>per capillos capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
mei</hi> (sayes he in the Charter) <hi>&amp; fratris mei Radulphi
de Warrena, quas abscidit cum cultello de capitibus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
Henricus Episcopus Wintoniensis;</hi> by the hairs of my
head and of my Brothers, which <hi>Henry</hi> Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
cut off before the Altar; meaning (according to
the Ancient custome) in confirmation; when they by that
solemnity addicted themselves to the free servitude of the
Lord Jesus. The ceremony is obsolete and chang'd, but
the mystery can never; and indeed that is one of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
in which we can rejoyce concerning the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Rite in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
that whereas it was sometimes clouded, sometimes hindred,
and sometimes hurt, by the appendage of needless, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
ceremonies; it is now reduc'd to the Primitive and
first simplicity amongst us; and the excrescencies us'd in
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are wholly par'd away; and by holy
Prayers and the Apostolical Ceremonie of imposition of
the Bishops hands it is worthily and zealously administred.
The Latins us'd to send Chrism to the Greeks, when they had
usurped some jurisdiction over them, and the Popes Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
went with a quantity of it to <hi>C. P.</hi> where the Russi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
usually met them for it; for that was then the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this ministration; But when the Latins demanded
fourscore pounds of Gold besides other gifts, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and chang'd their custom rather than pay an unlawful
and ungodly Tribute. <hi>Non quaerimus vestra sed vos;</hi>
we require nothing but leave to impart Gods blessings with
pure Intentions, and a spiritual ministery. And as the
Bishops of our Churches receive nothing from the People,
<pb facs="tcp:98912:5"/>
for the Ministration of this Rite, so they desire nothing
but Love, and just Obedience in spiritual, and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
duties; and we offer our Flocks spiritual things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mixture of Temporal advantages from them; we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the rituals of the Gospel, without the inventions of
Men, Riligion without superstition, and only desire to be
believ'd in such things which we prove from Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Catholick practice of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Subject of this Discourse, <hi>the Rite of
Confirmation;</hi> It were easie to recount many great and
glorious expressions which we find in the Sermons of the
Holy Fathers of the Primitive Ages; so certain it is, that
in this thing we ought to be zealous, as being desirous to
perswade our People to give us leave to do them great good:
But the following Pages will do it, I hope, competently: only
we shall remark; that when they had gotten a custom ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that in cases of necessity, they did permit Deacons and
Lay-men sometimes to baptize, yet they never did confide in
it much; but with much caution and curiosity commanded
that such Persons should, when that necessity was over, be
carried to the Bishop to be confirm'd, so to supply all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
defects relating to the past imperfect ministry, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
necessity and danger, as appears in the Council of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris.</hi>
And the Ancients had so great estimate and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to this Holy rite, that as in Heraldry, they distinguish
the same thing by several names, when they relate to
Persons of greater Eminency, and they blazon the Armes of
the Gentry by Metals, of the Nobtlity by pretious stones, but
of Kings and Princes by Planets, so when they would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Vnction which was us'd in confirmation, they gave it
a special word, and of more distinction &amp; remark, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the oyl us'd in baptism, they call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. but that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and they who spake properly kept
<pb facs="tcp:98912:6"/>
this difference of words, untill by incaution, and ignorant
carelessness the names fell into confusion, and the thing into
disuse and dis-respect. But it is no small addition to the
Honour of this ministration, that some wise and good men,
have piously believed, that when baptiz'd Christians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and solemnly bless'd by the Bishop, that then it is
that a special Angel Guardian is appointed to keep their
souls from the assaults of the spirits of darkness. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, though I shall not interpose mine own opinion, yet
this I say, that the Prety of that supposition is not disagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the intention of this Rite; for since by this, the Holy
Spirit of God (the Father of Spirits) is given, it is not
unreasonably thought by them, that the other good Spirits
of God, the Angels who are ministring spirits, sent forth
<hi>to minister to the good of them that shall be Heirs of
Salvation,</hi> should pay their kind offices in subordination to
their Prince and fountain; that the first in every kind,
might be the measure of all the rest; But there are greater
and stranger things than this that God does for the souls of
his Servants, and for the honour of the ministeries which
himself hath appointed.</p>
            <p>We shall only add that this was ancient, and long before
Popery entred into the World, and that this rite hath been
more abus'd by Popery, than by any thing: and to this Day
the Bigots of the Roman Church are the greatest Enemies to
it; and from them the Presbyterians; but besides that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> does religiously retain it,
and hath appointed a solemn officer, for the Ministery, the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches do observe it carefully,
and it is recommended and establish'd in the harmony of the
Protestant Confessions.</p>
            <p>And now, may it please Your Grace to give me leave to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
Your Aid and Countenance for the propagating this so
<pb facs="tcp:98912:6"/>
religious, and useful a Ministery, which, as it is a peculiar
of the Bishops office, is also a great enlarger of Gods gifts
to the People; it is a great instrument of Vnion of hearts,
and will prove an effective deletory to Schism; and an
endearment to the other parts of Religion: it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of Baptism, and a preparation to the Lords
Supper; it is the vertue from on high, and the solemnity
of our spiritual adoption. But there will be no need to use
many arguments to enflame Your zeal in this affair, when
Your Grace shall find, that to promote it will be a great
service to God; that this alone will conclude Your Grace, who
are so ready, by Laws, and Executions, by word, and by
example, to promote the Religion of Christ, as it is taught
in these Churches. I am not confident enough to desire
Your Grace, for the reading this Discourse, to lay aside
any one hour of Your greater Employments, which consume
so much of Your Dayes and Nights. But I say, that the
Subject is greatly Worthy of Consideration. <hi>Nihil enim
inter manus habui, cui majorem sollicitudinem praesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

what <hi>Secundus</hi> did, to the wise <hi>Lupercus, Quoties ad

I can Commend it because it is little, and so,
not very troublesome; and if it could have been writen
according to the worthiness of the thing Treated in
it, it <hi>would deserve</hi> so great a Patronage; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is not, it will therefore greatly <hi>need it,</hi> but it
can hope for it on no other account, but because it is
laid at the feet of a Princely Person, who is Great and
Good; and one who not only is bound by Duty, but
by choice hath Obliged Himself to do advantages to
any Worthy instrument of Religion. But I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd

            <head type="sub">The Introduction.</head>
            <p>NExt to the Incarnation of the Son of God
and the whole Oeconomy of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
wrought by him in an admirable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Conjugation of glorious mercies,
the greatest thing that ever God did to the
World, is the giving to us the Holy Ghost: and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
this is the consummation and perfection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For in the work of Redemption Christ indeed
made a new World; we are wholly a new Creation,
and we must be so: and therefore when S. <hi>John</hi> began
the Narrative of the Gospel, he began in a manner and
stile very like to <hi>Moses</hi> in his History of the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All things
were made by him, and without him was not any thing
made that was made.</hi> But as in the Creation the matter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98912:8"/>
was first: there were indeed Heavens, and Earth and
Waters; but all this was rude <hi>and without form,</hi> till the
Spirit of God <hi>moved upon the face of the waters:</hi> So it
is in the new Creation. We are a new Mass, redeem'd
with the blood of Christ, rescued from an evil porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and made Candidates of Heaven and Immortality;
but we are but an Embryo in the regeneration, until
the Spirit of God enlivens us and moves again upon the
waters: and then every subsequent motion and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is from the Spirit of God. <hi>We cannot say that
Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> By him we live,
in him we walke, by his aids we pray, by his emotions
we desire: we breath and sigh, and groan by him:
<hi>he helps us in all our infirmities,</hi> and he gives us all our
strengths; he reveals mysteries to us, and teaches us all
our duties: he stirs us up to holy desires, and he actuates
those desires; he <hi>makes us to will and to do of his good
pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Spirit of God is that in our spiritual life,
that a Mans soul is in his Natural: without it, we are
but a dead and liveless trunke. But then, as a Mans
soul in proportion to the several operations of life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
several appellatives; it is Vegetative, and Nutritive,
Sensitive, and Intellective, according as it operates: So
is the Spirit of God. He is the spirit of Regeneration
in Baptism, of renovation in Repentance: the spirit of
love, and the spirit of holy fear, the searcher of the
hearts, and the spirit of discerning: the spirit of wisdom,
and the spirit of prayer. In one mystery he illuminates;
and in another he feeds us: he begins in one and finishes
and perfects in another. It is the same spirit working
divers operations. For he is all this now reckoned, and
he is every thing else that is the principle of good unto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98912:8"/>
us; he is the beginning, and the progression, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
and perfection of us all; and yet every
work of his is perfect in it's kind, and in order to his
own designation; and from the beginning to the end
is perfection all the way. Justifying and sanctifying
grace is the proper Entitative product in all; but it hath
divers appellatives and connotations in the several
rites: and yet even then also, because of the identity
of the principle, the similitude and general consonancy
in the effect, the same appellative is given, and the
same effect imputed to more that one; and yet none
of them can be omitted, when the great Master of
the family hath blessed it, and given it institution.
Thus S. <hi>Dionys</hi> calls Baptism. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
perfection of the Divine birth; and yet the baptized
person must receive other mysteries which are more
signally perfective: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is yet more perfective, and is properly the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Baptism.</p>
            <p>By Baptism we are Heirs, and are adopted to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of sons, admitted to the Covenant of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and engag'd to live a good life; yet this is but
the solemnity of the Covenant which must pass into
after-acts by other influences of the same Divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
Until we receive the spirit of <hi>obsignation</hi> or
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> we are but <hi>babes in Christ</hi> in the meanest
sense, Infants that can do nothing, that cannot speak,
that cannot resist any violence, expos'd to every rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and perishing by every temptation.</p>
            <p>But therefore as God at first appointed us a ministery
of <hi>a new birth;</hi> so also hath he given to his Church the
consequent Ministry of <hi>a new strength.</hi> The spirit
moov'd a little upon the waters of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and gave
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98912:9"/>
us the principles of life, but in <hi>Confirmation</hi> he makes
us able to move our selves. In the first, he is the spirit
of life; but in this he is the spirit of strength and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Baptisma est nativitas, unguentum vero est nobis
actionis instar &amp; motus</hi> said <hi>Cabasilas. In Baptism we
are intitled to the inheritance;</hi> but because we are in our
infancy and minority, <hi>the Father gives unto his Sons a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
a Guardian and a Teacher <hi>in Confirmation,</hi> said
<hi>Rupertus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">De divin. offic. l. 5. c. 17.</note> that as we are baptized into the death and
resurrection of Christ: So in Confirmation we may be
renewed in the inner man, and strengthned in all our
Holy vows and purposes by the Holy Ghost ministred
according to Gods ordinance.</p>
            <p>The Holy Rite of Confirmation is a Divine ordinance,
and it produces Divine effects, and is ministred by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
persons, that is, by those whom God hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and separated to this ministration. At first, all that
were baptiz'd were also confirm'd: and ever since, all
good people that have understood it, have been very
zealous for it; and time was in <hi>England,</hi> even since the
first beginnings of the reformation, when Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had been less carefully ministred for about six years,
when the people had their first opportunities of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd;
they ran to it in so great numbers; that Churches
and Church-yards would not hold them; insomuch that
I have read<note n="*" place="margin">Vindic. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiast. hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarch. per Franc. Halli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> that the Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> was forc'd to
impose hands on the people in the Fields, and was so
oppressed with multitudes, that he had almost been
trod to death by the people, and had dyed with the
throng, if he had not been rescued by the Civil power.</p>
            <p>But Men have too much neglected all the ministeries
of grace; and this most especially, and have not given
themselves to a right understanding of it, and so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98912:9"/>
it yet more: But because the prejudice which
<hi>these parts</hi> of the Christian Church have suffered for
want of it, is very great (as will appear by enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the many and great blessings consequent to it)
I am not without hope that it may be a service accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God, and an useful ministery to the souls of <hi>my
charges,</hi> if by instructing them that know not, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them that know, I set forward the practise of
this Holy rite, and give reasons why the people ought
to love it, and to desire it, and how they are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and practise it, and consequently, with what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
affections they are to relate to those persons,
whom God hath in so special and signal manner made
to be for their good and eternal benefit, the Ministers
of the Spirit and salvation.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the life S. <hi>Malachias</hi> my Predecessor in
the See of <hi>Downe</hi> and <hi>Connor,</hi> reports that it was the
care of that good Prelate to <hi>renew</hi> the rite of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in his Diocess, where it had been long neglected
and gone into desuetude. It being too much our case
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I find the same necessity, and am oblig'd to
the same procedure, for the same reason, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of so excellent an example, <hi>Hoc enim est Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizare
Christum</hi> (said S. <hi>Austin) non tantùm docere quae

               <hi>sed etiam quae observanda ei qui
accedit ad compagem corporis Christi.</hi> For this is to preach
the Gospel, not only to teach those things which are
to be said of Christ; but those also which are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by every one who desires to be confederated
into the Society of the body of Christ, which is his
Church: that is, not only the doctrines of good life,
but the mysteries of godliness; and the Rituals of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which issue from a Divine fountain, are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98912:10"/>
by him who would fully preach the Gospel.</p>
            <p>In order to which performance I shall declare</p>
            <p>1. The Divine Original, Warranty and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Rite of Confirmation.</p>
            <p>2. That this Rite was to be perpetual, and
never ceasing ministration.</p>
            <p>3. That it was actually continued, and practis'd
by all the succeeding Ages of the purest and
Primitive Churches.</p>
            <p>4. That this Rite was <hi>appropriate</hi> to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of Bishops.</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>imposition</hi> of the Bishops
hands did make the whole Ritual; and though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things were added, yet they were not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or any thing of the institution.</p>
            <p>6. That many great Graces and blessings were
consequent to the worthy reception and due mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of it.</p>
            <p>7. I shall add something of the manner of prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to it, and reception of it.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Divine Original, warranty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Holy Rite of Confirmation.</head>
            <p>IN the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they have determin'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to be a Sacrament <hi>proprii nominis,</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and really, and yet their Doctors have, some of
them at least, been <hi>paulò iniquiores</hi> a little unequal and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98912:10"/>
unjust to their proposition, in so much that from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
we have had the greatest opposition in this article,
<hi>Bonacina</hi> and <hi>Henriquez</hi> allow the proposition,<note place="margin">De sacram. disp. 3. qu. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. punct. 3.</note> but
make the Sacrament to be so unnecessary, that a little
excuse may justifie the omission and almost neglect of
it.<note place="margin">2. Lib. 3. de sacram.</note> And <hi>Loemelius,</hi> and <hi>Daniel à Jesu,</hi> and generally the
English Jesuits have, to serve some ends of their own
family and order, disputed it almost into contempt, that
by representing it as unnecessary, they might do all the
ministeries Ecclesiastical in <hi>England</hi> without the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Bishops their <hi>Superiours,</hi> whom they therefore
love not, because they are so. But the Theological faculty
of <hi>Paris</hi> have condemn'd their doctrine as temerarious
and savouring of Heresie: and in the later Schools, have
approov'd rather the Doctrine of <hi>Gamachaeus, Estius,
Kellison,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> who indeed doe follow the
Doctrine of the most eminent persons in the Ancient
School; <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh, Scotus, Hugo, Cavalli,</hi> and
<hi>Gerson</hi> the Learned Chancellor of <hi>Paris,</hi> who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Old Roman order, Amalarius</hi> and <hi>Albinus,</hi> doe
all teach Confirmation to be of great and pious use, of
Divine original, and to many purposes necessary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church.</p>
            <p>Whether Confirmation be a Sacrament or no, is of no
use to dispute; and if it be disputed, it can never be
proov'd to be so as Baptism and the Lords Supper,
that is, <hi>as generally necessary to Salvation:</hi> but though it
be no Sacrament, it cannot follow that it is not of very
great use and holiness; and as a Man is never the less
tyed to Repentance, though it be no Sacrament; so
neither is he ever the less oblig'd to receive Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though it be (as it ought) acknowledg'd to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98912:11"/>
of an use and Nature inferiour to the two Sacraments of
Divine, direct and immediate institution. It is certain
that the Fathers in a large Symbolical and general sense
call it a Sacrament; but mean not the same thing by
that word, when they apply it to Confirmation, as they
doe, when they apply it to Baptism and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
That it is an Excellent and Divine ordinance to
purposes spiritual; that it comes from God, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in our way to God, that is all we are concern'd
to inquire after: and this I shall endeavour to prove
not only against the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> but against <hi>all opponents</hi> of
what side soever.</p>
            <p>My first argument from Scripture is what I learn
from <hi>Optatus,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyril. Optatus</hi> writing against the
Donatists hath these words. <hi>Christ descended into the
water, not that in him, who is God, was any thing that could
be made cleaner, but that the water was to precede the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Vnction, for the initiating and ordaining, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the mysteries of Baptism. He was wash'd, when he
was in the hands of</hi> John, <hi>then followed the order of the
mystery, and the Father finish'd what the Son did ask,
and what the Holy Ghost declar'd, The Heavens were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
God the Father anointed him, the spiritual Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
presently descended in the likeness of a Dove, and
sate upon his head, and was spread all over him, and
he was called the Christ, when he was the anointed of the
Father. To whom also, least imposition of hands should
seem to be wanting, the voice of God was heard from the
could,</hi> saying. <hi>This is my Son in whom I am well pleased,
hear ye him.</hi> That which <hi>Optatus</hi> sayes is this; that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and in Christs person, Baptism, Confirmation, and
Ordination were consecrated and first appointed. He
was baptized by S. <hi>John;</hi> he was confirm'd by the Holy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98912:11"/>
Spirit and anointed with spiritual Unction in order to
that great work of obedience to his Fathers will; and
he was Consecrated by the voice of God from Heaven.
In all things Christ is the head, and the first fruits:
and in these things was the Fountain of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and spiritual grace, and the great exemplar of
the Oeconomy of the Church. For Christ was <hi>nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
poenitentiae debitor;</hi> Baptism of Repentance was not
necessary to him who never sinn'd, but so it became
him to fulfil all righteousness, and to be a pattern to us
all. But we have need of these things, though he had
not; and in the same way in which Salvation was
wrought by him for himself and for us all, in the same
way he intended we should walk.<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 2. 6.</note> He was baptized
because his Father appointed it so: we must be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
because Christ hath appointed it, and we have need
of it too. He was Consecrated to be the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and the great Priest, because <hi>no man takes on
him this honour, but he that was called of God, as was
Aaron:</hi> and all they, who are to minister in his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
office under him, must be consecrated and solemnly
set apart for that ministration, and after his glorious
example. He was anointed with a spiritual Unction
from above <hi>after his baptisme;</hi> for <hi>after Jesus was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi>
he ascended up from the waters, and then the
Holy Ghost descended upon him; it is true, he receiv'd
the fulness of the spirit; but we receive him by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
but <hi>of his fulness we all receive, grace for grace;</hi>
that is, all that he receiv'd in order to his great work,
all that in kind, one for another, grace for grace, we
are to receive according to our measures, and our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.
And as all these he receiv'd by external mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations;
so must we; God the Father appointed his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98912:12"/>
way, and he, <hi>by his example</hi> first, hath appointed the
same to us; that we <hi>also may follow him in the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and <hi>work out our salvation</hi> by the same graces in
the like solemnities. For if he needed them for himself,
then we need them much more. If he did not need
them for himself, he needed them for us, and for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that we might follow his steps, who by receiving
these exteriour solemnities and inward graces, became
<hi>the Author and finisher of our Salvation,</hi> and the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his Church. I shall not need to make use of
the fancy of the <hi>Murcosians</hi> and <hi>Colabarsians,</hi> who turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all mysteries into numbers, reckoned the numeral
letters of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and made them co-incident to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
but they intended to say, that Christ, receiving the Holy
Dove after his Baptism, became all in all to us; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and the perfection of our Salvation; here he was
confirm'd, and receiv'd the <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>When he truly
was baptized in the River of</hi> Jordan, <hi>he ascended out of the
waters, and the Holy Ghost substantially descended upon
him, like resting upon like. And to you also in like manner,
after ye have ascended from the waters of baptisme, the
Vnction is given, which bears the image or similitude of
him by whom Christ was anointed—that as Christ after
baptism, and the coming of the Holy Spirit upon him,
went forth to battle (in the Wilderness) and overcame
the adversary: so ye also after holy baptism, and the
mystical Vnction (or confirmation) being vested with the
Armour of the holy Spirit are enabled to stand against the
opposite powers.</hi> Here then is the first great ground of
our solemne receiving the Holy spirit, or the Unction
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98912:12"/>
from above after Baptism, which we understand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
by the word <hi>Confirmation,</hi> denoting the principle
effect of this Unction, spiritual strength: Christ, who
is the head of the Church, entred this way upon his duty
and work; and he who was the first of all the Church,
the head and great example, is the measure of all the rest,
for we can go to Heaven no way, but in that way in
which he went before us.</p>
            <p>There are some who from this story would infer the
descent of the Holy Ghost after Christs Baptism, not to
signifie that Confirmation was to be a distinct rite from
baptism, but a part of it, yet such a part as gives ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and consummation to it. S. <hi>Hierom, Chrysostom,
Euthymius</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> go not so far; but would have
us by this to understand that the Holy Ghost is given to
them that are baptized. But reason and the context are
both against it. 1. Because the Holy Ghost was not
given by <hi>Johns baptism;</hi> that was reserv'd to be one of
Christ's glories; who also, when by his Disciples he
baptiz'd many, did not give them the Holy Ghost; and
when he commanded his Apostles to baptize all Nations,
did not at that time so much as promise the Holy Ghost:
he was promis'd distinctly, and given by another mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
2. The descent of the Holy Spirit was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
ministery from the baptism; it was not only after
Jesus ascended from the waters of baptism; but there
was something intervening, and by a new office or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
For there was <hi>prayer</hi> joyn'd in the ministery. So S.
<hi>Iuke</hi> observes; <hi>while Jesus was praying, the Heavens were
open'd,</hi> and the Holy spirit descended, for so Jesus was
pleas'd to consign the whole office and ritual of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
prayer for invocating the Holy Spirit, and giving
him by personal application, which as the Father did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98912:13"/>
so the Bishops doe by imposition of hands
3. S. <hi>Austin</hi> observes that the apparition of the Holy
Spirit like a Dove was the visible or ritual part; and the
voice of God was the word to make it to be Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,<note place="margin">Tract. 80. in Johan.</note> 
               <hi>accedit verbum ad elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum:</hi>
for so the ministration was not only perform'd on Christ,
but consign'd to the Church by similitude, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
institution. I shall only add, that the force of this
argument is established to us by more of the Fathers.
S. <hi>Hilary</hi> upon this place hath these words.<note place="margin">S. Hilar. can. 4. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Fathers
voice was heard, that from those things, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated
in Christ, we might know</hi> that after the baptism
of water <hi>the Holy Spirit from the gates of Heaven flies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us and that we are to be anointed with the Vnction of a
coelestial glory, and be made the Sons of God by the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the voice of God, the Truth by the very effects of
things prefigur'd unto us the similitude of a Sacrament.</hi> So
S. Chrysostom.<note place="margin">In Matthaeum.</note> 
               <hi>In the beginnings alwayes appears the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
visions of spiritual things for their sakes, who cannot
receive the understanding of an incorporeal nature; that
if afterwards they be not so done (that is, after the same
visible manner) they may be believ'd by those things which
were already done.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But more plain is that of <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact.
The Lord had not need of the descent of the Holy
Spirit, but he did all things for our sakes, and himself is
become the first fruits of all things which we afterwards were
to receive, that he might become the first fruits among many
Brethren.</hi> The consequent is this, which I express in the
words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> affirming, <hi>Christi in baptismucolom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam
unctionem nostram praefigurâsse.</hi> The Dove in Christ's
Baptism did represent and prefigure our Unction from
above, that is, the descent of the Holy Ghost upon us
in the rite of Confirmation. Christ was baptized, and so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98912:13"/>
must we. But after Baptism; he had a new ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the reception of the Holy Ghost; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this was done for our sakes, we also must follow
that example: and this being done immediately before
his entrance into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
Devil, it plainly describes to us the <hi>order</hi> of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and the <hi>blessing</hi> design'd to us; after we are
baptiz'd, we need to be strengthned and confirm'd
<hi>propter pugnam spiritualem;</hi> we are to fight against the
flesh, the World and the Devil, and therefore must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ministration of the Holy spirit of God; which
is the design and proper work of Confirmation. For
(they are the words of the Excellent Author of the
imperfect work upon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> imputed to S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom)
The Baptism of Water profits us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Homil. 4.</note> 
               <hi>because it
washes away the sins we have formerly committed; if we
repent of them. But it does not sanctifie the soul; nor
precedes the concupiscences of the heart and our evil thoughts,
nor drives them back, nor represses our carnal desires.
But he therefore, who is (only) so baptized, that he does
not also receive the Holy Spirit, is baptized in his body,
and his sins are pardon'd, but in his mind he is yet but a
Catechumen; for so it is written; he that hath not the
Spirit of Christ is none of his: and therefore afterward
out of his flesh will germinate worse sins, because he hath
not receiv'd the Holy Spirit conserving him (in his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptismal
grace) but the house of his body is empty; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that wicked spirit finding it swept with the Doctrines
of Faith, as with besomes, enters in, and in a seaven fold
manner dwells there.</hi> Which words, besides that they
will explicate this mystery, do also declare the necessity
of Confirmation, or receiving the Holy Ghost after ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
in imitation of the Divine precedent of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98912:14"/>
2. After the <hi>example</hi> of Christ, my next Argument
is from his <hi>words,</hi> spoken to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in explication
of the prime mysteries Evangelical;<note place="margin">John 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Vnless a man be
born of Water and of the Holy Spirit, he shall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdom of God.</hi> These words are the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
which the Church uses for the indispensable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Baptism, and having in them so great effort,
and not being rightly understood, have suffered many
Convulsions (shall I call them) or Interpretations:
Some serve their own <hi>Hypothesis</hi> by saying that Water is
the Symbol, and the Spirit is the Baptismal Grace: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that it is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one is onely meant, though
here be two Signatures. But others conclude, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is onely necessary, but the Spirit is super-added as
being afterwards to supervene and move upon these
Waters: And others yet affirm, that by Water is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meant a Spiritual ablution, or the effect produced by
the Spirit; and still they have intangled the words, so
that they have been made useless to the Christian
Church, and the meaning too many things, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be understood. But truth is easie, intelligible
and clear, and without objection, and is plainly this.</p>
            <p>Unless a man be Baptized into Christ, and confirmed
by the Spirit of Christ, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ; that is, he is not perfectly adopted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Christian Religion, or fitted for the Christian
Warfare; and if this plain and natural sense be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the place is not onely easie and intelligible, but
consonant to the whole Design of Christ and Analogy of
the New Testament.</p>
            <p>For first, Our blessed Saviour was Catechising of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi>
and teaching him the first Rudiments of the
Gospel, and like a wise Master-builder first layes the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98912:14"/>
foundation, <hi>The Doctrine of Baptism, and laying on of
Hands,</hi> which afterwards St. <hi>Paul</hi> put into the Christian
Catechism, as I shall shew in the sequel. Now these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
are the first principles of the Christian Religion
taught by Christ himself, and things which at least to
the Doctors might have been so well known, that our
blessed Saviour upbraids the not knowing them, as a
shame to <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact,
Euthymius</hi> and <hi>Rupertus</hi> affirm that this Generation by
Water and the Holy Spirit might have been understood
by the Old Testament, in which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was so well
skilled. Certain it is, the Doctrine of Baptismes was
well enough known to the Jews, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the illumination and irradiations of
the Spirit of God was not new to them, who believed the
Visions and Dreams, the Daughter of a Voice, and the
influences from Heaven upon the Sons of the Prophets,
and therefore although Christ intended to teach him
more than what he had distinct notice of, yet the things
themselves had foundation in the Law and the Prophets,
but although they were high mysteries and scarce discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by them, who either were ignorant or incurious of
such things, yet to the Christians they were the very
Rudiments of their Religion, and are best expounded
by observation of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> placed in the very
foundation. But,</p>
            <p>2. Baptism is the first mystery, that is certain; but
that this of being born of the Spirit is also the next, is
plain in the very order of the words, and that it does
mean a mystery distinct from Baptism will be easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to by them, who consider, that although Christ
Baptized and made many Disciples by the Ministry of
his Apostles, yet they who were so Baptized into
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98912:15"/>
Christs Religion did not receive this Baptism of the
Spirit till after Christs Ascension.</p>
            <p>3. The Baptism of Water was not peculiar to <hi>John
the Baptist,</hi> for it was also of Christ, and ministred by
his command; it was common to both, and therefore
the Baptism of Water is the less principal here. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
distinct from it is here intended. Now if we add
to these words, That St. <hi>John</hi> tells of another Baptism,
which was Christs peculiar; <hi>He shall Baptize you with
the Holy Ghost, and with Fire;</hi> That these words were
<hi>literally</hi> verified upon the Apostles in Pentecost, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
upon all the Baptized in <hi>Spiritual effect</hi> (who
besides the Baptism of Water, distinctly had the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of the Spirit in Confirmation) it will follow that
of necessity this must be the meaning and the verificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these words of our B. Saviour to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which
must mean a double Baptism: <hi>Transivimus per aquam &amp;
ignem, antequam veniemus in refrigerium,</hi> we must pass
through Water and Fire before we enter into rest, that
is, We must first be Baptized with Water, and then with
the Holy Ghost, who first descended in Fire; that is, the
onely way to enter into Christs Kingdom is by these two
Doors of <hi>the Tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not
Man,</hi> first by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and then by <hi>Confirmation;</hi> First
by <hi>Water,</hi> and then by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Primitive Church had this notion so fully amongst
them, that the Author of the Apostolical constitutions
attributed to St. <hi>Clement,</hi> who was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Schollar, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
That a man is made a perfect Christian (meaning
Ritually and Sacramentally,<note place="margin">S. Clem. Ep. 4.</note> and by all exterior solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
by the Water of Baptism and Confirmation of
the Bishop,<note place="margin">Constit. Apost.</note> and from these words of Christ now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
derives the use and institution of the Rite of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98912:15"/>
Confirmation. The same sense of these words is given
to us by St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> who intending to prove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency
of one without the other, sayes, <q>

nascantur, cum Scriptum sit, nisi quis natus fuerit ex

               </q> 
               <q>Then
they may be fully Sanctified and become the Sons of
God, if they be born with both the Sacraments, or
Rites; for it is written, <hi>Vnless a Man be born of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of
God.</hi>
               </q> The same also is the Commentary of <hi>Eusebius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenus</hi>

to reprove them that neglect the Episcopal imposition
of Hands <q>[Concerning them who by negligence
lose the Bishops presence, and receive not the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Hands, it is to be considered, least in justice
they be condemned, in which they exercize Justice neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
because they ought to make haste to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Hands; because Christ said, <hi>Vnless a Man be
born again of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God:</hi> And as he said this, so also he said,
<hi>Vnless your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To this I fore-see two Objections may be made:
First, That Christ did not institute Confirmation in
this place, because Confirmation being for the gift of
the Holy Ghost, who was to come upon none of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98912:16"/>
till Jesus was glorified: These words seem too
early for the consigning an effect that was to be so long
after, and a Rite that could not be practised till many
intermedial events should happen. So said the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
<hi>The Holy Ghost was come upon none of them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John. 7. 39.</note> 
               <hi>because
Jesus was not yet glorified,</hi> intimating that this great
effect was to be in after-time, and it is not likely that
the Ceremony should be ordained before the Effect it
self was ordered and provided for; that the solemnity
should be appointed before provisions were made for
the mystery, and that the outward, which was wholy
for the inward, should be instituted before the inward
and principal had its abode amongst us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To this I answer. First, That it is no unusual thing;
for Christ gave the Sacrament of his Body before his
Body was given, the memorial of his death was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> before his death. 2. Confirmation might here as
well be instituted as Baptism, and by the same reason
that the Church from these words concludes the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of one, she may also infer the designation of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for the effect of Baptism was at that time no
more produced than that of Confirmation. Christ had
not yet purchased to himself a Church, he had not
wrought remission of sins to all that believe on him;
the death of Christ was not yet passed, into which death
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Christian Church was to be Baptized. 3. These
words are so an institution of Confirmation, as the sixth
<hi>chap.</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi> is of the blessed Eucharist: It was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signativa,</hi>
not <hi>ordinativa,</hi> it was in design, not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
command; here it was preached, but not reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to practice till its proper season. 4. It was like the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> words of Christ to St. <hi>Peter: When thou art converted
confirm thy Brethren.</hi> Here the command was given,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98912:16"/>
but that Confirmation of his Brethren was to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in a time relative to a succeeding accident. 5. It
is certain that long before the event and grace was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Christ did speak of the Spirit of Confirmation,
that Spirit which was to descend in Pentecost, which all
they were to receive who should believe on him, which
whosoever did receive,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. <hi>v.</hi> 39.</note> 
               <hi>out of his Belly should flow Rivers
of Living Waters,</hi> as is to be read in that place of St.
<hi>John</hi> now quoted. 6. This praedesignation of the Holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Spirit of Confirmation was presently followed by some
little ante-past and <hi>donariola,</hi> or little givings of the
Spirit; for our blessed Saviour gave the Holy Ghost
three several times. First, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> obscurely, and by
intimation and secret virtue, then, when he sent them to
heal the sick, and anoint them with Oyl in the Name of
the Lord. Second, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more expresly and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
after the Resurrection, when he took his leave of
them, and said, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</hi> And this
was to give them a power of ministring remission of
sins, and therefore related to Baptism and the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Repentance. But, 3. He gave it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more
perfectly, and this was the Spirit of Confirmation; for
he was not at all until now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, sayes the
Text; <hi>The Holy Ghost was not yet:</hi> So almost all the <hi>Greek</hi>

               <hi>Austin</hi>
among the <hi>Latines,</hi> and some <hi>Latine Translations</hi> read
it: Our Translations read it, <hi>The Holy Ghost was not yet
given,</hi>
was not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in them,</hi> as some few <hi>Greek</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
read it; but the meaning is alike, Confirmation
was not yet actual, the Holy spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98912:17"/>
was not yet come upon the Church, but it follows
not but he was long before promised, designed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
spoken of and declared.* The first of these
collations had the Ceremony of Chrisme or Anointing
joyned with it, which the <hi>Church</hi> in process of time
transferred into her use and ministry, yet it is the last
onely that Christ passed into an Ordinance for ever; It
is this onely which is the Sacramental consummation of
our Regeneration in Christ; for in this the Holy spirit
is not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> present by his power, but present
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as St. <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen</hi> expresses it, to dwell with us, to converse
with us, and to abide for ever, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
So St. <hi>Paul</hi> describes this Spirit of Confirmation, the
Spirit which he hath poured forth upon us, richly or
plentifully, that is, in great measures, and to the full
consummation of the first mysteries of our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now because Christ is the great Fountain of this
blessing to us, and he it was who sent his Fathers spirit
upon the <hi>Church,</hi> himself best knew his own intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the great blessings he intended to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to his <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore it was most agreeable
that from his <hi>Sermons</hi> we should learn his purposes and
his blessing, and our duty: Here <hi>Christ</hi> declared <hi>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Sacramenti,</hi> the spiritual Grace which he would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
impart to his Church by exterior ministry, in this
as in all other Graces, Mysteries, and Rituals Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical:
<hi>Nisi quis, Vnless a Man be born both of Water and
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the next objection is yet more material. 2. For if
this be the meaning of our Blessed Saviour, then Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is as necessary as Baptism, and without it ordinarily
no man can be saved. The solution of this will answer
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98912:17"/>
a case of conscience, concerning the necessity of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and in what degree of duty and diligence we
are bound to take care that we receive this Holy rite.
I answer therefore, that, <hi>entring into the Kingdom of God,</hi>
is, being admitted into the Christian Church and ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
to become Sons of God, and Souldiers of Jesus
Christ; and though this be the outward door, and the
first entrance into life, and consequently the Kings high
way, and the ordinary means of Salvation, yet we are
to distinguish the external ceremony from the internal
mystery, The <hi>Nisi quis</hi> is for this, not for that; and
yet that also is the ordinary way. <hi>Vnless a Man be
baptized;</hi> that is, unless he be <hi>indeed regenerate,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be sav'd; and yet baptism, or the outward washing
is the solemnity, and Ceremony of its ordinary ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and he that neglects this, when it may be had, is
not indeed regenerate; he is not renewed in the spirit
of his mind, because he neglects Gods way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can as little be sav'd, as he, who having receiv'd the
external Sacrament, puts a bar to the intromission of
the inward grace. Both cannot alwayes be had; but
when they can, although they are not equally valuable
in the Nature of the thing, yet they are made equally
necessary by the Divine Commandment. And in this
there is a great but general mistake in the doctrine of
the Schools disputing concerning what Sacraments are
necessary <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> that is, as necessary means,
and what are necessary by the necessity of praecept,
or Divine Commandment. For although a less reason
will excuse from the actual susception of some than of
others, and a less diligence for the obtaining of one
will serve than in obtaining of another, and a supply in
one is easier obtain'd than in another, yet no Sacrament
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98912:18"/>
hath in it any other necessity than what is made meerly
by the Divine Commandment. But the grace of every
sacrament, or rite or mystery which is of Divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is necessary indispensably, so as without it no
man can be sav'd: And this difference is highly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the words of Christ recorded by S. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> He
<hi>that believeth and is baptized shall be saved: but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not shall be damned.</hi> Baptism it self, as to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
part, is not necessary <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> or indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably;
but baptismal Faith for the remission of sins in
person capable, that indeed is necessary; for Christ does
not say that the want of baptism damns as the want of
Faith does: and yet both Baptisme and Faith are the
ordinary way of Salvation; and both necessary; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
because it is so by the Divine <hi>Commandment,</hi> and
faith as a <hi>necessary means</hi> of salvation, in the very Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
and dispensation of the Gospel. Thus it is also
in the other Sacrament.<note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
               <hi>Vnless we eat the flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink his blood we have no life in us;</hi>
and yet God forbid that every Man that is not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
should dye eternally. But it means plainly, that
without receiving Christ, as he is by Gods intention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
we should receive him in the Communion, we have
no life in us. Plainly thus, without the internal grace
we cannot live; and the external ministery is the usual
and appointed means of conveying to us the internal;
and therefore although without the external it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be sav'd, when it is impossible to be had; yet
with the wilful neglect of it, we cannot. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to understand the words of Christ decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the necessity of both these Ceremonies: they
are both necessary, because they are the means of
spiritual advantages and graces, and both minister
to the proper ends of their appointment, and both
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98912:18"/>
derive from a Divine Original: But the ritual or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
part in rare emergencies is dispensable; but
the Grace is indispensable. Without the grace of
Baptism we shall dye in our sins; and without the grace
or internal part of Confirmation we shall never be able
to resist the Divel, but shall be taken captive by him
at his will: Now the external or ritual part is the means,
the season and opportunity of this grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is at no hand to be neglected, least we be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
despisers of the grace, and tempters of God to wayes
and provisions extraordinary. For although when
without our fault we receive not the sacramental part,
God can and will supply it to us out of his own stores;
because no man can perish without his own fault; and
God can permit to himself what he please, as being
Lord of the Grace and of the Sacrament; yet to us he
hath given a law and a rule; and that is the way of his
Church in which all Christians ought to walk. In short:
The <hi>use</hi> of it is <hi>greatly profitable;</hi> the <hi>neglect</hi> is <hi>inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable;</hi>
but the <hi>contempt</hi> is <hi>damnable. Tenentur non negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere
si pateat opportunitas,</hi> said the Bishops in a Synod at
<hi>Paris:</hi> If there be an opportunity, it must not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
<hi>Obligantur suscipere, aut saltem non contemnere,</hi>
said the Synod at <hi>Sens.</hi> They are bound to receive it, or
at least not to despise it. Now he despises it that refuses
it when he is invited to it, or when it is offered; or that
neglects it without cause. For, <hi>causelesly</hi> and <hi>contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
are all one. But these answers were made by gentle
<hi>Casuists;</hi> he onely values the Grace that desires it, that
longs for it, that makes use of all the means of Grace,
that seeks out for the means, that refuses no labour, that
goes after them as the Merchant goes after Gain; and
therefore the <hi>Old Ordo Romanus</hi> admonishes more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

wants it by necessity, it may by the overflowings of the
Divine Grace be supplied, but not so if negligence or
choice causes the omission.</p>
            <p>3. Our way being made plain, we may proceed to
other places of Scripture to prove the Divine Original
of Confirmation. It was a Plant of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
planting, it was a Branch of the Vine, and how it
springs from the Root <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> we have seen; it is
yet more visible as it was dressed and cultivated by the
Apostles. Now as soon as the Apostles had received
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98912:19"/>
the Holy spirit, they preached and baptized, and the
inferiour Ministers did the same, and St. <hi>Philip</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
did so at <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Converts of which place
received all the Fruits of Baptism, but <hi>Christians</hi> though
they were, they wanted a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> something to make
them perfect. The other part of the Narrative I shall
set down in the words of St. <hi>Luke:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 8. v. 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Now when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
which were at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Word of God, they sent unto them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi>
John, <hi>who, when they were come down, prayed for them that
they might receive the Holy Ghost, for as yet he was fallen
upon none of them, onely they were Baptized in the Name
of the Lord Jesus; Then laid they their hands on them and
they received the Holy Ghost.</hi> If it had not been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to have added a new solemnity and ministration, it
is not to be supposed the Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would
have gone from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to impose hands on the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
at <hi>Samaria. Id quod deerat à Petro &amp; Johanne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
est, ut Oratione pro eis habitâ &amp; manu impositâ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocaretur
&amp; infunderetur super eos spiritus sanctus,</hi> said
St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Jubaian.</note> It was not necessary that they should be
Baptized again, onely that which was wanting was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that by prayer and impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands the Holy Ghost should be invocated and
poured upon them. The same also is from this place
affirmed by <hi>P. Innocentius</hi> the First,<note place="margin">Epist. 1. c. 3. Adv. Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and many
others; and in the Acts of the Apostles we find another
instance of the celebration of this Ritual and Mystery,
for it is signally expressed of the Baptized Christians at
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> first Baptized them, and then laid
his hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost;
and these Testimonies are the great warranty for this
Holy Rite. <hi>Quod nunc in confirmandis Neophytis manus
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98912:20"/>
impositio tribuit singulis, hoc tunc Spiritus sancti descensio
in credentium populo donavit universis,</hi> said <hi>Eucherius Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunensis,</hi>
in his Homily of Pentecost. The same thing
that is done now in imposition of hands or single persons,
is no other than that which was done upon all Believers
in the descent of the Holy Ghost; it is the same Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and all deriving from the same Authority.</p>
            <p>Confirmation or imposition of hands for the collation
of the Holy spirit we see was actually practised by the
Apostles, and that even before and after they preached
the Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therefore <hi>Amalarius,</hi>
who entred not much into the secret of it, reckons this
Ritual as derived from the Apostles <hi>per consuetudinem,</hi>
by <hi>Catholick</hi> custom, which although it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
spoken as to the whole <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Authority of
it, yet he places it in the Apostles, and is a witness of the
Catholick succeeding custom and practise of the Church
of God; which thing also <hi>Zanchius</hi> observing, though he
followed the sentiment of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> and seemed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
no more of it, yet sayes well: <hi>Interim</hi> (sayes
he) <hi>exempla Apostolorum &amp; veteris Ecclesiae vellem plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
aestimari.</hi> I wish that the example of the Apostles
and the primitive Church were of more value amongst
<hi>Christians,</hi> it were very well indeed they were so, but
there is more in it than mere example. These examples
of such solemnities productive of such spiritual effects
are, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls them, <hi>Apostolica Magisteria,</hi> the
Apostles are our Masters in them, and have given Rules
and Precedents for the Church to follow. This is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Law, <hi>and written</hi> as all <hi>Scriptures are, for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</hi>
But this I shall expresly prove in the next
Paragraph.</p>
            <p>4. We have seen the Original from Christ, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98912:20"/>
and exercise of it in the Apostles, and the first
Converts in Christianity; that which I shall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
is, that this is established and passed into a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine. The warranty for what I say is the
words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 1. 2.</note> where the Holy Rite of <hi>Confirmation,</hi>
so called from the effect of this ministration, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by the Ritual part of it, <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> is
reckoned a Fundamental point <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Not
laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead
works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of
Baptismes and of laying on of Hands, of Resurrection from
the Dead and Eternal judgement.</hi> Here are six Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
points of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Catechism, which he laid as the
foundation or the beginning of the institution of the
Christian church, and amongst these imposition of hands
is reckoned as a part of the foundation, and therefore
they who deny it, dig up foundations: Now that this
<hi>imposition of hands</hi> is that which the Apostles used in
confirming the Baptized, and invocating the Holy Ghost
upon them, remains to be proved.</p>
            <p>For it is true that <hi>imposition of hands</hi> signifies all
Christian Rites except Baptism and the Lords Supper;
not the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but all the <hi>Sacramentals</hi> of the
Church: It signifies Confirmation, Ordination, Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
Visitation of the Sick, blessing single persons,
(as Christ did the Children brought to him) and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Marriages, all these were usually ministred by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands. Now the three last are not preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be any part of this foundation, neither Reason,
Authority, nor the Nature of the thing, suffer any such
pretension: The Question then is between the first
three. First, <hi>Absolution of Penitents</hi> cannot be meant
here, not onely because we never read that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98912:21"/>
did use that <hi>ceremony</hi> in their Absolutions; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostle speaking of the foundation in which
Baptism is, and is reckoned one of the principal parts
in the foundation, there needed no Absolution but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal,
for they and we believing <hi>one Baptism for the
Remission of Sins,</hi> this is all the absolution that can be
at first and in the foundation. The other was <hi>secunda
post naufragium tabula,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Symbol. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caen. &amp; C. P.</note> it came in after, when men had
made a shipwrack of their good <hi>conscience,</hi> and were as
St. <hi>Peter</hi> says <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
of the former cleansing and purification and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their old sins.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. It cannot be meant of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and this is also
evident. 1. Because the Apostle sayes he would
thenceforth leave to speak of the foundation, and go
on to perfection, that is, to higher mysteries. Now
in Rituals, of which he speaks, there is none higher than
<hi>Ordination.</hi> 2. The Apostle saying he would speak no
more of Imposition of Hands, goes presently to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the mysteriousness of the Evangelical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and the honour of that vocation, by which it is
evident he spake nothing of Ordination in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism
or Narrative of Fundamentals. 3. This also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the context, not onely because <hi>laying on of
hands</hi> is immediately set after <hi>Baptism,</hi> but also because
in the very next words of his Discourse he does enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and apportion to <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and proportioned effects: To <hi>Baptism, illumination,</hi>
according to the perpetual stile of the Church of God,
calling <hi>Baptism</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an enlightning, and to <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
he reckons, <hi>tasting the Heavenly gift, and being made
partakers of the Holy Ghost;</hi> by the thing signified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the Sign, and by the mystery the Rite. Upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98912:21"/>
these words St. <hi>Chysostom</hi> discoursing, sayes, <q>That
all these are Fundamental Articles; that is, that we
ought to repent from dead works, to be Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Faith of Christ, and be made worthy of the
gift of the Spirit, who is given by Imposition of
Hands, and we are to be taught the mysteries of the
Resurrection and Eternal Judgement.</q> 
               <hi>This Catechism</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>is perfect;</hi> so that if any man have Faith in
God, and being <hi>baptized</hi> is also <hi>confirmed,</hi> and so tastes
the Heavenly gift and partakes of the Holy Ghost, and
by hope of the Resurrection tastes of the good things
of the World to come, if he falls away from this state,
and turn Apostate from this whole Dispensation, digging
down and turning up these Foundations, he shall never
be built again; he can never be Baptized again, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be Confirmed any more, God will not begin again,
and go over with him again, he cannot be made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
twice; if he remains upon these Foundations,
though he sins, he may be renewed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
and by a Resuscitation of the Spirit, if he have not
wholly quenched him: But if he renounces the whole
Covenant, disown and cancel these Foundations, he is
desperate, he can never be renewed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to the
Title and Oeconomy of Repentance.</hi> This is the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this excellent place, and any other wayes
it cannot reasonably be explicated, but therefore into
this place any notice of Ordination cannot come; no
Sense, no Mystery can be made of it or drawn from it,
but by the interposition of Confirmation the whole
context is clear, rational, and intelligible.</p>
            <p>This then is that imposition of hands of which the
Apostles speaks. <hi>Vnus hic locus abundè testatur,</hi> &amp;c.
saith <hi>Calvin:</hi> This one place doth abundantly witness
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98912:22"/>
that the Original of this Rite or Ceremony was from
the Apostles,<note place="margin">In hunc locu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, saith S. <hi>Chrysostom;</hi>
for by this rite of imposition of hands they receiv'd the
Holy Ghost. For though the spirit of God was given
extra-regularly, and at all times, as God was pleas'd to
do great things; yet this imposition of hands was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
this was <hi>the Minstery of the Spirit.</hi> For so we
receive Christ when we hear and obey his word: we eat
Christ by Faith, and we live by his Spirit; and yet the
Blessed Eucharist is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the ministery
of the body and blood of Christ.</hi> Now as the Lords
Supper is appointed <hi>ritually</hi> to convey Christ's body and
blood to us: So is Confirmation ordain'd <hi>ritually</hi> to give
unto us the Spirit of God. And though by accident
and by the overflowings of the spirit it may come to
pass that a man does receive perfective graces alone, and
without Ministeries external: yet such a Man without
a miracle is not a perfect Christian <hi>ex statuum vitae dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positione;</hi>
but, in the ordinary wayes and appointment
of God, and until he receive this imposition of hands,
and be confirmed, is to be accounted an imperfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
But of this afterwards.</p>
            <p>I shall observe one thing more out of this testimony
of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> He calls it, <hi>the Doctrine of Baptismes and
laying on of hands;</hi> by which it does not only appear
to be a lasting ministery, because no part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Doctrine</hi> could change, or be abolished; but
hence also it appears to be of Divine institution. For if
it were not; S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been guilty of that which our
Blessed Saviour reproves in the Scribes and Pharisees,
and should have <hi>taught for Doctrines the Commandments
of Men.</hi> Which because it cannot be suppos'd; it must
follow, that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Confirmation, or <hi>impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98912:22"/>
of hands</hi> is Apostolical and Divine. The argument is
clear, and not easie to be reproov'd.</p>

breath'd upon the Apostles and Apostolical men; but
then he breath'd his last: <hi>recedente gratiâ, recessit disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina:</hi>

by divers particulars evince plainly, that this ministery
of confirmation was not temporary and relative only
to the Acts of the Apostles, but was to descend to the
Church for ever. This indeed is done already in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Sect. In which it is clearly manifested; that Christ
himself made the Baptism of the Spirit,<note place="margin">John 3. 5.</note> to be necessary
to the Church; he declar'd the fruits of this Baptism;
and did particularly relate it to the descent of the Holy
Spirit upon the Church at and after that glorious <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost.</hi>
He sanctifyed it, and commended it by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
just as in order to baptism, he sanctified the

this righteousness also: This Doctrine the Apostles first
found in their own persons and experience, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to all their Converts after Baptism by a solemn and
external Rite, and all this passed into an Evangelical
Doctrine, the whole mystery being signified by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rite in the words of the Apostle, as before it was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98912:23"/>
by Christ, expressing onely the internal; so that there
needs no more strength to this Argument: But that
there may be wanting no moments to this truth, which
the Holy Scripture affords, I shall add more weight to
it; And,</p>
            <p>1. The perpetuity of this Holy Rite appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this great gift of the Holy Ghost was promised <hi>to
abide with the Church for ever.</hi> And when the <hi>Jews</hi>
heard the Apostles speak with Tongues at the first and
miraculous descent of the Spirit in Pentecost, to take
off the strangeness of the wonder and the envy of the
power; St. <hi>Peter</hi> at that very time tells them plainly,
<hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you,—and ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Not the
meanest person amongst you all but shall receive this
great thing,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 38, 39.</note> which ye observe us to have received;
and not onely you, but your Children too; not your
Children of this Generation onely, <hi>sed Nati natorum, &amp;
qui nascentur ab illis,</hi> but your Children for ever: <hi>For
the promise is to you and to your children, and to all that
are afar off, even to as many as the Lord our God shall
call.</hi> Now then let it be considered.</p>
            <p>1. This gift is by promise, by a promise not made to
the Apostles alone, but to all; to all for ever.</p>
            <p>2. Consider here at the very first as there is a <hi>verbum,</hi>
a word of promise, so there is <hi>sacramentum</hi> too: (I
use the word as I have already premonished in a large
sense onely, and according to the stile of the Primitive
Church) it is a Rite partly Moral, partly Ceremonial,
the first is Prayer, and the other is laying on of the
hands, and to an effect that is but transient and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and of a little aboad, it is not easie to be
supposed that <hi>such a solemnity</hi> should be appointed. I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98912:23"/>
say, <hi>such a solemnity,</hi> that is, it is not imaginable that
a solemn Rite annexed to a perpetual Promise should be
transient and temporary, for by the nature of Relatives
they must be of equal abode. The promise is of a thing
for ever, the Ceremony or Rite was annexed to the
Promise, and therefore this also must be for ever.</p>
            <p>3. This is attested by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who reduces this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to this Mystery, saying; In whom after that
ye believed <hi>signati estis spiritu sancto promissionis, ye
were sealed by that holy spirit of promise.</hi> He spake it to
the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 13.</note> who well understood his meaning by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what was done to themselves by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 19. 6.</note>
but a while before, who after they had Baptized
them did lay their hands upon them, and so they were
sealed, and so they received the Holy spirit of promise;
for here the very matter of Fact is the clearest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
on St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words: The spirit which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to all Christians they then received, when they
were consigned, or had the Ritual seal of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Imposition of hands. One thing I shall remark
here, and that is, that this and some other words of
Scripture relating to the Sacraments or other Rituals of
Religion do principally mean the Internal Grace, and
our consignation is by a secret power, and the work is
within, but it does not therefore follow that the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rite is not also intended; for the Rite is so wholly
for the Mystery, and the outward for the inward, and
yet by the outward God so usually and regularly gives
the inward, that as <hi>no man is to rely upon the External
Ministery,</hi> as if the <hi>opus operatum</hi> would do the whole
Duty; so <hi>no man is to neglect the External, because the
Internal is the more principal.</hi> The mistake in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
hath caused great contempt of the Sacraments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98912:24"/>
and Rituals of the Church, and is the ground of the
<hi>Socinian</hi> errors in these Questions.</p>
            <p>But 4. what hinders any man from a quick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the first representation of these plain reasonings
and authorities? Is it because there were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effects accompanying this ministration, and because
now there are not, that we will suppose the whole Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
must cease; if this be it, and indeed this is all
that can be supposed in opposition to it, it is infinitely
vain.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because these extraordinary effects did continue
even after the death of all the Apostles. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
sayes they did continue even to his time; even the
greatest instance of miraculous power,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap 57.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; in fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
saepissimè propter aliquid necessarium ea quae est in
quoquo loco Vniversa Ecclesia postulante per jejunium &amp;
supplicationem multam, reversus est spiritus, &amp;c.</hi> When
God saw it necessary, and the Church prayed and fasted
much, they did miraculous things, even of reducing
the Spirit to a dead man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In the dayes of the Apostles the holy spirit did
produce miraculous effects, but neither alwayes, nor at
all, in all men: <hi>Are all workers of Miracles? Do all
speak with Tongues?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Do all interpret? Can all heal?</hi>
No, the Spirit bloweth where he listeth, and as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth;
he gives gifts to all, but to some after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to some after that.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. These gifts were not necessary at all times any
more than to all persons, but the promise did belong to
all, and was made to all, and was performed to all. In
the dayes of the Apostles there was an <hi>effusion</hi> of the
Spirit of God, it run over, it was for themselves and
others, it wet the very ground they trode upon, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98912:24"/>
made it fruitful; but it was not to all in like manner,
but there was also then, and since then, a <hi>diffusion</hi> of
the Spirit, <hi>tanquam in pleno.</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was full of the
Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Acts 6. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>he was full of faith and power:</hi> The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost was given to him to fulfil his Faith principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the working miracles was but collateral and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
But there is also <hi>an infusion</hi> of the Holy Ghost,
and that is to all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> and that is for ever, <hi>The manifestation
of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall,</hi> saith
the Apostle; and therefore if the Grace be given to all,
there is no reason that the Ritual ministration of that
Grace should cease, upon pretence that the Spirit is not
given extraordinarily.</p>
            <p>4. These extraordinary gifts were indeed at first ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>In the beginnings alwayes appears the sensible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of spiritual things for their sakes, who cannot receive
the understanding of an incorporeal Nature; that if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they be not so done, they may be believed by those
things which were already done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matthaeum.</note> said St. <hi>Chysostom</hi> in the
place before quoted. That is, these visible appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were given at first by reason of the imperfection of
the state of the Church, but the greater gifts were to
abide for ever; and therefore it is observable that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> sayes, That the gift of Tongues is one of the least
and most useless things; a meer sign, and not so much
as a sign to Believers, but to Infidels and Unbelievers;
and before this he greatly prefers the gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
or Preaching, which, yet all Christians know, does
abide with the Church for ever.</p>
            <p>5. To every ordinary and perpetual ministery at first,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
there were extraordinary effects and miraculous consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
We find great parts of Nations converted at
one Sermon. Three thousand converts came in at once
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98912:25"/>
Preaching of S. <hi>Peter;</hi> and five thousand at another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
and Persons were miraculously cured by the
prayer of the Bishop in his visitation of a sick Christian;
and Divels cast out in the conversion of a sinner; and
blindness cur'd at the Baptism of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi>
was healed of a Palsie at the same time, he was cur'd of
his infidelity; and <hi>Eutychus</hi> was restor'd to life at the
Preaching of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and yet that now we see no such
extraordinaries, it followes not, that the visitation of
the sick, and Preaching Sermons, and absolving penitents
are not ordinary and perpetual ministrations: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to fancy that invocation of the Holy Spirit, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands is to cease when the extraordinary and
temporary contingencies of it are gone, is too trifling
a fancy to be put in ballance against so sacred an institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
relying upon so many Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. <hi>With this Objection some vain persons would have
troubled the Church in S.</hi> Austins <hi>time; but he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it with much indignation, writing against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists.
His words are these.</hi>

Spirit fell upon the Believers, and they spake with tongues
which they had not learned, according as the Spirit gave
them utterance. They were signs fitted for the season; for
so the Holy Ghost ought to have signified in all tongues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Gospel of God was to run thorough all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Languages of the World: so it was signified, and
so it pass'd thorough. But is it therefore expected that
they, upon whom there is imposition of hands that they might
receive the Holy Ghost, that they should speak with tongues?
Or when we lay hands on Infants, does every one of you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to hear them speak with Tongues? And when he sees
that they do not speak with Tongues, is any of you of so
perverse a heart as to say, They have not received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98912:25"/>
Ghost; for if they had received him, they would speak
with Tongues, as it was done at first? But if by these
Miracles there is not now given any testimony of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the holy Spirit, how doth any one know that he
hath received the Holy Ghost? Interroget cor suum, si
diligit fratrem, manet spiritus Dei in illo. <hi>It is true
the gift of Tongues doth not remain, but all the greater
gifts of the holy Spirit remain with the Church for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
Sanctification and Power, Fortitude and Hope,
Faith and Love: Let every man search his Heart, and
see if he belongs to God; whether the</hi> love of God be
not spread in his heart by the spirit of God: <hi>Let him
see if he be not patient in Troubles, comforted in his
Afflictions, bold to Confess the Faith of Christ crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
zealous of good works: These are the miracles
of Grace, and the mighty powers of the Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that saying of Christ;</hi> These signs shall follow
them that believe:<note place="margin">Marc. 16. 17.</note> In my Name shall they cast out Devils,
they shall speak with new Tongues, they shall tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
they shall drink poyson, and it shall not hurt them;
and they shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall
recover. <hi>That which we call the miraculous part is the
less power; but to cast out the Devil of Lust, to
throw down the pride of</hi> Lucifer, <hi>to tread on the great
Dragon, and to triumph over our spiritual enemies, to
cure a diseased Soul, to be unharmed by the poyson of
Temptation, of evil Examples and evil Company:
These are the true signs that shall follow them that truly
and rightly believe on the Name of the Lord Jesus; this
is</hi> to live in the spirit, and to walk in the spirit; <hi>this is
more than to receive the spirit to a power of miracles,
and super-natural products in a natural matter: For
this is</hi> from a super-natural principle <hi>to receive</hi> super-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98912:26"/>
aids <hi>to a</hi> super-natural end <hi>in the</hi> Diviner spirit <hi>of
a man; and this being more miraclous than the other,
it ought not to be pretended that the discontinuance of
extraordinary miracles should cause the discontinuance
of an ordinary ministration; and this is that which I
was to proove.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. To which it is not amiss to add this Observation,
That <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered to buy this power of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
that he also by laying on of hands might thus
minister the spirit. Now he began this sin in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, and it is too frequent at this day, but if
all this power be gone, then nothing of that sin can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
if the subject matter be removed, then the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
crime cannot abide, and there can be no Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
so much as by participation; and whatever is or
can be done in this kind, is no more of this Crime, than
Drunkenness is of Adultery; it relates to it, or may
be introductive of it, or be something like it: But
certainly since the Church is not so happy as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
free from the Crime of Simony, it will be hard
to say, that the power (the buying of which was the
principle of this sin, and therefore the Rule of all the
rest) should be removed, and the house stand without
a foundation, the relative without the correspondent,
the accessary without the principal, and the accident
without the subject. This is impossible, and therefore it
remains that still there abides in the Church this power,
that by Imposition of the Hands of sit persons, the Holy
Ghost is ministred: But this will be further cleared in
the next Section.</p>

And although in Rituals the tradition it self, if it be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal

is so esteemed in the Baptism of Infants, in the Priests
consecrating the Holy Eucharist, in publick Liturgies,
in Absolution of Penitents, the Lords Day, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating

being all that, and evidently derived from the

the Scriptures, and taught how to be baptized; then changing
a few things he sayes to him, now you are no longer a Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

            <p>S. <hi>Dionys</hi> commonly called the <hi>Areopagite</hi> in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

of the Holy rite of Confirmation or Chrism.<note place="margin">De Eccles. Hier. c. 2.</note> Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
at large the office and manner of baptizing the
Catechumens, the trine immersion, the vesting them in
white Garments; adds; <hi>Then they bring them again to the

               </gap>, with the most Divinely operating Unction,

he sayes.<note place="margin">Et cap. 4.</note> But even to him, who is consecrated in
the most holy mystery of regeneration, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the perfective Unction of Chrism gives to him the advent
of the Holy Spirit. And this rite of Confirmation, then
called Chrism, from the spiritual Unction then effected
and consign'd also and signified by the Ceremony of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
externally, which was then the ceremony of the
Church; he calls it <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation
of our baptismal regeneration; meaning that
without this, there is something wanting to the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed

            <p>And this appears fully in that famous censure of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus</hi>

               <note place="margin">A. D. 260.</note>
               <hi>Novatus</hi> had been baptized in his bed being very
sick and like to dye: <hi>but when he recover'd he did not
receive those other things which by the rule of the Church
he ought to have receiv'd: neque Domini sigillo ab Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopo

signature by the hands of the Bishop; he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed:
<hi>Quo non impetrato, quomodo spiritum sanctum

can he be suppos'd to have receiv'd the Holy Spirit?

The same also is something more fully related by
<hi>Nicephorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 3.</note> but wholly to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>Melchiades <hi>in his Epistle to the Bishops of</hi> Spain <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
excellently about the necessity and usefulness of
the Holy Rite of Confirmation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. D. 320.</note> [What does the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Confirmation profit me after the mystery of Baptism?
Certainly we did not receive all in our Baptism, if after
that lavatory we want something of another kind. Let
your charity attend. As the Military order requires, that
when the General enters a Souldier into his list, he does
not only mark him, but furnishes him with armes for the
Battle. So in him that is baptiz'd, this blessing is his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.
You have given <hi>(Christ)</hi> a Souldier, give him
also Weapons. And what will it profit him if a Father
gives a great Estate to his Son, if he does not take care to
provide a Tutor for him. Therefore the Holy Spirit is the
Guardian of our regeneration in Christ, he is the Comforter,
and he is the Defender.]</p>

            <p>The Council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 38.</note> celebrated in the time of <hi>P.

               </gap>.
<note place="margin">Can. 38.</note> All
that are baptized, must be anointed with the coelestial
Unction, and [so] be partakers of the Kingdom of Christ.
All that are so, that is, are confirm'd; for this coelestial
Unction, is done by holy prayers, and the invocation of
the Holy Spirit, so <hi>Zonarus</hi> upon this Canon: all such
who have this Unction shall reign with Christ, unless by
their wickedness they praeclude their own possessions.
This Canon was put into the Code of the Catholick
Church; and makes the 152. Canon.</p>
            <p>The Council of <hi>Orleans</hi> affirms expresly;<note place="margin">Habetur apud Gratian. de Consecrat. dist. 5. cap. jejun.</note> that he who
is baptiz'd cannot be a Christian (meaning according
to the usual stile of the Church; a full, and perfect
Christian) <hi>nisi confirmatione Episcopali fuerit Chrismatus;</hi>
unless he have the Unction of Episcopal confirmation.</p>
            <p>But when the Church had long disputed concerning
the re-baptizing of Hereticks and made Canons for and
against it, according as the Heresies were, and all agreed
that if the first baptism had been once good, it could
never be repeated; yet they thought it sit that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
should be confirm'd by the Bishop, all supposing
Confirmation to be the perfection and consummation of
the less perfect baptism.<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> Thus the first Council of <hi>Arles</hi>
decreed concerning the Arrians, that if they had been
baptized in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost, they should not be re-baptized. <hi>Manus tantùm eis
imponatur ut accipiant Spiritum Sanctum;</hi> That is, let
them be confirm'd; let there be imposition of hands that
they may receive the Holy Ghost. The same is decreed
by the second Council of <hi>Arles</hi> in the case of the <hi>Bonasiaci.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note>

            <p>So many Fathers testifying the practise of the Church,

a Journey he takes, who abides without Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
brought remedy as far as he could, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that in the absence of Bishops they should be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Priest; and therefore it is by some suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that <hi>factum valet, fieri non debuit.</hi> The thing ought
not to be done but in the proper and appointed way;
but when it is done, it is valid, just as in the case of
Baptism by a Lay-man or Woman: Nay, though
some Canons say it is <hi>actio irrita,</hi> the act is null, yet for
this there is a <hi>salvo</hi> pretended; for sometimes an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is said to be <hi>irrita</hi> in Law, which yet nevertheless is
of secret and permanent value, and ought not to be
done again. Thus if a Priest be promoted by Simony,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98912:33"/>
it is said,<note place="margin">1 Qu. 1. cap. qui vult 1. &amp; 2.</note> 
               <hi>sacerdos non est, sed inaniter tantùm dicitur;</hi>
he is but vainly called a Priest, for he is no Priest. So
<hi>Sixtus</hi> II. said,<note place="margin">Epist 2. de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc. ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</note> That if a Bishop Ordain in anothers
Diocess, the Ordination is void; and in the Law it is

               </note> that if a Bishop be consecrated without his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy

and yet these later and fiercer constitutions do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
concerning the natural event of things, but of
the legal and Canonical approbation.</p>
            <p>To these things I answer, That St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in <hi>Egypt</hi> the Presbyters <hi>consign</hi> in the Bishops
absence, does not prove that they ever did <hi>confirm</hi> or
impose hands on the Baptized for the ministry of the
holy spirit,<note place="margin">Qu. v. &amp; <hi>N. T.</hi> Qu. 101.</note> because that very passage being related by
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> the more general word of <hi>consign</hi> is rendred
by the plainer and more particular, <hi>consecrant,</hi> they
consecrate, meaning the blessed Eucharist; which was
not permitted primitively to a simple Priest to doe in
the Bishops absence without leave, onely in <hi>Egypt</hi> it
seems they had a general leave, and the Bishops absence
was an interpretative consent: But besides this, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signant</hi>
is best interpreted by the practise of the Church,
of which I shall presently give an account, they might
in the absence of the Bishop consign with Oyl upon the
top of the head, but not in the fore-head, much less
impose hands, or confirm, or minister the holy Spirit,
for the case was this.</p>
            <p>It was very early in the Church, that to represent the
grace which was ministred in Confirmation, the Unction
from above, they us'd Oyl and Balsom; and so constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
us'd this in their Confirmations, that from the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
it had the appellation; <hi>Sacramentum Chrismatis;</hi>
S. <hi>Austin</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98912:33"/>
at the Baptism of <hi>the adult Christians,</hi> and (by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that) <hi>of Infants,</hi> Confirmation and Baptism
were usually ministred at the same time; the Unction
was not only us'd to persons newly baptiz'd; but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Unction was added as a ceremony in Baptism it self;
and was us'd immediately before Baptism; and the oyle
was put on the top of the head, and three times was
the party sign'd; so it was then, as we find in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Hierarchy. But besides this Unction with oyl
in baptismal preparations; and pouring oyl into the
baptismal water; we find another Unction after the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
was finished. For they bring the baptized person
<hi>again to the Bishop,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. hier. cap 2.</note> saith S. <hi>Dionys;</hi> who signing the

Unction; this was that which was us'd when
the Bishop confirmed the baptized person: <hi>For to him
who is initiated by the most holy initiation of the Divine
generation (that is, to him who hath been baptiz'd, saith</hi>
Pachimeres <hi>the Paraphrast of</hi> Dionysius) <hi>the perfective
Vnction of Chrisme, gives the gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> This
is that which the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Every man that is borne into
the World, and every man that is a Champion is anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with oyl. That to baptism, this alluding to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Chrisme</hi> was frequently ministred immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after Baptism; in the Cities where the Bishop
was present. But in Villages and little Towns where the
Bishop was not present, it could not be. But Bishops
were forc'd at their opportunities to go abroad and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98912:34"/>
perfect what was wanting, as it was in the example of
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to the Samaritans. <hi>Non quidem abnuo
hanc esse Ecclesiarum consuetudinem, ut ad eos qui longè in
minoribus Vrbibus per Presbyteros &amp; Diaconos baptizati
sunt, Episcopus ad invocationem Sancti Spiritus manum
impositurus excurrat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">C. Hieron adv. Lucifer. ante med.</note> 
               <hi>It is the custom of the Church that
when persons are in lesser Cities baptiz'd by Priests and
Deacons, the Bishops uses to travel far, that he may lay
hands on them, for the invocation of the Holy Spirit.</hi> But
because this could not alwayes be done, and because
many baptized persons dyed before such an opportunity
could be had; the Church took up a custome, that the
Bishop should consecrate the Chrisme, and send it to the
Villages and little Cities distant from the <hi>Metropolis,</hi>
and that the Priests should anoint the baptized with it.
But still they kept this part of it sacred and peculiar to
the Bishop. 1. That no Chrisme should be us'd but what
the Bishop consecrated. 2. That the Priests should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
the head of the baptized; but at no hand, the
forehead, for that was still reserved for the Bishop to
do when he confirmed them. And this is evident in
the Epistle of <hi>P. Innocent</hi> the first, above quoted. <hi>Nam
Presbyteris, seu extra Episcopum, seu praesente Episcopo
baptizant, Chrismate baptizatos Vngere licet, sed quod
ab Episcopo fuerit consecratum. Non tamen frontem ex
eodem oleo signare, quod solis debetur Episcopis cum tradunt
Spiritum Paracletum.</hi> Now this the Bishops did, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to satisfie the desire of the baptized, but by this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
to excite the <hi>votum confirmationis,</hi> that they,
who could not actually be confirmed, might at least
have it <hi>in voto</hi> in desire, and in Ecclesiastical representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This (as some think) was first introduc'd by
Pope <hi>Sylvester:</hi> and this is the consignation, which the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98912:34"/>
Priests of <hi>Egypt</hi> us'd in the absence of the Bishop; and
this became afterward, the practice in other Churches.</p>
            <p>But this was no part of the Holy Rite of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but a ceremony annexed to it ordinarily; from
thence transmitted to baptism, first by imitation, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by way of supply and in defect of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Confirmation Episcopal. And therefore we
find in the first <hi>Arausican</hi> Council in the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the
first and <hi>Theodosius junior,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> it was decreed, <hi>That in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
every one should receive Chrism: de eo autem qui in
baptismate, quâ cunque necessitate faciente Chrismatus non
fuerit, in confirmatione sacerdos commonebitur.</hi> If the
baptized by any intervening accident or necessity was
not anointed, the Bishop should be advertiz'd of it in
Confirmation, meaning that then it must be done. For
the Chrisme was but a ceremony annexed; no part of
either rite essential to it; but yet thy thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
by reason of some opinions then prevailing in
the Church. But here the rites themselves are clearly
distinguish'd; and this of <hi>Confirmation</hi> was never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to mere Presbyters. <hi>Innocentius III,</hi> a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonist
and of great authority, gives a full evidence in
this particular. <q>Per frontis Chrismationem manus impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio
designatur, quia per eam Spiritus Sanctus per augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
datur &amp; robur. Vnde cum caeteras unctiones sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex

               <q>By anointing of the forehead, the
imposition of hands is design'd, because by that the
Holy Ghost is given for increase and strength; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a single Priest may give the other Unctions,
yet this cannot be done but by the chief Priest, that
is, the Bishop:</q> And therefore to the Question, what

shall be done if a Bishop may not be had? The same <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi>

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98912:35"/>
on the fore-head, by that was signified that
the Holy Ghost was preparing a habitation for himself;
by this was declared the descent of the Holy Spirit, with
his seven-fold gifts, with all fulness of knowledge and
spiritual understanding. These things were signified by
the appendant Ceremony, but the Rites were ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
and did not onely signifie and declare, but
effect these Graces by the ministry of Prayer and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Hands.</p>
            <p>The ceremony the Church instituted and us'd as she
pleas'd, and gave in what circumstances they would
choose; and new propositions entred, and customes
chang'd, and deputations were made; and the Bishops,
in whom by Christ was plac'd the fulness of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
power, concredited to the Priests and Deacons so
much as their occasions and necessities permitted; and
because in those ages and places where the external cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was regarded (it may be) more than the inward
mystery, or the Rite of Divine appointment, they were
apt to believe that the Chrism, or exteriour Unction dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to the Priests Ministery after the Episcopal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of it, might supply the want of Episcopal
confirmation; it came to pass that new opinions were
entertain'd; and the Regulars, the Fryers and the Jesuits,
who were alwayes too little friends to the Episcopal
power, <hi>from which they would fain have been wholly exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,</hi>
publickly taught (in <hi>England</hi> especially) that chrisme
ministred by them with leave from the Pope did doe
all that which ordinarily was to be done in Episcopal
confirmation. For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> complain'd in his time,
<hi>Quibus fuit propositum aliter docendi, eos necessitas coëgit
aliter disponendi instrumenta Doctrinae.</hi> They who had
purposes of teaching new Doctrines, were constrain'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98912:36"/>
otherwise to dispose of the Instruments and Rituals
appertaining to their Doctrines. These men to serve
ends, destroyed the article, and overthrew the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Discipline and Unity of the Primitive Church. But
they were justly censur'd by the Theological faculty at
<hi>Paris;</hi> and the censure well defended by <hi>Hallier,</hi> one of
the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon;</hi> whether I refer the Reader
that is curious in little things.</p>
            <p>But for the main: It was ever call'd <hi>Confirmatio Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopalis,
&amp; impositio manuum Episcoporum,</hi> which our
<hi>English</hi> word well expresses, and perfectly retains the
use; we know it by the common name of <hi>Bishopping of
Children.</hi> I shall no farther insist upon it, onely I shall
observe that there is a vain distinction brought into the
Schools and Glosses of the Canon Law, of a <hi>Minister
ordinary,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary;</hi> all allowing that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is appointed the ordinary Minister of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but they would fain innovate and pretend that in
some cases others may be Ministers extraordinary. This
device is of infinite danger to the destruction of the
whole Sacred order of the Ministry, and disparks the
inclosures, and layes all in common, and makes men su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
controulers of the Orders of God, and relies
upon a false principle; for in true Divinity and by the
Oeconomy of the spirit of God, there can be no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of any Divine Ordinance, but he that is of Divine
appointment, there can be none but the <hi>ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
I do not say that God is tied to this way, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be tied, but by himself; and therefore Christ gave
a special Commission to <hi>Ananias</hi> to baptize and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and he gave the Spirit to <hi>Cornelius</hi> even
before he was baptized, and he ordained St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be
an Apostle without the ministry of man: But this I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98912:36"/>
say, That though God can make Ministers extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
yet Man cannot, and they that goe about to do so,
usurp the power of Christ, and snatch from his hand
what he never intended to part with. The Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
others into a part of their care, and of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but when they intended to imploy them in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
they gave them so much of their Order as would
enable them, but a person of a <hi>lower order</hi> could never be
deputed Minister of actions appropriate to the <hi>higher,</hi>
which is the case of Confirmation, by the practise and
tradition of the Apostles, and by the Universal practise
and Doctrine of the Primitive Catholick Church, by
which, Bishops onely, the successors of the Apostles,
were alone the Ministers of Confirmation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any man else usurp it, let them answer it; they
do hurt indeed to themselves, but no benefit to others,
to whom they minister shadows instead of substances.</p>

of Hands was the whole procedure in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Rites; and because this ministery was most signally
performed by this ceremony, and was also by St. <hi>Paul</hi>
called and noted by the name of the <hi>Ceremony, impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hands;</hi> this name was retained in the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> and this manner of ministring <hi>Confirmation</hi> was
all that was in the commandment or institution.</p>
            <p>But because in Confirmation we receive the Unction
from above, that is, then we are most signally <hi>made
Kings and Priests unto God, to offer up spiritual sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and to enable us to seek the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God and
the Righteousness of it, and that the giving the holy
spirit is in Scripture called the Unction from above, the
Church of God in early Ages made use of this Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and passed it into an External ceremony and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the mystery,<note place="margin">Prudent. in <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>We are consigned on the fore-head with Oyl,<note place="margin">A. D. 400.</note> and a

said S. <hi>Cyril.</hi> Preserve this Unction pure and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
for it teaches you all things, as you have heard the
blessed S. <hi>John</hi> speaking and philosophying many things
of this holy Chrism. Upon this account the H. Fathers
used to bless and consecrate Oyl and Balsome, that by
an external signature they might signifie the inward
Unction effected in Confirmation. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
This Chrism
is not simple or common when it is blessed, but
the gift of Christ, and the presence of his H. Spirit,
as it were effecting the Divinity it self; the body is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
anointed with visible Oyntment, but is also san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the holy and quickning Spirit; so St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> I
finde in him,<note place="margin">Synodus Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricensis, apud <hi>Bochel.</hi> l. 1. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Eccl. Gal. lit. 5.</note> and in some late Synods, other pretty sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
and allusions made by this Ceremony of
Chrisms, <hi>Nos autem pro igne visibili, qui die Pentecostes
super Apostolos apparuit, oleum sanctum, materiam nempe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
ex Apostolorum traditione ad confirmandum adhibemus,</hi>
This using of Oyl was instead of the Baptism with Fire,
which Christ baptized his Apostles with in Pentecost;
and Oyl being the most proper matter of Fire, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
used in Confirmation.</p>
            <p>That this was the ancient Ceremony is without
doubt, and that the Church had power to do so hath
no question, and I add, it was not unreasonable; for if
ever the Scripture expresses the mysteriousness of a
Grace conferred by an exteriour ministry, (as this is,
by imposition of hands) and represents it besides in the
Expression and Analogy of any sensible thing, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
drawn into a ceremony will not improperly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Grace, since the Holy Ghost did chuse that for
his own expression and representment. In baptism we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98912:39"/>
are said to be <hi>buried with Christ.</hi> The Church does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Analogy of that expression, when she
immerges the Catechumen in the Font; for then she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the same thing which the Holy Ghost would
have to be represented in that Sacrament, the Church
did but the same thing when she used Chrism in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.
This I speak in justification of that ancient
practise, but because there was no command for it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
said St. <hi>Basil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. de Spir. S. cap. 17.</note> concerning Chrisme
there is no written word, that is, of the Ceremony
there is not, he said it not of the whole Rite of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;
therefore though to this we are all bound,
yet as to the anointing the Church is at liberty, and
hath with sufficient authority omitted it in our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</p>
            <p>In the Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. the Bishops
used the sign of the Cross upon the fore-heads of them
that were to be confirmed. I do not find it since for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
or revoked by any expression or intimation, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
onely that it is omitted in our later Offices; and
therefore it may seem to be permitted to the discretion
of the Bishops, but yet not to be used, unless where it
may be for Edification, and where it may be by the
consent of the Church, at least by interpretation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, I have nothing else to interpose, but
that <hi>neither this, nor any thing else, which is not of the
nature and institution of the Rite, ought to be done by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

            <p>IT is of it self enough, when it is fully understood,
what is said in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> at the first mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of this Rite. <hi>They received the Holy Ghost,</hi>
that is, according to the expression of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself to the Apostles, when he commanded them
in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to expect the verification of his glorious
promise: <hi>they were endued with virtue from on high;</hi> that
is, with strength to perform their duty, which although
it is not to be understood exclusively to the other
Rites and Ministeries of the Church of Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet it is properly and most signally true, and as it
were in some sense,<note place="margin">Part. 3. qu. 72. art. 6. ad prim.</note> appropriate to this. For as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
well discourses; the grace of Christ is not tyed to the
Sacraments; but even this Spiritual strength and vertue
from on high can be had without Confirmation: as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Baptism remission of sins may be had: and yet we
believe one Baptism for the remission of sins; and one
Confirmation for the obtaining this vertue from on high,
this strength of the spirit. But it is so appropriate to it
by promise and peculiarity of ministration, that as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the desire of baptism our sins are not pardon'd, so
without, at least, the desire of Confirmation, we cannot
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98912:40"/>
receive this vertue from on high, which is appointed to
descend in the ministery of the spirit. It is true, the
ministery of the Holy Eucharist is greatly effective to
this purpose; and therefore in the ages of Martyrs the
Bishops were careful to give the people the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
frequently,<note place="margin">Epist. 54.</note> 
               <hi>ut quos tutos esse contra adversarium
volebant, munimento Dominicae Saturitatis armarent;</hi> as
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> with his Collegues wrote to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> that
those whom they would have to be safe against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of their adversaries, they should arme them with
the guards and defences of the Lords fulness. But it is
to be remembred, that the Lords Supper is for the more
perfect Christians, and it is for the increase of the graces
receiv'd formerly, and therefore it is for remission of
sins, and yet is no prejudice to the necessity of baptism,
whose proper work is remission of sins; and therefore
neither does it make Confirmation unnecessary, for it
renews the work of both the precedent Rites; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
the breaches, and adds new Energy, and proceeds
in the same dispensations; and is renewed often, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the others are but once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Excellent therefore are the words of</hi> John Gerson <hi>the
Famous Chancellor of</hi> Paris,<note place="margin">In opusc. art. de Confirmat.</note> 
               <hi>to this purpose.</hi> It may be
said that in one way of speaking Confirmation is necessary,
and in another it is not. Confirmation is not necessary as
Baptism and Repentance, for without these, Salvation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had. This necessity is absolute but there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
necessity. Thus if a Man would not become weak,
it is necessary that he eat his meat well. And so Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is necessary, that the spiritual life, and the health
gotten in Baptism may be preserv'd in strength against our
spiritual enemies. For this is given for strength. Hence
is that saying of <hi>Hugo de</hi> S. <hi>Victore.</hi> What does it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98912:40"/>
that thou art raised up by Baptism, if thou art not able
to stand by Confirmation? Not that Baptism is not of value
unto Salvation without confirmation; but because he who
is not confirmed will easily fall, and too readily perish. <hi>The
spirit of God comes which way he please, but we are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to use his own Oeconomy, and expect the blessings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by his own ministeries: And because to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is promised we shall receive whatever we ask, we may
as well omit the receiving the holy Eucharist, pretending
that prayer alone will procure the blessings expected in
the other, as well I say, as omit confirmation, because
we hope to be strengthned and receive virtue from on
high by the use of the Supper of the Lord: Let us
use all the ministeries of Grace in their season; for</hi> we
know not which shall prosper, this or that, or whether
they shall be both alike good; this onely we know, that
the Ministeries, which God appoints, are the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and opportunities of Grace.</p>
            <p>This <hi>power from on high,</hi> which is the <hi>proper blessing
of Confirmation,</hi> was expressed, not onely in speaking
with Tongues and doing Miracles, for much of this they
had before they received the Holy Ghost, but it was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in spiritual and internal strengths; they were not
onely enabled for the service of the Church, but were
indued with courage and wisdom, and Christian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and boldness, to confess the Faith of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and unity of heart and minde, singleness of
heart, and joy in God, when it was for the edification
of the Church, miracles were done in confirmations;
and St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Malachias</hi> tells, that
St. <hi>Malchus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lismore</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> confirmed a
Lunatick child, and at the same time cured him: but such
things as these are <hi>extraregular</hi> &amp; <hi>contingent.</hi> This which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98912:41"/>
we speak of is a regular ministery, and must have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
effect.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> said, That the holy spirit in confirmation
was given <hi>ad dilatanda Ecclesiae primordia,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogating
Christianity in the beginnings of the Church.
St. <hi>Hierom</hi> sayes, it was <hi>propter honorem sacerdotii;</hi> for
the honour of the Priesthood; St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayes, it was
<hi>ad confirmationem Vnitatis in Ecclesiâ Christi,</hi> for the
confirmation of Unity in the Church of Christ, and
they all say true: But the first was by the miraculous
consignations, which did accompany this ministery, and
the other two were by reason that the mysteries were
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they were appropriated
to the ministery of the Bishop, who is <hi>caput unitatis,</hi>
the head, the last resort, the Firmament of Unity in
the Church. These effects were <hi>regular</hi> indeed, but
they were <hi>incident</hi> and <hi>accidental:</hi> There are effects
yet more proper, and of greater excellency.</p>
            <p>Now if we will understand in general what excellent
fruits are consequent to this Dispensation, we may best
receive the notice of them from the Fountain it self, our
blessed Saviour.<note place="margin">John 7. 38.</note> 
               <hi>He that believes, out of his Belly</hi> (as
the Scripture saith) <hi>shall flow Rivers of Living waters.
But this he spake of the spirit, which they that believe on
him should receive.</hi> This is evidently spoken of the
spirit, which came down in Pentecost, which was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to all that should believe in Christ, and which the
Apostles ministred by imposition of hands, the Holy
Ghost himself being the expositor; and it can signifie
no less, but that a spring of life should be put into the
heart of the confirmed, to water the Plants of God;
that they should become Trees, not onely planted by
the water side (for so it was in <hi>David</hi>'s time, and in all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98912:41"/>
the ministery of the Old Testament) but having a River
of living water within them to make them fruitful of
good works, and bringing their fruit in due season,
fruits worthy of amendment of life.</p>
            <p>1. But the principal thing is this. <hi>Confirmation</hi> is the
consummation and perfection, the corroboration and
strength of baptism, and baptismal Grace; for in
<hi>baptism</hi> we undertake to do our duty, but in <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
we receive <hi>strength to do it:</hi> In <hi>baptism</hi> others promise
for us, in <hi>confirmation</hi> we undertake for our selves, we
ease our God-fathers and God-mothers of their burden,
and take it upon our own shoulders, together with the
advantage of the Prayers of the Bishop and all the
Church made then on our behalf. In <hi>baptism</hi> we give
up our names to <hi>Christ,</hi> but in <hi>confirmation</hi> we put our
seal to the profession, and God puts his seal to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
It is very remarkable what St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes of the
beginnings of our being Christians, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the word of the beginning of Christ: Christ begins
with us, he gives us his word, and admits us, and we

               </gap>,
it is <hi>the form of Doctrine unto which ye were delivered.
Cajetan</hi> observes right, That this is a new and Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
way of speaking: we are wholly immerged in our
fundamentals; other things are delivered to us, but we
are delivered up unto these. This is done in <hi>Baptism</hi>
and <hi>Catechism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 18.</note> and what was the event of it? <hi>Being
then made free from sin, ye became the Servants of
Righteousness.</hi> Your baptism was for the remission of
sins there, and then ye were made free from that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and what then? Why then in the next place,
when ye came to consummate this procedure, when the
baptized was confirmed, then he became a servant of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98912:42"/>
righteousness, that is, then the Holy Ghost descended
upon you, and enabled you to walk in the spirit; then
<hi>the seed of God</hi> was first thrown into your hearts by a

            <p>It is a work of great and wonderful powers when
the holy pledge of God is poured forth upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
This is that power from on high which first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
in Pentecost, and afterward was ministred by
prayer and imposition of the Apostolical and Episcopal
hands, and comes after the other gift of remission of
sins. <hi>Vides quod non simplicitèr hoc fit, sed multâ opus

said St. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> You see that this is not easily done,
but there is need of much power from on high to give
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98912:42"/>
the holy spirit; for it is not all one to obtain remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sins, and to have received this virtue or power
from above. <hi>Quamvis enim continuò transituris suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant

sunt confirmationis auxilia,</hi> said <hi>Melchiades;</hi> Although
to them that die presently the benefits of regeneration
<hi>(baptismal)</hi> are sufficient, yet to them that live the
Auxiliaries of confirmation are necessary; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the saying of St. <hi>Leo</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Nicetas</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>Aquileja,</hi> commanding that Hereticks return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Church should be confirmed with invocation
of the holy spirit and imposition of hands, they have
onely received the form of baptism <hi>sine sanctificationis
virtute,</hi> without the virtue of sanctification, meaning
that this is the proper effect of <hi>Confirmation:</hi> For, in
short, <hi>Although the newly listed Souldiers in humane war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
are enrolled in the number of them that are to sight, yet
they are not brought to battle till they be more trained and
exercised: So although by baptism every one is ascribed
into the catalogue of believers, yet he receives more strength
and grace for the sustaining and overcoming the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, onely by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Bishops hands.</hi> They are words which I
borrowed from a late Synod at <hi>Rhemes;</hi> that's the first
remark of blessing; in confirmation we receive
strength to do all that which was for us undertaken in
baptism: For the Apostles themselves (as the H. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
observe) were timorous in the Faith, until they
were confirmed in Pentecost, but after the reception
of the Holy Ghost, they waxed valiant in the Faith, and
in all their spiritual combats.</p>
            <p>2. In Confirmation we receive the Holy Ghost,
as the earnest of our inheritance, as the seal of

but as the reasonable soul works in its due time and by
the order of Nature, by opportunities and new fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and actualities, so does the spirit of God; when
he is brought into use, when he is prayed for with love
and assiduity, when he is caressed tenderly, when he is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98912:43"/>
us'd lovingly, when we obey his motions readily, when
we delight in his words greatly; then we find it true,
that the soul had a new life put into her, a principle of
perpetual actions; but the tree planted by the waters
side, does not presently bear fruit; but <hi>in its due season.</hi>
By this spirit we are then seal'd; that whereas God hath
laid up an inheritance for us in the Kingdom of Heaven,
and in the faith of that we must live and labour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this faith, God hath given us this pledge: the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God is a witness to us, and tells us by his holy
comforts, by the peace of God, and the quietness and
refreshments of a good Conscience, that God is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we are his Sons and Daughters, and shall be
co-heirs with Jesus in his eternal Kingdom. <hi>In baptism</hi>
we are made the Sons of God, but we receive the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and testimony of it <hi>in Confirmation.</hi> This is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the Holy Ghost the Comforter, this is he whom Christ
promis'd and did send in <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and was afterwards
ministred and conveyed by prayer and imposition of
hands: and by this Spirit he makes the Confessors bold,
and the Martyrs valiant, and the tempted strong, and
the Virgins to perfevere, and Widows to sing his praises
and his glories. And this is that excellency which the
Church of God called <hi>the Lords seal,</hi> and teaches to be
imprinted in <hi>Confirmation:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Eusebius</hi> calls it.<note place="margin">Apud. Euseb.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I will not be so curious as to enter into a discourse of
the Philosophy of this. But I shall say, that they who are
Curious in the secrets of Nature, and observe external
signatures in Stones, Plants, Fruits and Shells, of which
Naturalists make many observations, and observe strange
effects; and the more internal signatures in minerals
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98912:44"/>
and living bodies, of which Chymists discourse strange
secrets; may easily, if they please, consider that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
credible that in higher essences, even in Spirits;
there may be signatures proportionable, wrought more
immediately, and to greater purposes by a Divine hand.
I only point at this, and so pass it over, as (it may be)
not fit for every mans consideration.</p>
            <p>And now, if any Man shall say, we see no such things
as you talk of; and find the confirm'd people the same
after, as before, no better, and no wiser; not richer in
gifts, not more adorned with graces, nothing more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for Christs Kingdom; not more comforted with
hope, or established by faith, or built up with charity;
they neither speak better, nor live better. And what
then? Does it therefore follow that the Holy Ghost is
not given in Confirmation? Nothing less. For is not
Christ given us in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?
Do not we receive his body and his blood? Are
we not made all one with Christ, and he with us? And
and yet it is too true, that when we arise from that holy
feast, thousands there are that find no change. But there
are in this, two things to be considered.</p>
            <p>One is, that the changes which are wrought upon our
souls are not after the manner of Nature, visible, and
sensible, and with observation. <hi>The Kingdom of God
cometh not with Observation:</hi> for it is within you, and is
only discerned spiritually, and produces its effects by
the method of Heaven, and is first apprehended by faith,
and is endear'd by charity, and at last is understood by
holy and kind experiences. And in this there is no
more objection against Confirmation than against Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
or the Lords Supper, or any other ministery E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98912:44"/>
The other thing is this. If we do not find the effects of
the spirit in Confirmation, it is our faults. For he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by moral instruments; and is intended only as a help
to our endeavours, to our labours, and our prayers, to our
contentions and our mortifications, to our faith and to
our hope, to our patience and to our charity. <hi>Non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juvari
dicitur, qui nihil facit.</hi> He that does nothing,
cannot be said to be help'd. Unless we in these instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do our part of the work, it will be no wonder if
we loose his part of the co-operation and supervening
blessing. He that comes under the Bishops hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the gift of the Holy Ghost, will come with holy
desires, and a longing soul, with an open hand and a
prepared heart: he will purifie the house of the spirit
for the entertainment of so Divine a guest: he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him with humility and follow him with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and delight him with purities: and he that does
thus, let him make the objection if he can, and tell me;
Does he <hi>say that Jesus is the</hi> Lord? He cannot say this,
<hi>but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Does he love his Brother? If
he does, then <hi>the Spirit of God abides in him.</hi> Is Jesus
Christ formed in him? Does he live by the lawes of
the spirit? Does he obey his commands? Does he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his motions? Hath he no earnest desires to serve
God? If he have not, then in vain hath he receiv'd
either Baptisme or Confirmation. But if he have, it is
certain that of himself he cannot do these things: he
<hi>cannot of himself think a good thought.</hi> Does he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think well? That is from the Holy Spirit of
God.</p>
            <p>To conclude this inquiry:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Holy Ghost is promised
to all Men to profit withall.</hi> That's plain in Scripture.
Confirmation, or prayer and Imposition of the Bishops

hand is the Solemnity and Rite us'd in Scripture for
the conveying of that promise, and the effect is felt in
all the Sanctifications and changes of the Soul, and he
that denies these things hath not faith, nor the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices

us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> Here
is a description of the whole mysterious part of this
rite. God is the Author of the grace: The Apostles
and all Christians are the suscipients and receive this
grace: by this grace we are adopted and incorporated
into Christ: God hath anointed us; that is, he hath given
us this Unction from above, <hi>he hath sealed us by his
Spirit,</hi> made us his own, bored our ears thorough, made
us free by his perpetual service, and hath done all these
things in token of a greater; he hath given us his
Spirit to testifie to us that he will give us of his glory.
These words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> besides that they evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

expounded of the Rite and Sacramental it self, by S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,

more. For in this mystery, <hi>Christos nos efficit, &amp; mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiam

S. <hi>John Damascen;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 4. de fide cap 10.</note> he makes us his anointed ones, and
by the Holy Spirit he declares his eternal mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us. <hi>Nolite tangere Christos meos.</hi> Touch not
mine anointed ones. For when we have this signature
of the Lord upon us, the Devils cannot come near to
hurt us, unless we consent to their temptations, and
drive the Holy Spirit of the Lord from us.</p>

            <p>IF Confirmation have such gracious effects, why doe
we confirm little children, whom in all reason we
cannot suppose to be capable and receptive of such
Graces? It will be no answer to this, if we say, that
this very question is asked concerning the baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
to which as great effects are consequent, even
pardon of all our sins, and the new birth and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the soul unto Christ: For in these things the
soul is wholly passive, and nothing is required of the
suscipient but that he put in no bar against the grace,
which because Infants cannot doe, they are capable of
baptism; but it follows not that therefore they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of confirmation, because this does suppose them
such as to need new assistances, and is a new professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a personal undertaking, and therefore requires
personal abilities, and cannot be done by others, as in
the case of baptism. The aids given in Confirmation
are in order to our contention and our danger, our
temptation and spiritual warfare, and therefore it will
not seem equally reasonable to confirm children as to
baptize them.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That in the Primitive Church
<hi>Confirmation was usually administred at the same time with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98912:46"/>
baptism,</hi> for we find many Records that when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of baptism was finished, and the baptized person
devested of the white Robe, the person was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the Bishop to be confirmed, as I have already
shewn out of <hi>Dionysius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 4. part 3. De Eccles Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Melchiad. Epist. ad episc. Hispan. Ordo Rom. cap. de die Sabbathi. S. Pasch. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuin. De divin. offic. c. 19.</note> and divers others. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why anciently they were ministred immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one another, is, not onely because the most of them
that <hi>were baptized were of years to choose their Religion,
and did so;</hi> and therefore were capable of all that could
be consequent to baptism, or annexed to it, or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
with it, and therefore were also at <hi>the same time
communicated as well as confirmed;</hi> but also because the
solemn baptismes were at solemn times of the year, at
<hi>Easter</hi> onely and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and onely in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
or Bishops Church in the chief City; whither when
the Catechumens came, and had the opportunity of the
Bishops presence, they took the advantage <hi>ut sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
utro<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> renascantur,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s expression is, that
they might be regenerated by both the mysteries, and
they also had the third added, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.</p>
            <p>This simultaneous ministration hath occasioned some
few of late to mistake confirmation for a part of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
but no distinct Rite, or of distinct effect, save
onely that it gave ornament and complement, or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the other: But this is infinitely confuted by
the very first ministry of <hi>Confirmation</hi> in the World;
for there was a great interval between St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
and the Apostles confirming the <hi>Samaritans,</hi>
where also the difference is made wider by the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Minister; a Deacon did one; none but an
Apostle, and his successor a Bishop could do the other;
and this being of so universal a Practise and Doctrine in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98912:46"/>
the Primitive Church, it is a great wonder that any
learned men could suffer an errour in so apparent a case.
It is also clear in two other great remarks of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the Primitive Church, the one is of them who
were baptized in their sickness, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
when they recovered they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to address themselves to the Bishop, to be
confirmed, which appears in the XXXVIII. Canon of
the council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> and the XLVI. Canon of the
council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which I have before cited upon
other occasions; the other is, that of Hereticks retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Church, who were confirmed not onely
long after baptism, but after their apostacy and their
conversion.</p>
            <p>For although Episcopal confirmation was the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptismal grace, and commonly administred
the same day, yet it was done by interposition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
ceremonies,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum</hi> Schol. ad Hym. Eccl.</note> and not immediately in time. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius
Augustodunensis</hi> tells, That when the baptized on
the Eighth day had laid aside their Mitres, or proper
habit used in baptism, then they were usually confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or consigned with Chrism in the Fore-head by the
Bishop. And when children were baptized irregular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or besides the ordinary way, in Villages and places
distant from the Bishop, confirmation was deferr'd, said
<hi>Durandus.</hi> And it is certain, that this affair did not
last long without variety: Sometimes they ministred
both together; sometimes at greater, sometimes at les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
distances; and it was left indifferent in the Church
to do the one or the other, or the third, according to
the opportunity and the discretion of the Bishop.</p>
            <p>But afterward, in the middle and descending Ages
it grew to be a question, not whether it were lawful,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98912:47"/>
or not, but which were better, To confirm Infants, or to
stay to their childehood, or to their riper years? <hi>Aquinas,
Bonaventure,</hi> and some others say it is best, that they
be confirmed in their Infancy, <hi>quia dolus non est, nec o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicem
ponunt,</hi> they are then without craft, and cannot
hinder the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them; and
indeed it is most agreeable with the Primitive practise,
that if they were baptized in Infancy, they should then
also be confirmed, according to that of the famous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of <hi>Melchiades</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>Spain: Ita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juctna
sunt haec duo sacramenta, ut ab invicem nisi morte
praeveniente, non possint separari, &amp; unum sine altero ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè
perfici non potest.</hi> Where although he expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
the Rites to be two, yet unless it be in cases of
necessity they are not to be severed, and one without
the other is not perfect, which, <hi>in the sense formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi>
is true, and so to be understood; That <hi>to him who
is baptized and is not confirmed, something very considerable
is wanting, and therefore they ought to be joyned, though
not immediately, yet</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>according to reasonable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and accidental causes:</hi> But in this there must
needs be a liberty in the Church, not onely for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reasons, but also because the Apostles themselves
were not confirmed till after they had received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>Others therefore say, That to confirm them of riper
years is with more edification. The confession of Faith
is more voluntary, the election is wiser, the submission
to Christs discipline is more acceptable, and they have
more need, and can make better use of their strengths
then derived by the holy spirit of God upon them;
and to this purpose it is commanded in the Canon Law,<note place="margin">De consecrat. dist. 5. c. ut je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juni.</note>
that they who are confirmed should be <hi>perfectae aetatis,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98912:47"/>
of full age; upon which the gloss sayes, <hi>Perfectam vocat
forte duodecim annorum; Twelve year old was a full age,
because at those years they might then be admitted to the
lower services in the Church.</hi> But the reason intimated and
implied by the Canon is, because of the preparation to
it; <hi>They must come fasting, and they must make publick
confession of their Faith.</hi> And indeed that they should
do so is matter of great edification, as also are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of choice, and other preparatory abilities and
dispositions above-mentioned: They are matter of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
I say, when they are done; but then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
of them so long before they be done, and the
wanting the aids of the Holy Ghost conveyed in
that ministry, are very prejudicial, and are not
matter of edification.</p>
            <p>But therefore there is a third way, which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> followes, and that is,
that after Infancy; but yet before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
too much of sin, and when they can compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
understand the fundamentals of Religion, then
it is good to bring them to be confirmed, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God may prevent their youthful sins, and
Christ by his word and by his spirit, may enter and take
possession at the same time. And thus it was in the
Church of <hi>England</hi> long since provided and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Laws of King <hi>Edgar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A. D. 967.</note> 
               <hi>cap. 15. ut nullus ab E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopo
confirmari diù nimium detrectârit;</hi> That none
should too long put off his being confirmed by the
Bishop, that is, as is best expounded by the perpetual
practise almost ever since, <hi>as soon as ever by Catechism
and competent instruction they were prepared, it should not
be deferred.</hi> If it have been omitted (as of late years
it hath been too much) as we do in baptism, so in this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98912:48"/>
also; it may be taken at any age, even after they have
received the Lords Supper, as I observed before in the
practise and example of the Apostles themselves, which
in this is an abundant warrant: But still the sooner the
better. I mean, after that Reason begins to dawn:
but ever it must be taken care of, that the Parents and
God-fathers, the Ministers and Masters see that the
Children be catechised and well instructed in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>For this is the necessary preparation to the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
reception of this holy ministry: <hi>In Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siis
potissimùm Latinis non nisi adultiore aetate pueros ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti
videmus, vel hanc certè ob causam, ut Parentibus,
susceptoribus, &amp; Ecclesiarum praefectis occasio detur pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros
de fide, quam in baptismo professi sunt, diligentiùs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituendi,
&amp; admonendi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consultationis. cap. 9.</note> said the excellent <hi>Cassander.</hi>
In the Latine Churches they admit children of some
ripeness of age,<note place="margin">Serm. 116. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum.</note> that they may be more diligently
taught and instructed in the Faith. And to this sense
agree St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De lib. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast. c. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Walafridus Strabo, Ruardus Lovanien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this was ever the practise of the Primitive
Church to be infinitely careful of catechising those, who
came and desired to be admitted to this holy Rite;
they used Exorcisms or Catechisms to prepare them to
baptism and confirmation. I said <hi>Exorcisms</hi> or <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,</hi>
for they were the same thing; if the notion be
new, yet I the more willingly declare it, not onely to
free the Primitive Church from the suspicion of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
in using Charms or Exorcismes (according to the
modern sense of the word) or casting of the Devil out of
innocent Children but also to remonstrate the perpetual
practise of catechising children in the eldest and best
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98912:48"/>
times of the Church. Thus the <hi>Greek</hi> Scholiast upon

to Exorcise, that is, (sayes he) to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise

The use that I make of this notion is principally to
be an exhortation to all of the Clergy, that they take
great care to catechise all their people, to bring up
Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, to
prepare a holy seed for the service of God, to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the young plants, and to dress the old ones, to
take care that those, who are men in the World, be not
meer Babes, and uninstructed in Christ, and that they,
who are children in age, may be wise unto salvation;
for by this means we shall rescue them from early temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
when being so prepared they are so assisted by a
Divine ministery; we shall weaken the Devils power, by
which he too often, and too much prevails upon unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and unconfirmed youth: For, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
confirmation is the firmament of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but we profess nothing till we be catechised; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisings
are our best preachings, and by them we shall
give the best accounts of our charges, while in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of Christ we make Disciples, and take prepossessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Infant-understandings, and by this holy Rite, by
prayer and imposition of hands we minister the holy
spirit to them, and so prevent and disable the artifices
of the Devil; <hi>for we are not ignorant of his devices,</hi>
how he enters as soon as he can, and taking advantage of
their ignorance and their passion, seats himself so strongly
in their hearts and heads. <hi>Turpiùs ejicitur, quàm non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittur
hostis,</hi> It is harder to cast the Devil out, than to
keep him out. Hence it is that the youth are so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in their manners, so Devilish in their Natures,
so cursed in their conversation, so disobedient to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
so wholly given to vanity and idleness; they
learn to swear before they can pray, and to lie as soon
as they can speak. It is not my sense alone, but was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98912:49"/>
long since observed by <hi>Gerson</hi> and <hi>Gulielmus Parisiensis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. Schism.</note>
               <hi>Propter cessationem confirmationis tepiditas grandior est
in fidelibus, &amp; fidei defensione:</hi> There is a coldness and
deadness in Religion, and it proceeds from the neglect
of confirmation ritely ministred, and after due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and dispositions. A little thing will fill a childs
head: Teach them to say their prayers; tell them
the stories of the Life and Death of Christ; cause them
to love the holy <hi>Jesus</hi> with their first love, make them
afraid of a sin, let the principles, which God hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their very Creation, the natural principles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Truth, of honesty and thankfulness, of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and obedience be brought into act, and habit,
and confirmation by the holy Sermons of the Gospel.
If the Guides of Souls would have their people holy,
let them teach holiness to their children, and then they
will (at least) have a new generation unto God,
better than this wherein we now live. They who are
most zealous in this particular will with most comfort
reap the fruit of their labours, and the blessings of their
ministery, and by the numbers which every Curate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to his Bishop fitted for confirmation, he will in
proportion render an account of his Stewardship with
some visible felicity; and let it be remembred, that in
the last Rubrick of the Office of Confirmation in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
it is made into a Law, that <hi>none should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the holy Communion, until such time as he could say
the Catechism, and be confirmed;</hi> which was also a Law
and Custom in the Primitive Church, as appears in St.
<hi>Dionysius</hi> his Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, and the matter of
fact is notorious. Among the <hi>Helvetians</hi> they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to contract marriages before they are well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Catechism: And in a late Synod at
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98912:50"/>
               <hi>Bourges,</hi> the Curates are commanded to threaten all
that are not confirmed, that they shall never receive the
Lords Supper, nor be married; and in effect the same
is of force in our Church; for the married persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to receive the Sacrament at their marriage, and none
are to receive but those that are confirmed; the same
Law obtains with us, as with the <hi>Helvetians</hi> or the <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Bituricensis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another little inquiry, which I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to omit; but the answer will not be long, because
there is not much to be said on either side. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether the holy Rite of Confirmation can be
ministred any more than once? St. <hi>Austin</hi> seems to be
of opinion that it may be repeated.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de bapt. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Quid enim aliud
est impositio manuum nisi oratio super hominem?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
is a solemn prayer over a man; and if so, why
it may not be reiterated can have nothing in the nature
of the thing; and the Greeks do it frequently,
but they have no warranty from the Scripture, nor
from any of their own ancient Doctors. Indeed when
any one did return from Heresie, they confirmed them,
as I have proved out of the first and second Council of
<hi>Arles,</hi> the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the second Council
of <hi>Sevil:</hi> But upon a closer intuition of the thing, I find
they did so onely to such who did not allow of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in their Sects, such as the <hi>Novatians</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists.

               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. haeret. Fabul.</note> So <hi>Thedoret.</hi>
For that reason onely the <hi>Novatians</hi> were to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
upon their conversion, because they had it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
I finde also, they did confirm the converted <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98912:50"/>
but the reason is given in the first Council of
<hi>Arles, quia propriâ lege utuntur.</hi> They had a way of
their own; that is, as the Gloss saith upon the Canon,
<hi>de Arrianis consecrat. dist.</hi> 4. their baptism was not in
the name of the holy Trinity; and so their baptism be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
null, or at least suspected, to make all as sure as
they could, they confirmed them. The same also is the
case of the <hi>Bonasiaci</hi> in the second council of <hi>Arles,</hi>
though they were (as some of the <hi>Arrians</hi> also were)
baptized in the name of the most holy Trinity; but it
was a suspected matter, and therefore they confirmed
them: But to such persons who had been rightly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
and confirmed, they never did repeat it.<note place="margin">Cyril. Hieros. in Procatech.</note>

they had done it; for I find no mention expresly that
they did the latter, but upon the fore-mentioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and either upon supposition of the invalidity of
their first pretended baptism, or their not using at all of
confirmation in their Heretical conventicles: But the

            <p>Remember how great things ye have received, and
what God hath done for you; ye are of his flock, and his
<hi>Militia;</hi> ye are now to fight his battles, and therefore
to put on his armour, and to implore his auxiliaries, and
to make use of his strengths, and alwayes to be on his
side, against all his and all our Enemies. But he that
desires grace, must not despise to make use of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of grace. For though God communicates his
invisible spirit to you, yet that he <hi>is pleas'd to do it by
visible instruments is more than he needs, but not more than
we do need.</hi> And therefore since God descends to our
infirmities, let us carefully and lovingly address our
selves to his ordinances; that as we receive remission
of sins by the washing of water, and the body and blood
of Christ by the ministery of consecrated Symbols, so
we may receive the Holy Ghost <hi>sub Ducibus Christianae

whom our Lord Jesus hath separated to this ministery.
