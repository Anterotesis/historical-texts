            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Parochial Session</hi> is constituted of One <hi>Minister,</hi> or More, with a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Number of <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> (their <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri non Docentes</hi>) and <hi>Deacons.</hi> It meets once a Week, or oftner, if there be Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and takes Cognizance of all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Cases</hi> concerning <hi>External Order,</hi> and <hi>Censure.</hi> If there be but One Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in the Parish, he is Constant <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>: If More, they take their Turns as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99224:4"/>
they can agree upon't; and they are all of them Equal in Honour, and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There passes no Act without the Joynt Consent of the <hi>Minister, Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>; or <hi>Plurality of Votes</hi>; and Note, that the <hi>Minister</hi> has no <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voice.</hi> The Power of <hi>Binding,</hi> or <hi>Loosing</hi>; of <hi>Censures Ecclesiastical</hi>; and of <hi>External Order,</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> is Radically, and Equally in All: So that the <hi>Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> have as much <hi>the Power of the Keys,</hi> as the <hi>Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To support this Jurisdiction, they have their <hi>Four Sacred Orders,</hi> which they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to be of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> First. Their <hi>Preaching Elders</hi> (whom they call <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>) Secondly. Doctors (or University Professors.) Thirdly. <hi>Lay,</hi> or <hi>Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who have as much Authority in the Debate, and Decision of Matters of Faith, Worship, Polity, Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; as the <hi>Preaching-Elders.</hi> Fourthly. <hi>Deacons.</hi> Take notice that their <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are <hi>Annual,</hi> and Consequently one Year Sacred, and Another Profane.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Session</hi> meddles only with things <hi>Parochial,</hi> as the Ordering of the <hi>Parish-Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99224:4"/>
and <hi>Peculiar Service</hi>; the <hi>Censure</hi> of <hi>Lesser Scandals</hi>; as Fornication, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, Scolding, Sabboth-breaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in Difficult Cases, they apply themselves to the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their <hi>Censures,</hi> they impose <hi>Civil Punishments,</hi> and <hi>Fines</hi>; they Emprison Offenders at pleasure; Cart them through the Town; set them in Pillories; Shave one Half of their Heads; Cut off their Beards: Nay, they take upon them by their own Authority to <hi>Banish</hi> whom they <hi>please</hi> out of the Bounds of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; which is a Direct Usurpation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power:</hi> In Case of a Pecuniary Mulct inflicted, or of a Child born in Fornication, they will not allow the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant to be Baptiz'd, if either of the Parents have not paid the Fine, or secur'd it, or satisfi'd the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbytery</hi> is next; and it is made up in some places, of <hi>More,</hi> in others, of <hi>Fewer Parishes,</hi> and the King himself is not Exempt from the Power, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of this <hi>Consistory</hi>; nor in Effect from the Authority of the very <hi>Parochial

Session,</hi> living within the Precinct, either of the One, or of the Other. This <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory</hi> is Compos'd of all the <hi>Parochial Ministers</hi> within its Compass, and a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> for <hi>Each Parish:</hi> so that the <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> are Equal to the <hi>Preaching Elders</hi> both in Number, and Power; and a Botchers Vote goes as far under that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, in Divine Matters, as the Voice of the most Reverend and Learned of the Clergy; only a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> cannot properly be a <hi>Moderatour;</hi> tho' in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cases they have dispens'd with that Scruple.</p>

These <hi>Expectants</hi> have usually some smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in Divinity; as Country-School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Masters, or the like: and they are Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd to do all <hi>Ministerial Acts,</hi> except <hi>Baptizing,</hi> or Administring the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; without <hi>Holy Orders, Imposition of Hands,</hi> or any Qualification for the Sacred Function. There are more or fewer Presbyteries in a Country, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Number of Parishes; but all of them Independent One from Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If the King himself be Cited, he must <hi>Appear,</hi> or be <hi>Excommunicate</hi> for <hi>Contempt</hi>; and submit his Earthly Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their <hi>Scepter of Christ,</hi> as they term it, and from thence, receive <hi>Christ's Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances.</hi> As no <hi>Person</hi> is Exempt, so neither is any <hi>Crime</hi> whatsoever that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99224:6"/>
is either Committed, or suspected to be Committed within the Limits of their Jurisdiction; but they hook it in, as <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to a Christian Profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Provincial Synode</hi> is an <hi>Associate Body</hi> of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> chosen out of all the <hi>Individual Presbyteries,</hi> within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of the Province: they meet twice or thrice a year, and Exercise an Over-ruling Power over all the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> within that Province, in such manner as the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> superintends the <hi>Parochial Session.</hi> In this <hi>Judicatory</hi> the Leading men of the Faction lay their Heads together; form their Projects; and when the <hi>Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> return from hence to their several <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> they intimate to the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ministers what Points they are to Preach upon, for the Advancement of those Designs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>General Assembly</hi> is <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and <hi>Independent:</hi> Hither lies <hi>the Last Appeal,</hi> and the Jurisdiction of it is Universal in what concerns <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> or <hi>Temporals</hi> in Order to <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99224:6"/>
They look upon themselves as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Entrusted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and to Him only do they hold themselves Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable. Whosoever does not obey this Sovereignty, (tho' the King himself) he is to be Excommunicate, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, Collective Body; nay, every Individual Person is to assist to the Compelling, Censuring, and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to the Utmost of his Power. So that the King himself is at their Command, and to order the Execution of their Censures, in Estate, Body, Life, and Death.</p>
               <p>To This <hi>Judicatory Two Preaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> are sent as <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi> from every <hi>Presbytery</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; so that the Clergy have thus far, Two to One: but then reckoning that every <hi>Borough,</hi> and <hi>Corporation</hi> sends <hi>One Commissioner,</hi> and the <hi>Universities,</hi> and <hi>Colledges their Commissioners</hi> too, which are most of them <hi>Lay-men,</hi> this <hi>Assembly of the Kirk</hi> is turn'd into a <hi>Council of State.</hi>
               </p>

Estates) upon the 13th of <hi>May,</hi> 1633. began his Journey towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> in order to his Personal <hi>Coronation,</hi> where he was receiv'd with a Pomp, and Acclamation, befitting the Dignity, and the Solemnity of the Occasion. His first Work was to ratifie the Laws, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of his Predecessour, in Relation to <hi>Church - Government</hi>; which pass'd not without some Opposition: but the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Surrenders</hi> went yet nearer them, tho' both the <hi>Owners of Lands,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers</hi> were so abundantly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, that <hi>the Former</hi> (as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says in his large Declaration, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.) <hi>acknowledg'd it as a Deliverance from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Bondage, under which They and their Ancestours, ever since the Reformation of Religion, had grievously Groan'd; and the Other, with Infinite Gratitude Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Majesty as the Father, and Founder of their Churches.</hi> The Case was this, (as <hi>Heylin</hi> renders it in his <hi>Cyprianus Anglicus, pag.</hi> 224.) <hi>In the Minority of King</hi> James, <hi>the Lands of all</hi> Cathedral Churches, <hi>and</hi> Religious Houses, <hi>which had been settl'd on the Crown by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

They contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within the Bounds of Libels, and Clamours, till that Rebellious Outrage in the great Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> on the 23 of <hi>July,</hi> 1637. Which was no more

many of the Members of Both Houses; as might serve to inspect their Actions; took upon them the Powers, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Convocation.</p>
               <p>The Form of their Government was the same with That of <hi>Scotland:</hi> They had their <hi>Congregational, Classical, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,</hi> and <hi>National Assemblies</hi>; with the same degrees of <hi>Subordination,</hi> and Vested, in Proportion, with the same Powers. They had their <hi>Expectants</hi> too, and the Constitution of their several <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories</hi> was the very same; only the Lords, and Commons (under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Committee for judging of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal) were so wise as to reserve the <hi>Last Appeal</hi> to <hi>Themselves,</hi> which was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lodg'd in the <hi>General Assembly</hi>; by which Device, the <hi>Schism</hi> was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the <hi>Rebellion</hi>; whereas in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> it was the clear contrary. And they had also another Hank upon them, in appointing that the <hi>National Assembly</hi> should meet upon a Summons by <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and then sit, and continue, as the Parliament should order, and not Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for they were not able to consent

(they said) in a Declaration of the House of Commons, <hi>Apr.</hi> 17. 1646.) to their <hi>Granting of an</hi> Arbitrary, <hi>and</hi> Unlimited Power, <hi>and</hi> Jurisdiction, <hi>to near</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Judicatories, <hi>to be Erected in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which could not be consistent with the Fundamental Laws, and Government of it; and which, by necessary Consequence, did Exclude the Parliament from having any thing to do in That Jurisdiction.</hi> But the Nation is never the better yet for This Caution, so long as the <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>Slavery</hi> is still the <hi>same.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> That the Parliaments Power does no more reach to the Placing of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Originally in the Church, than the Church has Power to make States-men in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Parliament can make no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99224:16"/>
Law at all concerning the Church, but only Ratifie what the Church Decrees: And after it has Ratify'd it, yet if the Assembly of the Church shall Prohibit it, and Repeal that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Church, all the Subjects are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd from yielding Obedience to the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> The Assembly has Power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all Subscriptions to the Confession of Faith commanded to be Subscrib'd by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; and as it is Interpreted by Him, or his Commissioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly;</hi> The Assembly, without the King, is the Church, and the only Judge Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, fit to Interpret, and Explain all Doubts arising upon the Confession of Faith Commanded by his Majesty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly;</hi> Tho' the Law be Interpreted, yet if the Interpretation be dislik'd by Most of the Kingdom; the Body of the Kingdom (for whose Good the Law was made) may crave the lawful Redress of Grievances sustained by that Law. <hi>Take Notice here, that they had already Actually trangress'd the Law (without staying for Leave) and Justifi'd the Doing of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seaventhly;</hi> The Assembly is Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99224:16"/>
either from King, or Parliament, in Matters Ecclesiastical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly;</hi> That the King is to Receive all the Determinations of an Assembly, as a Son of the Church, tho' they be not matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> but only of <hi>Government;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly;</hi> It is Lawful for Subjects to make a Covenant, and Combination Without the King; and to enter into a Bond of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Defence Against the King; and all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever <hi>(tho' against several Acts of Parliament.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly;</hi> It is Lawful for themselves, (sitting in an Assembly) to Indict a New As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, without the King's Consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly;</hi> If Subjects be convented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and Council for any Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour; they may Appeal from the King, and Council to the next General Assembly, and Parliament, if they think either the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or the Good of the Church concern'd in the Matter in Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly;</hi> They do not desire the King to Indict a General Assembly, as needing his Authority, but rather for his Honour, and for the Countenance of their Proceedings:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99224:17"/>
Alledging, that if the Prince shall omit to do his Duty, the People, from whom he had his Power Originally, may Resume it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly;</hi> If the King's Voice shall be deny'd to any thing, tho' never so Vnjust, and Illegal, that shall be carry'd by the Major part of the Assembly, his Majesty is bound <hi>Jure Divino</hi> to enforce Obedience to to those Acts, and the Counsellors, or Judges refusing to Execute, shall be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, and depriv'd of their Places, and Estates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly;</hi> An Assembly may Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Acts of Parliament, and discharge the Subject from Obeying them, if they any way reflect upon the Business of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenthly;</hi> The Protestation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects against Laws Establish'd, either before the Judges of the People, or the People themselves who are born to be Judg'd, doth void all Obedience to those Laws, without ever bringing of them to be discuss'd before a Competent Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixteenthly;</hi> The Major part of the People may do any thing <hi>(they say)</hi> which they Themselves conceive Conducing to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99224:17"/>
Glory of God, and the Good of the Church, any Laws to the Contrary notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

all Solemnity to be Printed, and Publish'd: but at the same time,</hi> his Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and Declarations are said to be Contrary to Law. <hi>pag. 449.</hi> And all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are forbidden any way to Publish, or to Proclaim the same.

And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of That Declaration summ'd up with great Exactness, in his Majesties Answer to it, contracting the Venome of it into These</hi> Six Positions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> That they have an Absolute Power of Declaring the Law; And that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99224:20"/>
they declare to be so, ought not to be question'd, either by King, or People: so that all the Right, and Safety of the Prince, and Subject, depends upon their Pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> That no Presidents can be Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to Bound their Proceedings; which, If so, <hi>The Government of the</hi> Turk <hi>Himself is not so Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That a Parliament may dispose of any thing, wherein the King, or Subject hath a right, for the Publique Good; <hi>(speaking all this While of the Remnant of the Two Houses)</hi> That they, without the King, are This Parliament, and Judge of This Publique Good; and that the King's Consent is not Necessary. So that the Life, and Liberty of the Subject, and all the Good Laws made for their Security, may be dispos'd of, and Repeal'd by the Major Part of Both Houses, at any time present, and by any Wayes, and Means Procured so to be, and his Majesty has no Power to Protect them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> That a Member of either House ought not to be troubled, or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with, for Treason, Felony, or any Other
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99224:21"/>
Crime, without the Cause first brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Them, that they may judge of the Fact, and their Leave obtained to Proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi>; That the Sovereign Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in Both Houses of Parliament. The King has no Negative Voice; and becomes Subject to their Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly;</hi> That the Levying of Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Personal Commands</hi> of the King, (tho' accompany'd with his <hi>Presence</hi>) is not Levying War against the <hi>King:</hi> But to Levy War against his <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> (which they have Power to Declare, and Signifie) is Levying War against the <hi>King;</hi> And that Treason cannot be Committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his <hi>Person,</hi> otherwise than as he is Entrusted with the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and Dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that Trust; and that they have a Power to judge, whether he discharges it or no. <hi>And to justifie their Usurpations, they do maintain,</hi> pag. <hi>270.</hi> That the Kings of This Realm are Oblig'd to pass all such Bills as are Offer'd unto them by Both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It would be superfluous to tell you of their</hi> Proclaiming Fasts, <hi>and Assuming to themselves other</hi> Rights of Sovereignty,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99224:21"/>
                  <hi>under the specious Pretence of a</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>But to shew you that it was All an Imposture: If the</hi> King <hi>will not Agree, the</hi> Two Houses <hi>(they say) may Act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him: If the</hi> Two Houses <hi>Differ, the Sovereignty rests in the</hi> House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>As in the Case of a Bill they sent up to the Lords for Directing a</hi> Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>which they had Fram'd, to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken throughout</hi> England. <hi>This Bill the Lords Rejected; Whereupon, the Commons pass'd this</hi> Vote, That <hi>That House</hi> did conceive that the Protestation made by them is fit to be taken by every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is well Affected in Religion, and to the Good of the Common-Wealth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth declare, That what Person soever shall not take the Protestation, is Vnfit to bear Office in the Church, or Common-Wealth. <hi>And so they order'd the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and Burgesses to send down to the several Places for which they serv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Copies of that Vote of the House con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the</hi> Protestation, <hi>and that the</hi> Vote <hi>should be Printed. They began with a</hi> Contempt <hi>of the Lords; they Lay'd them quite</hi> Aside <hi>at last; and in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99224:22"/>
they</hi> Themselves <hi>were, upon their Own Arguments, Confounded by the</hi> Rabble. <hi>You see the Dominion these People Challenge over their</hi> Master; <hi>and it cannot be expected that they should give any better Quarter to their</hi> Fellow Subjects; <hi>But it is</hi> Their Way <hi>of making</hi> Kings Glorious, <hi>and</hi> Patronizing the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the People.</p>

               <p>You have here from their own Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Acts, (for I cite none of their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets) a Breviate of the Powers they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to themselves over King, and People: And this so Early in the War too, that the Faction was not as yet sure in the Saddle. (For This was all before 1643.) You shall now see the <hi>Execution</hi> of these <hi>Arbitrary Principles</hi> by the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi> of <hi>Both Kingdoms</hi> in their Turns, and you shall Confess that tho' the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of the <hi>Kirk</hi> may serve as a Foil to any <hi>Other Tyranny,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> have yet had the Honour to out-strip their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>According to the Common Method of <hi>Innovatours,</hi> their First Work was, by <hi>Press</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to <hi>Defame</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their Next, was, by Popular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99224:24"/>
to stir up the Multitude by <hi>Tumults</hi> to <hi>Reform</hi> it; and Lastly; (if they found their Party strong enough to Depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to Enter into a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and Set up for themselves. This was the Course that <hi>Knox, Willock</hi> and their Followers took in <hi>Scotland</hi> under the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> in 1555. and afterward, under King <hi>James</hi> VI. And <hi>Cartwright</hi> with his Complices went the same way to Work also under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; only the Conspiracy of <hi>Arthington, Hacket, Coppinger, Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, &amp;c.</hi> was Discover'd, and the Plot Disappointed. But the Libels, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 1637. which led to that Impious <hi>Bond,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> in 1638. had better success. (See his Late Majesties <hi>Large Declaration</hi> upon That Subject.) And after their Pattern, so had the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices in <hi>England</hi> in 1641. when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was so Over-aw'd by <hi>Tumults</hi> that the Vote of the <hi>Two Houses</hi> was no other in Effect than the Sense of the <hi>Rabble</hi> in the <hi>Lobby.</hi> It was but their Bawling for Justice upon the Noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>; their Crying down of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Popish Lords,</hi> and the thing is Done. The Riots
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99224:24"/>
were so Great, that the Lords press'd the Commons at a Conference, to Joyn with them in a Declaration for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of them. But it was Answer'd, saying, <hi>We must not Discourage our Friends, This being a time we must make use of All our Friends. God forbid</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Pim) that the House of Commons should proceed in any way to Dishearten People to obtain their just Desires in such a way</hi>; Exact Collections, <hi>pag.</hi> 532. The <hi>Kirk</hi> would have said, that <hi>they did not know with what Spirit they were Over-Rul'd,</hi> as they told King <hi>James</hi> in the Case of <hi>Gibson,</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering Treason in the Pulpit. The next thing that follow'd in Course, was a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi>; and That shall be the first Point we'l handle in the Common <hi>Practices</hi> of the Party; which in One Word amounts to no less than <hi>the Dissolution</hi> of a <hi>Legal,</hi> and the <hi>Setting</hi> up of a <hi>Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Pretext of the <hi>Scottish Covenant</hi> in 1638. was <hi>the Defence of the King's Majesty, his Person, and Authority in the Defence, and Preservation of the True-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Liberties, and Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> As also <hi>the Mutual Defence, one of another,</hi> against all sorts of Persons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>English Protestation</hi> of 1641. looks the very same way, <hi>viz. for the Maintenance of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>the Power, and Privileges
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99224:26"/>
of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>and Liberty of the</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

               </p>
               <p>So soon as ever they had by these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Appearances decoy'd an Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Part of the Nation into the Net, they Emprov'd the Fraud by Expounding upon all their <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> quite Contrary to the Common Intent, and Acceptation of the same. And made way thereby to the Destruction of all those Interests which the People thought they had Sworn to Preserve. But the Subject was so hamper'd betwixt the Dread of the <hi>Othe,</hi> among those that did not understand the <hi>Nullity</hi> of the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and the Forfeiture of <hi>Life, Fortune,</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> if they should not persue it according to the Oraculous sence of them that Impos'd it, that betwixt their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> their <hi>Safeties,</hi> and <hi>Estates,</hi> they were in a great streight.

               </p>
               <p>After this Hypocrisie in the very <hi>Frame</hi> of their Project, there was but little of Good Faith to be expected in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> of it: And all their <hi>Covenants,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colour of <hi>Reforming</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were both in Construction, and in Effect, but so many Othes for the <hi>Abjuring</hi> of it; and the setting up of a more <hi>Blasphemous Oracle</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> than ever was silenc'd at his taking Flesh upon him by his <hi>Holy Power.</hi> I call their <hi>Covenants, Oracles</hi>; as well in respect of the <hi>Inspiration,</hi> as of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.</hi>

Nay, and all things in the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> carri'd by the Sway of these <hi>Lay-Elders;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that it was a very rare thing to hear a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

                  <hi>(says the Author of it)</hi> and the Decree is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. It can change the very Nature of things; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what is Just, to be Vnjust, and what is Vice, to be Virtue. All Laws are in the Cabinet of its Breast, and it can dispose of Kingdoms, and Empires as it pleases. It makes it a Mortal Sin even to doubt of any part of its Religion; and demands, under pain of Damnation, the Subjection of all Christians to its Authority. That Word of <hi>Reformation</hi> misappli'd, has serv'd it to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie all the Executions, Assassinations, Wars, Massacres, and Devastations, whereby the Discipline hath been Propagated.
