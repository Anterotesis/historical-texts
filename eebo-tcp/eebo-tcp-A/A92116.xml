         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe particulars are too many to
be related at this time concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this laſt nights Ingagement with
the Enemy at Maidſtone, which in
brief was ſuch as never was ſince theſe
VVars began; This Army ſtrugled
with ſo much difficulty to overcome
a ſtubborn and reſolute Enemy: The
Fight begun about Seven of the clock
at night, about a mile from Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
and before we could beat them
from hedge to hedge, and get in at the
Barracado's, it was paſt Nine; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115564:3"/>
we had entred the Town, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed
every ſtreet and turning; they
having Eight pieces of Canon, which
they diſcharged above Twenty times
upon our men in the ſtreets, and by
Gods mighty help and aſsiſtance we
overcame them between twelve and
one of the clock at night, being every
minute in all that time firing upon
their horſe and foot, and they upon
us, it being extreme wet weather du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all this time of Ingagement; we
took about Four hundred priſoners,
and near as many Horſe, our Forlorn-hope
of horſe gave the red Standard
of horſe as gallant a charge as ever
was ſeen, which is ſaid to be General
<hi>Hales</hi> his Troop. The reaſon why
the Ingagement began ſo ſoon, the
Train and the Rear of the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

three miles off (and not come up)
was, that the Forlorn of horſe and
foot being ingaged in viewing the
Town before it was dark, came off
ſafe: The Enemy being with their
whole body of horſe and foot within
two miles on the top of the Hill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Rocheſter all day long in view
of our Army, about Eight thouſand
men, who, as they perceived that we
did not diſpute the paſs at Alsford,
which was very difficult for us to
have done; they ſent in a ſupply of
Twelve hundred horſe and foot to
thoſe before in the town of Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
who came in juſt as we inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
being Seamen, Apprentices, and
moſt part Commanders and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
that have formerly been in arms
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115564:4"/>
againſt the Parliament. There were
in all, as we gueſs, Two hundred then
ſlain in and about the town, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
<hi>Price</hi> a very honeſt and ſtout
Gentleman, Col: <hi>Hewſons</hi> Captain
Lieutenant, was alſo ſlain, and about
thirty more of our men, moſt falling

ſhot; we took Eight pieces, ſix Iron,
and two Braſs, abundance of Arms,
having been up all night, and want of
time cannot ſend more particulars at
preſent: Onely I deſire God to let
you ſee how the old quarrel is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the ſame party, with greater
violence then at firſt. You will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand what Earls, Lords, and
other perſons of quality appeared in
this buſineſs. His Excellency from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115564:4"/>
the firſt minute of Ingagement to the
laſt, could not be drawn off from a
perſonal and hazzardous attendance
on the ſervice, and is much impaired
in his health.</p>
