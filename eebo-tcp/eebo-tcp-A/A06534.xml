         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

al things, burnes al things; yea
enkindles such flames as euen the
Ocean of euils, wherewith the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4178:10"/>
flowes, &amp; aboundes, c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it.
This subtil, actiue, spreading,
and deuouring flame, takes force &amp;
vigour euen from very crosses and
torments themselues, surmounts al
things, cleaues to one God, and with
an inextricable knot is vnited with
him. Whether it be the fire, which
alwayes suffers some-what, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
this or that, I know not; this I am
sure of, that the liuelyer it puts forth
the force it hath, the lesse it yealds to
the enemy, and is the hardlyer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
This fire, when once it takes
on the litle furnace of the hart, good
God! what strange, and how many
heates, of loue enkindles it there!
They only know the excesses of
this vnquiet feauer, who loue IESVS
dearely indeed, &amp; passionately thirst
after him.</p>
               <p>Now shal you see this languishing
hart breake out into frequent, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4178:10"/>
and interrupting sighs, and
now and then heare certayne briefe
interiections withal, cast forth here
and there by the poore soule, lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
with a sweet extasy of loue:
<hi>Tel my beloued,</hi> o blessed spirits, <hi>that
I languish al for loue</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Cant. 5.</note> and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

                  <note n="c" place="bottom">Ester 15.</note> &amp; powerfully susteyne &amp;
hold vp my fleeting soule, I shal
faint at his feet: for now the vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
and feeble pulse euen mortally
beates, and now my face is fouly
dight with an asky and deadly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the extatical heat now wholy
wastes the marrow, so as now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes
in me nothing which suffers
not of this fire.</p>
               <p>But anon you wil wonder to see
that hart excited with the same loue
of God, resuming as it were new
strength, to be sodainly caryed and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4178:11"/>
snacht with violence into the thing
beloued. <hi>I wil rise,</hi> said the Spouse
extreamly enamoured with her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
<hi>I wil compasse the Citty, through
streets and lanes, I wil seeke whom my
soule loues</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">Cant. 3.</note>; nor wil I giue ouer til
obteyning my desire I take hold of
him. I wil enquire of created things,
&amp; aske them, where is my God? I wil
seeke and perticularly demand of al;
nor wil I truely rest satisfyed finding
some image only of God in them su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
shadowed, or discouering
but a glimmer only of diuine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for these wil but excite my
thirst, not quenh it wholy; but I wil
hunt further and constantly seeke
him, <hi>whom my soules loues</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="bottom">Cant. 1.</note>. For
the hart enflamed with loue, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
machinates &amp; workes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
nor hath diuine loue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be idle: it is alwayes in action,
and stil proceedes from vertue to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4178:11"/>
vertue, and if it rest at any tyme,
and seeme but to sabothize, it is no
longer diuine loue<note n="f" place="bottom">Greg. Hom. 30. in Euang.</note>.</p>
               <p>Amidst these symptomes of this
disease, the mind obteynes three
things, and proues them in it-selfe:
for first, how much soeuer it occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes
it-self in difficult things, and
seriously attends, to its owne abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to a perfect cont<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ept of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, to represse vntamed and
vnbridled appetites, yet al these acts,
most worthy and heroical, it puts in
the last place, yea when it workes
and effects the most, thinks it hath
done as good as nothing, and
lastly accounts the tyme so long
spent in the lists of vertue to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
short, which euen the sacred
Scriptures record of the Patriarch
<hi>Iacob,</hi> whom the beauty and loue of
the faire <hi>Rachel</hi> had so taken &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled,
as he reckoned yeares very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4178:12"/>
tedious for toyles, as weekes for
dayes, dayes for moments<note n="g" place="bottom">Gen. 29.</note>. I haue
yet said but litle: The hart which is
enamoured with IESVS, thinks it
cannot be broken or tamed with
anything, and therefore dares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
euen death it-self, &amp; chalenge
it to a single fight, as not his match,
to scorne its weapons, and not so
only, but insolently to insult vpon
this pale Goddesse, who yet is she
which tramples the Crownes and
Scepters of Kings and <hi>Caesars,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues
the armed <hi>Sampsons</hi> and layes
them at her foot, forbids the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>

hart is so impatient of rest, delayes,
al things, as while most ardently it
loues and seekes the onelie IESVS,
and groanes after him, it holds a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4178:12"/>
for a yeare, regards not any
thing els, nothing likes, nothing
pleaseth, nothing satiates or recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
a whit, as to whom, besides IESVS,
al things are nauseous and but drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
vnto it. Lastly, for his sake, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whom it sighes and languishes
with the heat of thirsting loue, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

pleasures, and the filthy mire of the

three parth with it, whereof the first
the mind, is to be seen in the vpper

the omnipotency to be seen
and worshiped in the gouern'ment
of them the highest wisdome, and
the infinit goodnes in the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The interiour part of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
is the other portion of the hart,
the wil; and here that infinit either
goodnes, or beauty aboue al things,
exhibits it-self most amiable. Lastly
for the out most face of the whole

of this T<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eple, the hart I meane
deuoted vnto God, is performed with
the same ceremonies, our Temples
rightly dedicated are. The manner
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4178:14"/>
of sanctifying Temples is, to strew
the pauements al with ashes; to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige
twelue Crosses on the wal; to
burne as many tapers set before
them, to haue water blessed after
the solemne formulary of Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in the Ashes sprinckled
on the ground, the Greeke &amp; Latine
Alphabet scored out. So his hart
that would be the Oratory of the
God-head, should first be imbued
with humility and the knowledge
of his owne nothing; be illustrated
with excellent faith, signed with
the loue of the Crosse and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as wel inward as outward,
be instructed by the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> and

waters of diuine graces.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Point</hi> Now then the hart thus
dedicated, with so many, and so chast
ceremonies, is so in the power and

worship of the diuinity, as hereafter
without a great sacriledge, and a

ennoble soules, being cleansed with
that purple to wash their robes, to
make them fit and apt, that crowned
with victorious laurels they may
eternally triumph, with the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate

               <p>Take therefore O IESVS, loue
of my soule, from this infinit bath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4178:53"/>
of thine some few little drops, at
least, and sprinckle thy Sanctuary
therewith, I say, the ample field of
my hart; whose shure possessi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, thou
hast taken to thy self long since. But
you, O smitting Angels, goe farre
away hence, the house is marked
already, the signes of Tau is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

for where this marke is seen, it is a

my IESVS dearely beloued, with
<hi>Dauids</hi> feruour, I could pray and
obtaine this fauour at thy hands.</p>
               <p>Lord blot out my iniquities, wash me
yet more from my wickednes, purge me of
my sinne. Thou shalt, sprinckle me with
ysop, and I shal be cleane, thou shalt
wash me, and I shal be whiter then the
snow. Turne away thy face from my
sinnes; and blot out al my iniquities.
Create in me, O God, a cleane hart, and
renew a right spirit in my bowels.<note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 50,</note>

Let there be no corner, I beseech
thee, which thou purgest not no
portion of my soule, which thou
blessest not with the fruit of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
bloud. The swallow with her
owne bloud restotes sight to her
bling yong ones. The bloud of a
Goat expels al manner of poyson.
Againe, the bloud of doues, let forth
beneath the wings, quickens the
dulled species of the eyes: nor is it fit
my God, nor iust that from thy
precious bloud, my hart should not
feel likewise the same effects. The
bloud of victimes shed from the
sacrificed Holocausts, bred no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
nor stench, nor flyes, that
sordid creature, but rather eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n
destroyed those importune and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

                  <note n="c" place="bottom">Gen. 35.</note> offered vp by <hi>Iacob,</hi> they say, was

watched a Lyon, very exquisitly
wrought, the truest symbol of regal
Maiesty; and likewise for the people
beneath in the midst of the Temple
he erected a very eminent and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
Chapel. And so to thee Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
God; the heauen is a Throne the
earth a foot-stoole. For thou sit'st
(as sacred scriptures<note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 17.</note> tel) vpon
the wings of Cherubins, whence
thou giuest Oracles, prescribest lawes
to the world; and euen with the only
looke, maiesty, and state, becomst
most terrible to the haughtiest mids.
Hence thou exactst iust punishments
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4178:59"/>
from the damned: hence thou ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briatst
the blessed Citizens of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
with the nectaral honey of thy
goodnes: lastly hence thou carrousest
cups mingled with the gal of iustice,
and honey of pure goodnes, to the
earth, suspended betweene heauen
and hel. Besides in the triumphant
Church the celestial spirits, whom
we cal Thrones, are thy royal seat;
and in the militant, the sacred Altar
is thy lodging chamber, where thou
sweetly takest thy rest.</p>
               <p>But nothing is thine owne so much
or due vnto thee, with a better title,
then the hart of man, which with
a low abasement of thy self, and a
singular obedience to thy father,
thou hast lawfully recouered and
bought with the price of immense
labour and paynes; yea redeemed
with thy bloud, &amp; a shameful death
on the Crosse. Here, o pacifical

thou swayst in that manner, as there

carnal concupiscence, sweetnest the
acerbity of labours. And, (O most
happy kind of gouernment!) thou
alone sufficiently sillest the whole

trayne of heauenly Citizens which
thy retinew or Court can neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

Now the steps by which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

endure thy aspect. There thou

giuest precepts, and art presently
obeyed; commaundst, and thy

Angels themselues, euen the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins

wel enough, this litle region to be
properly thine, so only made for

please or satiate the hart; grown

with any owner, vnles thou fix
the seat of thy kingdome in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts.
If thou beest present with
it desires no more; if absent, come
in al created things at once, &amp; wooe
it neuer so much, there wil yet be
place enough for more. If thou getst
from thence, al felicity departs with
thee: if thou abidest, al beatitude
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4178:61"/>
comes sodainly thither. Raigne the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
and eternally raigne in my

motions of perturbations, nor euer
suffer the vnhappy hart; to thrust
the King out of his seat; then which
cannot happen a greater disastre to
it. Nor suffer I say, o darling and
delight of my hart, that one hart
should be shared into many parts.
For thou sufferest no riual. Oh
suffer it not euer to be enticed with
the allurements of worldly pleasure,
which gate being once set open, I
see how easily the enemy wil rush
in. Be thou to it a brazen, yea, a wal

               <p>Goe on heauenly Artificer, now

that tragedy publish their wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and miserable condition. So
exhibit the whole, as I may seeme

the darknes self as with the finger,
feele the gnashing of teeth, heare
the horrible blasphemies, their cries,
their pathes, their flegme which in
vaine they cast forth against God,
their bans and cursings, wherewith
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4178:74"/>
they cruelly teare one another, that
being astonished with the sight of

thy mercies,<note n="b" place="bottom">Psal. 88.</note> which hath held me

inspire an odoriferous soule into the

rising somewhat higher, from the

in forme of a siluer cup, shewes

Or are we mocked the
white? I heare me-thinke a lute,
the harpe playes, the flutes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
wind, a whole Quire is kept in
the hart; and if I be not deceiued it
is a song of three parts; they seeme
to play according to the number of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4178:90"/>
the musitians that play. For the
Angels here of th'one side, though
they vse diuers instruments; yet soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
but one thing seeme to play
but one part; then IESVS the skilful
and most exquisit Musitian tunes
his voyce, and beares his part; lastly
the hart hath his. For amidst these
numbers it sings and dances al at
once. How quaintly and aptly the
strings, wind instruments, and voyce
al agree: With how admirable a
pleasure the numbers quauer and
iump with al. But then how noble a
Hymne is sung the while how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
&amp; elegant IESVS stands in the
midst, not only a singer, but as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
of the Quire also with a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
rod in hand now lifted vp, and
then let fal; keeping the time, and
ordering the key and ayr of the
whole song. If you aske me the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4178:91"/>

a goe, when he sayd: <hi>I wil chant the
mercies of the Lord for euer.</hi> For to this
purpose IESVS the prime Christ,
records his ancient loues to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
hart, &amp; now mixing with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
skil flats with sharps, sharps
with flats, the tenour with the base, &amp;
running diuersly diuisions he touches
with a sweet reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance now vvith
a moderate, novv remisse, now slow,
and novv vvith a quick voyce, the
innumerable number of his benefits
vvhere-vvith heretofore he hath
vvooed the hart: Wherefore recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
things in this manner, novv he
stirres vp pious desires, vvhich he
had often enkindled before, novv
vvith a grauer tone, he exaggerats
the horrid feares of sinnes, and hel,
vvhich he not rarely had inculcated
heretofore, and novv againe vvith
a sharper streyne of the voyce, cal he
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4178:91"/>
to mind the liuely and sudden im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of compunction for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the agitations and excitations,
of the mind, determining a change
of life, nevv vndertakings of great
things, heroical entreprises, and a
thousand other of the sort; vvith
vvhich diuine loue is vvont to play
and dully in the harts of louers.
Meane vvhile the Angels tune their
instruments and strings to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and while themselues for asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
cannot open the mouth
or expresse a word; they betake
them to their instruments, and apply
al the industry and art they haue to
play vpon them, and with a sacred
silence, tacitly admire the diuine
mercy towards men, and euen with
the gesture of this dumb admiration
most vehemently stirre vp and incite
themselues to magnify and extol the
praises of God to the Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s! whose

manner is and cheife delight, to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
mortals from the iawes of hel,
to put the burning coles of diuine

to extinguish the flames of libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

cast of the eye, as with a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt
to ruine and depresse the proud
and haughty and for the humble
and modest, with the only beck of
his wil to raise them sudenly. But
what doth the hart while, in whose
musike roame is al this harmony
made? Now it dilates it-self, now
contracts, now it riseth, now fals,
it feares, it hapes, it loues, it hates,
it composeth and wholy frames it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and al it's appetites to the rules,

               <p>Then truly it obserues and clearly

another sings outrage in's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:

flatter, as <hi>Syrens,</hi> some with singing
to plot and coner guile and deceit
Thus are al the songs of the world
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4178:93"/>
but a hydeous and tumultuous noise,
no harmony; inarticulate and hoarse
murmurs, no musike; or if a harmony
it be, it dulles truly as wel the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

among tumults, nor tranquility, nor
calmes, amidst the black, &amp; hydeous
stormes and tempests of malice.
Whereas on the contrary, heauenly
musike delights the hart, wipes
away troubles and tediousnes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the euil motions of the sick
mind, repels the force of the enemies
lastly puts Sathan to flight, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

               <p>THe heauenly <hi>Dauid</hi> in the midst

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4178:97"/>
This sound, beleeue me, wil banish
Sathan, and throughly purge away
melancholy, that grateful seat of the
wicked Genius.</p>
               <p>But why the harp (most sweet
IESVS) rather then another? Yet
should I thinke thou takest it not
by chaunce: Vnles perhaps it be
that the forme and sound of this
Instrument. Ah! thou wouldst pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that figure which in mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary
thou actedst so long a goe; play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chorus of that sad Tragedy,
in the publike Theater of Heauen &amp;
earth, in view of al? Ah, now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how thine armes and feet
were then stretched forth on the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
as in the harp the strings are
wont. How stiff were then the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and sinewes of the whole body:
But here loue playes the harper, and
yealds so forth a sound most like the
harp, reaching farr and wide, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4178:98"/>
farre I say, as the highest, midle, &amp;
nether orb extend heauen, earth, &amp;
hel. Sathan felt thee harper, and
maugre al his power was constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to compresse his foaming anger,
and bridle his implicable fury. Death
lurking at the gates of hel, felt the
fatal point of his dart (being no
lesse then sinne) to be sudenly reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But with vs now at the sound
of his harp, the rocks being riu'd &amp;
split, began to fly asunder, harts
harder then adamants to soften,
wicked men touched with the prick
of conscience to confesse their cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
to knock their breast, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
seat of the penitent mind, and
to giue forth these words, most ful
of compunction, <hi>Truly the Sonne of

               </p>
               <p>Yea the sound went vp to Heauen
also; and sudenly stayed so the hand
of the diuine <hi>Nemesis,</hi> menacing

eternal ruine and calamity to men,
and now ready stretched forth to
make a ful reuenge of al, as that by

vnarmed, and now as the case were
altered quite hath giuen place to
mercy, which hitherto had layne
hid.</p>
               <p>But why doe I cal these things to
memory? who knowes my hony
IESVS, whether, with this harp
thou playest not some-what els?
What? I know not Vnles perhaps
with this sweet harmony of strings
thou, wouldst signify the sweetest
and sincerest pleasures, wherewith
thou woest and courtst the harts of
pious men. For who are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

with the irksomnes and tediousnes
of a wretched and miserable life?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4178:99"/>
And for that we seely men, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

               <p>Therefore, o my hart, listen I
pray, and when thou hearest the
voice of thy God, anon being struck
as it were and smil, giue a sound
with al, and attemper and ply thy

But especially lend thine empty ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
to the most sweet ditty of the
diuine Harper: who sweetly allures
thee a farre of, and neerer hand puls

<hi>Come,</hi> for so he sings, <hi>come my freind

dye, is the thorny crowne of the most
louing IESVS; for this sticks so
deep into the crowne of the sacred
head of the Spouse, as none may pul

firme peace: and therefore wil I sing
with the most holy <hi>Iob: I wil dye in my
nest, and like to the Palme wil multiply
my dayes.</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">Iob. 39.</note> And I wil alwayes

                     <p>2. <hi>Point.</hi> The bed wherein IESVS
loues to rest, is the hart of pious
men, and dedicated to his loue. If
IESVS lodge but there, though
he sleep the while, al things goe
wel and rest quietly; and it were to
no purpose to feare any winds, stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
or thunders there. For the

of Martyrs, makes them so generous

the torments of fire, and water: and
no meruail; for while IESVS takes
but his rest there, he giues them rest.

when <hi>Moyses</hi> heretofore ascended on

God in stony tables<note n="b" place="bottom">Exod. 29.</note> the people
beheld al the place to be set on fire

O fires and liuing flames euen in the
midst of flouds of waters! This is
the fire which encloses the hart so,
and sends forth such radiant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent
rayes, as banishing al dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
al things shine and burne both
within and without. Of this lamp
mercy is the oyl; and that truly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
as flowing from an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible

God. This is that wal of fire, which
God had prouised by the Prophet,

who should once goe about to set

of al these wonders, this is most to
be wondred at, that as the greene
bush amidst the purest flames did
burne vntouched<note n="h" place="bottom">Exod. 2.</note> and impeached
a whit, and God himself was heard

vp to heauen. Goe to then, come

The ayr repurged shal sauour sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the threats and rage of Deuils
shal expire; for indeed they can
no more endure these odours, the

breath exhaling from the sweetest

they be enforced to fly away, and
returne againe into the immost and
most hidden receptacles of Hel.</p>
               <p>This is the fire, this the flame,
which quenches the heat of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence;
for as one nayle driues out
another, so the fire of diuine loue
expels and represseth the libidinous
flames of base and carnal loues.</p>
               <p>Burne therefore my hart, o IESV,
the dearling of my soule, and let not
the oile of the lamp be euer wanting:
be this fire as a wal vnto me;<note n="i" place="bottom">Zach. 2.</note> be it
as a sunne, and be this my chiefest
ambition, that I burne and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed

with this flame: Yea, and be
reduced into ashes; then those ashes
into a litle worme, and presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a new hart. O Metamorphosis
of loue! But first would I haue the
old be throughly tryed, in the litle
furnace of his loue, the drosse, and
al the dregs to be scoured thence,
and no humane and terrene lees to
be left behind, but meerly to take
a heauenly state vpon it: to liue a
spiritual life, to feed on spiritual food
to vse a spiritual tongue, to haue spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
feet and hands; yea diuine
cogitations and affections, &amp; not
done by aspects only, but euen
Angelical. In summe may this hart,
thus purged and purified, giue forth
hereafter naught but a liuely and
euerlasting figure of a blessed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
So then doe thou my

Draw I say these ancient cruel

and tamed wel loaden with cheines
and reproaches, before the oual and
triumphant chariot, that is, the rich
bootyes, noble spoyles, ample tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheyes
and victories atcheiued in
many warres. But especially haue
care that sensuality aboue the rest,
the chiefest part of the triumph, be
tyed and bound to the Chariot,
which with an heroical fortitude
thou hast conquered, &amp; made more
like indeed to a dead then a liuing
thing, pale, meagre and of so feeble
forces as it may neuer after dare to
appeare in the field, or make any
resistance.</p>
               <p>But now in warlike standards and
enseignes let the cityes and towers,
which thou hast ouer-throwne, be
painted; which kind, let the mad
tower be first set downe, which thou
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4178:126"/>
had leueld with the ground, and let
al the complices and confederates
thereof, subdued and braught vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoke,
and so cheyned together be
led, as ambition, vanity, arrogance,
and the rest of those military troops.
Let another banner exhibit the
bloudy warres, to be read which
thou hast valiantly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, faught,
and the victoryes nobly atchiued
against luxury and rebellion of the
senses. Let those gallant exploits be
wouen here in silke, and waued in
banners, vp and downe through the
ayr as thou passest,; wherewith thou
hast mastered and tamed thy flesh,
that fierce and cruel beast. Let the
inuincible courage of thy mind be
here seen and read, as fasts, abstinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
austerities mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,

               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:4178:127"/>
Let the Stygian <hi>Pluto</hi> also, that
damned loue of riches, be caryed in
an other flag; whom long since thou

religious pouerty before al the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

then al these to be called in

the weding the Spouse or Wife of

of his bed and bord, companion
of his throne &amp; crowne. And this is
that honour if I be not deceiued,
which the Prophet Esay meanes:<note n="d" place="bottom">Isa. 56.</note>
                  <hi>I wil giue then a place in my house, and
within my wals; and a better name then
sonns and daughters.</hi> For children being
but a slender part or portion of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
chalenge and retayne indeed
much of their right and substance
from them: but for man and wife, so
great is the society and community
between them of their whole life &amp;
of al their goods and titles, and they
are bound together with so streight
a tye, as how farre so euer they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
yet are held to be as is were
in one place, and al one, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
also in the celestial wedlock of
IESVS with the soule. <hi>For who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heares
to God is in al one spirit with him,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:4178:132"/>
as the Apostle<note n="e" place="bottom">1. Cor. 6.</note> hath taught.
Whence it is, that the soule perfectly
vnited with God, is not only diuine,
but in a certaine manner (if I may
so say) is made God. And hence is
al (whatsoeuer it is, which is surely
very great) that dignity; profit, and
sweetnes of these nuptials. For looke
whatsoeuer els besides haue any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with them, doe al euen flow
from thence, as from an endlesse
spring of al good and beatitudes; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
those three, (to say nothing
of those of the body] to wit, the most
singular and eminent dotes of the
soule espoused &amp; wedded to IESVS,
as Vision, Comprehension, Fruition:
<note n="f" place="bottom">S. Tho. 1. 2. q. 4. ar. 3.</note> Which are not procured her ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is wont when they match with any

their beloued Spouses, by reason of

But in reguard these things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

fruits thereof, with the pleasant and
most apt figure (for our capacity)
of royal nuptials, and a wedding
supper.<note n="g" place="bottom">Luc. 14. Mar. 22.</note> The reason is, for that
no noises of affaires &amp; negotiations,
nor cares, which commonly fal out
by day, doe not trouble or disturb
the peace and delights of suppers; &amp;
for the feasts of royal Nuptials, they
vse especially to be very curious and
dainty indeed, where no part of the
senses abounds not with exquisite
delights. Here the eyes are fed with
various Emblems of the tapistries of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4178:133"/>
the Hal most gallant to behold, with
the gorgeous apparel of the Ghests
and waiters also, with the gold of
the plates, and iewels of the whole
furniture there. Here the eares are
charmed with the artificious harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of musical instruments &amp; voyces.
Here the sent most sweetly is perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the delicate odours of
flowers and herbs, and boxes ful of
the sweetest oyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: the palat sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned

with the greatest study and
industry; and sought for farre and
neere by al the exquisit meanes that
may be deuised, and dressed especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the rarest Cookes. Lastly, to
the end the sense of feeling, the most
brutish sense of al the rest, might not
want it's peculiar delights also, the
touching hath its proper delectation,
from the softnes of downy beds, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4178:134"/>
curious carpets, from the feathers,
and downe of swans and the like.
Let vs runne ouer a while, if you
please, the gardens &amp; pictures of the
great <hi>Assuerus,</hi> that from that feast,
the royallest perhaps that euer was in
the memory of men, by ghesse at least
we may gather in some manner, what
a ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet it is, which IESVS furnisheth
forth in the hart of his Spouse.</p>
               <p>He then, as wel, to shew the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the glory of his Kingdome,
and the greatnes and the ostentation

though indeed I should thinke it
rather to be no more then a meere
exaggeration of insolent men, who
extending their bounds a litle wider,
vse to flatter themselues with the
Empire streight of the whole world:
But be it so as they boast of &amp; make
their braggs, Assuerus yet shal seem
but a fly compared with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
nor euer shal though he pusse
vp himself neuer so much, ariue to
the bulke and worth of an Elephant.
IESVS, the Master of this feast,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:4178:135"/>
not only as God, but euen also as
man, is the Soueraigne &amp; supreame
Lord of al things, in whose loynes
is written King of Kings, and Lord

<hi>Assuerus</hi> himself appeare one day,
yea tremble and groane the while.
The rest may likewise be gathered

                  <hi>Susa</hi> was not the head-Citty of

and most delicious <hi>Tempe,</hi> which
that riuer <hi>Coaspes</hi> washed as it went
a long; whose waters Kings, and

made vse of for daintyest drink: and

the Spring especially as we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
Here not only the pleasant
variety of flowers and herbs made a

whereof in checker-wise, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
the allyes, walks, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the royal hands themselues,

trow you was the rest of the garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this festiual Court Where
the Pauilions were of a costly and
rich stuffe; of cerulean, aetherean,
and of the colour of the Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth,
whose curteynes hung with

teares to him were of familiar as

more frequently then teares, yea
teares themselues were food vnto
him; so as oppressed with dolours
neither would he take his food, or
so much as thinke thereof; while to
him thus vehemently thirsting after
the presence of God, this gibing
taunt was obbrayded to his face,
