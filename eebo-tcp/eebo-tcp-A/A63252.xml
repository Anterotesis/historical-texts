         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Memory of Good men ought not to be
buried in Silence, but that men by reading
their Heroick Actions may be stirred up to an
Emulation of Vertue; so the Remembrance
of the Wicked should not be forgotten, that
men by reading the punishments of vicious
livers, might be deterred from the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of lewd actions: And herein examples work more with
the People than Precepts; especially when men eminently
known come to be examples of Justice: For the terrours of
Punishment works more with many to deter them from vice,
than the promises of reward doth excite others to the persuit
of virtue. To this end is the life of this person set forth, that
others by his Extravagancies, and the evil effects attending
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43071:3"/>
thereon, may learn Sobriety, and to live a regular and well
order'd life. In the persuit of our intended design, we shall
avoid all unnecessary impertinencies, and with as much brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as may be, declare to the World, what are known to be
verities concerning the whole progresse of his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
and herein we are resolved to steer an even course,
neither swerving to the one hand nor the other, for favour or
envy; that so avoiding this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charyblis,</hi> our Relation of
him may find free acceptance with all people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JAmes Turner</hi> (commonly called or known by the name
of Capt. or Col. <hi>Turner)</hi> was born about the year
of our Redemption 1608. He was the Son of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Divine, Minister of <hi>Hadley</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> not
far from <hi>Barnet,</hi> of which he was Parson above 40.
years, being a Divine of the Primitive stamp and temper,
that expressed his Faith by his Works; a friend to the Poor, a
Mediator in any differences among the rich, eyes to the blind,
and feet to the lame; in short (according to his ability) none
more forward in good works then he. This his Son, <hi>Iames Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
he brought up to School for the attainment of some suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in Learning, where he first began to show his pranks,
which were so unhandsome, that his very Schoolfellowes took
such a dislike of him, that as much as in them lay they shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his Company.</p>
            <p>Afterwards for his future fortune, he bound him an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to a Sempster (or one that sells Linnen Clothes ready
made) at the lower end of <hi>Cheaspside,</hi> neer the <hi>Mitre</hi>-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;
which time he served, though with much regret to his
Neighbours, who likewise by reason of his unlucky actions had
ever an evil opinion of him.</p>
            <p>For, to relate to the mad Figgaries he had during his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship,
would of themselves make up a sufficient Volume;
no unhappy action done, wherein he had not a hand, if he
were not a principal; yet was he always so cunning to carry on
his businesse, that his extravagancies were by his Master rather
deemed youthful excursions, or harmlesse Figgaries, then any
innate mischief, or wilful acting of what was bad, though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43071:3"/>
others of his Neighbours had a contary opinion, and by a bloody
morning did foretell a dismal afternoon.</p>
            <p>His Time being out, he married a Gentlemans Daughter
of <hi>Shaston</hi> in <hi>Dorset-shire,</hi> one of the <hi>Foyles,</hi> a Family of good
account in that Country; Afterwards he set up for himself in the
<hi>Round Court</hi> in St. <hi>Martins le Grand</hi> neer the <hi>Shoo-makers,</hi>
which Trade he continued for some short time: but the small
profit redounding from a private shop, was not correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
agreeing with those high Chymera's his vast imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
had prompted unto him; and his ambition soaring a
higher pitch, he resolved to throw his Chance in Fortunes Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
The Times then suited well to his purpose, being
those fatal dayes wherein the Nation was engaged in an unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Civil War; and first (as nearest) he sought to ingratiate
himself into the Parliaments side, endevouring an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under them, and was very active to promote his own
interest, thinking by taking up Arms to have brought him to
have wound himself out of many troubles, which his
litigious nature, and vexatious spirit had brought him to:
But a turbulent person hath many enemies, who prevailed so
far that he was in danger to have been taken by the Officers and
Serjeants at Arms, so that he was forced to make a Virtue of
Necessity, and abandoning <hi>London,</hi> for the amendment of his
fortunes, to turn Royalist.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II. His Actions in the Army, with some mad frolicks which
he committed.</head>
            <p>HIs first appearance in the Kings Army was very low
accompanied onely with three or four Companions. But
being a <hi>Londoner,</hi> he was the more welcome; and having
gotten a Commission, he made use of his wits to raise a Troop,
Commanding many of the Country-men who lived in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
to ride with him to <hi>New-Castle,</hi> which they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43071:4"/>
unto, upon promise they should not stay above three or
four dayes; where getting Amunition for a whole Troop, he
became a Captain under the Marquesse of <hi>New-Castle.</hi> In
which Military condition he continued four years, during
which space of time we cannot greatly applaud his
Manhood, for we hear of no wonders performed by him, nor
was his courage so great, but that (I conceive) the Iliads of
his valour might be comprized in a Nutshel. His chiefest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
consisting in plundering, for which he was called <hi>The
Plunderer of the North.</hi> In which action being very busy, one
day in a Town in the <hi>North,</hi> a Party of the Parliament Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
came in, who was so busie at his work, that had not one
cryed to him, Col. <hi>Turner,</hi> Col. <hi>Turner;</hi> he had been taken:
So that for his refuge, he was forced to run, and that with all
the speed he could; yet did he receive one shot in the Neck,
which was all the wounds he could ever boast of.</p>
            <p>One thing very remarkable is commonly reported of him;
namely, that during his command, he sent a Warrant to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
to provide Quarters for him and his men, and over
and above for himself in particular a handsome Lasse: the
Constable was willing to obey him in the one, but having not
such a command as Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> could not tell how to satisfie
him in the other; whereupon he was threatned to be hanged,
and being of a foolish temerity, to avoid what was afterwards
the destiny of the Captain, he permitted him the enjoyment
of his own Wife, whom he kept three or four dayes; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
(as being contrary to the Rules of War) he was
called to an accompt for it, when to justifie himself, he sent
for the Constables Wife (whom he belike, had so pleased) that
she cleared him of any incivility to her, before the Council of
War.
<q>
                  <l>Thus Women (if they list) can hide mens crime,</l>
                  <l>And none shall er'e be hang'd before their time.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But one exploit he used much to boast of, which we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
leaving the Reader to believe as he pleases; namely,
That he being with Paarty of men gathering of Contribution
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43071:4"/>
neer to <hi>Newberry,</hi> he was set upon by a party of the enemies
Horse, of far greater number then they were: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his order, making fast their Bags to the Bowes of their
Saddles, (which proved a defence to their Belly and Groyns)
he gave them a desperate Charge, and very manfully hacked
their way out quite thorough the Enemy, both men and money
coming safely off to <hi>Wallingford-Castle.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus some can boast, although they make a Lye on't:</l>
                  <l>For evermore the Knight must beat the Gyant.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewise reported that in a Skirmish betwixt some small
Parties neer <hi>Stevenage</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> he was beaten and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisoner; when for his Ransome he gave a ring with a
Stone in it, which he said was worth 100 <hi>l.</hi> but the Victor
afterwards found it worth no more then 5 <hi>s.</hi> But this Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montade
humour was not so much to be blamed in him, it being
for his liberty.</p>
            <p>During this War he had plundered and laid up much money
for his future occasions, whereas the other Royalists in stead
of getting, lost almost all they had; here we may commend
his providence, though we must condemn his Conscience,
in plundering for his private gain his own Countrey
people.</p>
            <p>The War now being expired, he with several other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
for some facts they had committed, were kept Prisoners
at <hi>York,</hi> their crimes were some Misdemeanors during the War,
all the Gentlemen saving only <hi>Turner</hi> pleaded Not guily, but
he (whose Indictments were said to be no lesse then 65. he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
telling the Judge, <hi>That if he staid one hour longer there would
be no less then</hi> 99. pleaded Guilty, and the day of his Tryal had
as many dishes of meat as there were Indictments against him,
all carried up in sight of the Court, and at withal laid a wager
of five pounds he should be hanged that Assizes: Being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Reason therefore; he said, <hi>If he lived he did not
value the five pound, and if he dyed it would serve to buy Gloves
and Ribbons for his friends;</hi> which frolick together with his
Plea to the Jury, <hi>viz, Whether they would not have done the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43071:5"/>
same if they had been under the like command?</hi> brought him off
clear without the least Fine or Damage: Whereas, the other
Gentlemen, who pleaded, Not Guilty, and stood to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Cause by Disproof of Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were by
the Jury found guilty, and lost their lives.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Turner's returning to London, his wayes to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of the great port he lived in.</head>
            <p>SOon after this, he returned again to <hi>London,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in vain to strive against the stream, he resolved for
his profit, to have a seeming Complyance with the adverse
party, sitting amongst the Committees of <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdashers-Hall,</hi>
upon Compositions for Delinquents Estates;
but those Foxes were too cunning to be deceived, and the
place of such great profit, as it was coveted after by some
of their own Gang, and he being known to have been one of
the other side, he was forced to abandon that employment
quite.</p>
            <p>Thus did he run divisions like a dog in a halter, for his
active spirit would never be at rest, well knowing that Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is the Mother of Poverty, and having gotten some
small store of money formerly in the Army, he spared for no
cost either of Clothes or otherwise, to bear a port equal to
the best; and having thereby screwed himself into the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of some men of good account, he pretended to a great
perfection of Skill in all Affairs: And first he began to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
poor mens Causes, whose charges he disbursed out of his
own pocket, which won him very high Commendations,
and was very acceptable to injured people, who very much
applauded him for it.</p>
            <p>This brought him into more employment amongst the great
ones, so that what hetwixt Broaking and Solliciting he grew
very famous, and withal got store of money, for the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43071:5"/>
of some people is so given to contention, that they will
do no right, nor suffer any wrong; and where such Seeds of
Division are sown, there the Lawyers reap golden Harvests.
So that now he flaunts it with the bravest, Taverns and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
are daily frequented, rich and costly garments provided,
high prized Jewels daily worn, not a dinner could be made
under seven or eight several dishes of meat, nor the least
journey gone without a Coach: Yea, nothing wanted which
might conduce to an outward happinesse. And that he might
be the more taken notice of, he kept a high prized Gelding,
with which he ambled up and down the City, and was so bold,
that upon the Kings most happy Restauration, when the Lords
and Gentry went to meet him, he thrust himself into the
company of the Barons, riding most sumptuously in his Foot
Cloth, attended by his Foot-boy; but being known by the
Marshal, that it was only the Asse that marched in the Lyons
Skin, he was by him sufficiently Cane'd for his audacious bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Yet notwithstanding this Check, he always afterwards
kept up a stately port, so that none was more notice taken of
then he, for had he come by in his Coach (as he often did) in
the night, upon Col. <hi>Turners</hi> name, the very Watchmen
would tremble, whom yet he would often reward with
money: but his terrible Oaths, being so habitu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

would make a good Christian quake to hear him. But
though his Vices were very great, yet had he many things in
him worthy of commendation, being very charitable to poor
distressed Cavaliers, whom he would entertain at his own
Table, and if it were his Chance to be in their Company
with him at Taverns, he would pay their share out of his own
pocket, and lend them money besides.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto no great blemishes were lay'd on his practice,
which now began to be very great, being acquainted with most
of the monyed men in <hi>London:</hi> His frequent dealings were in
the sales of Lands decreed in Chancery, and the recovery of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43071:6"/>
Right and Title to Lands unjustly holden from the true heirs:
In which he had such a multitude of businesse, that he kept two
Clerks constantly a writing, or running about his businesse.
He also dealt very much in Jewels, by the sale and bartering
of which to persons of quality he gained exceedingly, so that
his incomes were valued at seven or eight hundred pound
a year; yet by reason of his extravagancies we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he laid up much for his posterity.</p>
            <p>But in prosecution of his Designs he met with many oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
particularly one <hi>Batchelor,</hi> who lived neer <hi>Fenchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi>
who having (as he thought) received some wrong
from Collonel <hi>Turner,</hi> got a friend of his to Write a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
against him, wherein amongst other base passages this
was one, <hi>viz. This same</hi> Turner <hi>was Knighted in the Field
for slaying, killing, and undoing the good and well
affected People of this Nation; a most dangerous and active
fellow, and for his Services so rewarded,</hi> &amp;c. This he did
out of revenge to render him obnoxious to the Usurper, though
it proved rather to his Reputation, he himself taking great
delight in the repetition of it; nor would ever contradict it,
but would say, <hi>If he had an Estate of Lands and value, he
would soon be a Knight; but his Condition as a Broker, and

            <head>CHAP. IV. Some conjectural Misdemeanours of Mr. Turner, with
some other mad frolicks performed by him.</head>
            <p>SEveral other matters are by common report laid to his
charge, <hi>viz.</hi> that one Mr. <hi>Clench</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> having
occasions for money, borrowed 400 <hi>l.</hi> upon a Farm called
<hi>Bendish</hi> in that County, and made use of Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> for the
procuring of it; who pretended that because his Lands lay so
far distant, he must give Bond, together with personal securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for the payment thereof at the appointed day. But Mr.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43071:6"/>
               <hi>Clench</hi> upon the payment of the money, onely took up his
Mortgage, but forgot the Bond, which was afterward sued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
against him. Another story is reported of him, that he
should deceive a young Gentleman of 60 <hi>l.</hi> upon promise of
procuring him a <hi>Mandamus</hi> from the King, for a Fellowship
in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Also another rumour is commonly spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
namely, that by his procurement he should supply the
Tyrant <hi>Oliver,</hi> with Twenty thousand pounds to pay his Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who were then in a condition of Mutyning. But for the truth
of these, I shall desire the Reader to suspend his belief, being
cautious in our Relation, to cast any just aspersion upon the dead.</p>
            <p>But another thing real we shall impart unto you, wherein he
received a foul Check, namely, in his dealing with one Mr.
<hi>Galilee</hi> in <hi>Finch-lane,</hi> who pretended a right to an Estate
of an Hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and
hearing of Col. <hi>Turner</hi>'s abilities, bargained with him for
the sum of 50 <hi>l.</hi> paid ready down, to prosecute his Title, and
did afterwards pay him several sums of mony incident to the
charges that belonged thereunto: Which Suit being commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> (according to the customary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that Court) a Lessee was named, which was one <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and he by the appointment of <hi>Galilee,</hi> as <hi>Turner</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But before it came to a Trial, <hi>Galilee</hi> sold his right,
so that <hi>Sampson</hi> was overthrown, and an Execution for Costs
taken out against him; who thereupon made his application
to <hi>Galilee,</hi> that now disowned the matter, and said he never
named him upon that account. Hereupon high differences
rose betwixt <hi>Turner</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> who brought an Indictment of
<hi>Barratry</hi> against <hi>Turner,</hi> and swore it himself, with an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of several other Witnesses which put <hi>Turner</hi> to
great trouble, and notwithstanding he produced several
persons for testification of his honesty; yet the Jury found
him guilty; but the Court was not so well satisfied therewith,
whereupon the businesse was referred to Sir <hi>William Wild,</hi>
who awarded <hi>Turner</hi> that he should pay to <hi>Galilee</hi> either 40.
or 50. pounds; the whole Charges amounting to no lesse
than three hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>To allay these, and some other troubles which he had, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43071:7"/>
had many Commical Frolicks, of which to relate one or two
may not be unpleasant to the Reader. He having one time
made one of his Company dead drunk, caused the Bell to be
toll'd, and sent for a Chimney-sweeper to be his Doctor, and
the Searchers to view his Corps, giving them 12 <hi>d.</hi> a peice for
their pains.</p>
            <p>At another time, having occasion to go to <hi>Colchester,</hi> upon
the Arrest of a certain man, he took for his assistance some
Officers from the <hi>Compter,</hi> as special Bailiffs (which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times before had done) having done his businesse, he
bought a Pipe of Canary of his Land-lord of the House, and
gave it freely to all Comers; and from thence carried his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to <hi>Bishops-Starford</hi> in <hi>Hartford-shire,</hi> where in the like
frolicks he spent 40 <hi>l.</hi> more.</p>
            <p>Another of his frolicks was at <hi>Colchester</hi> aforesaid, where
he hired a Waggon to carry away all the Dead he should kill; and
to affright the People, caused all the Swords that belonged to
his Company, to be hanged drawn, out of the Window; which
so amazed the Man of the House, that he commanded his
Hostler to stop up the Well in the yard with Hay, that none
of the slain might be put in there.</p>
            <p>This his ungoverned Prodigality, brought him of late out
of money, which (as I conceive) was the occasion to make
him undertake this dishonest shift, to peece out his Ruins by
base Attempts, rather than to sink obscurely into a Goal, and
there lie an object of misery. The manner whereof we shall
declare unto you.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. An exact relation of the manner of the Robbery of
Mr. Tryon.</head>
            <p>ABout <hi>Christmas</hi> last, he consulted with some persons
about this Grand Robbery, and had gotten for his turn
three men fit for the purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>William Turner</hi> a But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43071:7"/>
               <hi>Iames White</hi> a Soliciter, and another person, <hi>White</hi>'s
friend. The main of their Design was to be carried on by
Collonel <hi>Turner</hi> himself, which was for the Robbery of Mr.
<hi>Francis Tryon</hi> a Merchant in <hi>Lime-street,</hi> with whom <hi>Turner</hi>
was very intimate, and knew all passages belonging to the
house; upon their first meeting for the undertaking of the
businesse, one of their Company being drunk, it was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
for that time; <hi>White</hi> (one of the actors) protesting he
would not venture his life with one in his Condition. But
not long after, <hi>viz.</hi> the 7. of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> they met again at
the <hi>Red-Lyon</hi> in <hi>Bishopsgate-street,</hi> where they Dined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then resolved upon the Robbery that night, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to meet there again by Six of the Clock in the Afternoon;
but coming thither, the room was taken up by other Guests,
wherefore they went over to the <hi>Foure Swans</hi> or <hi>Green Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
and there staid till Eight a Clock; from thence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the <hi>New-Market</hi> in <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> where three of
them sate upon the Stalls, till the Collonel went out for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
who after half an hours space returned, bringing them
word that the Man and Maid were both gone out, and that now
was their time; whereupon away they went, and coming to
the place, Col. <hi>Turner</hi> unlocked the dore (having before
got the impression of the Key in soft wax, and had one made
answerable unto it) then went they up the Stairs, <hi>Turner</hi> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way, and in the Kitchin light a Candle, and so went
immediately up to Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi>'s Chamber, where two of them
put a Cloth into his mouth, and bound his hands and feet,
whilest <hi>Turner</hi> at the Beds feet took the Keys of his Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
and Counting-house out of his pocket; and whilest they
were busy in gaging him, he in the mean time searches the
Closet, where he finds the Jewels, and pockets them privately,
not acquainting his Companions therewith. But there was store
of Money beside, with which they severally loaded themselves,
to the value of 1023 <hi>l.</hi> This was done all in the space of an
hours time; which money they carried to one <hi>Nicholas Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginson</hi>'s
house, at <hi>Lowsie-lane</hi> in <hi>Dukes Place,</hi> which they hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some dayes before, pretending it for the use of a Master
of a Ship, his Mate, Purser, and Boat-Swain. The next
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43071:8"/>
morning <hi>Turner</hi> fetcht away the money to his own house, giving
to <hi>White</hi> and his Friend onely Twenty pound a peice for their
pains, and promised <hi>William Turner</hi> a hundred pound.</p>
            <p>Soon after they were gone, Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi> got the gag out of his
mouth, and though bound tumbled out of his Bed; in doing which
he sell upon an earthen Chamber-pot, and hurt himself sorely;
but recovering his legs and getting to the Window, called out
Murder and Theives, which being next the Street his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
heard him, and with a Crow of Iron broke open the dore
(for <hi>Turner</hi> had locked it after him,) and unbound him; then
did they see how he was robbed, but the Man and Maid being
missing caused some suspition of them, who presently after
came, pretending they had been at Supper at Col. <hi>Turner</hi>'s,
which was not so; whereupon a Constable went to examine the
businesse, who found Col. <hi>Turner</hi> and his Family in bed, who
likewise (upon the request of the Constable) went along with
him to Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi>'s, where he kept such a bustle about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that his too overmuch diligence gave him cause to be
suspected; which suspition was afterwards aggravated, by his
listning to hear when others were examined, the Man and Maid
being at that time throughly sifted by Sir <hi>Thomas Aleyn,</hi> who
took a great deal of pains in the businesse; however <hi>Turner</hi> was
let go that night, and in the morning betimes removed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from his own house, to the house of one Mrs. <hi>Fry</hi> a Semp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
at the lower end of the <hi>Minories,</hi> pretending it to be
the money of a Merchant newly broke, who having a Wife
and seven or eight Children, desired to have it secured. This
businesse Mrs. <hi>Fry</hi> reveals to a Kinswoman of hers in the house,
who having been formerly a Servant to Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> and
hearing of Mr. <hi>Tryon's</hi> Robbery, suspected the money was not
well gotten, and thereupon acquainted her Master Alderman
<hi>Love</hi> of it; who as speedily informed Sir <hi>Thomas Aleyn</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> therefore taking a Foot-boy with him, speedeth
down, and in the way meeting with Major <hi>Tasker</hi> desired his
Company to go along with him, which he accordingly did;
and entering the house of Mrs. <hi>Fry,</hi> found Col. <hi>Turner</hi> with
his hands in a Chest, wherein was two Wallets of money, one
of a 100 <hi>l.</hi> the other 200 <hi>l.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> took the Keys from him,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43071:8"/>
and going into another Room, found two Wallets of money
more. Then was a Constable called for, and <hi>Turner</hi> being
examined whose money it was, he said he had received it of a
Goldsmith, but could not tell his name; being further asked
why he should remove his own money, he answered he
onely did it for two or three dayes, till this Foolery was
over.</p>
            <p>Whilest thus they were arguing the matter, <hi>Iohn Turner</hi> the
Son (who had helped to bring the money thither) hearing how
the businesse went, got out by a back dore, and leaping over
a pale behind the house, made an escape; but the Collonel,
though he pretended he were in persuit of the Theives, and
therefore desired freedome to goe about it, yer would not Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> grant it, but calling for a Coach, (in company with
Major <hi>Tasker</hi> and the Constable) brought him to Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi>'s
house, telling him he had brought him 500 <hi>l.</hi> of his money,
and did not doubt but also a person that could help him with
the rest he had lost; but <hi>Turner</hi> having spoken with Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi>
in private, upon promise of helping him to all the next day
about four or five a clock in the afternoon, he was permitted to
go at Liberty.</p>
            <p>The next day he went to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> as he formerly used
to do, where about two a Clock he was arrested in the Streets
by the two <hi>Coles,</hi> (at the suit of four Officers of the <hi>Poultrey</hi>
Compter, who had bailed him to a Writ of one Mr. <hi>Van de
Burgh</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant) who carried him to the <hi>Hoop</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
where they stay'd him, in the mean time his Wife brought
the Jewels to Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi>'s, so that he had all his again. But
the matter was so apparent against Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> that Sir <hi>Thomas
Aleyn</hi> by Warrant committed him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> whether he
was carried about one or two a Clock the same night, and
<hi>Ianuary</hi> the 15. and 16. he was Arraigned for the same at
<hi>Iustice Hall</hi> in the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> where he was by the Jury found
Guilty, and on the 19 day of the same moneth had Sentence
of death pronounced upon him.

            <head>CHAP. VI. The Passages betwixt Col. Turner and Mr. Ordinary of
Newgate; with the manner of his Going to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</head>
            <p>SOon after his Condemnation, Mr. <hi>Welden</hi> the Ordinary of
<hi>Newgate</hi> went unto him, telling him he was a Dying
man (being dead in Law) and very earnestly pressed foure
things unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That as he was an open Sinner, so that he would
make open Confession of his sins, urging to that purpose the
saying of the <hi>Wise-man</hi> in his Book of <hi>Proverbs; He that
hideth his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh
them shall find mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A hearty Contrition for his enormous Offences
which had brought that just judgement of God upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Restitution; for words without deeds was but
a feigned and hypocritical Repentance. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Charity, to forgive others, as he would that God
for Christ's sake should forgive him.</p>
            <p>He pressed much to him the Message which the Prophet
<hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> brought to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> viz. <hi>Set thy house in order, for
thou shalt die and not live.</hi> He told him that by <hi>house</hi> was
meant not onely his temporal but his spiritual body; that the
Body in respect of the Soul was but as the shell to the kernel,
or as the Jewel to the Case which enclosed it; what a small
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43071:9"/>
minute of time he had left him betwixt that &amp; the infinite space
of Eternity; therefore what great need he had to make the best
improvement of that short time; with many other such like
speeches, which wrought very much upon him, declaring by
many outward signs a reall sorrow for his hainous crimes; not
onely weeping bitterly, but by many expressions declared his
hearty unfeigned Contrition.</p>
            <p>Afterwards on Tuesday he desired to receive the Sacrament,
the <hi>Ordinary</hi> asked him (because he would have no more Wine
then needed) how many would Communicate with him? he
replyed, his Wife and two Sons; but they being asked, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse;
Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> alledging she was not in Charity with some
persons whom she imagined too eager in prosecution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
against her Husband; but Mr. <hi>Ordinary</hi> prest so much a
necessity of her reconciliation, and gave her such sound advice,
that she willingly imbraced to be pertaker in that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
but their two Sons did not receive it.</p>
            <p>Whilest thus he prepared himself for Death, he was not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in using all endevours for the prolongation of his Life.
To this end he desired Mr. <hi>Tryon</hi> to accompany his Wife with
a Petition to his Majesty for a Reprive, which they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered upon their knees in the Long Gallery; but the
King told them he could not do it, having received such an
account of him from the Judges and Magistrates of the City
of <hi>London;</hi> and being humbly requested for a respite for some
few weeks, he would not consent for so few dayes.</p>
            <p>This not prevailing, he desired Mr. <hi>Ordinary</hi> to move
the Lord Chancellor in the businesse, propounding two reasons
to perswade him thereto; the first was, the shortnesse of the
time, which he alledged was very quick, considering that load
of sin that lay heavy upon his Conscience; and the other was,
that he had the Estates of two or three Widowes in his hands,
which by reason of his sudden cutting off, might be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
thereby. But notwithstanding these plausible pretences,
it would not hinder the Execution of Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43071:10"/>
But one thing we had almost omitted; namely, That
when Mr. Ordinary preached on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> treating of
a thorough and sound Repentance, by which they might
obtain Pardon for their sins; the Collonel in terpreting that
to be meant of his Corporal Body, which Mr. Ordinary
spake in reference to his Spiritual condition; when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was ended he seriously asked him if there were a
Pardon for him or no.</p>
            <p>But no doubt the man was thoroughly convinced of his
crime, and the heynousnesse of it, and spent the whole
day in sorrow and mourning for his offences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those are much too blame who reported him to be
drunk that day, that he ranted and swore <hi>Dam him,</hi> and
<hi>sink him,</hi> he would have a Pardon though it cost him five
thousand pound: but such is the Nature of some base ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spirits, to insult over men in misery, and when they
cannot touch their bodies, brand them as much as in them
lies, in their very memory.</p>
            <p>To confirm the Truth of these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
concerning Mr. Ordinary with the
Collonel, we shall give you a Letter
from his own hand, which he wrote to
a person of quality here in <hi>London,</hi> who
desired of him the Relation of the whole

                  <p>MY Occasions have been extraordinary,
so as I have wanted a convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of recalling the several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
that were between Me and Mr. <hi>Turner.</hi>
I shall begin, after he was cast I attended Him
to the <hi>Press-Yard,</hi> and told Him that shortly
the Sentence of Death would be denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; He answered I dread not Death,
I have looked Death oft in the face; I pray
Sir pray for me, that I may not faint when the
day of Death comes: I told him Death was
the King of Terrour; and a man had need of a
strong Faith to shield him against the fiery
Darts of Death from hurting the Soul. He
replyed Sir we shall have time to talk of these
Things Monday or Tuesday; I pray said he
call upon me as oft as you can: Tuesday night
I waited on him, and told him, Colonel I am
come to repeat the Sentence justly denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you by the Iudge, and I assure you, you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43071:11"/>
shall die and not live, therefore my advice is
to set your House in order; what do you mean
by that said he? my Meaning is your outward
Affairs relating to your Family, and in satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that have intrusted you: but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
the Closet of your Soul, to see that it be
furnished with the Grace of Almighty God, as
faith, repentance, &amp;c. I pray Sir said he direct
me, for I believe I am not a man for this World.
Sir I should have told you that Sunday in the
afternoon he came to Chapel, carried himself
very soberly; heard my Sermon attentively,
which was out of the Book of <hi>Numbers, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams</hi>
wish who I told him had lived a curser,
a ranter: He desires O that I might die the
Death of the Righteous, and that my later end
were like his. He gave me thanks for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and told me he hoped it would do his Soul
good.</p>
                  <p>I told him Meditation was the way to make
the word fruitful. I desired him to dismiss the
Company that frequented him; and to do as
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when sentance was passed, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and wept sore. Pray to God for pardon of
sin, and bath the feet of your Saviour with your
penitential Tears, and your Saviour will bath

                     </hi> I visited him with the rest of the
Prisoners in Chapel; pray'd and adviced them,
where I met with a true Penitent <hi>Jane Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>
who had spent all her time after sentence
in mourning and lamenting: I return'd to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Turner,</hi> he gave me ten shillings for my
Sermon, and some other monies to hire a Coach
to speak to the Lord Chief Iustice to allow him
a longer time for his repentance and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to die, and to satisfie four Widowes who
had intrusted him with large summs 4000 <hi>l.</hi>
as I remember; I went to the Lord Chancellor
where I found the Iudges, moved in his behalf
but his request could not be granted, die he must
the morrow by eight of the Clock or time usually
appointed; I gave him notice thereof, his reply
Lord God I have been a great sinner and shall
I have so small a time of repentance: God is
more mercifull then man, or I have no hope.
<hi>I</hi> told him it was not the length of time, but
the truth of repentance God looked at; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
true repentance the Theif's case was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
be as Penitent as he, and you shall not

                     <hi>I</hi> pray'd God to assist him in this

him very pensive, he desired the Communion,
we made a pause at last, having prest him to
restitution, he promised he, would to his power.
<hi>I</hi> found by him his power was small, he had
lived high upon the Estate of others, as <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by some passages that dropt from his
Lips; therefore <hi>I</hi> told him where you wanted
a power, the will was accepted. <hi>I</hi> demanded
who would receive the Communion? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
Himself, his Wife, his Sons and
Daughters; <hi>I</hi> demanded whether his Sons
and Daughters had received the Communion
before? they answered no, some of 'um,
others they were not prepared; his Wife also
refused to receive with him, but we perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Her to joyne in that Sacred Performance
with her Husband, otherwise it would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
she had no charity for him; he impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned

Lord Iesus dear God I pray that this
Blood may not seal up my Damnation
who have been a great Offender. Lord
thy Blood is able to save me O God, thou
never didst cast away penitent sinners:
Let thy Blood seal up my Salvation dear
Lord. So he drank it, and after said, I
have comfort in my Soul. He was very
attentive to the Admonitious of my Self

Thursday Morning being come (the fatall Day appointed
for his Execution,) he was very intent upon his preparation
for another World; and spent the Morning wholly with
the Ministers, and in taking leave of his Wife and Children,
to whom he gave many good and wholesome admonitions.
About 10 a clock both the Sheriffs came in Person to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him to the place of Execution. Coming out of the
Presse-Yard, and seeing a Cart there prepared to carry him;
he was somewhat abashed, and desired of Sir <hi>Richard Ford</hi>
(one of the Sheriffs) he might have a Coach, which was
denyed, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> telling him the King had ordered it
otherwise; Then did he desire he might walk on foot,
but that neither would be granted, whereupon he went
up into the Cart, and being by the Officer ordered to sit
in the Body of the Cart, the usual Place for Offenders;
he desired to be permitted to ride on the Copps, but that
also was denyed, and so he was tyed according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of Fellons. There rode with him in the same Cart,
Mr. Ordinary of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and another Minister; great was
the Confluence of People all the way he passed along the
streets, the Windows being so thronged as hath not been
known in the memory of Man upon the like occasion.</p>
            <p>Being come to the Place of Execution, (which was in
<hi>Leaden</hi>-Hall-Street, at <hi>Lime-Street</hi> end, where a Gibbet
was Erected,) He called the Executioner unto him, and told
him, that his Friends desired his Cloaths, and therefore in
Consideration of them, he gave hime <hi>fifty shillings,</hi> and halfe
a Crown besides to Drink. He also gave <hi>15s.</hi> to the Serjeants
and Yeomen there present to see his Body and Cloaths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to one M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Smith,</hi> a Neighbour that lived hard by,
then looking round about upon the People, addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Sheriffes, he made a long Speech, the substance
whereof is this.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. The Speech of Collonel James Turner at his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with his Character, as also an example of his
horrible Swearing.</head>
            <p>HE confessed that it was the greatness of his sins that
brought him thither; the greatest of which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
blaspheming God, and taking his name in vaine;
that he was much addicted to Company, yet never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Theives, or such base inferiour people, but by
hearing others Swear got a habit of it, though inwardly he
detested it. That for the fact which brought him thither it
was of his own contriving, and that his two Sons <hi>Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Ely</hi> were ignorant of it, and therefore desired they might
be released. That his Father was a Reverend Divine, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of good Life and Conversation. That his Wife was
descended from a Family of repute in <hi>Dorset</hi> Shire, one of her
Uncles having lent the late King 8000l. That his Wife now
being brought to this dist<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess, his two Children might be
releast for her comfort, and not to add affliction to her
affliction. That he was afraid the crying sinnes of this
Nation, (without Gods wonderfull mercy,) would bring
some heavy punishment upon it. That the dislike of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in the World, hath made him many times wish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his grave. That being a Boy, men were more friendly &amp;
given to Hospitality; but that now the World was full of
malice and difference. Then did he free himself of some
Calumnies cast upon him, and gave account of his service
under the old King. Next did he fall upon the occasion of
his coming thither, imputing it to the just hand of God for
his sinnes, desiring all people to take warning by him; that
had he not been Arrested at that sad juncture of time Mr.
<hi>Tryan</hi> had had every penny worth of his Goods and Money
again, desiring God to forgive them that was the hinderance
thereof. Then did he vindicate himself of some other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umnies
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43071:14"/>
cast upon him, namely concerning that sad fire in
<hi>Loathbury;</hi> of which he protested his innocency therein,
As likewise some Money that was lost in <hi>Coleman</hi>-Street,
which heaverred he never knew of. He also purged himself
of an imputation laid upon him, concerning a Gentleman of
his own Name that lay in his House, as if something should
be put into his Drink to dispatch him out of this World,
(the Gentleman dying suddenly) of which he likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his innocency. Next did he give some breif account
of his Faith and Profession, how he had been bred up in the
Protestant Profession, and was a zealous practiser of the
Rites and Ceremonies belonging thereunto: That he was
truely and heartily sorrowful for his sinnes; desiring of God
the forgiveness of them. That he had made a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
confession, and restitution so far as in him lay, and that
his repentance was not feigned, desiring to be with Christ
in Glory, and that he was in perfect Charity with the whole
World.</p>
            <p>Next did he free himself of some imputations that he
was drunk the Sunday before in Prison. Desiring some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
might be taken concerning the Hole in <hi>Newgate,</hi> that
poor Prisoners might have some Boards to lie downupon
them in ease, that they might not be so tormented, when
they should be preparing for their ends. Afterwards he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
them about him to joyne with him in prayer, in which
he earnestly begged for the forgiveness of his sinnes; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heartily for the Kings <hi>Majesty,</hi> and all the Royal Family;
as also for the Majestrates and Ministers of the Land. That
God would provide and take care for his Wife &amp; Children.
Thanking him for that space of time for Repentance, and
that he was not cut off by sudden death: desiring God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
Jesus Christ, to wash away his sinnes, and receive
his Soul.</p>
            <p>Then did Mr. Ordinary of <hi>Newgate</hi> pray with him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he had some private Ejaculations, wherein he exprest
much sorrow for his times, and earnestly begged pardon for
them. Then taking his leave of the Sheriffs, desring to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
to the L. Maior, &amp; the rest of the Aldermen, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd
himself for his last minute, still earnestly beging of God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43071:14"/>
for mercie, and desiring for his comfort the Doctor to read
to him those Verses in the second of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> being the
14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 Verses.</p>
            <p>Next did he give 40. <hi>s.</hi> to a Minister, to be given to the
poor of that Parish; and 18. <hi>s. 6. d.</hi> more for his Wife, to
be delivered to his young Sons School-master.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he directed the Executioner to take off the
Halter from his shoulders; which being done, he took it in
his hands, kissed it, and put it about his neck himself; and
having fitted his Cap, went out of the Cart (wherein he
made his Speech) upon the Ladder: where the Executioner
tying the Rope, and pulling it something too much, he very
smartly said to him, <hi>What, dost thou mean to choak me? pray
fellow, give me more rope: How long hast thou been Executioner,
that thou knowest not how to place the Halter.</hi> Then bidding
the Executioner not to turn him off till he gave him a sign,
he again fell to Prayers; and desiring the Lord to receive his
soul, upon the sign given he was turned off the Ladder.</p>
            <p>After some short time he was cut down, and his bodie
conveyed to the House of Mistris <hi>Smith</hi> a neighbour near by,
where it continued till—when it was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very decently, at the Parish Church of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershaft.</p>
            <p>And this was the end of Mr. <hi>Iames Turner,</hi> a man who by
the course of Nature might have lived many years longer.
He was a person of a middle stature, something corpulent,
but active: of a chearfull countenance, which he kept up
even to the very period of his life, not much changing to
the very last. He was one very loving to his Wife, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to his Children; of a high spirit, which having not
an Estate answerable thereto, caused him to fall into many
errours. His vices were great and many; yet were they not
without a mixture of Vertues and other good qualities. He
was much addicted to the sin of Swearing: a vice which
hath in it neither profit nor pleasure; and unless a man be
wholly given up to wickedness, cannot but strike the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with much regret in the committing of it. He was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43071:15"/>
very charitable to the poor, especially to such who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been able to give themselves: But his thoughts were
vaster then his estate; and therefore (as I formerly hinted)
I am perswaded the occasion of this his last wicked act was
to have wherewithal to keep up that state and grandure he
had formerly lived in, fearing nothing so much as to strike
sail, and stoop to the privacie of an ordinary way of life.
Many were the troubles he had passed through, which we
may think he rather desired then studied to avoid; as some
men delight to fish in troubled waters, so did he take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in divers and intricate troubles; though I conceive the
profit arising by them was the greatest motive to make him
undertake them. For his valour, we find not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of him; yet do not I think he was a Coward, as
some have aspersed him. Indeed (as I said before) his vices
were many and great, especially that horrid sin of Cursing
and Swearing: whereof we shall give you an example, as a
Warning to all those who are addicted to those horrid
crimes; which we received from the hands of one who knew
all the passages for truth.</p>
            <p>ABout <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1662. Col. <hi>Iames Turner</hi> sent to
a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> to come to him to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Tavern in <hi>Cornhil,</hi> who found a Gentleman with
the said <hi>Turner,</hi> to whom two Captains also came;
<hi>Turner</hi> entreated the Citizen he sent for to move a
Company, of which the Citizen was a member, to
give out of their bounty ten pounds to release a
prisoner out of the Fleet, which was by him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and some few days after granted by the said
Company, and the prisoner set at liberty. <hi>Turner</hi>
swore very much without any provocation; the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
told him if he continued to swear, he would not
stay in his company. Whiles they were drinking a
Blackamoor-boy of some 14 years of age brought
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43071:15"/>
pipes and small beer. <hi>Turner</hi> swore and curst the
Boy, and said he was like the Devil, for which the
company did much reprove him, the Drawer stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by said, the Blackamoor was to be baptized the
next Lords day with his Masters child, his wife then
lying in. The Citizen to try the Blackamoors fitness
for baptism, asked him Who made him? who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
God. <hi>Turner</hi> very furiously replied and swore
desperately the Devil made him, earnestly saying
and swearing, <hi>You rogue, the Devil made you, God
never made you.</hi> The Citizen desired <hi>Turner</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
his swearing, and had much ado to get
him to be quiet; whilst he asked him further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories,
the Blackmoor replied Christian like
answers to the questions of Who redeemed him,
Who sanctified and preserved him, wherefore God
made him, and several other Christian-like answers
the Boy gave, till he came to answer to the Priestly,
Prophetical and Kingly Office of Christ. <hi>Turner</hi> still
continued vehemently cursing and swearing against
the Boy. It being now near ten a clock at night,
the four Gentlemen present, and also the Drawer
and the Blackamoor, <hi>Turner</hi> sitting with his face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the casement, therein came a mighty great flap
or stroke upon the window as if two great wings
would have drove the window into the room upon
the company, which made them all in a great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereupon the Citizen ran to the window,
opened the casement, but could not see any thing as
the cause, not a quarrel broke, nor any dirt upon the
window. <hi>Turner</hi> gave over cursing and swearing,
and sate as a man ready to sink into the ground,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43071:16"/>
that one of the Captains told <hi>Turner</hi> this is because
of your swearing and cursing. The window was
near a story from the yard which belonged to the
Tavern, and a Shed of boards from it downward,
that in no probability any man did it.</p>

Another Calumnie is commonly reported of him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond Sea with our now Gracious Sovereign, he should
deceive him of some sums of Monie wherewith he had been
entrusted: but this is easie to be refuted, it being well known
he was never out of <hi>England,</hi> and so by consequence could
not be culpable of that offence. I should therefore advise
people not to be too credulous of every report they hear
of him: as that which some have confidently reported, That
because he alwaies kept two or three brave Geldings; that <hi>He
was the head of all the high-way-men in England;</hi> and that
under pretence of solliciting mens businesses, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
him to stay out late some nights, that it was onely a
cloak to blind the eyes of the world, when he was abroad
upon worse matters: insomuch that the Tanners of <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard,</hi>
and other Market-folks, since his death have been bold to
say, <hi>That they hoped now they should ride safe home, since that
great Robber</hi> Turner <hi>was dead.</hi> But for these and sch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural
stories, I shall desire the Reader to suspend his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
til Time (the father of Truth) shall bring things to light.</p>
            <p>For that of one <hi>Marshal,</hi> concerning some Monie that was
lost in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> as also that he should cheat a woman
by a false Deed; there is so little of likelihood in it, that
were it not onely to stop the mouths of some who are apt
to believe every false report, I should not so much as once
mention them.</p>
            <p>Therefore though his Vices were great, yet we ought not
to lay other mens faults upon him, onely upon supposition,
which is no evidence in Law; and of the two ought rather
to judge the best, or at least to weigh and consider through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the contrary Reasons, lest we come under the lash of the
Poet,
<q>
                  <l>He that doth judge, and will but one side hear,</l>
                  <l>Though he judge right, he's no good Iusticer.</l>

            <p>But it is a known observation, That in such calamitous
cases more is commonly charged then proved: and it may
be his adversaries observed <hi>Machiavels</hi> Rule, To throw dirt
enough upon him, for that some would stick. For I have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43071:17"/>
observed, That let a lie be invented, though never so ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
it shall meet with some fools that will believe it:
Witness that story about ten years ago of the great Giants
coming into <hi>England.</hi> No doubt his crimes were very great,
for which we may judge his excesses were the greatest occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of them. In the mean time, Humanity commands us
to think the best of him, and to pitie his Wife and six Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
whom he left behind him, the onely remains of seven
and twentie by one woman; whereof two he left behind him
in prison, upon account of the same fact.</p>
            <p>But one thing is known to many for a truth, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

               </gap>ately executed for Treason, (as those who have
seen it with him have informed me,) which though preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be used for the making an excellent Medicine he had
for the Gout, yet it is a most unmanly thing to have no reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Humane Blood, though in persons justly punished.</p>
            <p>Nor could this person, who had been so litigious in his
life, rest free from suspicion after his death; a common ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
being bruited, That he was not hanged till quite dead,
but that afterwards by means used to him, recovered again
to life: But this storie being most of all ridiculous, I leave to
be believed by those that are more credulous then my self.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with a merrie Epitaph which was made
by an ingenious person upon him, leaving it to the Reader
to judge of it as he pleases.
<q>
                  <l>HEre lies the Carcass of a wretched Wight,</l>
                  <l>Who at Noon-day did bid the world Good-night.</l>
                  <l>Of what Sect he was of, there's few can tell,</l>
                  <l>He (like <hi>Erasmus)</hi> hung 'twixt Heaven and Hell.</l>
                  <l>Valiant by consequence he must be sed,</l>
                  <l>He scorn'd to die (like Cowards) in his bed:</l>
                  <l>And whereas others run from Death's embrace,</l>
                  <l>He boldly went to meet him in the face.</l>
                  <l>Lastly, his Courage was so mighty too,</l>
                  <l>He did what all that saw him fear'd to do.</l>

hear there is a Rumour of a false
Copy which is likely to come forth,
let him beware of it, lest it abuse the
