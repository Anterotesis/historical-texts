         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102985:3"/>
a strict one; they have left me no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary
Latitude; they have intrusted me
with a rich Jewel to present your Grace, and
onely recommended the modelling the Case of
it unto me: and this under a Limitation too;
for they know that Logick sits at the Forge and
Hammer, Rhetorick at the File and Polishing:
and this in favour of the Laws, they have forbid
me; knowing <hi>I</hi> ought not to practise in that
Mystery wherein <hi>I</hi> have not served out my
time. And though this be <hi>Vna,</hi> it is not <hi>Vnica
ratio;</hi> for Truth, and such a Truth as must be
stampt by the Authority of the House, they
judge according to the Rules of Heraldry, it must
be emblazoned in a plain Coat. Next, <hi>Sir,</hi>
the House in this Address follows not the track
of common Principles; for that Beauty of the
Universe we behold, arises out of jarring Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:

the most ravishing Harmony is composed of
Discords. But when this House raises a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
the noise of a Hammer must not be heard
in the Building: when they set a Lesson, it
must be perfected out of <hi>unisons. Nemine

               <hi>Welcome, welcome, welcome, great Duke,</hi> is

must be compleat to welcome you, now you <hi>are
come.</hi> The <hi>Laconism</hi> of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Letter I have
heard admired; who wrote, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici:</hi>
but, Sir, you may write much shorter, and much
truer, <hi>Vici,</hi> onely: for so forcible an Operation
hath your Vertues, that many worthy Persons
this Day, of whom you could not write either
<hi>Veni</hi> or <hi>Vidi,</hi> have entertained an honourable
Contest, who should first Resigne the Devotion
of their Services to your Commands. So that
I may say,
<q>
                  <l>Hoc, Coelo commune tibi est, Dux magne, Deis<expan>
                        <am>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I remember I thrice repeated your Graces
Welcome: there is more of Logick then Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102985:4"/>
in it; for there are three Estates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it: The Lords Spiritual have welcomed
you to the Bosome of the Church: the Lords
Temporal have welcomed you into the bed of
Honour: the Commons do welcome you into
the Recesses of their Hearts, perfumed with Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie
to his Majestie, and with submissive Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to your Person. What hinders then, but
that it be Enacted. But here I want expression,
when I consider the divided Passions of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
in giving the Royal Assent. May it
please your Majestie, you must either deny your
Self, or deny us; and you have rather denied
your Self, then you would deny us: you are
contented (though under some Impatience) to
want his Grace, rather then we should want him
under Despair. Then since we have the Royal
Assent, let your Graces Welcome be Enacted,
not by a temporary Act, but to continue to us
and our Posteritie. But what a crowd of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
compound the present Consistencie of
our Joys! and even these have their just advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.
The Sun breaking forth from an impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
cloud, returns with a coveted light; and
we are taught many times to inhanse the value of
former Enjoyments by their absence: this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Judgement, being recompensed with
an improvement of our Affection. Thus when
we consider you exil'd from whatsoever might
have yeelded you a Sublunary satisfaction;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102985:4"/>
when we consider you divorc'd from your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whom Grace and Nature had fitted to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your Name and Honours to future Ages
in an Issue like to you both; when we consider
you ravisht from those large Hereditary Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
conveyed through the Chanels of ancient,
pure and noble Bloud; and not onely thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd
from <hi>Rachel,</hi> but espoused to <hi>Leah,</hi> to a
blear-ey'd Condition; and for what Crimes?
your Vertues were your Crimes: this is the
imprisoning Cloud. But now to behold you
breaking forth with Rays, Rays reflected from
the Solar Aspect of his Majestie; Rays that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
and call up the sleeping Vertue in the
Roots of the several Interests in this Kingdom;
Rays that gild the Church, Rays that we doubt
not but will <hi>segregare Heterogenea,</hi> burn up
Schisms, Heresies; and <hi>congregare Homogenea,</hi>
wed Doctrine and Discipline: Rays that warm
the Civil Government; Rays not contracted
to the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> but proportionably
influencing the lowest Shrubs. What fitter
Return for such general benefits, then the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acknowledgement of all the Commons in
this Kingdom?</p>
            <p>But Sir, in the Van of Particulars, your Care
of that Religion profess'd in your Mother-Church,
opens our Arms, and encircles you in
Embraces as fast and durable as those with which
you embraced it: that Religion of which you
use to say,

            <p>And had we no other Instances of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
tenderness to this Kingdom, nor other
Evidences of his religious Soul; this, even this
single Act were enough to confirm our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Loyaltie, and to regulate our Imitation.
We may well judge his Majestie expects us to
write in a Canonical Hand, by sending us over
such an Orthodox Copie.</p>
            <p>Black-mouth'd <hi>Detraction,</hi> thou that feedest
upon the Consciences of Kings, and gnawest
the brests of great Ministers of State, hide thy
mouth in the dust; this day thy Tragedie bears
date: behold him placed over us by our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
upon whom Temptations in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in forraign parts, after many days Fasting
in a Necessitated condition, left no other impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
then their Foam and Malice. And <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
hearken not unto unwarrantable Fears (if
any such be:) behold him, that in his single
person dared the French Cardinals power and
rage, in rescuing that Illustrious Prince, of fresh

from the Snares laid for his tender years. What
mayst thou not now expect from him, armed
with Power, fenc'd with Laws, and both desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102985:5"/>Thus, Sir, you arrived to us Commissioned

of your life: this hath returned you to us
with the same countenance and complexion, <hi>sic
oculos, sic ora ferebat,</hi> as when you left us. <hi>I</hi>
wonder at those that wonder at it: for how
should the <hi>face</hi> alter, when the <hi>heart</hi> and noble
parts retain their primitive healthful temper?
how can Consumptive impressions seize that
body, that keeps within it self a Feast, a Feast

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102985:6"/>
the usurped Powers at Home, and confederated
Powers Abroad, run all those Methamorphoses
for the Triumph of a single Rape upon your
Allegiance; and all in vain. If we listen to
the Syrene-Air of their Promises and Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they are Swans: if we consider the merit
and weight of them, they are showres of Gold:
they learnt the plausible Dialect from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>All this will I give you, if you will fall down
and worship.</hi> If we reflect on their Menaces,
and (which is more) their Practises, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in shapes more fierce and antick then Bulls
and Satyrs. But your Grace made good by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
what deserves the praise of a Speculative
Fancie: be pleased to attend it; it is the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
appointed by the House for this present day.</p>

            <p>Your Grace knew you were a Star of the
first Magnitude in the Guards of <hi>Charles his
Wain;</hi> and those must not be Erratick, but Fixt.
Thus you are Commission'd from the King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; and then what shall be said, nay <hi>what
must be done to the man whom the King intends to
honour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102985:6"/>Now be pleased to give us leave to lay aside
these general Topicks of Religion and Loyalty,
and to recreate our selves with the Remembrance
of those Benefits we enjoyed under your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Government.</p>
            <p>It was not still Musick, or Bonfires lighted
for Triumph, that ushered your Grace into your
Government: No, it was the Warlike noise
of Trumpets, sounding of Drums, neighing of
barbed Steeds, and the screeches of the half-slain,
that proclaimed your entrance upon a Stage of
Bloud. And when you were thus but a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate
in your Government, you were put upon
terms of Disadvantage and Necessity to dispute
with the Doctors of the Chair: for your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
wanted neither <hi>Dolus,</hi> or <hi>Virtus.</hi> And if
we, who in a direct line partake of the prudence
of your Counsels, and the success of your
Sword, should be silent; even <hi>England,</hi> that
is but collaterally interested, might, nay would
upbraid our Ingratitude, since the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant
with the sense of your merits, were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Suitors to his late Majestie of ever-glorious
memory, as an earnest of his farther favours, to
confer on you the Honour and Dignity of a
Marquess: and that the rise of that Honour
might survive to be at the instance of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England,</hi> they presented your Grace
with a Jewel to be worn upon your brest, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102985:7"/>
better to direct the esteem of men to the inward
Jewel, by the richness of the Case.</p>
            <p>Thus we enjoyed, in the heat of War, the
shades of Peace, until fatal Divisions among our
selves (and <hi>a divided Kingdom cannot stand)</hi> rent
your Grace from us: and then, when <hi>the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
was smote,</hi> how miserably were <hi>the Sheep
scattered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when your Grace saw this Royal Vessel
sinking, you leapt not into the Long-boat, to
make provision for your own Safety: no, you
made honourable and secure Articles for those
that had imbarqued upon your account.</p>
            <p>Many that stand here this day, that owe a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sacrifice to your Pietie, whose age, wants, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-dependencies,
or the like, onely accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
your Grace with their Prayers, under the
Lee of those Articles, in the continued violence
of those Storms, embarqu'd themselves and their
Fortunes.</p>
            <p>And yet when the flagging Sayls carried you
unwillingly from this Coast, when you lost the
<hi>sight,</hi> yet you retained the <hi>sense</hi> of this Land.
Length of time, or distance of place, could not
abate the Intensiveness of your Spirits for this
Kingdoms good. It is said, that upon the disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in order to her Embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<hi>Callis</hi> was found written on her heart. I
shall not dispute the truth: but sure this is, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at your Graces departure was <hi>ultimum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102985:7"/>
and upon your return <hi>primum vivens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall pass by that Familiar Reception your
Grace afforded to the Commissioners of the
General Convention of <hi>Ireland:</hi> (for the name
of it, I can onely say, <hi>Aliquisque malo fuit usus
in illo)</hi> neither shall I mention your frequent
and steadable Advices, your constant Readiness
upon all occasions to bring them into his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
presence. I forbear your Graces passionate
and repeated Questions, <hi>How little Benjamin
did? How all things were in Ireland? Whether
the old man were living? How our Fundamental
Laws were administred?</hi> And in the conclusion
of all, how careful you were to return us <hi>with
our moneys in our sacks mouths,</hi> with his Majesties
gracious Declaration and Instructions: so that
the Addresses from this Kingdom, went out like
<hi>the bowe of Ionathan,</hi> that <hi>never returned empty.</hi>
Witness the Address from this House by their
Commissioners to his sacred Majestie, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(amongst other things) to that great Bill
of <hi>Settlement,</hi> (for that adopted title it retains.)</p>
            <p>Sir, I am not this day speaking of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie:
we still premise, <hi>Rex nobis haec otia fecit;</hi>
of him we say, <hi>Omnium domus illius vigilia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendit,
omnium otium illius labor, omnium delitias
illius industria, omnium vacationem illius occupatio.</hi>
His Majesty is the Spirit that moves the Wheels,
and we are now upon one of the Master-Wheels:
and happie is the Kingdom, when the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102985:8"/>
Wheels move as the Spirit moves. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
is the Waters of Healing; and we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
a Tutelar Angel that stirr'd the Waters,
and helpt in this Paralytical Kingdom, in the
crowd of Patients.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to remember the <hi>five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
mess</hi> of your time that you afforded <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.</hi>
Did the morning require your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
attending in Parliament? <hi>Ireland</hi> must be
first served. Did afternoon-Committees pray
in aid to your advice? <hi>Ireland</hi> must be first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Were there particular Causes designed
for hearing at the Council-Board? you have
successfully employed your Mediation that <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
might be first served. When Clauses and
Provisoes were offered to be inserted in that great
Bill, your first care was to see if they were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration-touch;
and held them up before it, as
the Eagle, to try the legitimation of her brood,
dares their eyes with the Sun-beams. And in
the throng of such Addresses, I have observed
your Grace in Civility to <hi>hear</hi> all persons, but
in Justice to <hi>see</hi> none. And if upon pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of profit, any intrenchments upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
had been offered, your Grace know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of your great Masters Standard,
wherein a C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Honour out-weighed pounds
of Profit, you endeavoured to transmit the Bill
as a seamless Coat.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I need not have recourse to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102985:8"/>
any Rhetorical Figure to make that great Bill to
speak. Your Grace may take notice, that as
many days you waited upon it, so it hath to
this day waited upon your Grace. It remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
how often when it was in the Cradle and
Swadling-bands you visited it. It remembers
when it was in the state of its Minority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Committee of the Council-Board, how
faithful and tender a Guardian you were to it.
It remembers how powerfully instrumental you
were to give it a Body, and now waits until your
Grace by the Royal Assent breathe a Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>It is now time to take in my Sayls, and make
ready an Anchor, especially since methinks I see
a Cloud rising upon your brow. I know your
Graces Temper, That you place your Reward,
as well as your Recreation, in doing good, and
not in hearing of it being done. But be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to remember, it is the Commons of this
Kingdom speak; and then <hi>Vox populi,</hi> nay more,
<hi>Vox populi Dei,</hi> is <hi>Vox Dei.</hi> As they are the
great Enquest to present Criminals, so they are
the great Records to preserve Vertue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Could your Grace have been contented
to have acted less, my Commission would have
been to have said less: but it is fit we give your
Grace an Essay of that Obedience that so unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
we devote to your Commands; and
therefore <hi>I</hi> shall onely add, That as this House
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102985:9"/>
most submissively acknowledgeth the repeated
Obligations from his Majesty; so they look
upon this as the Fermentation of them all, That
he hath put those Laws and Estates he hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
bestowed on us, under your Graces Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Protection: And that while it
shall seem expedient to his Majesty to continue
us in a Parliamentary way, his Majesty shall
finde the Effects of his great VVisdom and
Goodness, in giving your Grace unto us, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
after our own hearts. That so, as we
have been happie in your Grace, your Grace may
be happie in us; and the union of both those,
centre in the ever-prayed-for Happiness of his
Majestie and his other Kingdoms.</p>
