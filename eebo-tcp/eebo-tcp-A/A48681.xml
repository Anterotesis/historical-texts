            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62538:3"/>The witch of <hi>Endor</hi> had a Ghost we know,</l>

               <l>He knowes <hi>Belzebubs</hi> mind what's done in hell,</l>
               <l>This makes our Bishops and each Jesuite</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Laud, Wren,</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> nere had been so wise,</l>
               <l>But that this Ghost did each of them advise.</l>
               <l>This Ghost is not more wise then he is meeke,</l>
               <l>He lookes not like a wolfe, but like a Sheep,</l>

               <l>The broiles in <hi>Scotland</hi> late had never been,</l>
               <l>Had this Ghost still been harboured therein.</l>
               <l>This holy ghost in England was not knowne,</l>

               <l>Therefore he brought it with him men conceive,</l>
               <l>And when he dyed, at <hi>Lambeth</hi> did it leave,</l>
               <l>Providing then, that each of his successours</l>

               <l>If these should chance now to grow out of weare,</l>
               <l>He hath something else will fit you doe not feare;</l>
               <l>Would you in each mans purse still have a hand,</l>
               <l>Then gaine this Ghost, and none dare you withstand</l>

               <l>For this is cleare for all to see that will,</l>
               <l>All winds doe turne these Ghostly fathers mill,</l>
               <l>Hath any one a Christen soule to make,</l>
               <l>The Holy Priest therein will have a Stake,</l>
               <l>This Christen soule if next day chance to day,</l>
               <l>This Holy Priest will find no cause to cry;</l>
               <l>Is any one disposd a wife to wed,</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> must have ten groats fore he be sped,</l>
               <l>A Spit in Lent turnes not in any fashion,</l>
               <l>Without these Ghostly Fathers approbation.</l>
               <l>How come the Hood and Surplice to be holy,</l>
               <l>Its from their Ghost we know they have it wholly:</l>
               <l>And if I faile not in my observation,</l>
               <l>Without this Ghost no holy consecration,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62538:5"/>Of Temples, Altars, Crucifix, or Tables,</l>
               <l>Of Fonts, or Bells, or any the Popes bables,</l>
               <l>Without this Ghost a Bishop knowes not how,</l>
               <l>To make a Priest more holy then a Sow,</l>
               <l>And were it not for this unholy spirit,</l>
               <l>VVhat parish Clarke could holinesse inherit.</l>
               <l>But for this Ghost I pray you tell me when,</l>
               <l>Our Correstors would become holy men.</l>
               <l>A hundred other things this spirit doth,</l>
               <l>VVhich this time to declare I'm very loth.</l>
               <l>This that is writ may please the Chapmans mind,</l>
               <l>He may imagine the rest which is behind,</l>
               <l>Hereby to him it plainly doth appeare,</l>
               <l>He cannot buy this Holy Ghost too deare,</l>
               <l>But if he thinke herein I doe but scoffe,</l>
               <l>Aske Sir <hi>Iohn Lambe,</hi> he'l swear all's true by's troth.</l>
