         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt, That the Parliamentary Councils of that Age, conſiſted only of the King, ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords and Peers, without any Knights of Shires, or Burgeſſes, of which we find no mention in this, or any other former or ſucceeding Councils, in the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> times; though ſometimes Wiſe-men of inferior quality, both of the Clergie and Laity, were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſummoned to them, without any popular electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Kings ſpecial direction, for their advice.</p>
               <p>2ly. That all Divine and Eccleſiaſtical matters, touching God, Religion, and the Church, and all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realm of publique concernment, relating to war or peace, were debated, conſulted of, &amp; ſetled in Parliamentary Councils. 3ly. That the buſineſſes of God and the Church, were therein uſually firſt deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſetled, before the affairs of the kingdom, of which they ought to have precedency. 4ly. That all private grievances, injuries and oppreſſions done by the King, his Officers, or other private perſons, to the Church, or other men, were uſually complained of, and redreſſed in Parliamentary Councils, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and judgement of the King and Peers; and that either upon the parties Petition, ſetting forth his grievances, or a relation made thereof by the King, or ſome other Prelate or Nobleman, before the whole Council. 5ly. That what could not be redreſſed in one great Council, was in the next ſucceeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil revived and redreſſed, according to the merits of the cauſe. 6ly. That no Peer nor Member of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil might abſent himſelf in thoſe times, but upon juſt and lawfull excuſe, which he ought humbly to ſignifie to the King and Council by a ſpecial Meſſenger, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118756:31"/>
Letter, as Abbot <hi>Siward</hi> did here. 7ly. That all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council had free liberty of Debate and Vote, in all buſineſſes complained of, or propoſed to them; and a negative, as well as an affirmative voice. 8ly. That all buſineſſes then were propounded and debated before all the Council, and reſolved by them all, not in private Committees. 9ly. That our Kings in thoſe days, in Caſes of neceſſity, could not lawfully ſeiſe their ſubjects monies and plate againſt their wills, to raiſe Soldiers to reſiſt invading fore in Enemies, but only borrow them by their free conſents, and held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to reſtore or recompence the monies lent or taken by them in ſuch exigencies, with thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. 10. That our Kings in that age, could not grant away their Crown lands, create or inlarge San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, or exempt any Abbies from Taxes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique payments, or impoſe any publique Taxes on their Subjects, but by Charters, or grants made and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in and by their great Councils.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From theſe paſſages of our Hiſtorians it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. 1. That this Tax of ten thouſand pounds to the <hi>Danes,</hi> was the very firſt we find impoſed on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Nation, An. Domini 991, being never ſubject to any publike Civil Tax til then, for ought appears by Hiſtory. 2. That this Tax was then impoſed, and after reimpoſed, augmented on the Nation, only by common advice, grant, and conſent of the King, Prelates, and Nobles aſſembled in a publike and Parliamentary Council. 3. That the original ground of granting it was baſe degenerous cowardiſe, or unmanly fear, and ſluggiſhneſs, both in the King, Nobles, and People, and that by the very unlucky, imprudent, ill Council and advice, of an Archprelate, <hi>Siricius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> being the ptinciple adviſer of it. 4ly. That it was originally paid, not to a lawfull Native Soveraign king, for defence of the Nation, but to a forein invading prevailing, victorious <hi>Daniſh</hi> Enemy, to purchaſe peace, and be quit of future troubles and Invaſions. 5ly, That when this was firſt impoſed, it was with a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118756:83"/>
belief and reſolution never to reiterate or draw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into cuſtom or preſident in ſucceeding ages: and that only to ſatisfie a covetous invading Enemy for the preſent, without any thoughts that it would but ſtrengthen or encourage their Enemies to new invafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tributes of this Nature, doubled and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the Nation afterwards. Yet loe the contrary ſad effects of this ill preſident &amp; advice. 1. It is within few years after, ſeveral times drawn into Uſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom again. 2. It is every time increaſed, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more than other, till it amounted to 4 times as much as it was at firſt. 3. It did but impoveriſh, weaken the Engliſh themſelves, and much ſtrengthen, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Daniſh Enemies, and keep them ſtill under their Vaſſalage. Whereas ſo much mony or leſs raiſed and ſpent for their own defence againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> would probably have expulſed and beaten them home to their own Country with loſſe, and ſo have prevented their future invaſion. 4ly After the <hi>Danes</hi> were quite expelled, and the occaſion of this tax quite extinct, yet it then became a uſual conſtant ſuppliment to our Kings for ſundry ages after, upon all occaſions, and was the only ground-work, pattern, of all the heavy publike Shipmony, Taxes, Aids, Impoſitions, Payments, under which the people have ſuffered in all ſucceeding ages, till this preſent. It is very dangerous therefore for Parliaments, or Stateſmen, upon any extraordinary preſſing Neceſſity, to lay any new Taxes, Tributes, or Impoſts on the people, and moſt perillous for the people voluntarily to ſubmit unto their payment; fot being but once or twice granted, impoſed, paid, and made a Preſident, they are hardly ever aboliſhed or conjured down again, but kept ſtill on foot upon ſome pretext or other; yea oft doubled, trebled, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupled by degrees, to the peoples grand oppreſſion and undoing, as we may ſee by this old Preſident of <hi>Danegelt;</hi> and the late ſad Preſidents of our new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

For how are we not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, who are wounded, who are oppreſſed, who are wearied, who are diſtreſſed by forces, who are ſpoiled by arms? Neither flie we, ſince there is none who may aſſault us; neither do we aſſault, ſince courage fails on both ſides. How long ſhall it be, ere we ſee an end of theſe wonderfull things?

We are broken in pieces, we are ſlain, we are diſſipated, we loſe our deareſt pledges, we expoſe our ſweet friends and alliances to death. But of this labour what fruit? what end? what price? what emolument? what I pray, but that the ſouldiers being ſlain on both ſides, the Captains at laſt compelled by neceſsity, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound? or verily fight alone, without a Souldier?

thoſe Hiſtorians witneſs; Whoſe Name and date the ignorant compiler of this Manuſcript miſtook; whoſe Antiquitie and reputation is very ſuſpitious, as <hi>(c)</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> informs us. Firſt, becauſe Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>[b] Concilia, p.</hi> 534.</note> could never gain the ſight of it from Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> though he oft-times promiſed to lend it him to peruſe for his ſatisfaction. And that which dares not abide the ſight and teſt of ſuch a judicious learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when deſired, may juſtly be deemed an Impoſture. 2ly. Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> conceives the Author of this Manuſcript, writ not before the end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, if ſo ſoon, ſeeing he calls the Great Council of the Realm, ſo frequently a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which Title was not given it in Manuſcripts or Hiſtorians, till the end of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. or after his reign; And <hi>Wigornienſis, Matthew Weſtminſter, Hoveden,</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Dunelmenſis,</hi> all ſtile it onely <hi>CONCILIUM,</hi> not <hi>Parliamentum.</hi> 3ly. Becauſe he certainly miſtakes in his Chronology in making <hi>Aegelnoth</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the reign of King <hi>Hardecnute,</hi> when as he died and <hi>Eadſi</hi> was made Archbiſhop thereof two years before <hi>Hardicnutes</hi> reign, which <hi>Eadſi</hi> crown'd him King, as <hi>Matt. Weſtminſter,</hi> An. 1038. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> and <hi>Godwin,</hi> atteſt. And therefore he might as groſly miſtake in other things. 4ly, It appears by the recital it ſelf, that it was writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 130 years at leaſt after this Council under <hi>Cnute,</hi> becauſe it recites, it preceeded the Decrees made ſo long after, under Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> An. 1150. 5ly. The form of the Prologue, <hi>Haec ſunt Statuta, &amp;c.</hi> coupled with, <hi>ad ſuum convocans Parliamentum in ſuo publico Parliamento:</hi> and, <hi>aliis Epiſcopis ipſorum Suffraganeis,</hi> prove it not to be written before King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt his reign; when ſuch phraſes came firſt in vſe: Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cooke</hi> himſelf informing us in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that in <hi>Cnute</hi> his reign, ſuch State-Aſſemblies were ſtiled <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerandum Concilium Sapientum, &amp; ſic enim apud

If there were then any ſuch Parliament as this then held at <hi>London,</hi> and ſuch proceedings in it concerning <hi>Godwin,</hi> it was moſt probably in the year 1043. as I here place it.

               <p n="1">1. That there is mention onely of the King, Earls and Barons preſent in this Parliament as members of it, not of any Knights of ſhires, Citizens or Burgeſſes elected by the people, of which there is not one ſyllable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Earls and Barons in Parliament were the onely Judges in that age in Parliament between the King
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:118756:139"/>
and his Nobles, ſubjects, both in criminal and other cauſes there decided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Peers in that age were onely tryed and judged by their Peers, for treaſon and capitall offences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That appeals of Treaſon were then tryed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Earls and Barons the ſole Judges of them, and of what offences were Treaſon and what not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Biſhops and Clergy in that age had no votes in matters of Treaſon and capitall offences.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Judgement of Parliament then reſted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the Earls and Barons, not the King: and that their judgement was not repealable by, but obligatory to the King himſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That no Subject could then by law wage battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King in an Appeal.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the murther of Prince <hi>Alfred,</hi> then heir to the Crown, in the time of <hi>Harold</hi> an actuall King by uſurpation without any good title, by his command, was reputed a treaſonable offence in Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> for which he forfeited his lands, and was forced to purchaſe his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and lands reſtitution with a great fine and ſumme to the King.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That though the Author of the Chronicle of <hi>Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (&amp; <hi>Caxton</hi> out of him) ſtile this Aſſembly PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTUM, a Parliament, not a COUNCIL, yet it is onely <note place="margin">

               <p>From which paſſages and charters (which I have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled all together for their coherence in matter, though differing ſomewhat in time) I ſhall obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That parliamentary great Councils in that age, were ſummoned by the King upon all extraordinary occaſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Prelates, Nobles, and Barons of the Realm were the onely members of the great parliamentary Councils (ſummoned onely by the Kings writs) without any Knights or Burgeſſes that we read of elected by the people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Kings of <hi>Engl.</hi> in that age could not depart out of the Realm (no not to pay their ſolemn vows to God) nor appoint Vice-royes, Guardians, Officers, Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Commanders, to govern or defend the Realm in their abſence, without the advice and conſent of their Nobles, in parliamentary Councils: nor yet endow Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries with any Crown-lands, or Royal priviledges by their charters, unleſs by conſent and confirmation of their Nobles and themſelves in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Nobles and grand Councils of <hi>Engl.</hi> had then a negative voyce, not onely to conclude againſt the King in his reſolutions and intentions, but even in his ſacred and religious vows, when prejudicial, dangerous &amp; miſchievous to the Realm, the publick peace &amp; ſafety.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Kings ought to ſubmit to the juſt petitions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice &amp; deſires of their Nobles, Councils and people, in all things which concern their ſafety &amp; tranquil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity, though contrary not only to their private reſolutions, but vows.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Nobles and Subjects of that age were very zealous both of the ſafety of their Kings perſons, the kingdoms peace and ſecurity, and the hereditary ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Crown.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the Kings abſence out of the Realm, or death, without any hereditary iſſue or heir, is exceeding pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous and miſchievous to the Realm, yea the cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeditions, tumults, perturbations and ruins.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the ſacred vows of Kings prejudicial to the Realm may and ought to be violated and diſpenſed with;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118756:146"/>
and that by the reſolution of two Popes, three Roman Synods, and two parliamentary Councils.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That God doth many times not onely preſerve the right heirs to the Crown from the hands of bloody Tyrants and Uſurpers who ſeek their life, but likewiſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly and unexpectedly reſtore them to the Crown again without war or bloodſhed, after many years ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from it by intruding armed uſurpers, as he did K. <hi>Edw.</hi> here after 25 years invaſion of his right, <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> after 21 years long before.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That right heirs to the Crown, when ſo miraculouſly reſtored and reinthroned in their Kingdomes, ought to be extraordinarily affected with, and thankful, bountiful and devout to God for it, and their ſubjects likewiſe, both in words and deeds; as King <hi>Edward</hi> his Nobles and Subjects were.</p>

Earl <hi>Beorn</hi> promiſed him to procure from the King that his Earldome ſhould be reſtored to him.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lve</hi> with 29. ſhips, he recalled as many of the diſmiſſed ſhips as he could, to encounter him. <hi>Oſgad</hi> having received his wife, ſailed with 6 of his ſhips into <hi>Denmark,</hi> the other 23 ſhips ſailed towards <hi>Eſſex,</hi> having taken a great booty about the promontory of <hi>Edelfe,</hi> they were all caſt away in a great ſtorm, but two, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were taken in the parts beyond the ſea, &amp; all the men in them put to the ſword.

               <p n="2">2. That King <hi>Swane</hi> the invading and uſurping Dane, after he had gotten the power of this Realm, impoſed it annualy on the Engliſh, and made it <hi>any early Tribute to pay his Army.</hi>

               <p n="8">8.

ſo we may likewiſe conclude that by the Law of that Age.</p>

               <p n="2">2. That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were then ſworn and obliged, to govern their people by good, juſt, and wholeſome Laws, and Cuſtomes, not by their arbitrary pleaſures, powers, or commands.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

The Kentiſhmen having thus encloſed him round about, caſting down their boughs, bended their bowes, drew out their ſwords, ſhaked their pikes, held forth their other arms, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their banners, and ſounded their trumpets in token of battel.

               <p n="7">7.

9.

That the ſordid Covetouſneſſe of Kings and Generals in oppreſſing their people, and depriving their Subjects and Souldiers of their juſt and lawfull ſpoils after victory over the Enemies, is a ready means to alienate their affections, and cauſe a defection from them to their Oppoſites.</p>
               <p n="18">18. That when God hath deſigned a perjured Vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or Nations ruine for their crying ſins, he ſuddenly ſtirs up unexpected Enemies and Inſtruments to effect, occaſions to facilitate it; and ſo infatuates them, that they become altogether uncapable of any good advice, and reject all Propoſitions and Accommodations, that might prevent the ſame; as <hi>Harold</hi> obſtinately did.</p>
               <p n="19">19.

ſolemn Oathes, even in Kings themſelves and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perſons: whoſe deteſtable perjury oft brings ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſtruction both upon themſelves, their kinred, Poſterity, and whole Armies and Kingdoms too; as in the caſe of <hi>Harold.</hi>

               <p n="23">23. That the barbarous murders, the cruel oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Innocent people, are apt to ſtirr up a univerſal Inſurrection againſt their Governors and Inſtruments; and uſually end in the dethroning, expulſion, death and deſtruction of the Authors of them; of which <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti</hi> yields us a notable preſident: And that people when once juſtly enraged againſt ſuch bloudy tyrannical Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, become altogether implacable, and will never brook their future Government over them.</p>
               <p n="24">24.

               <p n="25">25. That a few timorous Counſellors, Great Perſons or Clergy-men, in times of danger, are apt to diſappoint the magnanimous reſolutions, and daunt the heroical Spirits of ſuch who are moſt cordially affected both to their Native Countries Lawes, Liberties, and right heir to the Crown and to draw them to unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with them againſt both.</p>
