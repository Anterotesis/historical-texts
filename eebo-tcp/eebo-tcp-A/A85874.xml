            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The right honorable the Lords
Aſſembled in
PARLIAMENT:
<hi>The humble Petition of Sir <hi>John Gayer</hi> Knight and
Alderman of <hi>London;</hi>
               </hi>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat by the 29 Chapter of the great Charter, <hi>all Commoners are to be tryed by
their equals;</hi> and there are 30 Seſſions of Parliament which confirm the great
Charter, being a Statute declaratory of the Common Law; eſpecially thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Laws, wherein your Lordſhips had your ſhares in making of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Petition of Right in the 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Caroli,</hi> and the Act for aboliſhing the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
the Councel Table, in the 17. <hi>Caroli,</hi> in which many Statutes are enumerated, <hi>That
Commoners ought to be tryed by their equals, by Bill of Indictment or writ original, and by
thoſe of their neighbourhood;</hi> And all Decrees and Judgments made contrary thereunto, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
thereby to be <hi>null and void in Law,</hi> which bars al Preſidents: And by ſeveral Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Ordinances your Lordſhips have declared, that <hi>Ordinances are no Laws,</hi> but temporary,
during the Wars; and the cauſe of neceſſity being taken away, your Lordſhips have promiſed
the free people of <hi>England, that they ſhall be governed according to the known Laws of the
Land,</hi> as it appears in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> dated the 15 of <hi>January,</hi> 1647. And it is againſt the
Law of <hi>God, Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> that any perſon or perſons ſhould be <hi>Judg</hi> or <hi>Judges,
Examiner</hi> or <hi>Examiners</hi> in their <hi>own cauſe,</hi> or to be tryed any otherwiſe then by a <hi>known
Law, for where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> It is declared by Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi>
that the Parliament cannot make a <hi>Law</hi> againſt the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is cuſtom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Right</hi> and neceſſary <hi>Reaſon.</hi> That Preſidents are nothing in compariſon of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and <hi>Statute Laws,</hi> being known Maximes in Law, <hi>A facto ad jus non valet Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;
Gubernandum eſt legibus non exemplis:</hi> Articles are nothing in Law but meer <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Prerogative extrajudicials,</hi> eſpecially when ordinary perſons are in queſtion. The
old maxime in Law is, <hi>Non recurrendum eſt ad extraordinaria quando fieri poteſt per ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
And your Lordſhips are not only <hi>ſworn,</hi> but have joyned by your legiſlative power to
impoſe ſeveral oaths upon the free Commoners of <hi>England,</hi> to defend the <hi>fundamentall
Laws of the Land.</hi> And I am confident your Lordſhips will be very tender of the preſervation
of the <hi>great Charter,</hi> in which is wrapped up our <hi>lives, liberties</hi> and <hi>estates.</hi> Your noble
Predeceſſors being ſo glorious and famous Inſtruments in aſſiſting the PEOPLE, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
