         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mountebankes that dare venture to vent
their Quackſaluing Conceipts, to mooue
mirth, in time of a mightie Mortalitie, and
when GOD and KING calls for Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
The very Title of this <hi>Tract</hi> is <hi>Teares;</hi>
the <hi>Subject, Sad;</hi> the <hi>Matter, Mournfull;</hi> in <hi>a
ſorrowfull Seaſon;</hi> in <hi>a perplexed Place:</hi> All
true, and really too true: If it were the
will of GOD, would it were not ſo: Yet
all is heere related by way of Meditation,
and but generally: particular Sad and
Mournfull accidents, I doe but touch,
though I know many: For example, of
whole Families ſwept away by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of GODS Deſtroying Angell; ſome
conſiſting of 5. ſome 6. ſome 7. ſome 8.
ſome 9. and 10. perſons in a Familie; and
none left to lament the loſſe of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
nor any lawfull Inheritour left,
or hardly to bee heard of, to lay clayme
to the Goods and Eſtate remayning: and
if any ſuch found out, how ſhie and
<pb facs="tcp:5692:7"/>
fearefull to enter and take poſſeſſion of
the ſaid Goods? I know, I ſay, the
names of ſuch Families, the places where
they dwelt: yea, and Nurſes, and ſuch
like keeping-Creatures going away with
the beſt part of ſuch Goods as are left in
the Houſes: whiles Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
hearken after the right Inheritours.
And who is there remaining in this Citie,
that hath not a ſhare in the knowledge,
more or leſſe, of this Tragedie, of thoſe
that are dead from vs? Now, for our
<hi>Londoners</hi> that fled from vs, their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment
in the Countries about vs, and
in the ſeuerall Shires of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
I muſt leaue you to thoſe forced
and farced, if not feigned, Relations
before ſpecified: or rather to their
owne Reports by their Letters, and at
their returnes: bad enough, and too
bad, I partly heare it hath beene: for
which the Countries hard-heartedneſſe to
Citizens extended my Prayer ſhall be, that
God haue not a ſcourge in ſtore for them.
<pb facs="tcp:5692:8"/>
And ſo not to trouble farther with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
I referre and commend you to

with free Commerce, Merchandizing and Trading with all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5692:9"/>
Merchants of Chriſtendome; yea, I may ſay, of the whole
World, am now become the moſt forlorne place of the
whole Kingdome: For, by reaſon of the Contagious Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Peſtilence raigning within my Circumference
and about my Skirts; Firſt, my Gracious Soueraigne hath
forſaken me, and high time it was, (conſidering the diſaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
accident in his Majeſties Houſe at <hi>White-Hall</hi>) that
his Sacred Majeſtie ſhould abandon mee: for his Majeſties
Life and ſafety is more worth than many Millions of others

of all the Nobilitie, and Gentry of this Land: alſo the
Termes and Courts of Iuſtice haue ſuffered interruption by
reaſon of my Viſitation: the High Court of Parliament ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
and remoued farre away from me: but all this I
muſt confeſſe not without juſt cauſe. That which grieueth
me moſt &amp; addeth to my Affliction, is, my natural Children
the Citizens, all the wealthier ſort, who haue ſucked the beſt
ſap of their Eſtates from my Breaſts, haue abandoned me in
my greateſt Affliction; and whom haue they left, but the
pooreſt ſort to defend and ſupport me? And although I
will be more charitable than to cenſure all ſuch as fled from
me: For, I hold it lawfull in time of Infection for men to
leſſen their Houſes and remoue themſelues and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
with moderation: Yet as a Learned man hath lately
counſelled them, they ſhall giue me leaue to aduiſe them in
the ſame words; <hi>Let not rich Citizens by fleeing (vnleſſe they
likewiſe flee from their ſinnes) thinke to eſcape ſcot-free: So
long as they carry their ſinnes with them, the Lord will finde
them out, and his hand will reach them whereſoeuer they are.</hi>
And I adde thus much.</p>
            <p>For mine owne part, although I will not deale ſo harſhly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5692:9"/>
with you as St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did in the Goſpell, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe, with the Multitude, in theſe words: <hi>O yee gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

becauſe I your Mother haue to deale with a Multitude alſo,
let me aduiſe with you my Children in a milder manner, <hi>O
yee Generation of Citizens, (beloued Londoners) Men, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Brethren, (yea and Siſters too) tell mee, who hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
you to flee from the Vengeance of the Peſtilence?</hi> Yee
may call to minde that Gods Plague of the Peſtilence is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Holy-writ, the <hi>deſtroying Angell,</hi> and I muſt tell you
that <hi>Angels</hi> haue Wings, and can flee faſter than any of
your Coaches can hurrie, or your Geldings can gallop; And
doth not wofull experience tell you already ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Viſitation of the Peſtilence, that ſome of you
hauing ſent your beſt-beloued before-hand into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
(as Wiues, Children) meaning to follow after your
ſelues, and thoſe your beſt and deareſt beloued haue beene
infected with the ſame Sickneſſe before you could come,
and ſome againſt you came vnto them: and others of you
haue beene your ſelues arreſted and ſurpriſed with the ſame
before you could follow: How ſay you? Is not this true?
And was not, I ſay, the <hi>deſtroying Angell</hi> quicker therein
than either you, your Coaches or Geldings could bee? I
ſay vnto you therefore againe, as I ſaid before, (and I ſpeake
to all ſuch as flee hand ouer head without taking counſell of
God, &amp;c.) <hi>Who hath forewarned you to flee from Gods <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?</hi>
Firſt, what warrant haue you to flee? And I come
vnto you more particularly, Art thou a Magiſtrate? Shew
me thy warrant to flee, and who ſhall ſupply thy place to
ſee Iuſtice executed? Art thou a Priuate man, rich and
wealthy? who ſhall relieue the Poore in thy ſtead? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
thou wilt anſwere me, that though thy preſence be
abſent yet thy Purſe is preſent: and if ſo thou canſt ſay, and
ſay truly, it is well. But alas, how many ſcore I might ſay
Hundreds of you haue gone; nor leauing nor ſending any
ſuccour for the Poore? Inſomuch, that I may ſay, yee haue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5692:10"/>
left in a manner none but the Poore to relieue the Poore.
1. The poorer and meaner ſort of Houſe-holders (many
whereof haue need of reliefe themſelues) to relieue poore,
aged, impotent, blinde, lame, ſicke and diſeaſed people:
who daily die in the fields and ſtreetes for want of ſuccour
and ſuſtenance.</p>
            <p>Our Calamitie extendeth yet further: For we that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in about <hi>London,</hi> being for the moſt part, but poore
I ſay our ſelues, and men of meane eſtates; ſome of vs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
had our Houſes viſited, and ſo ſhut vp for a long ſpace;
and others of vs taking no money at all, neither for our
Wares nor worke, the whole Countrie and Kingdome in a
manner baulking vs, and refraining to ſend or buy any
Wares of vs: and all this while, wee hauing our ſelues,
wiues, children and ſeruants to care for, and to maintaine,
and beſides ſitting at great Rents, (yea, and many of vs
hauing vnmercifull Landlords,) and hauing no Rents nor
Reuenewes our ſelues; nor other meanes to helpe vs, beſides
our manuell Trades, Occupations, and Shopkeeping. All
which conſidered, was not, and is not our caſe lamentable?</p>
            <p>And as a further Addition to our preſent Affliction;
There are a Generation of Iuſtices of Peace, who deuiſed
an vniuſt and vnpeaceable way to famiſh vs that remained;
For, firſt, they hindred our <hi>London</hi> Butchers to come into
their adjacent Townes and Hamlets to fetch Cattell, for
our food: Secondly, they made Decrees, Orders, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
which they cauſed to be read publikely in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
(and this their fact, becauſe publike, will purchaſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fame or infamie to poſteritie:) that our Market-folke
of the ſame Townes and Hamlets be reſtreyned, vpon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
to bring vs into <hi>London</hi> freſh Victuals, (as Mutton,
Veale, Butter, Egges, and the like,) for our Moneyes;
whiles they themſelues drinke their Wine and ſtrong Beere
in Bowles, (little thinking on the Affliction of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>)
follow their ſports; as Hawking, Hunting, Gaming, Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the like; and faring deliciouſly euery day: but let
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5692:10"/>
them take heed it fare not with them hereafter as it did with
the rich Glutton in the Goſpell. (who certes was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
Iuſtice of Peace) for this their inconſiderate Crueltie:
Inſomuch, that were it not for the wonderfull prouidence of
God, who feedeth the Rauens, yea, all the World (beyond
the comprehenſion of their groſſe capacities,) many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
in and about this Citie that remaine, might haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
and ſtarued. I doubt not but after this great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
ſome of vs ſhall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>uruiue to make our complaint vnto
his moſt Excellent Maieſtie of this their cruell Plot; but I
doubt they will not eaſily anſwer it. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
hath a ſhrewd ſentence againſt ſuch vnjuſt Iuſtices: the
words are theſe,<note place="margin">Iſai. 10. &amp; 1.</note> 
               <hi>Woe vnto them that decree vnrighteous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brees,
and that write grieuouſneſſe, which they haue preſcribed.</hi>
And howſoeuer, becauſe they cannot reſtraine vs from
Charitie; We will and doe with our Sauiour Chriſt, pray,
<hi>Father forgiue them they know not what they doe,</hi> and with
holy St. <hi>Stephen, Lord lay not this (Crueltie) vnto their
Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let me your Mother come, and condole with
you my Children the Citizens, and Inhabitants that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in and about the Citie; reſoluing to endure the heat
of the Day of Gods Viſitation: and againe, I wiſh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Jeremies</hi> Wiſh:<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 1.</note> For, goe we into the Suburbs, what
doe wee heare but lamentable voyces and cryings of
the viſited Poore? <hi>O we are ſicke, and we die, wee periſh, for
want of reliefe, meanes, and looking to?</hi> goe wee into the
Fields-here lies one ſicke and fainting with the ſame crie as
before, there lies another dead: Come wee backe into the
heart of the Citie, in one houſe ſits one lamenting, <hi>O I haue

in on other, <hi>O I haue loſt my deare Husband, the ſtaffe
and ſtay of my life, and of my Childrens:</hi> in an other, Father
and Mother lamenting the loſſe of their childe, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
nay, I know ſome <hi>Rachels,</hi> mourning for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and will not be comforted; in another, helpleſſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5692:11"/>
lamenting the loſſe of both their Parents: in another
place, whole Families ſwept away; Parents, Children, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
and all: and at leaſt-wiſe, in what ſtreet or Familie
can we come? but we heare a voyce of mourning for one
kinſman or kinſwoman or other, in this or that place decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of this deuouring diſeaſe:<note place="margin">Iuly.—Auguſt.—</note> Sure I am, that euen I, the
writer hereof, (who euer I am,) am not without my ſhare
of cauſe of mourning in this kinde. But come we againe to
the State of this Citie: In the day time, what elſe heare we
almoſt but Bells ringing of Knells? and in the night ſeaſon
(when we ſhould take our reſt,) we are interrupted by the
continuall tolling of Paſſing-Bells, and anon the ringing
out of the ſame: In the day time alſo, how many both men
and women haue beene ſeene ſuddenly to ſinke downe in
the ſtreetes, and there drawe their laſt breathes? yea, ſome
of them of good ranke and faſhion: All which compelleth
me, and I can no longer forbeare mee to borrow the very
words of the Prophet <hi>Ieremies</hi> Complaint.<note place="margin">Lam. 1. &amp;. 1.</note> 
               <hi>How doth the
Citie ſit ſolitarie that was full of people? and how is ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

Princeſſe among the Prouinces, how is ſhe become tributarie?
ſhee weepeth ſore in the night, and her Teares are on her
cheekes: among all her louers ſhee hath none to comfort her, all
her friends haue dealt treacherouſly with her, they are become
her enemies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> And againe, <hi>The wayes of Syon do mourne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <hi>viz.</hi> (London) <hi>remembred in the dayes of
her affliction, and of her miſeries, all her pleaſant things that ſhe
had in the dayes of old, when her people fell into the hand of
the Enemie, and none did helpe her; the Aduerſaries ſaw her,
and did mocke at her Sabbaths.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> Againe, London, <hi>hath grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5692:11"/>
ſhe fighteth and turneth backward. Her filthineſſe is in her
skirts, ſhee remembreth not her laſt end, therefore ſhee came
downe wonderfully: ſhee had no comforter,</hi> &amp;c. It is worth
your reading, to reade ouer that firſt chapter of the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
when you thinke vpon the preſent eſtate of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<hi>London:</hi> eſpecially, haue recourſe vnto the 20. verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the latter end thereof.</p>
            <p>I cannot yet forget the want of you my Children the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>London,</hi> for whoſe abſence ſtill the crie of the
Poore ringeth the lowdeſt peale in mine eares: Put the caſe
that the Magiſtrates now in place of Gouernment for this
yeare, (whoſe liues are as deare vnto them as any of yours)
I meane the right Honourable the Lord Maior, and the
Right Worſhipfull the Sheriffs, ſhould flee from my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
as yee haue done; what Ryots, Rapines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vproares
would be committed in and about the Citie? by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Sharkes, Shifters, Decoyes, Roarers and Robbers,
that continually liue and lie lurking about the Citie, vpon
the Ruines of other men: And may we not well remember
euen ſince the beginning of this Viſitation, and no longer
agone but the laſt <hi>Trinitie</hi> Terme, what a horrible Ryot
was begun in <hi>Holborne?</hi> when a companie of Swaggerers
had combined to reſcue a Gentleman, (bearing the name
of <hi>L. L.</hi> a Nobleman) out of the Vnder-Sheriffs houſe, and
what a deale of blood had beene like to be ſpent in the ſame
buſineſſe? had not the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> beene ſent for
ſpeedily, who came with a ſtrong Guard; at whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and preſence the Reſcuers betooke themſelues to their
heeles, and not one of them durſt ſtand to it, or ſtrike one
blow more, though in enterchange of blowes before they
came betweene the Reſcuers and the Vnder-Sheriffs Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
there was ſome blood ſhed: All I ſay appeaſed at the
preſence of the Magiſtrate: and the Gentleman the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſubmits and commits himſelfe into the hands of the
Sheriffs of <hi>London:</hi> Who, had they beene abſent out of
<hi>London,</hi> which miſchiefe I ſay had happened vpon that Ryot,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5692:12"/>
I leaue wiſe men to iudge. And againe, ſince that time,
when the Priſoners in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Priſon combined to
reſcue themſelues out of Priſon, and to that end had gotten
the Keyes and bound the Keepers: in which Ryot ſome
blood was ſhed, and though ſome of the Priſoners enlarged
themſelues, yet other ſome for their labours loſt their liues:
but how much more blood had beene ſhed, and how many
more had beene ſlaine, if ſome in Authoritie had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
their helpe, we may well gueſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs come yet more particularly to the gouernment of
this Citie, which is diuided into ſo many ſeuerall Wards: &amp;
euery Ward hath its particular Alderman to gouerne it, in
ſeeing to the Orders and diſorders in it. Now, the Alderman
he fleeth into the Country, &amp; for his excuſe he ſaith, he leaues
his Deputie behinde him: the Deputie he follows the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(if he be not gone before him) &amp; leaues Conſtables be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him, to ſee to matters: the Conſtables haply they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Deputie, and peraduenture they leaue the Beadle
behinde them: Well, the Beadle he is left behinde for all: he
ſees many diſorders and Ryots happen in his Ward: Now,
I would faine know, who will obey a Beadle as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate?
or what power hath a Conſtable or Beadle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
or puniſh without the Alderman, being the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate?
Againe, the Conſtable or Beadle haply may be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſickneſſe; yea, peraduenture dieth: I would faine
haue any abſent Alderman anſwer what miſchiefe againſt
God and King may not be done in his Ward without any
controll at all: And for thoſe few worthy Magiſtrates that
haue continued the heate of the Day with vs, ſee the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God extended to them, in their calling: for all this
time paſt of mortality, I haue not heard that ſcarce the head
of any of them hath aked: Wee may well conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Magiſtrates, eſpecially ſuch as are in preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
and ſworne for their yeare, may not flee from
the Citie in time of greateſt Contagion, though their
liues bee farre more worth, for the Good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5692:12"/>
than the liues of ordinary men.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the Miniſters of Gods Word: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they may flee, I meane ſuch as haue the charge and
Cure of Soules: (ſuch alſo their liues are as deare vnto
them as others, yea and of more value than other ordinary
men:) yet they may not nor is it lawfull for them to flee in
this time of Contagion: And I will ſend them to bee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of a Reuerend and learned Diuine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Hall, Epist. Decad. 4. Epist. 9.</note> a man of their owne
Coat and Calling, who hath long ſince written to conclude
the vnwarrantableneſſe of their flight in the time of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence,
in theſe lines following:</p>
            <p>
               <q>How much better is it to bee dead, than negligent, than
faithleſſe? If ſome Bodies bee contagiouſly ſicke, ſhall all
Soules bee wilfully neglected? There can bee no time wherein
Counſell is ſo ſeaſonable, ſo needfull. Euery threatning findes
impreſſion, where the minde is prepared by ſenſible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
When will the Yron hearts of men bow, if not when
they are heat in the flame of Gods Affliction? Now then to
runne away from a neceſſary and publike Good, to avoyd a
doubtfull and priuate Euill, is to runne into a worſe euill than
wee would avoyd. Hee that will thus runne from <hi>Niniue</hi> to
<hi>Tharſis,</hi> ſhall finde a Tempest and a Whale in his way. Not
that J dare bee an Author to any of the priuate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitation of
infected Beds: I dare not without better warrant. Who hath
euer ſaid wee are bound to cloſe vp the dying eyes of euery de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
Christian? And vpon what-euer Conditions to heare
their last groanes? If wee had a word, I would not debate of
the ſucceſſe. Then, that were Cowardlineſſe, which now is
Wiſedome. Is it no ſeruice, that wee publikely teach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort?
That wee priuately prepare men for Death, and arme
them against it? That our comfortable letters and meſſages
ſtirre vp their fainting hearts? That our loude voyces pierce
their eares afarre, vnleſſe wee feele their pulſes, and leane vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Pillowes, and whiſper in their eares? <hi>Daniel</hi> is in
the Lyons Den; Is it nothing that <hi>Darius</hi> ſpeakes comfort
vnto him thorough the Grate, vnleſſe hee goe in to ſalute him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5692:13"/>
among thoſe fierce Companions? A good Miniſter is the
common goods, Hee is not his owne but the Peoples, hee cannot
make his life peculiar to one, without iniurie to many.
In the common cauſe of the Church, he muſt bee no niggard of
his owne life; in the priuate cauſe of a neighbours bodily
ſickneſſe, he may ſoone be a Prodigall. A good Father may
not ſpend his ſubſtance on one Childe, and leaue the reſt Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
If any be reſolute in the contrarie, J had rather praiſe
his courage, than imitate his practice. I confeſſe, I feare, not
ſo much death, as want of warrant for death.</q> And ſo much
for that reuerend Doctours writing, a faithfull labourer in
Gods Harueſt: which I hope is vnanſwerablie, enough to
proue rhat Miniſters may not flee from their Charges in
time of the Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>I muſt now proceed to Phyſicians (with whom I include
Chirurgions) whom,<note place="margin">Eccluſ: 38.</note> I finde <hi>ordained of God,</hi> and we ought
to <hi>honour them:</hi> but, wherefore <hi>ordained</hi> and to be <hi>honoured?</hi>
Why, the ſame Diuine Author ſaith, euen <hi>for the vſes which
we may haue of them.</hi> 1. For the health of thy body: Are
they therefore to flee from vs in the time of the Peſtilence?
Surely nothing leſſe: for then we haue moſt vſe, need, and
<hi>neceſſitie</hi> of them: If therefore the Magiſtrate, that hath
the care of the Common-wealth committed to his charge
by the King: and the Miniſter who hath the care of mens
Soules committed to his charge by God, may not (with
a ſafe Conſcience) flee in this time of contagious
Sickneſſe, as is before proued; I ſee no reaſon why the
Phyſician, who hath the care of mens bodies, ſhould flee
and leaue vs deſtitute of his helpe, for which he was <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
Can he gather ſo much out of the time of a common
Mortalitie, by his Fees of vs, that the ground will not
hold him, but he is mounted on his Foot-cloth? and muſt
he needs flee from vs, when we haue moſt vſe and need of
his company and his Counſell, when thouſands are daily
ſicke, and many die for want of meanes? But me thinkes
I heare Phyſicians anſwer, They leaue vs not deſtitute, they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5692:13"/>
leaue vs inferiour foot-Phyſicians: Wee confeſſe, indeed,
through the Prouidence of God we are not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute,
God mouing the hearts of ſome Phyſicians and
Chirurgions to ſtay amongſt vs, in their Calling; but that is
no thanke to them: for they flee, not regarding ſo many
thouſands they leaue behinde them, whether they ſinke or
ſwim, liue or die: but with what Conſcience, conſidering
the premiſſes I leaue to their owne conſiderations: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
thoſe Phyſicians and Chirurgions that haue in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable
reſpect to their Callings,) more than in reſpect of
gaine,) ſtayed with vs, giuen, and vſed their beſt counſell
and endeuours to ſuch as haue beene viſited, this great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie:
they certes are the men that deſerue the <hi>honour,</hi>
which we are conſelled to giue <hi>to the Phyſician:</hi> wee may
make queſtion whether ſuch as are fled from vs, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo braue and wealthy, deſerue any of that honour, or
no: Yea, in my iudgement wee owe thoſe that haue ſtayed
double honour.</p>
            <p>Well, for all this that hath beene ſaid or can be ſaid, of
Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Phyſicians and Chirurgions; many
of each neuertheleſſe haue fled from vs, and their excuſes
and apologies are diuers and various: yet for the moſt part
they jumpe in this one voyce and ſong; <hi>They flee,</hi> they ſay;
<hi>for their Liues,</hi> from the danger of a Contagion: to which
I anſwer, they were deceiued, for ſome of them, vpon my
knowledge, <hi>haue fled for their Deaths:</hi> I will ſay no more
vnto them, <hi>Sapienti verbum ſat est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for ſuch Magiſtrates, ſuch Miniſters, and ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
as haue ſtayed and endured the heate of the day with
vs: I ſhall not need to name them: I make no doubt but
their names are taken in Gods Booke, who is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the labour of their loue: My poore and vnworthy
Prayer for them ſhall euer be, <hi>The good Lord requite them:</hi>
and <hi>the Bleſſing of him that dwelt in the Buſh bee with them
for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That priuate and ordinarie men may not take that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5692:14"/>
libertie they doe, to flee in theſe times ſome leauing their
Callings, ſome their Families, promiſcuouſly and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly,
I haue ſaid enough in the premiſſes to ſatisfie any
reaſonable men.</p>
            <p>But now, beloued Londoners, let vs come and ſearch the
cauſe of this contagious Peſtilence, which cauſeth your
fearefull flight: Surely, it is nought elſe but our ſins which
haue incenſed the heauy wrath of God: And which I may
reduce theſe ſeuen Heads following; <hi>Swearing and blaſphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
Prophaning and not ſanctifying the Sabboth: Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and Fornication: Drunkennſſe and Gluttonie: Oppreſſion
and Extortion: Contempt of Gods word and Sacraments:</hi> To
which I may adde, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>fulneſſe of Bread,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Poore:</hi> (I pray God the other not to be named
ſinne of <hi>Sodome</hi> be not alſo perpetrated in ſome corners
and Sinkes of this Citie:) which ſinnes now reigning, I
briefly diſplay as followech; Firſt, for Swearing, doth any
Age or any Record make mention of the like ſwearing and
taking the moſt ſacred Name of God in vaine, as in now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
by Men, Women, and Children? yea, many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
no ſooner taught to ſpeake, but they learne alſo to
ſweare by the moſt ſacred name of God; before they know
God: nay, there are a ſort of ſwaggering Swearers, who
thinke themſelues not Maſters in their (curſed) Art of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
till they haue deuiſed, and doe vſe ſome new Oathes
and manner af Swearing: (O fearefull!) ſo as I may ſay
for this one ſinne, the Land mourneth: for this ſinne, this
Citie now mourneth: Commendable and agreeable to
Gods word, was that pious Statute Enacted laſt yeare by
the worthy Houſe of Parliament againſt <hi>Prophane Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</hi>
though by negligence of men I feare it taketh not ſo
good effect to reſtraine that ſinne as was hoped: For what
reformation can we ſee?</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the Saboath day, commonly called the Lords
day, what Feaſtings, what Gamings and vnlawfull Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
what ſlie and ſecret Reuellings and haunting of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5692:14"/>
Tauerns and Taphouſes? more than Gods houſe, on that
day, by many looſe people? what Surfetting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
on that day? ſome eating and drinking on that day
ſo much, that either they ſleepe it out at home, or if they
come to Gods Houſe they ſleepe out the time of diuine
Seruice and Sermons: Inſomuch, as I may ſay, they haue
polluted the Lords Sabboths: which alſo is an other
cauſe of Gods heauie Viſitation of this Citie, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for Adulterie and Fornications, they haue beene,
and I feare me are ſo common, eſpecially about the skirts of
this Citie, as if there were neither Lawes of God nor Man
againſt them: inſomuch, as I may be bold to ſay they haue
beene ſo openly and commonly vſed in ſome places, as if
they had beene allowed and countenanced by Authoritie:
Yea, there are a company of ſwaggering Whoremaſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this Citie, who not content with their ordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
Strumpets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but will brag and boaſt of their abuſing
this and that mans Bed infamiliarity with his Wife: and of
their deflowring of this and that Maide: who haply are
honeſt Women, and chaſte Maides, that neuer had any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
at all with ſuch Companions: This ſinne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may as boldly ſay, is another cauſe of Gods Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Citie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for Drunkenneſſe and Gluttonie, they abound,
as if they were vncontrollable ſinnes, nay, as if they were no
ſins at all: many taking ſuch libertie in Drinking, that they
thinke they are not truly merry, vntill they be verily drunke;
and they being friends one with another, cannot (as they
ſay) loue each other, except they be drunke together: and
ſuch when they are told of it by any true Friends indeed,
ſuch, as feare God, they are ready fearefully to plead for
their Drunkenneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We call ſuch Drunkards, Beaſts,
but certes they are worſe than Beaſts, for what dumb Beaſt
is there that vſeth to be drunke? This ſinne therefore muſt
needs be another cauſe of Gods Viſitation of this Citie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:5692:15"/>
Fiftly, for oppreſſion of the Poore, and the couetous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
of many griping Vſurers, and Leaſe-munging
Landlords, the carefull complaint of many poore Priſoners
and Tenants, both Men and Women, in and about this
Citie, doth cry lowd in the Lords eares, and proclaime this
Sinne: Yea, how many a ſad weeping and mournfull
Countenance haue I, and may wee daily ſee of Men and
Women, eſpecially at the Quarter dayes (as we call them)
that are ſubiect to viperous Vſurers and vnconſcionable
Land-Lords? This ſinne therefore is vndoubtedly no ſmall
cauſe of this Gods heauy Viſitation.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, for Contempt of Gods word and Sacraments,
and the faithfull Miniſters thereof, this manifeſtly appeares
by the ſmall reformation of mens liues, eſpecially with the
prophane multitude, who giue no eare nor regard to heare
the ſacred word of God, which ought to be heard as it is
Preached, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: and for their perſons
that are the ſincereſt, and moſt zealous Preachers, euery
foule mouthd <hi>Rabſhecay</hi> hauing his tongue ſet on fire by the
flame of Hell, hath the moſt odious termes and aſperſions
to caſt vpon them and their doctrine, though it be the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of Chriſt, and they the Meſſengers thereof: And for
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, a Reuerend and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Diuine hath deliuered publikely, and is perſwaded,
that this preſent Peſtilence was ſent, and did begin about
Eaſter laſt, when a multitude of miſcreant people came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
and vnworthily, hand ouer head, to receiue the
Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as were Swearers and Blaſpheamers;
Sabboth-breakers: Common Whoremongers and Whores;
Panders and Bawdes: Drunkards and Epicures, or Belly-gods:
Oppreſſours, and Couetous wretches: Contemners
and Scoffers of Gods word and his Miniſters, yea, of the
Sacrament they came to receiue: which they came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
only for faſhion ſake, or elſe becauſe they would not
be lyable to the Law, penall in that kinde.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, for Pride; this Luciferian Sinne hath infected
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5692:15"/>
the Citie as much, if not more, than the Plague, at this
preſent: And though by the hawtie lookes of Men and
Women, we may iudge and diſcerne too much of the Pride
of their hearts, yet becauſe God is the tryer of the heart,
I leaue that; and come to the horrible Pride and and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie,
more apparant, in Apparaill: For, wee haue ſeene
Merchants and their wiues apparelled like Princes: wee
haue ſeene ordinary Tradeſmen and their wiues like No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and great Ladies. Knaues, Cheaters, and Cunny-catchers,
clad like Knights: Lawyers like Lords; Taylours
like Theeues: Shoomakers in Sattin: Tapſters in Taffety;
Horſe-ſcourſers and Hoſtlers wearing gold lace: Nay, I
haue ſeene a Coblers Daughter attyred like a Merchants
Daughter: a Kitchen-maide wearing a ſilken Cobweb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawne
Ruffe: and it is not ordinary to ſee Seruingmen in
ſiilken Stockings, and Prentices weare farre better clothes
than their Maſters? And this ſinne of Pride, the premiſſes
conſidered, we may perſwade our ſelues, that it is in a
higher degree than the Pride of <hi>Sodome:</hi> Which Sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt needs be one ſpeciall cauſe of drawing downe
Gods Vengeance of this preſent Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, for fulneſſe of Bread, and Contempt of the
Poore, becauſe I haue ſpoken of them in the Premiſſes,
though I could ſpeake much more, yet I deſiſt to diſplay
them further.</p>
            <p>There is another ſinne lurking, nay, too apparant, in and
about this Citie, which is the pride of the Clergie, many
Miniſters and their Wiues, (who ſhould be Lamps of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie:)
the which I heard a zealous Preacher of Gods
word deliuer publikely, hee was perſwaded was not the
leaſt cauſe of incenſing Gods wrath of the Preſent Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuce:
for me therefore, <hi>Satis ſuperque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of which heynous ſinnes before named, the
Prophet <hi>Zephanies</hi> Denunciation, or Gods by his mouth,
and complaint, may be fitly applied to <hi>London</hi> in theſe
words following;</p>

Shee obeyed not the voyce: Shee receiued not correction: Shee
truſted not in the Lord: Shee drew not neere to her God. Her
Princes within her are roaring Lyons: Her Judges are raeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Wolues, they gnaw not the bones till to morrow. Her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Jſaiahs</hi> ſaying and accuſation may alſo bee
verified and applyed to this Citie, in theſe words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>

            <p>And the ſame Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> proſecuteth his Complaint,

And ſeeing alſo that nothing can either bee well begun, nor
bee proceeded in, and ended, without good and fit Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
appropriated to each Action, (which dependeth vpon

conſideration of circumſtances for the ſame, except it bee

aſſiſt with thy Spirit of wiſedome, all ſuch Honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as are appointed by our Gracious King, Colleagues
and Aſſociates in Counſell for the adminiſtring of Warlike
affaires; Giue them both a quicke and ripe wit, to enquire
and ſearch out, what is fit and meet to come into their
Conſultations vpon the preſent; And then a diſcreet judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to finde and diſcerne what is moſt behoouefull for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the preſent Buſineſſe; And laſtly, a courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
to execute what by mature deliberation ſhall bee
decreed; and in all their Conſultations, let them ſpecially
attend vpon thy feare; knowing, that no counſell can bee
adminiſtred to preuaile and take effect, which is not guided
thereby. For, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>J Wiſedome dwell with
Prudence, and J finde out Knowledge and Counſels.</hi> To this

their eye-lids direct the way before thee, that They turning
neither to the Right hand nor to the Left, for feare; nor by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5692:24"/>
meanes of Corruption, or otherwiſe ſeduced from true feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
may at all times boldly and faithfully, aduance the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Buſineſſe, by ſuch Counſell as it requireth, to thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in the lawfull managing of thoſe <hi>Warlike affaires,</hi> euen
to the conquering of the Enemie, without doing wrong and
vnneceſſary violence, againſt the Law of Armes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
abandon farre from out their hearts all falſe, lewd,
and treacherous Counſels, which reſpect onely profit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due and Godly regard of <hi>right Iustice:</hi> Remoue all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
paſſions and affections, working by colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
for priuate gaine, or by malice mouing contentious
queſtions, of purpoſe to interrupt the courſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
by which the cauſe may bee hindred, and ſtrength
of Armes weakened, to the great prejudice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
As it ſhall ſeeme good to thy heauenly Will,
ſo bee pleaſed, wee beſeech thee, to be preſent and Preſident
with them at all times, in all their Counſels, that no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
no particular reſpects, nor quarrels, may draw them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
into Factions; But concurring in a mutuall and vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
conſent of opinions, may truely, and loyally aduance
the Common Cauſe, by preſuppoſing in their firſt thoughts
the end of that which is to bee preſented to the Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
alſo by fitting the beſt and ſafeſt meanes, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuing
the ſame end; And laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by putting in execution
what is determined with the leaſt charge and loſſe (if elſe it
cannot bee done.) And otherwiſe, O Lord, if their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
by the fauourable aſſiſtance of thy Spirit, ſhall bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
to a good and wiſhed ſucceſſe, let them out of the
knowledge of thy feare, ſay with thankeſgiuing; <hi>Not vnto
vs, O Lord, not vnto vs; but vnto thy Name, giue the
praiſe;</hi> For thou onely giueſt Prudence, and thou onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
by Prudence, whom thou makeſt wiſe in thee. Be thou
therefore onely glorified, in all the wiſedome of Men,
for thy Mercies ſake in CHRIST for euer,

               <p>O Glorious God, wee confeſſe it to be true, that thy

Hoaſt had pitched their Tents againſt me, yet my heart ſhould

<hi>Salomon,</hi> that Warre muſt be enterpriſed with Counſell:
Our humble Prayer and Supplication in Chriſt Ieſus is,
That it would pleaſe thee to grant vnto Him, who by thy
appointment is choſen of our Gracious King to be his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
to rule and gouerne this whole Fleet, aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Ships prepared (as wee hope and truſt) to fight
thy Battailes vpon the Waters, (or elſe-where by Land)
againſt thine Enemies &amp; ours, vniuſtly prouoking vs to fight;

Commanders of the Ships of Warre in this whole Fleet,
now in this preſent Voyage, Wiſdome, Diſcretion, aud Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
carefully to fore-ſee, and diligently to preuent all the
inconueniences that may hinder the Atchieuement of the

grace to Him, and to all ſuch as are called by way of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
for their experience to ayde and further the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cauſe, as well with ſound Policie, as with ſtrength of
Armes, (for in the multitude of them that can giue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

Giue vnto them all a conſtant Reſolution, grounded vpon
firme Faith in thee, by which they may be emboldned when
they encounter the Enemie, to ſay in the Spirit, <hi>Wee truſt in
God, wee will not feare what Fleſh can doe vnto vs.</hi> Cauſe the
ſpirit of our Enemies to faile in the midſt of them; Deſtroy

Let them be a ſpoyle vnto vs, that all other Princes
ſeeing how valiant thou art in Battailes, may cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with a Robe of Aſtoniſhment and ſay; Verily, the
Lord fighteth for his people, the Lord went forth with
their Armies, and conducted them: hee is the Shield and

which is a name of great feare and wonder ouer all the
