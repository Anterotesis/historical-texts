         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>WOrthy Friend, there
is a saying, <hi>Once well
done, and ever done;</hi> the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
men have so considerately
acted in their times, as by
their learned works, to build
their own monuments, such as
might eternize them to future
ages: our <hi>Iohnson</hi> named his,
Works, when others were
called Playes, though they
cost him much of the lamp
and oil, yet he so writ, as to
obliege posterity to admire
<pb facs="tcp:40261:4"/>
them; our deceased Heroe,
Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> knew how
to difference legitimate births
from abortives, his mighty
Genius anviled out what he
sent abroad, as his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
minde knew how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
betwixt writing
much and well; a few of our
deceased Poets pages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worth cart-loads of the
Scriblers of these times. It
was my fortune to be in
Newark, when it was besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
where I saw a few manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
of Mr. <hi>Cleavelands,</hi>
amongst others I have heard
that he writ of the Treaty at
Uxbridge, as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
since by a person I
intrusted to speak with one of
<pb facs="tcp:40261:4"/>
Mr. <hi>Cleavelands</hi> noble frends,
who received him courteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and satisfied his enquiries;
as concerning the papers that
were left in his custody, more
particularly of the Treaty at
Uxbridge, That it was not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
nor any of his other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
fit for the presse. They
were offered to the judicious
consideration of one of the
most aecomplisht persons of
our age, he refusing to have
them in any further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that they could be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
without some injury to
Mr. <hi>Cleaveland;</hi> from which
time they have remained sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and lockt up, neither can
I wonder at this obstruction,
<pb facs="tcp:40261:5"/>
when I consider the disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
our Authour met with in
the time of the Siege; how
scarce and bad the paper was,
the ink hardly to be discerned
on it; the intimacie I had
with Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> before
and since these civill wars,
gained most of these papers
from him; it being not the
least of his mis-fortunes, out
of the love he had to pleasure
his friends, to be unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
with his own manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts,
as I have heard him
say often, he was not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as to have any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
collection of his own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
they being dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his friends; some
whereof, when he writ for
<pb facs="tcp:40261:5"/>
them, he had no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but that they were
lost, or through the often
reading, transcribing, or fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, worn to pieces;
so that though he knew where
he formerly bestowed some
of them, yet they were not
to be regained; for which
reason the Poems he had left
in his hands, being so few, of
so inconsiderable a Volume,
he could not (though he was
often sollicited with honour
to himself) give his consent
to the publishing of them,
though indeed most of his
former printed Poems were
truly his own, except such as
have been lately added, to
make up the Volume; at the
<pb facs="tcp:40261:6"/>
first some few of his Verses
were printed with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the London Diurnal,
a stitcht pamphlet <hi>in quarto,</hi>
Afterwards, as I have heard M.
<hi>Cleaveland</hi> say, the copies of
verses that he communicated
to his friends, the Book-seller
by chance meeting with them,
being added to his book, they
sold him another Impression;
in like manner such small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
(though but a paper
or two of his incomparable
Verses or Prose) posted off o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Editions. I acknowledge
some few of these papers I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from one of M. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
neere Acquaintance,
which when I sent to his, ever
to be honoured, friend of
<pb facs="tcp:40261:6"/>
               <hi>Grayes</hi> Inne, he had not at
that time the leasure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
them; but for what he
had read of them, he told the
person I intrusted, That he did
beleeve them to be Mr.
<hi>Cleavelands,</hi> he having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
spoken of such papers
of his, that were abroad in
the hands of his friends,
whom he could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
my intention was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the collection of these
manuscripts for my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
use; but finding many
of these, I had in my hands,
already publisht in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Poems, not knowing
what further proceedings
might attend the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Presse, I thought
<pb facs="tcp:40261:7"/>
my self concerned, not out of
any worldly ends of profit,
but out of a true affection to
my deceased friend, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
these his never before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
pieces in Latine and
English, and to make this to
be somewhat like a volume
for the study. Some other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems
are intermixed, such as
the Reader shall find to be of
such persons, as were for the
most part Mr. <hi>Cleavelands</hi>
Contemporaries; some of
them no lesse eminently
known to the three Nations.
I hope the world cannot be
so far mistaken in his Genuine
Muse, as not to discern his
pieces from any of the other
Poems; neither can I beleeve
<pb facs="tcp:40261:7"/>
there are any persons so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
as not candidly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the heroick fancies of
the other Gentlemen that are
worthily placed to live in
this volume; some of their
Poems, contrary to my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
I being at such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
I have since heard, were
before in print: but as they
are excellently good, and so
few, the Reader (I hope) will
the more freely accept them.
Thus having ingenuously sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
thee in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
I shall not need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
more; but that I have,
to prevent surreptitious Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
publisht this Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that by erecting this Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide
of Honour, I might
<pb facs="tcp:40261:8"/>
obliege posterity to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
their memories, which is
the highest ambition of him,

                     <p>THis Academy, whom but even now
equally Marble with the widdowed
<hi>Niobe,</hi> grief congeal'd into a sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse-statue,
if this day she be restor'd to her
wonted smiles, 'tis to you, Great Princes, and
to your Auspicious presence, that she must
owe this happy change. The statue of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
darted upon by the Sun's royal beams is
reported by the ancients to have utter'd a
vocal harmony, nor is it lesse true, that even
these walls have now their charming chords,
from which as with a Plectre, or Quill, the
least glance of your countenance hath powr
to call forth a most melodious Sound, &amp; by a
strange contrariety of miracle, at the same
time the stones speak, and the Oratours are
struck dumb with admiration. It happens in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40261:53"/>
those, who are actuated with Divine impulse
that they so receive <hi>God</hi> as to cast off <hi>Man,</hi>
and that they understand rather by heavenly
instinct then by humane reason, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
your Divinity hath taken up its habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us, and with its over-powerfull splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
sacrificed all our sences, and yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a gain to have so gloriously lost our
selves. We now pardon the fates their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty,
and congratulate the imminent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of Letters as a favourable surprise,
for indeed the Muses must needs be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to die, if at your Royal feet they may be
admitted to breath their last: <hi>Archimedes</hi>
sportively imitated the Heavens in a Globe,
what hinders, but that I may affirm <hi>Iove</hi> to
be lively set forth in <hi>Charles;</hi> so that he, who
pointing to the earth cried out! O Heavens,
if at this present he had so declaim'd, he had
not committed a soloecisme with his hand,
for since I behold the best and greatest of
Kings and Princes in place together, me
thinkes the Princes birth-day seems to be
brought back to this present time in which
we see the Sun and Starre shining in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
though not with equal rayes, when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
died there appeared a new Starre in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which was generally called the Soul of
<hi>Iulius;</hi> the Epilogue of <hi>Caesar</hi> hath been
<hi>Charles</hi> his prologue, for what Starre was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40261:54"/>
to portend the great things to be done by
your off-spring (mighty King) then the Soul
of that most invincible <hi>Heroe.</hi> Starre did I
say? pardon me, great Sir, I should rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it was the Sun himself, who at that
time resign'd unto your hands the government
of the day; and, that he might the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
observe the Prince's Illustrious Cradle
he contracted his universal eye into a Starre;
Behold how <hi>Charles</hi> begins already <hi>Patrissare,</hi>
and with what haste and eagre pursuit he
soares up to his fathers virtues, that which we
read to have hapned of old, under the most
pious King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that the Sun went back
many degrees, is now in <hi>Charles</hi> his dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens't
by no lesse a wonder; nor was the
course of time then so much retarded as his
forward virtues have now hastned it and
brought it on, since in the very dawn of his
youth, he hath attained unto the noon of
perfection. Pardon me if my Oration swell
and sound nothing but Sun and Stars, since in
the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce's Nativity nature hath anticipated
my allegory; Oh happy Academy, in the
mean time, and invested with a kinde of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as comprehending at the same time in
King and Prince, both our <hi>Present</hi> and our
<hi>Future;</hi> what need we expect the ages to
come, having lived our own life, and that
of posterity together: But I fear least by an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40261:54"/>
officious zeal, I have been too tediously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
which in so illustrious a presence,
may soon grow up to a crime beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation.
The least absurdities committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a King, are like chinks which though
never so narrow, are discovered and inlarg'd
by the light that passeth through them; our
Oration thefore is to be corrected according
to the genius of the times, and that which is
superfluous to be lop't off; One prayer alone
remains to Usher in the close. Live, most
<hi>August,</hi> the desire and welfare of your own
and the terrour of your enemies, Live, even in
this descent of your age, the stay, and prop of
learning: Lastly, live adorn'd with so much
glory, that the Prince your Son may acquire
the name of <hi>Charles</hi> the Greatest, as being
lesse then his Father onely.</p>

                     <p>IF in never giving over our congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we are too importunate, I wish, that
every day new matter were afforded, of so
offending; the zeale of my duty feares no

disdains to meet with a <hi>Non ultra.</hi> It is a
more than ordinary satisfaction in frequent
Letters to ruminate upon your fortunes, and
(as <hi>Philoxenus</hi> wisht in another sense) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the pleasure of those delicacies with a
long-neckt quill; nor is it enough to rejoyce
onely for what is past; but to take hold on
the fore-lock, and congratulate for the future;
and this certainly is a provident and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
course, considering that your vertue
moves forward so fast, that within a short
while it will go near to transcend humane
limits, and so become ineffable; but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

going to offer up our respects, we observe
from a far off, at once, your splendour and
exaltedness. Veneration staggers when it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40261:56"/>
approacheth the Sun, and the trembling of
our lights confess a Deity, such is the abash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, that they cannot endure the
brightness of your rayes without an ocular
twilight, nor have we less awe of your exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness.
For as much as the Sacrificers zeal,
like the flame of the sacrifice, by how much
the more it ascends, so much the more it
trembles; but your clemencie disputes with
your greatness, and from this most friendly
strife (as if Nature were in travell) our duty
is to take its birth; we pardon the Fates their
incivility, and whatsoever hath happened ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
we embrace it as a favourable ambush.
So your fortunes seem'd to recoile back,
that they might spring forward with the
greater force; the event hath made good
the happiness of invention: the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant
now triumphs, and lately floating (as
heretofore the Ark) now rests upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
no more shall our Mother-Colledge
card and spin, or discover her sorrows by her
dejected countenance; the Muses, who could
not be said to live without an Hyperbole,
have now the confidence to shew their
excellencies; nor could it be otherwise, since

our ambition may at length be restrain'd by
some little curb put unto the full career of
your Honors; so that as when you shall seem

                     <p>HOw <hi>August</hi> your presence is, and
with how sacred a horrour it
strikes our mindes, I wish the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

testifie, for the same duty
which of late stirred me up with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to salute you, is now become
a kinde of religion in me, least I should
rush, an importunate inmate upon those
nice ears where the Counsels of Kings
have dwelt: Nor is it lesse a crime to
look upon you then to speak before you
lightning appears in your eyes, upon
whose too powerfull splendour who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall presume to look, must become
a Bidental sacrifice; If any of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:40261:61"/>
who have the Sun in Veneration
should chance to behold you, he would
take each of you for his own deity, and
so divide his sacrifice. But as to what
concerns our selves we confesse by our
dazled eyes the victory of your rayes,
and this genuine lustre of honour our
weak sight so much the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
by how much the lesse it is
able to indure the brightnesse of it;
Hail therefore thrice renowned guest,
whose most gratefull arrival (that our
breasts might be so much the more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious
to receive you) hath with the
excesse of joy driven us out of our
selves: behold how many greedy eyes
glut themselves with the beholding of
you, how many lents have we broken
in your gladsome aspect, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom we number amongst our
founders, by me as their Ambassadour
(a title I have cause to boast of) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
your coming hither, nor need
you envy me, most illustrious guest the
Title of Ambassadour, since your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
hath been pleased to descend to
my degree, which you have so lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon you, or rather our humility,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40261:61"/>
as in equal poize of the balances raised
it self up to your heighth. You have
seen our Schools, and that famous Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to the one of which you have taught
learing, to the other piety, and what
is there more among us that you can
desire to see, behold the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
behold our most Noble Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour;
who, whatsoever our <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
comprehends, represents with
high advantage; behold, our structures
and the Magnificence of our Schooles
wherein with the sport of Art we have
put to shame whatsoever hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> 'tis you, great Sir,
'tis you who are the Architect of our
fortune, and whose magnificence will
far exceed the highest glories we can
presume to imagin. I am the more
ample; most honoured guest, in the
deserved praises of our Chancellour that
you may be the more sensible, what
worthy, what <hi>Heroe,</hi> how great a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of others it is, who is this day sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to your virtue and excellence;
Certainly while I see two of the most
Illustrious personages of two such great
Nations in place together, there seems I
know not what Isthmus, maugre the
swelling ocean, to have joyn'd <hi>France</hi> &amp;

everlasting, and so strongly <hi>Gordian,</hi>
that no <hi>Alexander</hi> may be able to cut it
asunder with his sword. Farther I would
expatiate, and the zeal of my wishes
should still go on forward, but that by
the richnesse of the Argument, my
mouth already suffers a squinancie
greater then ever Demosthenes felt:
wherefore if I have been sacrilegious in
detaining overlong your ears accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
onely to the speech of Kings, if
in this I have been ought criminal, let
it at least be imputed to the provident
temerity of my over-hasty Oration,
that I may not be thought to have
come prepared to offend.</p>

will serve to climb your dignity? while
I suspect my cheeks to be hung with
your skarlet, nor do I know a more
subtle argument of that exceeding care
which holds me sollicitous of rendring
you your due respect then my silence
and astonishment, but whereas the
Prince of Poets brought the Senate of
the gods to his battel of Frogs &amp; Mice;
by the same reason I may make bold to
invite you to this sportive Combat, or
contention of ours, which is a shadow,
or image of war; the fight of the Mice

shell, and such also is the condition of
our task, that Mars and Venus may
here be seen intangled together. It is a
fight but sportive, a play which yet hath
in it somewhat of war; so that streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac't
Philosophy will not here be season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nor the bare Harp alone; he, who
clad in the Roab of manhood hath not
yet left his toyes, but seems as if he were
made up of jests, his Minerva I shall
esteem the posthume off-spring of his
own brain; the man, who appears a
meer Cato in these May-games, and
among the prickly Thorns of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
admits no flowers of Rhetorick, his
fancie like and Amazon seems bereft of
one pap. Our Souldier must be such a
one as can shew himself, both a light
Horsman of wit, and a Cuirasser of
Philosophy; who dares both manfully
dispute, and play at even, or odd with
the two legg'd <hi>Animal,</hi> and <hi>the Tripos,</hi> or

and Children; that which we see
happens in the divided, or double-spred
Eagle, where one body presents to
view two faces, the same is our double-
fronted condition towards hyou, Grave
Seniours, and toward these my Sons,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40261:71"/>
these, when I behold, I am the old Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and going about to expose my

rayes; when your selves, on the other
side I look upon, I also my self, I know
not how, return into a Chicken, and, like
a true Eagle, renew my youth. In this
Comedy therefore, I am to take upon
me two persons, in your Scene I must
act the Son, in yours the Father; the
one with a bended knee, the other stiff
as an Elephant: I fancie my self at
the tottering game cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where sometimes I possesse the upper
part, sometimes the lower; partly a
childe, partly an old man, like that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Aeson</hi> of old, half boil'd in the
cauldron of <hi>Medea;</hi> and what fitter
way can there be found out, than by
the rod of correction, to arrive at the
staff of authority; by the low settle of
a Son, to come to the reverend chair of
a Father. We must serve, that we may
obey; it is the rule of Courtiers: and,
according to <hi>Milo</hi>'s practice, the way
to come up to an Oxe, is to begin at
a Calf. To you therefore, most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Sages, our first fruits are to be
consecrated: but in case I shall be
thought to accost you with none, or,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40261:71"/>
which is as bad, with borrowed honor:
I see no reason, but my Sons may, with
the like disobedience toward me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
your injury; nor do I yet know
in the mean time, by what title to salute
you, whose learning may stile you the
Husbands of the University, whose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

day; so that <hi>Oedipus</hi> himself was
never branded with a more mysterious
incest, than each of you are guilty of,
being the Husband of your Mother,
the Son of your Wife, and the Father of
your brethren, nor do your Divine fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
rest here, your very Pourtraitures
being apt enough for generation, for as
our sacred Mother when she conceives,
puts some of your Idea's before her
eyes, and hath a representation of Souls
like unto you, that she may bring forth
a Masculine and perfect off-spring, such
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40261:72"/>
and so Authentick you are, that if you
had chanc't to live before Letters were
invented, your pictures express' as
Hieroglyphicks by the Egyptians might
have been read at this day instead of
Arts and Sciences, I am not addicted
to that vulgar errour, of those that
esteem nothing of any moment unlesse
what is ancient, such loath the present
time, and in favour of yesterday feed
upon course bread; Nature so sooth must
grow old, to our ancestors she gave acres
of Soul, to us but spans, they were Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
we but Dwarfs; how degenerous,
and truely little Souls have they that
persist in this opinion; the later ages
have gain'd, and not become bankrupt,
those indeed were the great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Letters, but how many families
are there, the first of which were, I will
not tell what, the second I cannot tell
what; a mean beginning hath oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a fair and happy progresse; let
the Ancients have attributed to them
what is their due, but let them not be
altogether Deified, they may challenge
to themselves their deserved praises, but
must not defraud you of yours; so much
respect I bear to the Ancients, that I

but to you belongs the Wheat,

attempt your Praises make my own

addressing himself to the Soveraigne
Judge, Spare me, said he, spare me great
<hi>Caesar,</hi> these Sons have I begot in the
Monument, and I have brought them
up carefully, to the end that we might
come the greater number of suppliants
before you; to you (curteous Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours)
I appeal, what could there have
been said more effectual then this; Vain
were thy hopes, O <hi>Cicero;</hi> In vain thy
great pains bestowed, or were thy
soaring phansies any thing but flashes,
thou wert but low, and flat in respect of
this most excellent of Oratours; nor,
hadst thou been shut up in thy <hi>Musaeum</hi>
with Rhetorick thy wife, couldst thou
ever have begot Orations like to his.
I render thee thanks, O <hi>Sabinus,</hi> for this
my excuse, who since I could not but
prove peccant, have yet by this means
met with so handsome a president of
begging favour. I have also my Sons to
shew, this croud of Rhetorick that
stands about me; Great, Great is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
of Children, who so much the
more prevail, by how much the lesse
they speak; their example therefore for
the present I shall follow, and doubt not
