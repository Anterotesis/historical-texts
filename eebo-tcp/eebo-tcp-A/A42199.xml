            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obſervable throughout all generations, that truth in its firſt appearance in the world can be very hardly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but rather oppoſed. I am ſure, of all truths, this hath not, nor is not like to eſcape. For Goſpel-truths will bring Goſpel-ſufferings: and therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art that wilt inquire into this truth, <hi>I</hi> begge of thee, that thou wouldſt firſt ſit down and conſider what it will coſt thee; and ſearch the Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things be ſo or no: For this is no new Doctrine, but that which hath been te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the mouths of all the Prophets: and conſider what the Apostle ſaith: For he hath choſen us unto ſalvation, through
<pb facs="tcp:45133:3"/>ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth. So that every truth is to be looked after by believers, becauſe that God, who is a God of truth, is ſweeth to be injoyed in all truth. Reader, accept of this ſmall mite, and the Lord grant that the eyes of thy understanding may be inlightned in the knowledge of Chriſt, as King, Priest, and Prophet unto thy poor ſoul; and then how ſweet will it be unto thee to conſider, that that King that rules and reigns in thy heart, ſhall ride Conquering and to Conquer, untill all his Enemies, both within and without, in thy heart, and my heart, and in the world, be made a footſtool: which ſhall be the deſire and prayer of him, who is a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto the</hi> God of Jacob,</p>

I ſhall make it appear, how all along this truth hath been teſtified unto from the firſt to the laſt: we ſhall begin with Gods promiſe unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> the thirteenth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the fifth verſe; And the Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaid unto <hi>Abraham</hi> after that <hi>Lot</hi> was ſeparated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, Northward, and Southward, and Eaſtward, and Weſtward: For all the land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed for ever. This land was the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Abraham;</hi> yea, and a promiſe that is yet to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. Abraham</hi> was in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and his ſeed after him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true; but in what condition? they were ſtrangers, and Pilgrims there, and this they confeſſed, and therefore this could not be a poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> I, but God in promiſing <hi>Abraham</hi> the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> it was a Type of the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45133:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, <hi>Abraham</hi> had an eye of faith to ſee into the promiſed reſt, as all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Jews have; However, there is more then this in the promiſe.</p>
            <p>For, obſerve how God cites this promiſe unto him: it is ſaid, After that <hi>Lot</hi> was ſeparated from him. I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but that <hi>Lot</hi> belongeth unto the general Aſſembly, and Church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but yet Gods Covenant muſt be with <hi>Abraham:</hi> now obſerve the promiſe, For all the land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy ſeed for ever; now we know that all the Types of the Law, as that of the bloud of Bulls, and Coats, and others, they did all center in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo every true believer hath entered into that reſt: but conſider what the Lord ſaith, The Land which thou ſeeſt, the breadth and length of it, will I give unto thee, and to thy ſeed for ever. And you ſhall finde in many places of Scripture, that when the Lord promiſes to bring back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Captivity of the Jews, (he ſaith) I will bring them into their own Land: a Scripture as clear as the Sun, for this, you may ſee in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6, 7, 8. Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a righteous branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and execute Juſtice and Judgement in the Earth. In his dayes <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely: and this is his name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our righteouſneſſe: and in verſ. 8. They ſhall dwell in their own Land. So that here is both the two Tribes, and the ten Tribes promiſed to enjoy their own Land again, which is the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> under the rule and reign of that righteous branch unto <hi>David,</hi> which is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for it is ſaid, he muſt execute Juſtice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the earth. That Chriſt is that branch ſpoken of, you may ſee plainly in the eleventh of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the firſt verſe: the whole Chapter is a ſweet diſcovery of the Kingdom of Chriſt; and in the ninth verſe (he ſaith) The earth ſhall he full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45133:4"/>Sea. We ſhall now begin with all the Prophets that have ſpoken in the name of the Lord: and that the Lord might be juſtified out of the mouths of the wicked, ſtand forth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Balaam</hi> in the 24th. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and the third verſe, And he took up his Parable, and ſaid, <hi>Balaam</hi> the Son of <hi>Beor</hi> hath ſaid, and the man whoſe eyes are open hath ſaid. Pray obſerve in the firſt place, it is ſaid in the ſecond verſe, that the Spirit of God was upon him: from whence I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this, that a Soul by the common enlightning of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may come to ſee into this and other glorious truths, and therefore it ought to be our care, that we have not onely that Spirit upon us, but the Spirit in us; and as Chriſt ſaith, Rejoyce not that the Spirits are ſubject unto you, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that your names are written in heaven: ſo I ſay, Rejoyce not in thy knowledge of this Kingdom, but rather that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is King in thy heart, whereby thou comeſt to have aſſurance that thou haſt an Intereſt in this glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all them that believe. But to go on where we leſt <hi>Balaam,</hi> in the ſeventh verſe: He ſhall pour the water out of his buckets; (ſpeaking of <hi>Jacob</hi>) and his ſeed ſhall be in many waters, and his King ſhall be higher then <hi>Agag,</hi> and his Kingdom ſhall be exalted. Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be higher then all the <hi>Agags,</hi> and <hi>Nimrods,</hi> and Potentates of the Earth. For he is the great and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo did by faith perceive what God would do for his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the laſt dayes, as you may ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Hannah</hi> in her ſweet ſong of deliverance propheſies of Chriſt, and of his Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. The adverſaries of the Lord ſhall be broken in pieces; out of heaven ſhall he thunder upon them; the Lord ſhall judge the ends of the Earth, and he ſhall give ſtrength unto his King, and exalt the horn of his anointed. Mark, friends, the Exaltation of Chriſt it lieth in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of his implacable enemies, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.1. The Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand untill I make thine Enemies thy footſtool: he ſhall give ſtrength unto his King:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45133:5"/>Jeſus Chriſt is the King of Gods own appointment, a King that God hath given unto his ſubjects, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. For unto us a Childe is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder; and his Nme ſhall be called, Wonderful, Counſeller, The mighty God, The everlaſting Father, The Prince of peace. Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his government and peace, there ſhall be no end, upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to ſtabliſh it with Judgement and Juſtice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this. That ſame Jeſus that is the King of his Saints and people, that Jeſus ſhall alſo be the King over all the Nations: <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. To him that overcometh, will I give to ſit with me on my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father on his Throne. So that here you may ſee that Jeſus Chriſt hath a Throne, which he calls more properly his Throne. Now what this overcomer ſhall do, you may ſee in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. To him will I give power over the Nations; agreeing with that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that Chriſt ſpake of, concerning the Lord and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: to him that had gained ten Talents, his Lord ſaith, Be thou ruler over ten Cities; and to him that had gained five, over five. But let us a little conſider this ſweet Prophecie of the ninth of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Some Expoſitors have much reaſoned whether they ſhould call <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a Prophet, or an Evangeliſt. And truly, though all theſe names that are given unto Chriſt be ſulfilled in reſpect unto his people in the ſtate of Grace, (for he is the wonderful Counſellour of his people in all ſtraits and difficulties, and he is the mighty God, for his own arm hath brought ſalvation, and he is the everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he is the Prince of peace; for Chriſt onely is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers peace) but it is ſaid, He ſhall be King upon the Throne of <hi>David.</hi> Now ye know that the Throne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> it was in the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> over the people of the Jews, this is the Throne which Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> How can that be? for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be, yet we have the promiſe of God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45133:5"/>for it, that it ſhall be again inhabited, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.6. And <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhall be inhabited again in her own place, even in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yea, we finde that at Chriſts ſecond perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it is ſaid that his ſeet ſhall ſtand upon the Mount of Olives, which is before <hi>Jeruſalem, Zech.</hi> 14.4. and in the ſame day you finde that he ſhall be King over all the earth, and there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one, in the 9. verſe. We know alſo, that as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his ſucceſſion to the Crown was a ſweet Type of Chriſt, ſo likewiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his peaceable Kingdom, and therein Chriſt ſhall well be called the Prince of Peace. Now it is very much to our purpoſe to conſider with what difficulty <hi>Solomon</hi> did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the Crown; you have the ſtory in the 1. of <hi>Kings,</hi> chap. 1. the whole Chapter is very remarkable: you finde that <hi>Solomons</hi> mother in the 17. verſe comes unto King <hi>David,</hi> and ſhe ſaid unto him, My Lord, thou ſwareſt by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, ſaying, Aſſuredly <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> thy Son ſhall reign after me, and he ſhall ſit upon my Throne, the 18. verſe, and now behold, <hi>Adonijah</hi> reigneth. Obſerve, it is the woman that prevailes with <hi>David,</hi> and ſurely it muſt be the woman (even the Church) that muſt prevail with God for the exaltation of Jeſus Chriſt, for ſhe is ſaid to travel with the man-childe, in the twelfth of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and ſhe brings him forth at laſt in verſe 10. Now is come ſalvation and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt: no more accuſings then of Satan; no, no, the accuſer of the brethren is caſt down. Now obſerve how the woman and the Churches and Saints of Chriſt may agree together in their Petition: for as ſhe ſaid, My Lord, thou ſwareſt that thy Son <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould reign, ſo may the Church ſay, Lord, thou haſt ſworn that thy Son Jeſus Chriſt ſhall reign, in the 89th. Pſalm, verſe 3, 4. Well, what follows? And now (ſaith ſhe) behold, <hi>Adonijah</hi> reigneth. This word, <hi>Behold,</hi> it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of admiration; Behold, my ſervant whom I have choſen (ſpeaking of Chriſt.) Truely, it ſhould be matter of admiration unto the Sons and daughters of <hi>Zov,</hi> that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45133:6"/>Lord ſhould have ſo much patience as to afford the Kings of the earth that time which is allotted unto them, but the Lamb ſhall at laſt overcome them; we finde that when <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi> had done, then came in alſo <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and he comes with the ſame ſtory: certainly the true Prophets of God they will in all generations joyn with the Church in that which concerns the glory of God; and hereby we may come to know who are the falſe Prophets, and who are the true. The falſe Prophets they cry up the beaſt, and wonder after the beaſt; but the true Prophets they cry up Jeſus Chriſt, and admire at his excellency, and are forced to cry out, Who would not fear thee, O thou King of Nations! <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. and as you read in the following Chapters, of the miſerable end that did follow them that helped to Crown <hi>Adonijah,</hi> ſo be aſſured that nothing but miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction will be the end of them that are enemies to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: But as for thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me. This will be Chriſts ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto ſuch his enemies at his appearance. It is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to run through the whole current of Scripture, that the Reader may be ſurniſhed againſt all Gainſayers. The next Scripture that hints unto this truth, is in <hi>Job</hi> 19 25. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, verſe 26, 27. yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, my eyes ſhall behold him: this was the comfort of <hi>Jobs</hi> knowledge, that he knew that Chriſt was his Redeemer. O man, or whoever thou art that readeſt, what doth thy Soul ſay to this? canſt thou ſay as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid? hath Chriſt given thee an entrance into his everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace? believe it, otherwiſe this truth will afford thee little comfort: he doth not ſay, A Redeemer, or THE Redeemer, but MY Redeemer, and this Redeemer ſhall ſtand upon the earth; yea, (ſaith he) mine eyes ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him: for our vile bodies ſhall not be taken away from us at Chriſts appearance, but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they ſhall be changed and made like unto his glorious body. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45133:6"/>now we come to the 2. Pſalm, where you have a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Chriſt and his Kingdom, verſ. 6. Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy Hill of <hi>Zion:</hi> as ſure as ever this was performed in his ſtate of Humiliation, ſo ſhall it ſurely be accompliſhed in his Exaltation, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25. yet this Pſalm doth more particularly point at his Exaltation, when he ſhall come the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation: for it is ſaid in the 9. verſe, Thou ſhalt break them with a Rod of Iron; agreeing to that which is ſaid in another place, By the breath of his mouth he ſhall ſlay the wicked; yea, we finde ſometimes that God hath ſo revealed this truth in his word, that it cannot well be underſtood ſpiritually, unleſſe we will turn Scriptures into Allegories, as in Pſalm 47. where the very Tranſlators or Expoſitors of the Bible have helped us with this Expoſition: The Nations are exhorted cheerfully to entertain the kingdom of Chriſt. In the 2. verſe it is ſaid, He is terrible, and a great King over all the earth, whereas Chriſt as he is King to his people, he is the Prince of peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. but ſee the work that this King is to do, in <hi>v.</hi> 3. He ſhall ſubdue the people under us, and the Nations under our feet: this will be more eſpecially done at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond glorious appearing, agreeing to that in <hi>Dan</hi> 12.1. And another thing that you may take notice of in the Pſalm, is in <hi>v.</hi> 9. where he ſaith, The Princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of <hi>Abraham.</hi> By Princes here I underſtand the Saints of God, for they are made Kings and Prieſts by Chriſt unto God the Father, as the Apoſtle ſaith, If ye be Chriſts, then are ye <hi>Abrahams,</hi> ſeed and heirs according to the promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. that it is ſpoken of the Saints that ſhall rule and reign with Chriſt as Princes, you may ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.1. Behold, a King ſhall reign in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and Princes ſhall rule in judgement. Second verſe, and a man ſhall be as an hiding place from the winde, and a covert from the Tempeſt: this is the Man Chriſt Jeſus, born of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> crucified, dead, and buried, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for as he ſuffered as God-man in the earth, ſo he ſhall be exalted as God man upon the earth, witneſs his own words,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45133:7"/>who is truth it ſelf, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.26. And they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the Clouds, with great power and glory. Chriſt ſo coming as he is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now the place whereunto he ſhall gather all his people, it is ſaid to be the excellency of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which is in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The next Pſalm that ſpeaks of this truth, is 67. 4. O let the Nations be glad, and ſing for joy: why, what is the matter? it follows: For thou ſhalt judge the people righteouſly; and lead the Nations upon earth. It cannot be denied, but that Chriſt doth govern and diſpoſe of all things, now: but this points at his very perſonal being as God-man upon the earth, verſ. 6. Then ſhall the earth yield her increaſe; I cannot believe that the earth doth now yield the ſame increaſe that it did before the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> but certainly God will make the earth as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> as ever he did for the firſt. You have alſo a plain Propheſie of his Kingdom, Pſalm 72. But I paſſe to the ſecond of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the ſecond verſe: And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, that the Mountain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be exalted in the top of the Mountains: agreeing to that in the fourth of <hi>Micah,</hi> the firſt. The Scripture maketh a difference between the latter dayes, and the laſt dayes: Chriſt ſaith, As it was in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall it be in the dayes of the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But is not Chriſts ſecond coming, called the judgement of the great day, as in the ſixth of <hi>Jude?</hi> where then is any room for dayes?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that this day of judgement may as well be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the thouſand years rule of Chriſt as for one days and the Scripture doth bear witneſſe that there is no difference as to God, ſecond of <hi>Peter,</hi> the third and eighth verſe, One day with the Lord is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day: in the fourth verſe, And he ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many people. Here he is brought in performing his Kingly office upon the Throne of his father <hi>David</hi> amongſt the Nations: the glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45133:7"/>of this his Kingdom you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. The whole Chapter is a moſt glorious Propheſie of the Kingdom of Chriſt, not onely internally in the ſpirit of his people, but alſo externally in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Was not this already performed when Chriſt came in the fleſh, when the deaf did hear, and the blind ſee, and the lame leap?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though the Propheſie hath a ſpecial eye unto that time, and was ſpecially fulfilled then, yet it reacheth unto a higher diſpenſation, as will appear if we conſider the 8th. verſe, and the 10th. verſe: in the 8th. verſe it is ſaid, And an high-way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called, The way of holineſſe. I know not the like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion again in all the Scripture, where the way of holineſle is called an high-way; I do believe that when Chriſt ſpake of the ſtraight way and narrow Gate that leadeth unto life, that he meant the way of holineſſe: now we know that an high way it is a broad way, and a plain way; and yet rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they do not oppoſe each other: for while the Prince of the power of the aire (which is the Devil) doth rule and bear ſway in the world, he (as all other Kings have) hath his high way, which is the high way; of ſin, error, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaneſſe, and there are multitudes that are found galloping in this way: but the way of holineſſe is ſo ſtrait, that he that walks in that way muſt walk alone; but when Chriſt cometh, and ſhall be King over all the earth, then ſhall be fulfilled that ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.21. It is further apparent if we conſider <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. the 10th. verſe: by the ranſomed of the Lord I underſtand, either the people of the Jews in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or elſe every true believer in particular: Theſe ſhall return, and come to <hi>Zion</hi> with ſongs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away. Why Gods bringing of his people now unto <hi>Zion,</hi> it is with weeping, and with ſupplication; but in this day when (<hi>Zion</hi>) the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be exalted in the top
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45133:8"/>of the Mountains, it ſhall be with everlaſting joy; agreeing to that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. Therefore they ſhall come and ſing in the height of <hi>Zion.</hi> But in the 9th. verſe there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſupplication, and in the latter end of the 12th. verſe, they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all. Certainly then this will be a time of extraordinary ſpiritual joy, which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and wait for, and not an outward glorious Jewiſh Kingdom, which ſome ſpeaking againſt it, ſay that we look for: but let ſuch ſee their portion, it they have a portion in Chriſt, and how gracious Chriſt will be unto them in this his kingdom, in that ſweet Propheſie of his reign in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.4. The heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge. I am perſwaded that many a gracious heart, in the corſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that glorious truth of Chriſts ſpiritual reign in the hearts of his people over ſin, Satan and the world, hath cried down this his perſonal reign upon the Throne of his father <hi>David,</hi> as error and Hereſie. I might cite much in the behalf of this truth, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. to the end, but I ſhall paſſe over to <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.9. And they ſhall ſerve the Lord their God, and <hi>David</hi> their King, whom I will raiſe up unto them. Now obſerve the time when they ſhall ſerve this King, it is when God ſhall give them to peſſeſſe the land which he gave unto their fathers, as you may ſee plainly in the third verſe: and before they do thus ſerve him, they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and ſeek him, even the Jews that are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.5. O ye Gentile Saints of the moſt high, what room hath God made in your hearts for the poor Jews? did they think upon us when we were not a people, and ſhall not we think upon them? Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence; for he hath ſaid that the Nation and kingdome that will not ſerve them ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; yea, thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly deſtroyed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.12. certainly then there is little hopes for <hi>England</hi> that would not ſuffer you to dwell amongſt us: but faithfull is God that hath promiſed, and will accompliſh, even to ſet over them that great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, the Lord Je us Chriſt, <hi>Ezek</hi> 34, 23. The next plain Scripture is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45133:8"/>
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him. This is a plain Propheſie of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearing to rule and reign with his Saints: if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the 22th verſe, there ye have him mentioned; Untill the ancient of dayes came; agreeing with that his title in the Revelation: I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt. This is a kingdom, and dominion under the whole heaven, certainly then it muſt be on earth; and then ſhall that promiſe be made good, which ſaith, The meek ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth. We do not doubt, (as a worthy Preacher<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </note> lately ſaid) of a kingdom in the heavens, in that celeſtial place of glory prepared for us; but our God hath promiſed us a kingdom under the whole heaven; wherein Chriſt ſhall be King, that one Lord, both over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews and believing Gentiles.</p>
            <p>This kingdom it is given him by God the Father, who is alſo called the ancient of dayes; for as Chriſt ſaith, I and my father are one, you have it in the 13. and 14. verſes of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. I ſaw in the night Viſions; and behold, one like the Son of Man, came with the Clouds of Heaven; agreeing unto Chriſts words, Then ſhall ye ſee the Son of Man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I ſhall plainly lay down my Meditations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and leave it to the judgement of the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which were this; Chriſt coming, and the Saints bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him unto God their father: for it is ſaid in the 13th. verſe, They brought him near before him; agreeing to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.18. Behold, I and the children which thou haſt given me. And now being before their father, (as Chriſt ſaid, I go to my father and to your father, to my God and to your God) the ſubject matter of their plea is for a kingdome founded in the ſufferings of Chriſt, and ſo a branch of the new Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoyl with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45133:9"/>the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his Soul unto death. Now God the father being faithful that promiſed, he gives the kingdom unto the Son; agreeing to that in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72.1. Give the King thy judgements, O God, and thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto the Kings Son, which is fulfilled in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him; even him that was deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, unto whom the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have ſaid, We will not have this man to reign over us, even unto him ſhall this glory and dominion be given, that ſo that which is written may be fulfilled, At the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall confeſſe that he is the Lord, for he will be King alone in that day, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.10. The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> is very large in declaring the ſigns and wonders that ſhall be, before this great day of the Lord, agreeing with thoſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> is in the latter end of his Propheſie treating of the reſtauration of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which take in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial circumſtances concerning this truth, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a larger Treariſe then this is: for there is both heighth and depth, and length and breadth in the truths of God. But I paſſe them over, and ſhall onely take notice of <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.3. And he ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke ſtrong nations afar off, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. They ſhall ſit every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid. It ſhall be a <hi>Solomons</hi> kingdom in reſpect of peace; ſo that in this ſenſe he will come as the deſired one of all Nations, and this kingdom ſhall come to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.14.

O how beautiful upon the Mountains ſhould the feet of ſuch publiſhers be, that would ſay unto <hi>Zion,</hi> Thy God reigneth, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52.7. Then ſhall the Saints of the Lord

And many nations ſhall be joyned unto the Lord in that day, and ſhall be my people.</hi> Verſe. 12. <hi>The Lord ſhall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and ſhall chuſe Jeruſalem again.</hi> There will be ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of light in the latter days, that the Nations ſhall be able to ſee, and to diſtinguiſh between the Bride and the Whore; the falſe Church, and the true Church; the houſe of God, and <hi>Babylon</hi> that ſhall be made the Cage of every unclean and filthy bird, even when the Gentiles ſhall come to the light of the Jews, which ſhall be as <hi>life from the dead, Rom.</hi> 11.15. for as ſure as ever the Lord hath caſt them off, ſo ſurely will he receive them again: but Oh, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work that the Lord muſt make in the earth, before he ſhall have accompliſhed his deſignes unto his people! and for this he hath appointed a day: and Oh, that Saints and Sinners would take notice of it: <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>For behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Agreeing unto this, is that Propheſie in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.12. <hi>For the day of the Lord of hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low.</hi> And in <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>In that day a man ſhall caſt his Idols of ſilver, and his Idols of gold which they made, to the Moles and to the Bats.</hi> All which may certifie us of a notable fiery day of Tryal, which will come before the great day of Chriſt. And truely, here I may juſtly take up a deep Lamentation in the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that abundance of pride and wickedneſs which doth abound, not onely amongſt the common profane of the world, but alſo amongſt Profeſſors themſelves: <hi>this is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi> O, how few have kept their firſt love! and ſuch as are in the day of their firſt Eſpouſals, if they be not very watchful, will be caried
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45133:10"/>away with the ſtream, amongſt Profeſſors that have cooled in their firſt love: certainly therefore it is a time for ſuch as fear the Lord, to be thinking upon his diſhonoured Name; <hi>for unto ſuch as fear his Name, ſhall the Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ariſe with healing under his wings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far there hath been onely treated of this Kingdom from the Old Teſtament Propheſies: I ſhall come now to ſome New Teſtament Scriptures wherein it is as clearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.31. it is thus written: <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory:</hi> and in the 34 verſe, <hi>Then ſhall the King ſay unto them on his right hand.</hi> By the man Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> God will judge the world; yea, and ſo judge them as he is a King; or el<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e what Kingdom ſhall he have to deliver up unto God the Father? <hi>Then cometh the end</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>when he ſhall have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the kingdom unto the Father, that God may be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.23, 24, 25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32. there God makes a promiſe unto <hi>Mary</hi> by the Angel, that that child <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was in her womb, ſhould ſit upon the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> which is to rule and reign over the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as it followeth in the 33 verſ. And in order unto this, he ſhall ſo come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as he aſcended up into Heaven. Now there is none that will deny this, but ſuch as will deny Chriſt and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture too, that he did aſcend with the ſame body with which he did ariſe: &amp; this is his own teſtimony of his ſecond coming, when he ſaith, <hi>Then ſhall ye ſee the Son of man coming,</hi> Act. 1.9, 10, 11 but until that time, the Heavens muſt receive him, which will be the time of the reſtitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Paul</hi> doth charge <hi>Timothy</hi> upon the account of the appearing and Kingdom of Chriſt, to be faithful in the work of his Miniſtry: ſo that Chriſt as he is King, and in his Kingdom, ſhall judge both the quick and the dead: but when Chriſt ſhall give up this Kingdom unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45133:10"/>God the Father, (wch he ſhall do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) then ſaith Chriſt to his, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before the foundations of the world were laid.</hi> And thus God the Father ſhall be all in all, &amp; the Saints ſhall come into the Fathers Kingdom: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> Luk. 12.32. <hi>It is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you a kingdom:</hi> and this is a Kingdom which was prepared for them, from before the foundations of the world were laid: ſo that the Saints of God, beſides that Kingdom that they ſhall have upon the foundation of the world, ſhall have a Kingdom prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them, from before the foundation of the world was laid, which is a houſe eternal in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the twelve choſen Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> was the beloved Diſciple, who lay in the boſom of Chriſt; and therefore he did deeply ſhare in afflictions for Chriſt; and being baniſhed into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> there he had the glorious things that do belong unto this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom opened unto him: it is the Revelation which God the Father gave unto Chriſt, and Chriſt by his Angel revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto <hi>John; I John</hi> (ſaith he, in the ninth verſe) <hi>who alſo am your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of of us Chriſt:</hi> John, and the Saints that he did write unto, were travelling towards this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yea, and they were in the way too, and that was through many tribulations. You have in the third verſe a bleſſing pronounced upon him that readeth, and they that hear and keep the things which are written in this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; that is, keep up the teſtimony of them, and the power of them being manifeſted in their lives and converſations. Now ſee thoſe ſweet Motto's that he gives to Chriſt in the fifth verſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, he is the <hi>fathful witneſs,</hi> and that in reſpect of that witneſs that he did hold forth in the world to his Fithers glory. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of that witneſs that he beares unto his people by his Spirit, and that is a witneſs that he holds forth by his Spirit unto their ſpirits, that they <hi>are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, Rom.</hi> 8.16.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45133:11"/>
            <p>Secondly, he is called the <hi>first begotten of the dead,</hi> as the Apoſtle argues it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead:</hi> and in verſe 22, he ſpeaks of Chriſt as being the firſt fruits, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. where he is called <hi>the firſt born from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he is called <hi>the Prince of the kings of the earth;</hi> and this very manifeſt in Scripture: he is often called <hi>the King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi> But I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of that which he delivered to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat</hi> 22.49. <hi>If David then call him Lord, how is he his ſon?</hi> It was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that <hi>Chriſt</hi> put unto the Phariſees; <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>think ye of Chriſt? whoſe Son is he? And they anſwered him. The Son of David. How then</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>doth David call him Lord?</hi> as in Pſalm 110.1. So that by this it doth appear, that Chriſt is both <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and <hi>Davids</hi> Son: he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, not onely as he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, but alſo as he is King of kings, and Lord of lords. And thus he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and <hi>Davids</hi> Prince, as well as <hi>Nero</hi>'s Prince, or any other wicked Prince that ever was upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Again, he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, in reſpect that he ſhall ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>David</hi>'s Throne; and this is that which <hi>David</hi> by faith did foreſee, and that which is promiſed Chriſt in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.31, 32, 33. Now I hope that there is none that will deny that Chriſt is the Son of <hi>David:</hi> for taking upon him our ſins, he muſt of neceſſity take upon him our body; <hi>a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> And thus he was in all things like unto us, ſin onely excepted; and that the Scripture might be fulfilled, he is born of a Virgin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. I am perſwaded in my very conſcience, that the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, with his perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the fleſh, to ſuffer and dye for ſinners, together with his perſonal appearance in glory hereafter, will be the Doctrine that God will make effectual in order unto the converſion of the Jews: for I underſtand that herein ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their blindneſs, which was alſo in their forefathers, an
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45133:11"/>expectation of the Meſſiah in a ſtate of glory; but what ſaith Chriſt unto this? <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart to believe! ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and ſo to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into his glory?</hi> Luk. 24.25. ſo that the very foundation of Chriſts exaltation, lieth and conſiſteth in his humiliation: becauſe <hi>he was deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrow, and acquainted with grief,</hi> therefore <hi>ſhall he come in the glory of his Father, and in the glory of his holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Truth is farther confirmed from <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26. <hi>He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, even as I have received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Pſal. 2.9. The ſaints, as the Scripture ſpeaks, are <hi>Heirs, joynt Heirs,</hi> yea, <hi>co-Heirs</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he having received of God the Father to have power over the Nations, he will give the ſame power over the Nations unto his ſaints that do overcome: and as he did overcome Sin, Death, Satan and the World, and is now ſet down in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throne, ſo alſo he hath a Throne (even the Throne of his father <hi>David</hi>) that he will give his overcoming Saints to ſit down upon with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev</hi> 11.15. it is thus written, <hi>And the ſeventh Angel ſounded, and there were great Voices in heaven, ſaying, The Kingdoms of this world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt:</hi> from hence it is very plain, that they are the Kingdoms of this world, which ſhall be given unto Jeſus Chriſt. And the devil, that red Dragon, that devouring Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that old Serpent, did know full well of this, when he came to tempt Chriſt: for after that he had failed twice, he comes, in the third temptation, with this: <hi>All the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world will I give thee, and the glory of them, ſo thou wilt but fall down and worſhip before me,</hi> Mat. 4.8, 9 he knew it with a witneſs, from the very firſt promiſe that God gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fallen man, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the head of the Serpents;</hi> which is, Chriſt, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and manifeſted to deſtroy the works of the devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Whereas you ſpeak here of a <hi>thouſand years</hi> reign, it is ſaid in this verſe, That <hi>he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45133:12"/>
            <p>I anſwer: I do believe that a thouſand years is a Type of perfection; and therefore we cannot read of any of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> that God did ſuffer to live a thouſand yeers; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate unto man, that there is no perſection here in this life: but then ſee the limitation that this word <hi>Ever</hi> hath in <hi>Scripture,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.17. it is <hi>for ever, as long as the ſun.</hi> But let us take a little notice how the Nations will take this: it is ſaid, <hi>They were angry,</hi> verſ. 18. ſo that while the <hi>Saints</hi> are praiſing and rejoycing before God, with great admitation in the enjoyment of this ſalvation, the Nations will be ſret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and vexing to ſee what is come to paſs: <hi>for thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they ſhould be judged;</hi> all Chriſts implacable, impenitent Enemies do but <hi>heap up wrath, againſt this day of wrath,</hi> for this will be a day of Judgement wherein Chriſt will give to every man, according to his works; yea, God will have an account of the very carth which he hath let out unto the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>He will deſtroy them which deſtroy the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, this is that the Church of Chriſt is now in pain for, and crying, travelling to be delivered, even of this <hi>Man child, who ſhall rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron,</hi> Rev. 125. and that becauſe of that great joy which they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive when Chriſt is exalted; for the <hi>Saints</hi> they are ſuch as love the appearance of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. For when he ſhall come in flaming fire unto his Enemies, he ſhall be with his people as a Lamb: <hi>And I looked, and lo! a Lamb ſtood on the Mount Zion:</hi> here is fulfilled that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion:</hi> ſo that he will be both King and Lamb upon mount <hi>Zion. Mount Zion,</hi> as it is written, <hi>ſhall be exalted above all mountains; and the Name of Jeſus,</hi> upon this exalted mountain, <hi>ſhall be exalted above every Name, and then ſhall the Saints of God ſing the ſong of Moſes and of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; Juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints,</hi> Rev. 15.3. Now it will be to our purpoſe to conſider in what reſpect theſe ſhall be ſaid to ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is Typical; for I believe that both
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45133:12"/>Jews and Gentiles ſhall ſing this ſong: <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And haſt made us unto our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign upon the Earth,</hi> Rev. 5.9, 10. ſo that out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry people, Chriſt will have a peculiar people. Now let us ſee how well the children of God travelling towards this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the children of Iſrael towards the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> will Agree together.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, to take in the ſpiritual meaning; as the Children of Iſrael were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> under ſore bondage; ſo are all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> by nature, under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin and Satan, and led captive by him at his pleaſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. now the Lord by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he brings them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and they are ſet ſafe over the Red Sea, and now for the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but they came not thither, for we read of their ſad fall through unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18. ſo the Lord, by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, hath ſet out a way for all towards the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but few come thither, and why ſo? <hi>Many are called, but ſew are choſen; one of a Tribe, and two of a Family,</hi> as the Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if we look at the myſtical meaning, then by <hi>Egypt</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>Babylon,</hi> myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whoſe inhabitants there is Egyptian darkneſs, and the Lord now in the dayes of the Goſpel having called and brought his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> while they ſtand upon a Sea of glaſs mingled with fire, they are inabled by the Spirit of God to ſing: <hi>They ſing the Song of Moſes, and of the Lamb, ſaying, Juſt and true are thy wayes, thou King of Saints,</hi> Iſa. 33.22. The Iſrael after the fleſh, they ſing, being delivered from outward Enemies; the Iſrael after the Spirit they ſhall ſing, being delivered from all their enemies, both inward and outward.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. you have the great joy and rejoycing of the Saints at the downfal of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whilſt the Kings of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45133:13"/>Earth which have committed Fornication with her, and the Merchants of the Whore are weeping, and wailing, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Alas, alas;</hi> the Saints they ſhall be ſaying, <hi>Alleluiah, ſalvation, and honour &amp; glory, and power unto the Lord our God, even ſo Amen. Alleluiah.</hi> It is a praiſing and rejoycing in the Lord, for his great Judgements and vengeance which he had taken; and to this end Chriſt was anointed, to proclaim the day of vengeance of our God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. &amp; 63.4. &amp; 34.8. but in what poſture then ſhall the Saints be in that day? you may ſee in the 7. verſ. <hi>Let us be glad, and rejoyce, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> Well, amongſt all this vengeance and Judgement, let us ſee what will be the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and that is, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> verſ. 16. We come now to <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. we have preſented unto us an Angel coming down from Heaven, having the Key of the bottomleſs pit: whether Chriſt be meant here by this Angel, or no, I ſhall leave that to the judicious Reader; with his meditations upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. where Chriſt faith, <hi>I have the Keys of Hell and Death:</hi> now this Angel layeth hold on the Dragon, which is Satan, and bindes him a Thouſand years; and he is caſt into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, with a Seal upon him. Some there are that do imagine, that this thouſand years was in the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine;</hi> but I ſee no ground for the truth of it: for when he ſhall be bound, the Nations ſhall not be deceived with any falſe worſhip, as ever hitherto they have been, ſince the man of ſin, that ſon of perdition, hath been up; and that he was looſed in the time of wicked <hi>Hildebrand</hi> a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer: but the words here in the 3. verſ. faith, <hi>That after his binding, he muſt be looſed for a little ſeaſon:</hi> now the wiſe man faith, <hi>There is a time, &amp; a ſeaſon for everything:</hi> and if the time ſince, in the Scriptural Account, can be lookt upon as a little ſeaſon, yet where hath Satans work been? For I believe, that Satan is yet at his firſt work, in being a lying Spirit in the mouthes of falſe Prophets, and ſo deceiving the Nations in the things of God, and of Chriſt, and carrying
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45133:13"/>on the Myſtery of Iniquity; and at this work he is new very buſie, labouring to pervert Foundation-truths by ſinful ſuggeſtions into our hearts. I know it by mine own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for he hath been very much labouring to blind my underſtanding and judgement in a foundation-truth: but O for ever bleſſed he that faithful High Prieſt, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who knowing all his plots, hath ſtill kept my Faith running out upon his word, with an anſwering, <hi>It is written.</hi> But now his laſt work that we read he ſhall do, is to gather the nations againſt this beloved City, to their final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: he is no ſconer out of priſon, but he goes to his work, and loſeth no time: it is ſaid, that <hi>he went out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth.</hi> Why it is reported by writers, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is in the midſt of the earth, and ſo in this ſence Chriſt will rule in the midſt of his enemies, as it may truly be ſaid, when Chriſt taketh poſſeſſion of any heart; why there is fleſh, and ſin, and the world: I, but Chriſt he is King, &amp; he keeps his Throne, and will at length bring them down under his ſeat, though for a time (for ends beſt known unto the Lord) they may have their lurking cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ſoul. Now when Satan had cathered them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the next news that we finde, is their general deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by fire, which I believe is the general deſtruction of the whole world, with all things that are therein. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away</hi> (faith Chriſt) <hi>but not one tittle of my word, until all be fulfilled:</hi> for I finde that the general Judgement of the righteous and the wicked, it followeth afterward, and then ſhall thoſe wicked ones who were in that laſt Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie againſt Chriſt and his people, and ſo filled up the meaſure of the ſins of all the Serpents ſeed. that went before them, be condemned before his Tribunal: for <hi>the book ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every one ſhall be judged according to his works.</hi> But before this Throne and Judgement of Chriſt, upon this white Throne, by himſelf particularly ſpoken of in verſ. 11. we have divers Thrones ſpoken of in the fourth verſe: <hi>And judgement was given unto them who had not worſhipped the beast nor his Images and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45133:14"/>
               <hi>thouſand years;</hi> but afterwards Chriſt who is the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is ſole Judge of all; and having finiſhed the Judgement, he delivers up all into the hands of God the Father: then ſhall the Saints, above what they know now, know with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, that the Son and Father are one, and they one in them, according to Chriſts prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 24.</p>
            <p>Now in order unto their reigning with Chriſt, they muſt be brought forth by the enjoyment of a Reſurrection: and this I judge to be the firſt Reſurrection, which ſhall be only of the Saints that ſleep in Jeſus; for <hi>the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> according to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.10. and 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15. <hi>Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming.</hi> I know there are ſome that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Reſurrection to the Reſurrection of the Soul out of the grave of ſin and corruption: Well, I ſhall not much controvert it; but whoever I ſee ſo riſen, I do not queſtion his part in the firſt Reſurrection: for it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection:</hi> It doth not ſpeak of ſinners, but of ſaints which had not worſhipped the Beaſt, neither his Image, they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeers; but the reſt of the dead lived not again, until the thouſand yeers were finiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what are the reſt of the dead that have not their part in this firſt Reſurrection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have them ſet down in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. and I am ſure there is not a Saint amongſt them; they are the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all lyars; and where ſhall all theſe be? why theſe ſhall be without; for <hi>without are dogs and ſorcerers,</hi> Rev. 22.15. without; that is, without this holy City new <hi>Jeruſalem coming down from God out of heaven;</hi> ſo that they ſhall not ſee that tranſcendent glory, which will be manifeſted in this City, a glimpſe of which the Lord even now ſometimes lets down into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his people, that ſo they might with the Apoſtle groan for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our bodies: yea, he witneſſeth that the whole Creation groans for this,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45133:14"/>even for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God; and they that had received the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, groaned alſo. O then how ſhall the ſaints of the latter dayes that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Promiſe of the Father, groan and travel for the accompliſhment of theſe things! And ſurely ſuch that are in ſome meaſure delivered into the beauty, and ſpiritualneſs, and glory of this glory, cannot but long and deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed, that they might be cloathed upon: <hi>John,</hi> in this chapter, ſaw <hi>a new heaven, and a new earth,</hi> which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of long before, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. and there you have a deſcription what this new Heaven and new Earth is, in the 18 verſe, <hi>For behold, I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her people a Joy.</hi> A new heaven indeed, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which now is, which is in bondage with her children, ſhall rejoyce with that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which is free, and is the mother of us all, which ſhall come downe from God out of Heaven: there ſhall alſo be a new Earth, for the Divell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound up, there will not be that Enmity in the hearts of Earthly men, neither to the Saints nor amongſt themſelves, but according to the Propheſie in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. laſt. <hi>The Lyon and the Lamb ſhall lie down together.</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>And I ſaw the holy City new Jeruſalem coming down from God out of heaven, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as a bride adorned for her husband. John</hi> in the time of all this <hi>Revelation</hi> was in the ſpirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I was in the ſpirit on the Lords day;</hi> and all that was revealed unto him was ſpiritual, from firſt to laſt: he that readeth, let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the holy City</hi> (for nothing that is unholy can enter in; fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.) It is a City, and it is a holy City; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is the City which <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith looked for, while he was a ſtranger in the Land of Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. <hi>For he looked for a city that hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God:</hi> This City hath Foundations, as you may ſee in the fourteenth verſe, and God is the Builder and Maker of it, for it is of his Creation.</p>
            <p>This holy City, this new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is ſaid to <hi>come down from God out of heaven:</hi> doth not this plainly demonſtrate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45133:15"/>unto us that the ſaints ſhall come down from heaven, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall come, and all the Saints with him;</hi> and in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> this is an expectation of Chriſt from heaven, and I ſee no difference between this expreſſion and that of Chriſt's, <hi>I am the true bread which came down from heaven:</hi> now ſee in what manner this holy City doth come down, and then conſider whether it will be any way a diſadvantage unto the Saints, to come down from heaven, for they come <hi>as a bride adorned for her husband.</hi> (O bleſſed Union!) all the Saints are Chriſts Bride, the whole general Aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in heaven, they do but make up the Lambs Wife; and thus ſhe ſhall come adorned for her husband, that is, without ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o: or wrinkle, as will appear if we compare ſpiritual things with ſpiritual. For here Chriſt doth by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and word eſpouſe us unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. O but there is a marriage day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.7. and then it ſhall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Bride to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, which is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints: Bleſſed are they which are called unto the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb. Chriſt he is the Kings ſon, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72 1. and God the Father he will inſtitute a ſupper for his Sonne, which is called <hi>The Mariage Supper of the Lamb,</hi> a Supper that ſhall begin, when all other ſuppers ſhall have ended: this doth not any way diminiſh from the ſouls feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt here, according unto Chriſts words, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed;</hi> but this is a ſupper the which all the Saints ſhall be called unto, that they might be married unto Chriſt, who were in this life eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto Chriſt, and therefore when ye have the cry at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, it is ſaid, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh</hi> Chriſt comes unto his Saints, as a Bridegroom in the glory of his Father and of his holy Angels: the Saints, they meet Chriſt as the Lambs wife, yea, as a Bride adorned for the Bridegroom, that although he comes at midnight to the ungodly, and to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45133:15"/>the ſeeming godly fooliſh Virgins without Chriſt in the world, yet it is the Saints morning-Star, that infallible ſigne of day unto them.</p>
            <p>In the third verſe: <hi>And I heard a great voice out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Behold! the Tabernacle of God is with men;</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf will witneſs unto this truth, [<hi>Behold!</hi>] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have this word, it ſpeaks out ſomething of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his people might know the certainty of that which is promiſed: you have it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>Behold, my ſervant ſhall deal prudently, he ſhall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt Jeſus the Son of the Eternal God, though equal with God, yet he took upon him the form of a ſervant, <hi>My Servant ſhall be extolled;</hi> yea, and as it follows, <hi>the kings ſhall ſhut their mouthes at him,</hi> &amp;c. It is ſaid of this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the fourth verſe, <hi>And the kings of the Earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth verſe: <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away.</hi> Here are the Saints in their perfect ſtate, a ſinleſs ſtate; for ſurely if there ſhall be no more cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there ſhall be no more ſinning: when a Saint ſins, God will take care to bring him unto Godly ſorrow. O but this is a ſtate without ſorrow: Sin is a way of pain, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things ſhall be paſſed away. A Saints grief is either firſt for himſelf, or elſe ſecondly, for the ſins of others: why in both theſe reſpects ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away: if it be in himſelf, it is from a body of ſin, a Law in his members warring againſt the Law of his minde. O but <hi>this vile body ſhall be changed, and</hi> (as it is written) <hi>made like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, ſin in others is that which doth often grieve the gracious heart, as it tends unto the diſhonour of Chriſt: but in this ſtate the Saints ſhall have no ſuch cauſe of grief, for Chriſt alone ſhall be exalted and admired in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45133:16"/>
            <p>I might cite much more in the behalf of this truth, from divers other verſes in this chapter: but I paſs by them all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the laſt verſe:</p>
            <p>

(God forbid) but as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ſtrive therefore.</hi> There are many that will bid fairly for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but will not come to the ſet rare: ſome there are that bid too little, and others there are that bid too much, and the laſt are worſe then the firſt. They that bid too little, are they that would give Chriſt a part of their hearts, but would keep the other part for the world; they would cut off a left hand ſin, but not a right hand ſin: but let ſuch know that Chriſt will either have all, or none at all. The ſecond ſort which bid too much (not that any can either bid, or give too much upon a right account) are they, that when the Goſpel ſaith, <hi>He every one that thirſteth, let him come without money, and without price;</hi> yet theſe will bring ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own, and ſo from ſome qualifications within themſelves, would ſet up a Saviour of their own, which is directly oppoſite to the minde of God, in his revealed word: and Oh that ſuch would conſider theſe two <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Truly poor ſinners may be likened unto a company of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, unto whom a Prince reſorting, makes Proclamation of a precious Pearl that is to be had, onely for coming &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it: Now theſe ſtrangers not believing the proclamation, either firſt neglect to come, or elſe further queſtioning his faithfulneſs, bring with them their Country Coin, which is but ſtones and rubbiſh. Truly the compariſon is rather too ſhort to hold forth the free-Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath made Proclamation, <hi>Let him that will, come, and take of the water of Life freely.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is both Prince and Pearl,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45133:18"/>who hath made Proclamation by himſelf, and by his Saints, of himſelf, unto poor ſinners; they are the ſtrangers (for ſo are all ſinners) that queſtioning his faithfulneſs, will not come; as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Ye would not come unto me, that ye may have life;</hi> and this is that, when the Spirit of God comes, it will convince the ſinner of this great ſin of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort are they that undervaluing the worth of this Pearl, will bring ſomething of their own to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it: If God the Father had ſet a price upon Chriſt, for every one to pay, before he ſhould receive him, ah! wo had been to all poor ſinners: but now Chriſt is to be given, he is not to be bought.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.45, 46. it is ſaid, <hi>The Merchant BOUGHT the Pearl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parable is very ſignificant, but doth no way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what hath been affirmed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if we conſider the Merchant in his ſeeking condition, he is ſeeking goodly Pearls: the young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel comes to Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Good Maſter, What good thing ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> and being directed, but not carryed forth thereunto, by the power of the love of Chriſt, he uttrely failed: but now this Merchant being directed to ſeek for Chriſt, and finding of him, is enlightened from above to ſee him to be the Pearl of great price, &amp; ſo ſells &amp; hates, &amp; forſaketh all for Chriſt. Now in his finding of him, it is plain that Chriſt firſt found him, as he ſaith, <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> Mat. 4.18, 32. <hi>Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>We have left all, and followed thee;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> counted all things dung and droſs, and was willing to ſuffer the loſs of all things that he might gain Chriſt; which was onely the working of the love of Chriſt dwelling in him: O poor ſinner! what is it that ſtands in thy way? is it hills or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? all the oppoſition that either ſin or Satan can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee? why behold, <hi>He comes leaping over the mountains, and skipping over the hills;</hi> even He whom thou haſt made thine Enemy, firſt ſeeks for a Treaty; O give Him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45133:18"/>while He knocks at the door of thy heart; and ſay, <hi>Welcom Jeſus, Rule and Reign in the midſt of thine Enemies, and let all thine Enemies be made thy Foot-ſtool.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, I am a very bond-ſlave unto my ſins and corruptions: why of a captive ſlive Chriſt will redeem thee, and make thee his ſervant; and canſt thou deſire a greater dignity then to be a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt? and that Faith may have a ground for this, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefeſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles glorieth in this, that he was the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. and when once thou art the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, it will no longer then be thy complement unto men [<hi>Your Servant, Sir</hi>] for Saints are <hi>bought with a price, that they might not be the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23</p>
            <p>Another it may be, will ſay, I have been an Enemie unto Chriſt, and to his Wayes, and to his People: truly this is a very bad condition, yet Chriſt makes Friends of Enemies: all ſinners are Enemies, but God commended his love unto us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us; therefore it is high time for thee to ſee that thou loveſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and hateſt aright: if thou loveſt rightly, thou loveſt God; if thou hateſt rightly, thou hateſt the world. See what <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world. If any man love the world, (either the lusts of the fleſh, or the pride of life, or the luſt of the eyes) the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Saints do not thus learn Chriſt, who hath ſaid, <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Of a vagabond ſtranger, thou mayſt be an adopted Son; of a Begger, a King; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeek not after the Kingdoms of this world, but rather profeſs (as once the Captain of our Salvation did before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat) My Kingdom is not of this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all that I have to ſay, with that good word of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in Act. 2.36. <hi>Therefore let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt. Peter</hi> ſo prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45133:19"/>Chriſt, that he got three thouſand ſouls at that time, in the Net of the Goſpel: a good example for the Miniſters of the Word to take pattern by. And we ſhall finde that he preached unto them of the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt, as you may ſee verſ. 30. <hi>Knowing that God had ſworn with an Oath, to him, that of the fruit of his loynes, according to the fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now therefore I intreat you, unto whom this ſhall come, that ye receive it in the love of it and marvail no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lord give thee an underſtanding heart, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe things be ſo or no. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would now willingly alſo commend ſomething unto ſuch as are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints, even unto as many as are preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus, which have received the <hi>White Stone,</hi> which none knowes but he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it: That you would ſhew forth the Vertues of Him that hath called you, and hath tranſl<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nverſations, and Godlineſs?</hi> O it becomes us that look for Chriſt from heaven, to have our converſation in heaven: certainly the knowledg of this truth ſhould makeus to trample upon the world, &amp; the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as baſe &amp; contemptible; and to content our ſelves in the worſt of conditions, in the quiet hope, &amp; patient waiting of our Lord from heaven. Surely the coming of Chriſt cannot
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45133:19"/>but yield very much comfort unto the ſoul that is aſſured of its intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Are Saints the Stewards of Chriſt? then let them know that their Lord and Maſter will return and call them to an account: and bleſſed is the ſervant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall finde ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Are Saints the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Bride of that bleſſed Bridegroom? then let them know, that whatever their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be in this world, yet their loving husband will return from his long journey, and put an end to all: and let not the Saints expect their full deliverance until he come, but rather perſecution and ſuffering while the world ſtands; for he hath ſaid, <hi>In the world re ſhall have trouble,</hi> and, <hi>through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is our duty to arm our ſelves with the ſame minde: <hi>For if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him:</hi> Chriſt Himſelf hath ſhewn us the way, and we are called by His Name, O let u foll w his footſteps. And ſurely it doth highly concern us to look to it that as Chriſt fore warn'd us, we be not overtaken with ſurſeiting, and dru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kenneſs, and cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon us unawares; we ſhall hardly win the race, if our hearts be loaded with the things of this world; and they will ſo lull us aſleep, that we ſhall endanger our ſelves to be found ſleeping at Chriſts coming, and therefore how doth it become the Saints at this day to be provoking one another to love, and to good works, exhorting one another, and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the day approaching. O let us conſider that our Lord is a Perſon of ſuch Highneſs and Excellency, that he deſerves our waiting for Him: for he is the <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is but bring faithful unto the death, and enduring unto the end: the battel is but once to be ſought, and the race is but once to be run; but yet the Lord knows, that without his ſufficient grace, we ſhall not overcome: and therefore how doth it concern us to take the oyl of the grace and ſpirit of God into out Lamps, leſt when the bridegroom cometh, we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45133:20"/>ſhould be found wanting, but rather to ſhine as lights ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an hill, and as Bees, ſucking Honey from this precious flowery Truth, from which ſo many ſpiders have ſuck'd poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as (if Hiſtory may be believed) ſome out of a notion of this Kingdom, to be but meer earthly, and for ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, have run out into all manner of licentiouſneſs, and the devil hath made great uſe of it againſt the truth, and no doubt but he will do ſtill: but what faith the Apoſtle? <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth;</hi> but truly (with ſhame let it be confeſſed) we do much in theſe dayes againſt the truth, becauſe we do not walk as becomes the truth, but God hath promiſed (and we do believe it) that the Redeemer ſhall come out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from <hi>Jacob,</hi> Rom. 11.26. <hi>And then the inhabitants ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; for the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their inquity,</hi> Iſa. 33.24.</p>
            <p>Oh how greatly now is Unity to be deſired amongſt the Saints! Truly I have for a long time been running to and fro, and now I will give you the report of all: but I may truly ſay, All ſeek their own, and none the things of Jeſus Chriſt; yea even the Saints themſelves in their ſeveral Forms, are ſo zealous about ſhadows, and are not ſo careful in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial commands of Jeſus Chriſt, that as for poor Way-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſouls, they may cry out and ſay, Lord where are thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are to be known by their love one to another? but may alſo come upon Jeſus Chriſt again, and ſay, <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loveth, where thou feedeſt.</hi> VVell, let the way-faring man be encouraged, and let the lambs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be comforted; for yet a little while, and there ſhall be but one Shepherd andone ſheepſold: and in the mean time, ſee, that ye are walking in the way that ye ſhould go, even in the way of holineſs, wherein the way-faring-man, though a fool, ſhall not err, but be ſeeking the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with their faces thitherward.</p>
            <p>And Oh that the Lord would put it into the hearts of his people, according to that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.14. <hi>Caſt ye up, caſt ye up, prepare the way, take up the ſtumbling block out of the way of my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45133:20"/>people:</hi> Surely if ye did but know how the mouths of the wicked are opened againſt you all, you would quickly ſhut your mouths that ye have ſo opened one againſt another.</p>
            <p>There are many (I fear) that are ready to ſay, with the fool, in his heart, There is no God; but it were to be wiſhed that the people of God would continually remember this, that whatever comes to paſs, it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled: if a <hi>Judas</hi> betray Chriſt, it is becauſe the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.16. compared with <hi>Pſa.</hi> 44.9.

            <p>If many ſhould come in His Name, ſaying, <hi>I am Chriſt,</hi> it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled: but believe it Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whoever thou art, no true Chriſt comes until Jeſus comes, who ſhall come in the glory of his Father, and of his holy Angels.

            <head>A POST-SCRIPT.</head>
            <p>I Have now but this one thing more to acquaint the Reader withal, and that is, The reaſon why this little Treatiſe is brought forth into the world. Know therefore, all and every one unto whom this Treatiſe ſhall come, That on a certain time I entered into a publique Aſſembly, where a great Rabbi did ſpeak againſt this Truth, and called the Profeſſors thereof Hereticks: But this I ſhould have minded before, That as I was purpoſing in my heart to go in, becauſe I thought I might hear ſomething that was good, nevertheleſs I had this ſweet Voice behind me, from the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>My Sheep hear my voice, and a ſtranger they will not follow:</hi> nevertheleſs (wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I was) I went on, and came in; and while I was hearing, I had great ſtrivings and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in my ſoul, whether I ſhould ſpeak or no: one great Objection was a Declaration from the Higher Powers againſt the Diſturbance of any publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but by Experience have I learned that the truth of Chriſt is to be vindicated, rather then the command of man obeyed.</p>
            <p>But juſt and righteous was the Lord, in that after
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45133:23"/>I had grieved and reſiſted (if not vexed) his Spirit, that he ſhould leave me to mine own ſtrength, and ſo fleſh prevailed; and now at what time ſoever I came to preſent my ſelf before the Lord, the Words of Chriſt ſtuck as a Dart in my heart, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me and of my words, in this ſinful and adulterous generation, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in the glory of his Father and of his holy Angels.</hi> And though I could not for ſome ſpace of time afterwards ſee my ſin, yet now Satan helpt on to the uttermoſt, ſo that I was in great fear that I was guilty of that <hi>Unpardonalle ſin;</hi> but the Lord, that watched over my ſoul for good, did firſt ſtrengthen my faith from the conſideration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable preciouſneſs of the blood of Chriſt: but ſtill unbelief was very powerful, and great tumults there were in my ſoul; yea, I may ſay, The bones of my peace were broken, ſometimes concluding this, and ſometimes that, and at the ſame time under the guilt of another ſin that lay heavy upon me, and thus was I afflicted and toſſed, but not comforted; but God that is plentiful in loving kindneſs, viſited my ſoul with ſo ſweet a promiſe, ſo ſutable unto my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as poſſibly my ſoul could wiſh: for when he was working godly ſorrow in my ſoul, and gave me a ſight of him whom I had pierced, yea, when I was mourning for the Abomination of others, from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. and had the ſence of theſe ſins upon my heart, I cried out in my ſorrow, <hi>Lord, whither ſhall I be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in this ſtream of iniquity?</hi> It was immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whiſpered into my ſoul, by the ſweet and ſtill voice of the Spirit of God, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> And faithful is the Lord who hath fulfilled his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45133:24"/>for whereas before I did finde that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his holy Spirit from me, and I had not the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of the Spirit of Grace and Supplication; now his aſſiſting grace was come, and now I conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſin freely: I queſtion not but that alſo his accepting grace is ſufficient for me, and his rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grace in his due time, even for me alſo, on whom the Lord Jeſus might have been aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, in the words of my dear Saviour, I do counſel every one that hath an ear, to hear what the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſaith unto the Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.</p>
