         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO MY
Eldeſt Son.</head>
            <p>SINCE it hath pleaſed God to
ſet you in a condition, whereby
you are likely to be entruſted,
with the honour of your Houſe,
and of all which is moſt precious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it, I have judged you the
perſon to whom I might moſt fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the enſuing diſcourſe, being
an Hiſtorical Narration of the Life
and Actings of the Raiſer of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Whatſoever you may find this
ſmall Work to be in it ſelf, yet I
know you will be carefull to preſerve
it in being, in reſpect of its relation
<pb facs="tcp:51737:3"/>
to the perſon who is the Subject of it,
and to whom we owe our eminency,
if any we have. I doubt not but your
own curioſity will exact at your hands
the reading of it, and the fault will
not be great if you doe it more than
once; for beſides that which relateth
to your Family, you ſhall there find
ſome things concerning the Hiſtory of
thoſe times, which are not eaſie to be
met with elſewhere; but the beſt uſe
that you can make of your reading is
this, the taking of your Anceſtour as a
precedent to direct the courſe of your
life hereafter, which cuſtome was uſual
with the old <hi>Romans,</hi> and very much
ſtirred up their <hi>Patricii</hi> or young Nobles
in the way of Vertue. You are now in
the prime of your age (as to the active
part of it,) and having the advantage
of ſo much time before you, it may pleaſe
God to give you much more liberty to
diſpoſe of your ſelf and of your courſes,
than I have had. Doe then as this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor
of yours did, Firſt gain abilities
<pb facs="tcp:51737:3"/>
by ſtudy and obſervation in your youth,
and afterwards employ thoſe abilities in
the ſervice of God and your Country.
As for your own perſon and private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
it will be imprudence not to ſeek
their preſervation, and you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by this good Example, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the advancement of them, as far
as it may be done without hindrance of
a greater good; for ſuch an ambition is
ſo far from being unlawfull, as it gives
wings (or rather being) to many deſigns
tending to publick benefit. For me, it
will be my part to aſſiſt you by my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and otherwiſe according to my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and for ſuch aſſiſtances, you ſhall
be ſure to receive them at the hands of</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your moſt truly
affectionate Father.</signed>

            <head>SOME
NOTES
Concerning the
LIFE
OF
EDWARD LORD NORTH,
BARON of KIRTLING.</head>
            <p>SUCH was the piety of the ancient hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Romans</hi> towards their deceaſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
as it became uſual to ſacrifice to
the Gods for them: Nay at laſt it grew to that
height, as many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours
thought not their duty ſufficiently performed,
unleſs they ranked their Parents in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Gods, and ſo turned that which
formerly had been received as commendable,
into a very high Impiety. Among the ancient
Chriſtians (and very near the times of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Purity) the former was ſo far revived,
as it became a note of Piety to pray for their
parents departed; and the cuſtom was ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
applauded, as it grew to extend it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51737:5"/>
ſelf to Benefactours as well as to Parents;
and in this the Clergy men, as being conceived
to pray more effectually than others, found
ſo great an advantage, as they have thought fit
to give it continuance even unto this day in the
Romiſh Church. But the uſe of Prayer in that
kind is now juſtly exploded by our reformed
Divines as an errour, and I ſhall leave the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of it to them, as a thing moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to their profeſſion; yet thus much may
be delivered as a certainty, that a reverend
affection to Parents and Benefactours, which
was the ground of that cuſtom, is not only
lawfull but praiſeworthy: And ſo natural it is
to me, as where I conceive my ſelf to have
received a great benefit from one who hath
finiſhed his courſe in this life, it conſtantly
poſſeſſeth my thoughts, that ſomething is to
be done by way of gratitude towards him.
And thus it was with me in relation to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Lord <hi>North,</hi> the common Parent and
raiſer of our Family, till my peruſal of the
old and almoſt worn-out Papers remaining at
<hi>Kirtling,</hi> gave me a ground-work to leave
ſomething behind me, which might preſerve
the memory of a perſon of ſo much Vertue
and Eminency. Yet ſome things have occurred
to my thoughts by way of diſcouragement,
to divert me from ſuch a purpoſe. As firſt
this, That ſince he was <hi>Propriae Fortunae Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and raiſed himſelf upon a ſmall baſis,
wanting the advantage of a high and noble
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51737:5"/>
extraction, it would become a derogation to
us of his Poſterity to mention his beginnings.
In this I quickly ſatisfied my ſelf, for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
relateth only to a perſon whoſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, That they were only truly noble
whoſe own Vertue rendred them ſo; and
theſe memorials are not deſigned for publick
uſe, but only to remain with us his Progeny,
who from the conſideration of his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may take occaſion to praiſe God the
more highly, for the great induſtry and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of our Anceſtor. And yet we may
juſtly affirm thus much concerning his Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that he derived it from a family of ancient
Gentry, though perhaps not ſo remarkable for
greatneſs of Eſtate as many others; nor ſhall
we bluſh to hear that even that moderate luſtre
of his was ſomewhat abated by his Father's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of himſelf to become a Citizen of
<hi>London,</hi> for that courſe of life in our later
times, is grown uſual in very conſiderable
families with younger Brothers (in which
rank his Father was) in ſo much as many of
them by that means have ſo outſtript the
chief branch of their houſe, as now to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowled
with the greater Nobility, and to
wear Coronets. Another diſſwaſive was this,
That as we have no light at all in that which
he did during his youth, ſo not in very many
particulars after the time of his activity. The
former part of this argument muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with any man, who hath but ſo much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51737:6"/>
Chriſtianity as to eſteem the Evangelical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
and the latter part being but a proof of
his modeſty, rendring it probable he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it a degree of vanity to leave any record
of his actions in writing, whereby he might
have ſeemed to covet fame with after Ages,
it became rather an incentive than a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to me in my deſire to continue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of that which either appeareth,
or may be recovered concerning him; and I
doubt not but I ſhall deliver that which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to ſatisfie any indifferent Reader, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the great worth of the perſon whoſe
Character I undertake.</p>
            <p>To make therefore an entry upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> was the Son (and
for ought we know, the only Son) of <hi>Roger
North,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtian Warcop</hi> his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of a good Family of Gentry in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
of that name; and he was born about
the year of our Lord 1496, as near as we can
conjecture, and during the reign of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. This <hi>Roger</hi> was of the Family
of the <hi>Norths</hi> of <hi>Walkeringam</hi> in the County
of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which <hi>Norths</hi> had preſerved
a ſmall Fortune in that County and place for
many Generations, without any conſiderable
encreaſe or diminution, living always in the
quality of private Gentlemen, untill the days
of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North;</hi> and many
years after, till the chief of that Race, by a
Shreivalty caſt upon him, with many charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51737:6"/>
ſuits in Law, and by the prodigality of
his eldeſt Son, who unhappily had taken upon
him the honour of Knighthood, was enforced
to part with ſo much Land, as it cauſed his
Heirs to fall out with the Manſion houſe, and
ſell it to the <hi>Perpoints,</hi> who at this time are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of it. The affection of <hi>Edward</hi> Lord
<hi>North</hi> to his Kindred of <hi>Walkeringam,</hi> was
always very great, and ſo was his care of
them in their prime concernments, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of <hi>Edward North</hi> their Chief in that age;
for in ſettling the greateſt part of his eſtate by
way of Entail, he preferred this <hi>Edward</hi> and
his Poſterity, before the Houſe of <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
and all other Deſcendents of his own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whoſe Iſſue was ſufficiently numerous.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Roger,</hi> as hath been intimated, being
a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> never attained to any
eminency of Eſtate, yet was he not ſo ſtraitned
in his fortune, but that he could and did afford
to his Son a coſtly way of breeding, training
him up at the Inns of Court in the ſtudy of the
Law. Like a good and wiſe Parent, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Child a capacity too large to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
it ſelf in his own narrow courſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
he found out for him (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome inconvenience to himſelf) a way of
greater extent and activity, which it pleaſed
God very highly to bleſs, as ſhall appear in the
ſequel of this narration. From the little that is
known of what he did in the prime of his years,
we may conclude, and not unfitly, that being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51737:7"/>
of an induſtrious nature he ſpent his time at
firſt about the laying of a foundation in the
way of his profeſſion by Study, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
having gained abilities, he ſought
to render himſelf and his parts known, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
himſelf to a fair and moderate practice
of the Law in a plauſible way; in which he
made ſo fair a progreſs, as it appears, that he
came to be of Council for the City of <hi>London,</hi>
and had a yearly Fee for that ſervice, though
it be not known at what time of his age he
came to be ſo.</p>
            <p>The firſt publick employment of his that
we have evidence for, is this, his having the
Clerkſhip of Parliament by grant from King
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. in the year 1530, which it
ſeems in thoſe days was an office of much
more reſpect than now it is, for he had it firſt
by Patent jointly with Sir <hi>Bryan Tuke,</hi> and
then wholly to himſelf, and it was afterwards
enjoyed by Sir <hi>William Pagett,</hi> then Secretary
of State, and ſo it came to Sir <hi>John Maſon,</hi>
and others: But had the place been of meaner
condition, he had wiſedom ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
him, that it is better for thoſe who have
their fortunes to make, to play at ſmall game,
than to ſit out. About this time, as by all
other fair ways, ſo in that of Marriage he
ſought his advancement, and eſpouſed himſelf
to his firſt Wife, who being a Widow and
having had two Husbands, brought him ſuch
an increaſe, as not long after, he purchaſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51737:7"/>
his Manor of <hi>Kirtling.</hi> This was about the
33d. year of his age, which ſheweth that he
was not haſty in parting with his liberty, for
he well knew the want of that to be one of
the chief <hi>remoras</hi> to young men, as to their
applications in the way of preferment other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and therefore when he came to ſell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſuffered not his affections to over-rule
his judgment, but made ſuch a choice, as to
be ſure in ſome meaſure, that the advantages
of his Wifes eſtate ſhould not be overballanced
by any natural indiſpoſitions or ill diſpoſitions
adhering to, or inherent in her perſon. And
not many years after this, his Sun began to
aſcend very faſt towards its Zenith, for the
King having taken a reſolution to ſhake off
the Papal yoke, he drew to his ſervice from
all parts, the moſt able and active ſpirits, and
among others this worthy perſon, ſo as in the
year 1536, he became one of the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
at Law, for ſo we find him ſtyled by the
King himſelf in a grant then made to him.
And now the diſſolution of Monaſteries being
enacted by Parliament, and the Court of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
being erected for the ordering of
that new acceſſion to the Crown, it pleaſed
the King about the year 1540, to confer upon
him the office of Treaſurerſhip of that Court,
which he enjoyed about four years, and during
that time, in the year 1542, by the name of
Sir <hi>Edward North</hi> (for he had received the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Knighthood) he was High Sheriff of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51737:8"/>
the Counties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon,</hi>
and alſo elected to ſerve in Parliament as Knight
of the Shire for <hi>Cambridge-ſhire,</hi> which two
employments did rarely concur in one and the
ſame perſon. And afterwards in the year 1544,
he firſt became Chancellour of the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
joyntly with Sir <hi>Richard Rich,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> and Chancellour of <hi>England;</hi>
and within a few months following, ſole Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of that Court, by reſignation of the ſaid
Sir <hi>Richard Rich</hi> unto him, and ſo he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that great office alone about four years; in
which time (as we ſuppoſe) he might well
have raiſed his fortunes double to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he left to his Family, if he had not been a
perſon of very great integrity. But though
his particular actions in the managing of that
great truſt were ſincere, and ſo not much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to detraction, yet his acting in an affair
ſo highly offenſive to the Roman Catholick
party, expoſed him to the cenſure of ſome of
his own poſterity of that profeſſion; for upon
ſome declinations in the houſe which he had
raiſed, they have not forborn to impute the
diminutions to that only cauſe, as a crime that
had been the deſtruction of many Families ſo
raiſed, and would be the Cataſtrophe of his.
I conceive this to ſavour too much of teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if it be not injurious, but I intend not to
undertake the vindication of this and other
States, in their power of ſetting out at the
firſt (or giving continuance to) a fit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51737:8"/>
for the maintenance of thoſe, either ſingle
perſons or Fraternities, which are ſet apart for
external ſervice in the way of Religion, which
power was not a thing altogether new in thoſe
times, as may appear by the Statute of <hi>Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne,</hi>
whereby dedications in the way of
Piety were much prevented; and why may
not a State finding the exceſs very prejudicial
to the whole Nation (who may challenge a
higher charity than any part whatſoever) as
well anihilate ſuch gifts already made as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them? for Dedication ſeemeth to conſiſt
rather in the declared intention of the giver,
than in the approbation of Governours, either
Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal. Neither ſhall I
define how little ſubjects are blamable for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the decrees of their ſupreme Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
though unjuſt or ſeeming irreligious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
it were an obſtruction ſcarcely recovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in a State, if ſubordinate Miniſters ſhould
be obliged to diſpute the rectitude or obliquity
of every decree. But certainly it can be no
other than a high preſumption, to apply the
judgments of the Almighty with too much
ſtrictneſs to ſuch and ſuch a particular cauſe,
for as the judgments are evident and expoſed
to the view of all, ſo their grounds lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
in the clouds and darkneſs which are
ſaid to encompaſs the Deity; and many times
thoſe who are cruſhed under a puniſhment,
do no more exceed their fellows in guiltineſs,
than they in the Goſpel on whom the Tower
of <hi>Siloah</hi> fell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51737:9"/>
But to leave this digreſſion, Sir <hi>Edward North</hi>
now ſtood ſo high in the favour of his Prince,
as he put him into the roll of Privy-Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and made frequent grants of Land as a
teſtimony of his favour, and of the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the ſervices done by him. Theſe
were great encouragements, and could not but
carry with them as great a ſatisfaction to the
receiver, but it was ſo uſual with this King to
throw down thoſe whom he had raiſed, as it
made his great ones <hi>Stare ſempre in cervello,</hi>
(as the <hi>Italians</hi> term it) or <hi>to be watchfull,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
ſtill in their minds the inſtability of the
ground whereon they ſtood. And to give ſome
taſt how dangerous a Maſter he ſerved, and
how apprehenſive he was of a change in the
way of diſpleaſure, I ſhall here inſert a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which came to me, though not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
from one who being himſelf an Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
in his Bed-chamber, then when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
paſſed, was an eye and ear Witneſs of it,
and this it is. That once early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there came from the King to <hi>Charterhouſe,</hi>
then the Manſion houſe of Sir <hi>Edward North,</hi>
a Meſſenger known to be no friend of his, to
command his immediate repair to Court, which
meſſage was alſo delivered with ſome harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
This was ſo terrible in the ſuddainneſs
and other circumſtances, as he obſerved his
Maſter to tremble at the delivery of it, who
yet finding it dangerous to uſe the leaſt delay,
haſted thither, and was admitted ſpeedily to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51737:9"/>
the King's preſence with this his Servant attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him. The King was then walking, and
continued doing ſo with great earneſtneſs, and
ever now and then caſt an angry eye upon
him, which was received with a very ſtill and
ſober carriage. At laſt the King brake out into
theſe words, We are informed that you have
cheated us of certain Lands in <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
whereunto having received no other than a
plain and humble negation, after ſome little
ſpace he replyed, How was it then, did We
give thoſe Lands to you? whereunto Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
anſwered, yes, Sir, Your Majeſty was
pleaſed ſo to doe. Whereupon having pauſed
a little, the King put on a milder countenance,
and called him to a Cupboard, conferring pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with him a long time; whereby, ſaid
this Servant, I ſaw that the King could not
ſpare my Maſter's ſervice as yet; but whether
or no the cauſe lay in the King's occaſions, or
in the other's humble behaviour and anſwers,
it muſt be left to judgment, for as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>A ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to purſue the Series of our diſcourſe,
King <hi>Henry</hi> after a long and ſtrange proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in all his undertakings, which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and full of hazard, came to breath
his laſt in the year of Grace 1546, and as a
full and final teſtimony of his confidence in
the integrity of Sir <hi>Edward North,</hi> he conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
him one of his Executors, leaving unto
divers others of his Council, perſons of more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51737:10"/>
eminent condition, the title of Overſeers of
his Teſtament, a character of higher honour,
but of leſt truſt. And ſeeing that this King
was ſo great a benefactour to the perſon who
is the occaſion of this tractate, I ſhall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to borrow ſo much time of the Reader,
as to ſay thus much more of him. I know that
many things are laid to his charge, as that he
was burthenſom to his Subjects and yet a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
That he was Sanguinary and Voluptuous
almoſt to the height. As I will not go about
to abſolve him concerning theſe, ſo I ſhall
leave it to others who may conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more proper for it, to ſet him out in
ſuch colours, but thus much I ſhall take upon
me to ſay on his behalf, That he was endued
with very great and royal abilities, and that
of all the governours of our Nation he is
the only Prince meriting to be ſtyled Arbiter
of the moſt important affairs of Chriſtendom,
(or the Ballancer as <hi>Guicchiardin</hi> calls him)
and this he did by aſſiſtance conſtantly, but
variouſly given in the Wars between <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5th. Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi>
the firſt of <hi>France,</hi> ſtill ſupporting the weaker
and oppoſing the ſtronger, by which means
he kept thoſe Princes ſtill in play one againſt
the other, and ſo eſtabliſhed his own ſecurity,
and in that reſpect was very fitly honoured
with this Motto, <hi>Cui adhereo praeeſt.</hi> And I
think that the bittereſt of his enemies muſt give
him this teſtimony, That he was no leſs boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51737:10"/>
in his Rewards, than ſevere in his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he maintained the honour of the
Nation with Foreign Princes in point of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and that he carried on the worſt of his
actions relating to the publick, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of his Parliaments, which howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his heart was diſpoſed, yet ſheweth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great dexterity of Brain. But that which
leaveth him the greateſt glory is this, That
he laid the ground-work of a Reformation in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which afterwards
grew to that perfection, as juſtly to be deemed
by judicious perſons, the beſt tempered of
any in the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>And now upon his death the Scene is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changed, for in ſtead of an active King,
who for the moſt part governed his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the Crown is fallen to a Prince, who
by reaſon of his Nonage being not able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
himſelf, and much leſs two ſo potent
Nations, falleth under the tuition of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
whoſe nature is ſuch, as they ſeldom
fail to be guided by their own ambition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the improvement of their Maſter's
intereſts. And this renders the providence of
God the more conſpicuous, for in this King's
days the Reformation of the Church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
almoſt to the height, and in a way of
more Purity than before, for King <hi>Henry</hi>
ſeemed rather to ſeek the abolition of Papal
authority, which ſo far reſtrained his Regal
power, than any other change in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51737:11"/>
of the then received Faith; but during
the reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> there was an aim
at the eſtabliſhment of Truth, even in ſuch
points of belief as had ſmall relation to that
competition for power. But to return to our
buſineſs, the perſon whoſe Life we endeavour
to deſcribe, ſoon found a difference between
his old Maſter King <hi>Henry,</hi> who already had
gratified moſt of thoſe which had ſhewed
themſelves active in his ſervice, and the Duke
of <hi>Somerſet</hi> newly made Protector of the King's
perſon; for this man, that he may advance
to places of honour and power thoſe perſons
who have their dependance upon him, muſt
either find or force a way for the effecting of
it, with them who are in poſſeſſion of thoſe
dignities. And King <hi>Edward</hi> had not reigned
two years, before <hi>Richard Sackvill</hi> Eſq; had
the Chancellourſhip of the Augmentations in
his eye, and with all ſo great an intereſt in
the Protector, as to engage him ſtrongly in
the purſuit. For the Protector ſoon cauſed
the buſineſs to be propoſed to the perſon
whom it chiefly concerned, and he finding
himſelf too weak to wreſtle with a man that
did little leſs than govern the whole Kingdom
in thoſe days, thought fit ſo far to give way, as
to bring the matter to a treaty, wherein he
carried himſelf ſo like his arts Maſter, (though
the Protector in perſon was witneſs to moſt
of it,) as he parted with the place upon terms
very conſiderable for honour, ſecurity, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51737:11"/>
profit; and yet ordered the buſineſs in ſuch a
manner, as the Protector could not but take
himſelf to be obliged in it, as may appear by
the articles of agreement between <hi>Sackvill</hi>
and him, and by other writings under Seal
belonging to that buſineſs, where the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſeem to lay all the weight upon the Lord
Protector, who is therein ſtyled Mr. <hi>Sackvill</hi>'s
good Lord. Thus by his wiſedom, he not
only prevented a miſchief which might have
befallen him in the oppoſition, and preſerved
himſelf in the dignity of a Privy Counſellor,
but gained a freſh intereſt in the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet,</hi>
that might have made him great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns;
But it pleaſed God to diſpoſe of matters
otherwiſe, for the Protector ſoon loſt not only
his power but his life, being ſupplanted by the
ſubtile practices of <hi>John</hi> afterwards Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> who though he aſſumed not
the other's title of Protector, yet bare no leſs
ſway in the government, and demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with much greater inſolence than <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</hi>
About this time Sir <hi>Edward North,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way made upon him concerning his great
office; thought good to ſtrengthen himſelf by
alliance, matching his eldeſt Son with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Winifride</hi> Daughter to <hi>Richard</hi> Lord <hi>Rich,</hi>
then Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and Widow
to <hi>Henry Dudley</hi> eldeſt Son to the ſaid Duke
of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> but neither that alliance,
nor any of his other dependencies, gave him
encouragement to ſeek farther advancement
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51737:12"/>
during the reign of King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſo as then
he endeavoured (as it ſeems) only to make
good his former ſtation, waiting for better
opportunity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as appears by an account
of his houſhold expences, he ſhewed himſelf
worthy of greater honour, by living in a way
of more eminency than hath been uſual with
perſons of his condition in thoſe and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
times; and then alſo his wiſedom
prompted him to have an eye to the Princeſs
<hi>Mary</hi> next in ſucceſſion to the Crown, for he
forgot not to put her in mind of him by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.
This had been worthy of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if he had done it only as a teſtimony of
gratitude to her Father, but he may well be
thought to have carried on a farther deſign
in it, for we find not any ſuch thing done in
relation to the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the other
Siſter; and whether or no he did then diſcern
ſome declination in the health of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
who is ſaid to have died of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is not eaſie to unfold. Yet ſuch was
the iniquity of thoſe times, as his great fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
could not prevent his being involved,
together with the reſt of the Privy-Council,
all the great officers, and moſt of the eminent
perſons in and near the Court and City of
<hi>London,</hi> in a danger (even by way of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the ſaid Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi>) which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
would have ſwallowed up any ſmall
number of them, if they had been ſevered.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51737:12"/>
For the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> foreſeeing
the certainty of the King's death, had ſo
wrought upon his tender age and weakneſs,
as to make him (as far as in him lay) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit
both his Siſters, and to eſtabliſh the
Succeſſion in the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> his near
kinſwoman then joined in Matrimony to the
Lord <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> one of the Duke's Sons.
This was done by Teſtament, and becauſe
there was an Act of Parliament to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Duke thought it not of ſufficient vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
without the concurrence and confirmation
of all thoſe who were then in power; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cauſed a Subſcription to be tendered to
every one of them, and ſo apprehenſive were
they of his diſpleaſure with the conſequences
of it, as there is no refuſal recorded but that of
Sergeant <hi>Hales</hi> one of the puney Judges, for it
ſeems that all the reſt ſubſcribed. This action
of his may ſeem to queſtion both the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and wiſedom of our Progenitor, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
him in it will require a digreſſion of ſome
length. To plead infirmity as a defence, is not
worthy of a perſon ſo eminent for wiſedom,
though <hi>Metus qui poteſt cadere in virum fortem,</hi>
doth very much excuſe; and though it may
very well become a Stateſman to prevent a
preſent danger with the hazard of a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the future, for as the <hi>Italians</hi> ſay <hi>Chi ha
tempo ha vita,</hi> He who hath time hath life;
which conſideration made the then chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> upon this very occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51737:13"/>
when his Brother of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi>
told him that they might both of them be
hanged twenty years after, if they ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the Teſtament, to return this Anſwer,
That it was moſt true, but yet as true, that if
they ſubſcribed it not, the Duke of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
might chance to hang them preſently.
But in my opinion it is not much to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but Sir <hi>Edward North</hi> had for his ſecurity
a better reſerve, which is this, a knowing
that the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> had received aſſurances
from him, to be faithfull to her and to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
in the way of allegiance, next to her
Brother's perſon and Poſterity, if any ſhould
be; which made her notwithſtanding this
Subſcription, not only to continue him in his
former dignity, but to advance him a degree
higher in the very firſt year of her reign.
And this courſe of his, to hold himſelf in
power with an intention to ſerve his lawfull
Sovereign who knew that intention, could not
but be very ſerviceable to her, and being ſo,
how could it give any great offence in a thing
ſo generally done? And as for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
it cannot well be doubted but
they would prompt him to his then compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
ſelf preſervation at that very time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conceived neceſſary by ſo many perſons
of known wiſedom; for though not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(as in nature where <hi>A privatione ad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum
non datur regreſſus,</hi>) yet it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
for perſons once outed to obtain a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51737:13"/>
of Dignities and Poſſeſſions; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it cannot be had at all, even by thoſe
who ſeem to be very much advantaged with
the preſent Governours, as may appear in the
Poſterity of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and of the
Lord <hi>Dacre</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> whoſe Predeceſſours
ſuffered for correſpondence with <hi>Mary</hi> Queen
of <hi>Scots,</hi> and yet when the Son and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſame Queen came to wear the
Crown ſucceſſively, they could not recover
their former rights. For ingenuity or open
ſincerity, it is a moſt Chriſtian vertue, yet
ſince the wiſedom of the Serpent is an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
companion to the innocency of the Dove,
that vertue cannot be ſo ſtrictly required in a
Stateſman, as in other perſons, for elſe it had
been a very horrid thing in <hi>David,</hi> a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to God's own heart, to ſuborn his
friend <hi>Huſhai</hi> to profeſs himſelf a Servant to
his Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> with an intention to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
him and to ſubvert his Counſels, for that
action of <hi>David</hi>'s is not at all diſapproved of in
Scripture as others were. But to return to our
buſineſs, In the year of our Lord 1553, King
<hi>Edward</hi> came to the period of his life and
reign, which though glorious for a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in the Churches reformation, yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
was but turbulent, by reaſon of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
upon the King's minority, both by the
Commons who in ſeveral parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
aroſe in Rebellion, and did it ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly,
as the State thought good to uſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51737:14"/>
Foreigners in the ſuppreſſion of them, a thing
very unuſual in this Nation, and by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Nobles who divided themſelves into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which ſome of them neareſt in relation
to the King himſelf, paid for, with the loſs of
their Heads even in his days, and others upon
grounds then laid very ſhortly after. Upon
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s death, this Kingdom fell from
a condition of inſtability which it had often
felt during the nonage of its Princes, to an
eſtate which was then altogether unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by us, to wit, the government of a
Queen regnant, a thing which the French
Nation profeſſeth utterly to abhor, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them <hi>Tomber en quinoüille,</hi> or <hi>to fall
under the Diſtaff.</hi> It is true, that this Crown
had frequently paſſed to the Progeny of our
Sovereigns Daughters, but before this time it
was never ſet (much leſs ſettled) upon the
head of any Woman. This might have raiſed
great ſtorms, but it pleaſed the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſo to diſpoſe of things by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
as the Pill was ſwallowed down
with great quietneſs; for firſt there was not
then in being with us any male Prince of the
bloud, as <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> had been in <hi>France,</hi>
who there aſſumed the Crown to the diſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; then this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had given its conſent in Parliament to an
Entail of the Crown upon <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
Daughters to King <hi>Henry.</hi> And laſt of
all the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s ambition
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51737:14"/>
not being able to make way otherwiſe, had
endeavoured to fix the Crown upon another
Lady of Royal bloud, his Daughter in Law,
ſo as by reaſon of this competition all the
active ſpirits of the Nation, having no other
adherence, became quickly engaged with one
of the Competitreſſes, and ſo the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
was wholly put out of thought. The
affection of this People was then ſo great to
a right Succeſſion in the race of their Princes,
as notwithſtanding hazard of the Churches
late reformation (which a great part of the
Nation had then ſet their hearts upon) and
the intereſt of the moſt eminent perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
poſſeſſours of Church-lands by way of
exchange and otherwiſe, yet the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> ſoon found the weakneſs of his
deſigns which he thought ſo ſtrongly laid,
and being forſaken by his party, became an
aſſiſtant in the proclaiming of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi>
but it was too late to prevent the loſs of his
Head, which had ſhewed it ſelf ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p>Thus Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> having her Sovereignty
generally acknowledged, began her Reign,
and being deſirous to give ſome teſtimony of
a gracious diſpoſition, ſhe gave free pardon
to all ſaving the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the
Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> and ſome few others. The Lords
of the Council, who had ſubſcribed againſt
her, and for ſome time had ſeemed to act in
the ſame way, were included in the Pardon,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51737:15"/>
and ſome of them continued in that great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and truſt; which may ſeem ſtrange,
conſidering that the deſigns of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
were ſo diametrally oppoſite to thoſe of King
<hi>Edward</hi> in point of Religion, but the ſame
oppoſition was between the Eccleſiaſtical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and religion of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yet many of the old Counſellours
were alſo held on by the latter; and it ſeems
fit (if not neceſſary) that it ſhould be ſo, for
great changes in a State cannot be wrought ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
without great danger, and the doing
of it maturely and judiciouſly, requireth not
only an exact knowledge of matters former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſacted, but alſo of their grounds and
cauſes.</p>
            <p>Of the Counſellours retained, Sir <hi>Edward
North</hi> eaſily obtained to be one, and not only
ſo, but in the firſt year of this Queens reign,
he received an encreaſe of Dignity, being called
to ſit in Parliament as a Baron, which is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Queens favour not then extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any other of the old Counſellours, though
many of them held themſelves in favour with
her even to the time of her death. And this
ſheweth that ſhe intended a ſpecial reward to
him, and preſuppoſeth a merit contracted by
the performance of ſome former ſervice of
eminence. It coſt her nothing, yet was it
of very high value, for the dignity of Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was rarely conferred upon any but perſons
of great worth and merit during the reigns of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51737:15"/>
theſe two Siſters, though under the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes it became not only more common
but a kind of merchandize for the benefit of
Courtiers. And now it appears how ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
he parted with his office of Chancellour
of the Augmentations, for he did it upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
conſideration, whereas his ſucceſſour
Sir <hi>Richard Sackvill,</hi> who held himſelf in
grace all Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, yet loſt it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any recompence at all.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt remarkable occurrents du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Queens Reign, was her marriage with
King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> and conſidering
that <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> is by our Hiſtorians
ſpecified in the catalogue of thoſe Lords who
were employed in his reception, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
likely as a Counſellour to have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all the way in the negotiating of that
affair, perhaps it may not be thought impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to touch ſomewhat upon it. It might
well be apprehended as a great danger to this
People, for their Queen to match with a
more potent Prince of another Nation, in
reſpect that this Kingdom might by ſuch
means become a Province, being deprived of
the preſence of their Sovereign: But the
tranſactours well knew, that this great King
(whoſe vertues were ſo many, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find ſufficient room in this ſmall Treatiſe)
was before his marriage here provided of a
Son, to inherit his great Kingdom in caſe
there had been iſſue by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51737:16"/>
iſſue nevertheleſs of hers ſhould have enjoyed
the <hi>Burgundian</hi> Provinces, a great acceſſion to
his Crown, and free from the inconvenience
before mentioned. And all other particulars
were ſo well provided for in that buſineſs, as
there appeared little intermixture of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the government during the Queens
life, and no inconvenience at all upon her
death. For <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North,</hi> he continued
in good favour all the time of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
for he held his Counſellourſhip and was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with the Queen to obtain grace for others,
as may appear by the reſtitution in bloud of a
perſon very highly deſcended and wrought by
his mediation, which alſo could not but be a
matter of good profit to him. And now this
Queens reign not affording more matter rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the ſubject of this diſcourſe, I muſt
not leave untouched a reflexion indiſcreetly
caſt upon this noble perſon by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in
his Acts and Monuments, which is this. He
ſaith, that he himſelf ſpake with a Woman
who told him, that near the expected time of
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s delivery (for ſhe conceived her
ſelf to be with Child, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was poſſeſſed with ſuch an expectation)
the Lord <hi>North</hi> and another Lord came to
her, and would have prevailed with her to
part with a child of hers newly born, but
that ſhe utterly refuſed it; and this Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>
conceiveth to have been deſired as a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
Child for the Queen. The deſign it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51737:16"/>
ſelf is ſo unprobable, either to have been
truly ſuch, or to have been carried on by a
perſon of ſo much honour and wiſedom, as it
needeth little anſwer, for the Queen her ſelf
was too vertuous (and religious in her way)
to admit of ſuch a thought; Neither if there
had been ſuch an intention, could it poſſibly
have been concealed, being the concernment
of ſo great Princes and Nations. And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs
the ſucceeding Queen would never have
caſt the leaſt honour, or placed any truſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Lord or his Son <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>North,</hi>
(whom ſhe made a Privy-Counſellour and
near officer about her) if ſhe had given the
leaſt credit to that Calumny. It is therefore
a wonder that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſhould inſert in his
Hiſtory ſo trivial a thing, and caſting ſo great
a Scandal, having received it from a mean
perſon (in an extrajudicial way,) who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might be hired to the affirmation, for
certainly he could not have found a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to abate the credit of his other Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
But however it was concerning
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s conception, whether it were
only fancied by her, or in it ſelf real with an
abortion following, it is certain that ſhe lived
not long after, for ſhe fell preſently into a
deep ſadneſs of ſpirit, and ended her days in
the year 1558, having reigned but a ſhort
time, and very unhappily even in her own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for ſhe thought the loſs of <hi>Calais</hi> (which
was the laſt footing of our Nation in <hi>France</hi>)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51737:17"/>
to be an irreparable blemiſh to her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet was there much bloud ſhed at
home for Religion. which better might have
deſerved her ſorrow, but ſhe according to
the Prophecy of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> thought
ſhe did God good ſervice in it.</p>
            <p>She was a Princeſs very eminent for Vertue
and Piety, but too flexible (a weakneſs incident
to her ſex, which is not ſo fit to govern in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
matters,) referring almoſt all to others, but
eſpecially in matters of Religion to her Prelates.
Theſe ſhe ſhould have conſidered, as too much
intereſted and over-violent in things tending
to their own power and greatneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſubjects of a Tyrant, who manageth
his own affairs, prove for the moſt part not
ſo unhappy, as of thoſe of a mild Prince
who putteth the whole care of Government
upon ſome choice inſtruments, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
many Tyrants in ſtead of one, and
being of a more ſervile condition, are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſteered by more ſordid ends. Yet is the
Prince himſelf anſwerable for their faults,
and ſo certainly was this Queen, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe in reſpect of her engagement to
uphold the Papal power, ſhe may be thought
not to have given an unwilling conſent to
thoſe horrid cruelties, but <hi>Sanguis martyrum
eſt ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> which ſaying it pleaſed
God to verifie moſt ſtrangely at that time,
as may appear in the Reformation perfected
and ſettled immediately after Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s
days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51737:17"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s entry upon her Reign,
was embraced with a general applauſe, by
the Proteſtants cordially, for they concluded
her well affected to their principles, and by
the Papiſts ſeemingly, becauſe ſhe was yet
theirs in outward profeſſion, as appeared by
the Popiſh Ceremonies uſed at her Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet theſe could not but be very diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
knowing her intereſt to be directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to that of her Siſter, for if the Pope
had power to Legitimate the marriage with
<hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> Mother to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
then that with <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> Mother to
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being ſolemnized living the
other, muſt of neceſſity be invalide.</p>
            <p>This Queen preſently made an alteration
at the Council-Table, retaining ſome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing
others. Of the latter ſort was <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Lord <hi>North,</hi> and whether or no it was
his own deſire by reaſon of age and infirmity
we know not, but certain it is that he was
not under any great diſpleaſure, for the Queen
finding it requiſite to erect a Lieutenancy for
command of the Militia, and ordering of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in each County, made choice of him for
that truſt in <hi>Cambridge-ſhire</hi> and the Iſle of
<hi>Ely.</hi> This ſhe did in the firſt year of her
reign, and by another Patent in her ſecond
year, ſhe confirmed it unto him. But this
power was ſoon reſumed, and as I conceive,
laid down generally for the preſent, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
occaſion to ſay ſomething Hiſtorically of
the Militia of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51737:18"/>
Anciently the Martial forces were of two
kinds, extraordinary or ordinary. The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
conſiſted of Mercenaries, ſerving for
Pay, and taken into ſervice upon the occaſion.
The ordinary were partly ſuch as lay under
an obligation by the tenure of their Lands to
ſerve their Prince, and this comprized all the
Nobility and Gentry of the Land with their
Tenants; and theſe were they by whoſe help
our Kings made ſo great Conqueſts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo formidable abroad, for if the Tenants
anſwered not the expectation of their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
it was in the Landlord's power to turn
them out of the Eſtates which they held, but
eſpecially ſuch as were Copyholders. This
power of great men, as it was extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
againſt Foreigners, ſo it grew dangerous
at home, for that means there was great and
frequent oppoſitions made againſt the Princes,
by Civil War managed by the Nobles, whoſe
Tenants were neceſſitated to ſerve them, and
this made the Kings ſo far to diminiſh this
power upon Tenants at Will, by frequent
deciſions of their Judges, giving to Copyhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
a Tenure by cuſtom, as they grew alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
deaf at the call of their Landlords;
And ſo it was found by this our <hi>Edward,</hi> and
others who would have uſed their Tenants
for ſervice of the Crown in foreign wars
under <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. This was ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
to the Prince, but little in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that which hath ſhewed it ſelf in theſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51737:18"/>
latter times, wherein the Commonalty or
third Eſtate hath aſſumed a power, not only
to ſubject their Sovereign to a juriſdiction
eſtabliſhed by the ſaid Commons, but to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Regal power it ſelf, and as a conſequent
thereunto, to bring the ancient Peerage to a
level with themſelves. And this may be very
much attributed to the former extirpation of
power in great perſons, who ſtood as a wall of
defence between Prince and People. The other
part of the ordinary Militia conſiſted in the
arraying of all perſons fit for War defenſive,
and this was firſt managed by Commiſſioners
of Array, authoriſed from time to time by the
Kings themſelves, which made them to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
it much more than the other. But in
proceſs of time this power reſiding in many,
who are more ſubject to find out dilatory ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
than a ſingle perſon, gave occaſion to the
Princes more to affect the placing of it in ſome
one, for one may more eaſily be commanded,
and is more ſubject to an account upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage.
But on the other ſide this gave more
offence to the Commons in Parliament, who
bear the Purſe for ſupply of their Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
occaſions, which perhaps might
be the cauſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s laying
it down for that time, though ſhe reſumed it
afterwards.</p>
            <p>After this, it appeareth not that <hi>Edward</hi>
Lord <hi>North</hi> ever deſired other than an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from publick employments, with a quiet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51737:19"/>
enjoyment of himſelf and of the fruits of his
paſt labours; and in this it pleaſed God to bleſs
him very far, for he had little publick moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet was he not free from diſquiet at
home, by reaſon of ſome apprehenſions ariſing
within his own family by the prodigality of
his eldeſt Son, for whom as is expreſt in his
Will, he was conſtrained at the laſt to pay a
great debt, beſides much of the ſame nature
formerly. In thoſe days the ſum which he
paid was eſteemed very great, yet was not the
debt ſo conſiderable in his thoughts, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in his Son (eaſily diſcernible as he
eſteemed) to proceed in the ſame way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
He feared that this would make the
young man to exceed all bounds when he
ſhould become maſter of his Eſtate, which
made the impreſſion ſo deep with him, as he
failed not to admoniſh his Son in the ſaid Will
with very great reflexions upon him, as to his
prudence; and perhaps it wrought great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
after the Father's death. And here may
be noted, that the ableſt perſons make their
judgments as to the future with great incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
for <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> proved a moſt
induſtrious and provident man, and a perſon
of great honour, for he was Ambaſſadour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi>
the 9th. of <hi>France,</hi> and bare many other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
employments abroad and at home, till at
the laſt he became Treaſurer of the houſhold
to the Queen, and one of her Privy-Council,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51737:19"/>
dying with that Character upon him, in
which he exceeded his Father. Neither had
<hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North</hi> any greater hopes of
Sir <hi>Thomas North</hi> his other Son, who though
a man of courage, a man learned (as appears
by divers tranſlations of his,) and indued with
very good parts otherwiſe, yet never had a
ſteadineſs comparable to his Brother, which
made the Father to ſettle his Eſtate by way
of Entail, as ſtrongly to prevent Alienations
as the Law of thoſe times would bear, with
a remainder to his Kindred of <hi>Walkeringam,</hi>
as hath been already touched. And in the
year 1563, he made the Will before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and conſtituted Sir <hi>William Cordall</hi> and
Sir <hi>James Dyer</hi> Executors of the ſame, both
of them perſons very eminent in thoſe times,
Sir <hi>William</hi> being Maſter of the Rolls, and
Sir <hi>James Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common
Pleas. In the year ſucceeding, having crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his wiſedom by a diſcreet ſettlement of his
private fortune, he paid his laſt debt to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ending his life with the <hi>Julian</hi> year on
the laſt day of <hi>December,</hi> and ſo changed this
for a better, being then about the 68th. year of
his age, as near as we can gather by conjecture.
Thus terminated the life of this noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
perſon, who hid not the talent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his Maker entruſted him, but improved
it for the advantage of his Nation and Family,
which ought to be an eternal honour to him.</p>
            <p>His marriages were two, whereof the firſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51737:20"/>
was to <hi>Alice Squier</hi> Daughter to a Gentleman
eſtated in <hi>Hamp-ſhire,</hi> ſhe then being Widow
of <hi>Edward Myrfyn</hi> Son to an Alderman of
<hi>London,</hi> ſo named, and having alſo had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Husband called <hi>Brigantine</hi> or <hi>Brickenden,</hi>
and by each of theſe Husbands one Son. By
this Wife he had four Children, whereof <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
Lord <hi>North</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas North</hi> have
already been named, and in ſome ſort Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
herein. The other two were Daughters,
whereof <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the elder was married to
<hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Scroope</hi> of <hi>Bolton.</hi> Of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of theſe four there is Poſterity left,
and now grown ſo numerous in the whole,
and it is become ſo far an honour to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Progenitor, as I my ſelf, who am the
Grandchild of his Grandchild, may in the
year of our Lord 1658, affirm, that I know
not any of the Race that have as yet applied
themſelves to courſes diſhoneſt or diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
This Lady <hi>Alice,</hi> as ſhe brought him a
conſiderable eſtate in Marriage, ſo ſhe was a
great and conſtant aſſiſtant to him in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of his fortunes, always ſhewing
her ſelf a diſcreet and provident perſon in the
government of his domeſtique affairs; and ſhe
continued ſo till the time of her death, which
hapned ſome four or five years before that of
her husband, who failed not to yield a fair
mention of her goodneſs in his Teſtament,
deſiring alſo to be buried with her at <hi>Kirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51737:20"/>
His ſecond and laſt Wife was the Lady
<hi>Margaret</hi> Widow to Sir <hi>David Brooke,</hi> and
ſurely ſhe was a perſon worthy of his choice,
for he ſhewed much care of her in his laſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
by Will, which is all that I ſhall need
to ſay of her.</p>
            <p>By his Picture, whereof there is yet a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
remaining with us, he appears to have
been a perſon of moderate ſtature, ſomewhat
inclining to corpulency, and of a reddiſh hair.
As for his inward abilities, it were extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
to queſtion them, in a man ſo verſed in
affairs of State as a Privy-Counſellour, and
that ſate at the Stern ſo many years in an
eminent place of Judicature. Such perſons
ſeldom want elocution ſufficient, but if we
may judge of his Oratory by his Letters, he
ſeemed rather to have affected the delivery of
a full and clear ſenſe, than any curioſity of
ſtyle or expreſſion. I have heard, that being
quick of apprehenſion he was much inclin'd
to ſudden anger, wherein certainly he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moderated himſelf, for otherwiſe he could
not ſo well have undergon employments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
ſo great a temper.</p>
            <p>The bravery of his mind may beſt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, by his delight to live in an equipage ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
above than under his condition or degree,
as hath been already hinted, and by his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
in other kinds, but eſpecially by
his buildings, which were very noble for mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
and workman-ſhip, as may appear by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51737:21"/>
two houſes which he ſet up at <hi>Kirtling</hi> and
<hi>Charterhouſe,</hi> both in being at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To
prove that he was a great lover of Learning and
Scholars, we have two witneſſes no ways lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to exception, The firſt is the Univerſity
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whoſe body hath no conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
revenue, but what ariſeth from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage
of <hi>Burwell</hi> given by him. And it
were pity to omit the manner of that Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſince that by it he expreſt a deſire of
future correſpondence between that Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the chief of his Family; for to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caridge
of <hi>Burwell,</hi> during its vacancy, the
Univerſity nominates two Clarks, and the
Lord <hi>North</hi> for the time being, preſents one
of them at his choice. Our other witneſs is
<hi>Peterhouſe,</hi> the ancienteſt College of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
to which foundation, as a token of
his gratitude for that which he gathered there
in the way of Learning, he gave the Parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of <hi>Ellington,</hi> and ſo became one of their
beſt Benefactours, as they cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>As for Piety and Charity, it will be hard to
give evidence in particular about a hundred
years after a man's deceaſe, farther than may
be extracted from Records and publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Under the head of Piety, I think we
may comprehend his care to provide Chapels
in ſuch houſes as he built, for thereby appears
a deſire in him of an aſſiduity in the ſervice of
God by himſelf and his family, which care of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51737:21"/>
providing peculiar places for divine Service
within Families, was too much neglected in
the age immediately following, as may be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
by many great and ſtately Houſes then
built. And may it not fall under the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Piety, to build a Chapel expreſly for
the enterment of his Poſterity, for though the
main ſuperſtition was expired, yet Burials in
thoſe days were attended with the performance
of much religious duty? Under the title of
Charity I ſhall place the above mentioned gifts
to the Univerſity, and to <hi>Peterhouſe,</hi> and I
may add to them a care had in his Teſtament,
of ſome perſons no ways relating to him in
bloud. And if Charity be truly ſaid to begin
at home, then it may fall under that head, to
make proviſion of a fair ſubſiſtence for his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
according to the degree wherein they
were placed (as far as it might be done without
obliquity in other kinds,) and that was always
driven at by this noble Lord. For the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Enterment, it was raiſed by him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
to the ſouth-part of the Chancel in
<hi>Kirtling</hi> Church, and there at the very jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the Chancel and Chapel, he himſelf
is entombed with a decent Monument of Black
Marble, erected by his Executors, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing

his Generation when God gave him being; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that he flouriſhed in a time remote from the
preſent, and little relating to our late affairs, I
conceived that I might inoffenſively tranſmit my
Obſervations to Poſterity, not omitting the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of ſome truths which may ſeem to be of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
concernment. This made me reduce my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51737:23"/>
Notes to ſome kind of Method, and doing ſo I
cannot but wiſh unto them a competency of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they having not only reference to a perſon
whoſe memory is moſt dear unto me, but being a
kind of Iſſue or Off-ſpring of my own, which laſt
is a conſideration too apt to beget a partiality of
Affection if not of Judgment. I never coveted
the honour of the Preſs, much leſs ſhould I do it
in a time of ſo much proſtitution. It ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſatisfie me to recommend this ſmall Diſcourſe
of mine in the way of <hi>Manuſcript</hi> to ſome of thoſe
who may acknowledge themſelves to have relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it, and I hope it will not prove offenſive if
I make this my firſt addreſs unto your Society,
ſince you are not aſhamed to own <hi>Edward</hi> Lord
<hi>North</hi> (who is the only Subject of this little
Work) as one of your nobleſt and moſt free Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactours.
And for my ſelf, though when firſt
I became a <hi>Cantabrigian,</hi> my Parents put me to
ſuck at the breaſt of another Houſe, as my Nurſe,
which hath ſecured unto her the chief place in
my affection, yet the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity being my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I cannot but have a ſpecial reſpect unto
yours, as being her moſt ancient foundation. I
dare not term <hi>Peterhouſe</hi> the heart of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
becauſe it would draw too much envy
upon you, yet none of her Siſters can deny that
ſhe had the property of the heart to be <hi>Primum
movens,</hi> and I think that neither they nor we
can with any patience admit the leaſt thought of
a trial by <hi>ultimum moriens.</hi> I may juſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that no man can wiſh unto your Fraternity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51737:23"/>
a longer and more happy continuance, for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
extends even to perpetuity it ſelf, if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things could bear it. The truth is, that
I do preſage a very great length of time, finding
the diſpenſations of Divine Providence to have
been ſuch as ſeem to deſign the prevention of a
ſecond Chaos, which ſtate of darkneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
ſhould it once overſpread the Land could
not but put the great Luminaries of it to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of being extinguiſhed. Blame me not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if I deſire to depoſite with you this ſmall
Tractate, which may be dear to ſome of us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its Relations, though not precious in it
ſelf, as being a Portraict drawn by an unskilfull
Artiſt, and ſet out with ill mixed colours. But
ſuch as it is, the care of preſerving it is a truſt,
and if you ſhall be pleaſed ſo far to accept of that
truſt, as to afford a place in your College Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
to this little Work (being the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of a Lady) it will lay a freſh obligation
upon him who already is</p>

            <p>IT was an effect of Superſtition in the ancient
Heathen, to aſcribe unto Fountains of moſt
Eminence a kind of Divinity, finding in them
a perennity more than is to be had in other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blunary
beings; which Art of theirs was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Impious in it ſelf, but Injurious to the true
<hi>Deity,</hi> for how can that be juſtly imputed to any
part of the Creation, which is peculiar to the
<hi>Creator,</hi> that infinitely pure Eſſence, from whoſe
effluence all that is, or hereafter can be, muſt
have its derivation? Yet certainly it can no
way participate of evil, to afford honour next
to thoſe Divine, unto fountains of Learning,
which learning ſo adds light to natural Reaſon,
as gives it ability to ſearch into all the ſecrets
of Nature, and to unfold thoſe myſteries, which
we have by Divine revelation, ſo as to impart
them with advantage unto Subjects capable of
ſuch ſublime notions. Such a fountain is our
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> from whom (together
with her Siſter of <hi>Oxford</hi>) this Nation muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to have received the honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
not only to enjoy it her ſelf, but to have
imparted to Foreigners, much of that encreaſe
of knowledge both Natural and Theological,
wherewith the World is at this time furniſhed.
Of this honour and common benefit the heart of
each intelligent <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ought to receive an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51737:24"/>
impreſſion, and more eſpecially the heart of ſuch
perſons as are Sons of either <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity. But
becauſe Gratitude concealed yields little fruit,
therefore I (though one of thoſe who have taken
from the <hi>Cantabrigian Helicon</hi> leaſt water)
hold my ſelf bound rather to break ſilence than
to run the hazard of being cenſured for Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
And becauſe I have nothing worthy in it
ſelf, to be offered to my Mother the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,
I adventure to preſent unto Her (by an addreſs
unto you Her chief Officers) that which may be
eſteemed worthy in reſpect of relation unto Her
ſelf, which is the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North,</hi>
one of Her chief Benefactours. And that he
was ſo, may appear by this, that the Patronage
of <hi>Burwell</hi> Rectory was his Inheritance, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by
his ſolicitation and favour with the then King,
and (as we firmly believe) at his own charge: This
is the moſt profitable Poſſeſſion (as I have heard)
that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity is endowed with, and yet
the matter is ſo far miſtaken, as in your Annual
Commemoration of Benefactours, <hi>Edward</hi> Lord
<hi>North</hi> is wholly left out, and the gift of <hi>Burwell</hi>
is attributed only to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, his Prince
and Maſter, with whom it was too uſual to aſſume
unto himſelf the honour of other mens Bounty and
Charity. For proof of this I muſt requeſt your
peruſal of the enſuing ſhort Tractate, and the
Tranſcript of an Evidence ſubjoined to it, which
cannot but be upon Record ſomewhere. When you
ſhall have given me ſo much reading, and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51737:25"/>
ſome perſon to make ſearch in your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
I ſhall have no reaſon, either to doubt
your aſſent to what I have affirmed, or to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
of right to be done in future commemorations.
And you cannot blame us of his Progeny, if we
be unwilling to loſe the honour of his having been
Benefactour to ſo honourable and eminent a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
As for <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>North.</hi> I may well
hope, that upon reading, you will find him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
worthy to be owned in ſuch a Relation. And for
the Diſcourſe it ſelf, I am unwilling to doubt your
affording it the honour of a place in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
Library; for though it were written in a
time of unparallell'd trouble and confuſion, when
the beſt converſation of Good men was with their
own thoughts, and when Hiſtorical Truth was
dangerous, yet it containeth (as I think nothing
apt to give offence, and perhaps ſomething of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
will be found there, which untouched by
others, may become a pleaſing entertainment to the
Reader. I muſt not omit the asking your pardon,
for filling empty Leaves with thoſe abrupt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionals,
which durſt not have appeared in your
preſence alone, and have little to ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but that they are born of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with the other. I muſt confeſs in both parts
a great vacuity of learning, and that the ſtyle will
be found rough and unpleaſant, both which faults
are ſcarce pardonable with Scholars, yet having a
ſincere intention in the addreſs, I caſt my ſelf upon
your favour, and am</p>
