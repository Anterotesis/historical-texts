         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as it hath pleased the Lord God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, (who is mighty and powerful, and
bringeth to pass whatsoever he will in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of this World,) so to suffer it to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
that power and authority is given unto you,
to exercise over these Kingdomes; And whereas the people
of these Nations (over whom your Authority is extended)
are divided in their Judgments in matters Spiritual, and are
of different Principles and wayes in Relation to Faith and
Worship and practises of Religion, and yet are all of them
free-born people, and Natives of these Kingdoms, and as such
ought to possesse and injoy their Lives, Liberties and Estates
by the just Lawes of God and man; And may not justly any
of them be destroyed by you, nor one sort of another, in their
Persons and Estates, by Death, Banishment or other Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
for and because only of their differences in matters
of opinion and judgement, nor though they are contrary
minded in profession of Faith and Worship and Religion,
while they do walk peaceably and justly in their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
under the Kings Authority, and do not make practise of
their Religion, to the violating of the Government, nor to
the injury of other mens Persons or Estates, but ought rather
to be defended and Protected by you in all their rights both
as men and Christians, both in things Civil and Spiritual,
Notwithstanding their difference in matters Religious as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
they giving proof of their peaceable and honest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58212:3"/>
towards the King and his Government, and the
people of these Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And therefore that due care may be had, as justly it ought
to be by you, for the Peace and Prosperity and happiness of
these Kingdomes, and that the just Liberties both civil and
Spiritual of all people therein, may be allowed and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all the Kings Dominions, and that unity and peace may
be fully established, and justice and Righteousness only
brought forth in the Land, and all Persecution, Hatred,
Contention and Rebellion may die and perish and never
more appear; And that all Christian people (though diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in judgement and practises in matters of Faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
may be protected to live a quiet and peaceable life in all
Godliness and honesty under this Government, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
and vengeance may he diverted from these Lands,
which seems to threaten because of the contrary, and that
blessings and peace may come, and rest upon this people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore for these ends and causes, and in the Name of the
Lord I do propound unto you, and lay before you on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of all the divided people of these Kingdoms,</hi> That free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience in the exercise of Faith, Worship and Religion to
God-wards, may be allowed and maintained unto all, without any
imposition, violence or persecution exercised about the same, on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Estates, or consciences of any in any relation of Religion, the
Worship of God, Church Government and Ministry; But that all
Christian People may be left free in all these Kingdomes, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Conscience without being restrained from, or compelled to any
way of Worship and practise of Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on, upon any pains and penalties,
and that every one may be admitted to worship God in that way
as his spirit perswades the heart, and may be defended in such their
profession of Religion, while they make not use of their Liberty to the
detrement of any other mens persons or Estates as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And let it not seem strange to you, why I appear in this
manner and matter, at such a season as this; for your very
happiness, prosperity and establishment, or the contrary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
hereupon, even in allowing and maintaining liberty
of Conscience in the exercise of Religion, or in limiting and
forcing and persecuting about the same, and this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if ye justly consider these things following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58212:3"/>
1. The Lordship in and over conscience, and the exercise
thereof in all matters of Faith, and worship and duty to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
is Gods alone only and proper right and priviledge,
and he hath reserved this power and Authority in himself,
and not committed the <hi>Lordship over Conscience, nor the exercise
thereof,</hi> in the cases of faith and worship, to any upon Earth,
not to prescribe and impose principles and Practises of Faith
and worship and Religion, by force and violence on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Consciences of men, but this belongs only to God,
even to work faith in the heart, and to convert to holiness,
and to lead and teach people by his Spirit in his worship, and
to exercise their Consciences in all his wayes; For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselves said, they had not Dominion over the
Faith of the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. but the Lord alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, said in his Meditations, page 91. of that
Edition Printed for <hi>R. Royston; I have often declared how little I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
my Laws and Scepter should intrench on Gods Soveraignity which is
the only King of mens Consciences, &amp;c</hi> So that to be Lord in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and exerciser thereof in all the matters of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is his only proper right, and to him alone it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
            <p>2. And therefore consider if ye do not allow free liberty of
Conscience, and give unto God the Lordship and exercise
thereof in all matters of Faith and Worship to him-wards, but
do impose by violence in forcing to, and restraining from
such and such wayes of Religion, then ye take Dominion
over mens faith, which ye ought not to do, and ye intrench
on <hi>Gods Soveraignity,</hi> and usurps his Authority in exercising
<hi>Lordship over the Conscience,</hi> in and over which Christ is <hi>only
King</hi> as before recited, and ye ought not to take his right from
him, nor to exercise that Authority over mens faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iences
which only appertains unto him, as his proper pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;
for in so doing how dangerous effects may it bring
forth, even ye may easilie provoke the Lord to wrath against
you, and bring upon your selves sorrow and misery, if ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
violence upon mens Consciences in and concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
matters, contrary to the Scriptures and the example of
Primitive Christians who were persecuted for their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, but did never persecute nor punish any for that
cause, nor ever used violence about their Religion, as <hi>Charles</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58212:4"/>
the I. in his meditations pag. 82. <hi>nothing</hi> (said he) <hi>violent nor
injurious can be religious,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Consider, if ye allow not the free exercise of Conscience
in Spiritual matters, but do take Dominion over mens faith,
and impose by violence in the cases of Conscience about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and do not suffer the Lord to enjoy his onely right to
be King, in the matters of his own Kingdom, then ye <hi>divert
the end of just rule and government among men,</hi> and perverts the
end of Gods great love and favour shewed unto you in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of you to the place of Authority and Judgment; for the
end of just Government upon earth by Kings and Rulers is to
exercise Justice, Truth, and Righteousnesse among men, and
over the outward man, and to be a praise to all that do
well, and walks uprightly, and to be a terrour to all
transgressors and them that do evil in their outward man,
and to keep the outward man in good order by just Judgment
in all cases between man and man; This is only the extent
of your Authority over the outward man, and to your Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
only this belongs, to judge in Truth and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to make Laws and execute them between man and man,
to preserve mens persons and estates from the wrong one of
another, but not at all to make Laws and execute them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and mens Consciences in the cases of his Spiritual
Kingdom, this power belongs to God, and he hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to you to exercise; and therefore, let justice, equity
and mercy be exercised by you among men, and over the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, and in all cases between man and man; but med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not in the cases of mens faith to God, and their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to him, but leave that unto him alone whose right it is,
for it is dangerous, and will bring wofull effects if ye intrench
on Gods Soveraignity, and if ye divert the proper end of just
Government, and of the Love of God in restoring you into
Authority and Power.</p>
            <p>4. Consider, if ye allow not free Liberty of Conscience in
the profession and practice of spiritual things, but will compel
by violence about Religion, <hi>then this will inavoidably produce
and bring forth cruel persecution in the Kingdoms,</hi> imprisonment,
banishment, and death, and all the evil effects of persecution
will fill the Nations; for though never so forceable impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be laid on the persons, estates, and consciences of men,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58212:4"/>
for the cause of difference in Judgment, and practises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to compel into Conformity, yet it cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that all will bow and conform to the denying of that
way which they are perswaded in Conscience to be right, and
to the embracing of what they cannot in Conscience believe
is of God, but will rather suffer the cruelest death, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to any thing contrary to light and knowledge; and if
free Liberty of Conscience be denied, many such must needs
be exposed to persecution, even to death, though they may be
peaceable people, and profitable inhabitants of the Kingdoms,
and in the things between man and man, and in all matters
temporal pertaining to the King, may be just, and righteous,
and unreprovable, yet because of difference in judgment and
opinion, exposed to be destroyed in person and estate; and
such effects will not be of honour nor safety to these Nations
if innocent and just men be destroyed, and their relations ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined,
onely for their Conscience and Religion sake, by perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>5. Consider, if ye do impose one way of worship by force,
and persecute all that are contrary-minded, to prison and
death, <hi>then how shall your Names and memorial be left a reproach
to generations after you, in dayes to come,</hi> who shall repute you cruel
men and persecutors, and such as destroyed your people for
difference in matters of Religion, and without just cause, and
thus will your names be a curse and not a blessing to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and their Children to all ages, if that ye make Laws and
execute them to the persecution and destruction of people for
Conscience sake, and for difference in Religion; for persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was never of God, nor ever justified in succeeding ages,
but persecutors alwaies were rendred Tyrants, and cruell in
the ages succeeding them; for do not you condemn the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
as oppressors and cruel persecutors in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies,
for their persecuting your Fore-fathers? And King <hi>Iames</hi> said
<hi>it was usually the condition of Christians to be persecuted, but never to
persecute, &amp;c.</hi> in his Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, pag. 4,
And indeed, they are no true Christians that persecutes for
matters of Conscience, and difference in Opinion, but the false
Christians that have a form of godliness but are without the
power, and out of the Doctrine of the Scriptures, who saith,
love your enemies, and render to no man evil for evil,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58212:5"/>
but over come evil with good.</p>
            <p>6. Consider, If ye do impose upon the Conscience, and
persecute about Religion, <hi>ye can never effect your end thereby,</hi> as
to force all into a conformity and uniformity to your Church
and Religion; but though death, and banishment, and the loss
of all be inflicted, yet such a thing cannot be effected, neither
is it the way of Christ to promote his Church, and to convert
the contrary-minded by such means as force and violence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
on mens persons and estates; As K. <hi>Iames</hi> said in his
speech in <hi>Parliament, 1609. That it is a sure rule in Divinity, that
God never loves to plant his Church with violence and bloud,</hi> and if
ye do persecute to the heighth in the case of Religion, ye will
weaken your selves, and cause the love and good affection of
people to die towards you, and the persecuted will grow, and
their cause be made honourable, and many will be increased
unto it, for it is usual in ages that the way and Religion which
hath been most persecuted hath most grown, and thus it must
infallibly be at this day, and ye can never effect your end
by persecution, nor promote your own Church, nor destroy
all the contrary-minded; As a Privy Counsellor to K. <hi>Iames</hi>
the 5th. of <hi>Scotland,</hi> advised in counsel about the year 1539.
upon the occasion of diversities of opinions then in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
said he, <hi>It is an errour of State in a Prince for an opinion of
piety to condemn to death the adherers to new Doctrines; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and patience of those who voluntarily suffer all temporal miseries
for matters of faith, stir up numbers who at first and before they had
suffered were ignorant of their faith and doctrine, not onely to favour
their cause, but to embrace their opinions, pity and commiseration open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the gates, and thus their faith is spread, and their number daily
increaseth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>7. Consider, If that ye do not allow Liberty of Conscience
but do impose and persecute as aforesaid, though some for
your fear, and terrour, and force against their Consciences
should deny their Principles, and conform to your Church,
such ye cause to sin; for whatsoever is performed by force and
not of faith is sin, as it is written, and such their sin will be
laid to your charge; and such who cannot deny their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and conform, will be destroyed, and their death will
be accounted against you in the day of the Lord; and therefore
if ye do not allow Liberty of Conscience, many grievous evils
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58212:5"/>
will infallibly follow, both to your selves and your people
And what advantage of honour will such be to God and your;
Church, that are against their Consciences and light forced
into a conformity for fear and terrour of men; it makes
them manifold more the Children of the Devil, and time-servers,
and Hypocrites, and destroys their souls, and such
can be no true members of the true Church of Christ, but
are Reprobates, and a dishonour to God and your Church.</p>
            <p>8. Consider, if ye constrain and compel in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and do not allow liberty of Conscience, <hi>it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and unequal, and down-right contrary to the Holy and pure
Law of God,</hi> which saith, <hi>ye shall do unto all men, as ye would
that men should do unto you, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy
self,</hi> and this is the fulfilling of the Law; But to be imposed
upon and persecuted for the cases of Consciences, and for the
matters of Worship of God, your selves would not willing
be against your light and knowledge, and then it is unequal
and unjust, and contrary to the Law of God, for ye to do
the same to others, which your selves would not be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
And do not you to this day cry out against the <hi>Papists</hi> in
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, and at this day in other Nations, and
condemn them as Tyrants and Oppressors, for Persecuting,
Killing, and Destroying the Protestants, for the matters of
their Conscience and difference in Opinion and Judgment?
And will you do the same at this day as they do to others,
and follow their example of cruelty and persecution, and
break the Law of God, and walk contrary to it, in doing to
others what you would not be done unto? And seeing you
condemn the late foregoing Powers in these Kingdoms for
Tyrants and Usurpers, and Oppressors, for prohibiting your
way of worship, and commanding the contrary, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
so much as they could your service Book and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
how can you justly do the like to others, as to force
waies of Religion upon them, and prohibit theirs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the contrary? if you do it, ye condemn your selves by
judging of others in the like case.</p>
            <p>9. Consider, if ye do not allow liberty of Conscience, but
impose Church Government and Religion by paines and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
<hi>then ye will fill the land with Hypocrites,</hi> and force peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into time-serving obedience, and into formal waies of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58212:6"/>
worship, some against their Consciences, and some in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
thereof, which is great abomination unto the Lord,
and such will neither be true and faithful in Church nor
State, but will seek advantages against you (if they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by violence in the cases of their Consciences) and it will
beget great contentions and hatred in the minds of men, and
divide them into heart-burnings one against another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you and your Government; for if men become Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
for your fear and terror, and deny their professed
principles and conform, they will be false-hearted, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
and malicious, and attempt any thing to be freed
from bondage and impositions of Conscience, and their hearts
will be disengaged in love and affection to you-wards; and
this will be infallibly the effect of persecution for Conscience
sake, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. saith in his Meditat. <hi>A charitable
connivance and Christian toleration often issi pates their strength
whom rougher opposition fortifies, and puts the dispised and oppressed
party into such combinations, as may most enable them to get a full
revenge on those they count their persecutors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>10. Consider, if ye force Worship, and Religion, and
cause men to conform against their Judgements, <hi>how dangerous
is this to destroy mens souls,</hi> and to lead them even to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
For seeing ye affirm not the Infalibility of your Worship
and Religion, and yet will impose them, and so engage mens
souls in dependancy for Salvation upon things and waies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and which God gives not the Faith to believe in; I
say how dangerous is this to ruin souls; for in no way can the
soul be secure but in the faith which God works in the heart,
in the Obedience of infallible Truth; So ye run mens souls
upon a Rock, and it is unreasonable as before mentioned,
that men should be forced into the profession and practice of
uncertain and fallible Religion, and that they should be forced
by you into that which may be evil, for which not you altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but themselves must bear the punishment in the day of
the Lord; and except ye could affirm and prove the Infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of your Church (which is impossible) there is no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nor right reason for it, that you should impose upon others
any more then others should impose upon you; for as King
<hi>Charles</hi> the I. said in his Medit. <hi>He desired not any should be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
subject unto him, then he and all of them might be subject unto
God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58212:6"/>
11. Consider, if ye alow not liberty of Conscience, but
persecute about the same, <hi>ye walk in the way and after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of some of the Heathen Rulers, and of the false Christians,</hi>
and shews that ye allow of the cruel persecutions by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ye follow their example, who perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes
unto death such as they call <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and if ye do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
for matters of Conscience, then ye allow the very
deeds of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who persecuted the Christians for their
Religion sake, and ye justifie the <hi>Papists</hi> in persecuting the
<hi>Protestants;</hi> and ye plainly demonstrate unto all the World
by your works and fruits, that ye are of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> if ye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on mens Consciences by force in the matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and persecute good Conscience about the same; for it
was the <hi>Antichrist</hi> and the <hi>Beast,</hi> that first forced all to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and violently engaged all into a conformity, <hi>and killed
and persecuted all that would not worship according to the Image,</hi>
Rev. 13. <hi>as ye may read.</hi> And it was not Christs way, nor the
practice of any his Primitive Churches to impose and force
on the persons and Consciences of men concerning their
Church and Religion, to cause all into a conformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and destroy and persecute all that would not; This
was not the way of Christ and his Apostles in their daies, but
they left Religion free, and said, <hi>they were not lords over mens
faith, nor lords over Gods Heritage,</hi> neither did impose upon any
in doubtful cases of conscience, much lesse compel against
mens Consciences; for the Apostle left the practice of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, <hi>as every one was perswaded in his own mind, to do or
not to do,</hi> without imposing by force or directions of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the same; Therefore if ye do not allow free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience, ye are out of the Doctrine and Example
of Christ and his Apostles, and follows the way and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Antichrist, Heathen Rulers, and cruel <hi>Papists,</hi> to your
great dishonour.</p>
            <p>12. Consider, if ye allow not liberty of Conscience in the
exercise of Religion, but impose and persecute about the
same; <hi>It must inavoidable tend to destroy and expel Trading, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
and Merchandize in these Kingdomes,</hi> for a great part of
Trading and Husbandry, depends upon such kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose principles are for toleration in Religion, and
hates persecution and violence in that case, this ye will find
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58212:7"/>
true on examination; and if liberty of Conscience be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
such will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> exposed to great afflictions, some to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
and some to poverty, and some to fly into other
Countries, to the destruction of their Callings and Trading,
and the hands &amp; industriousnes of such people will be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in these Kingdomes, if they cannot enjoy their just liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in temporal and spiritual cases, and the effects thereof
will work wofully in this very respect, even to disenable both
the hearts and hands of Husbandmen and Trades, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these Nations to want and poverty, and to enrich their
enemies.</p>
            <p>13. Consider, if liberty of Conscience be denied, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
be introduced about the same; <hi>all these and many more
woful Consequencies and effects wil follow infallably to the ruin of these
Kingdoms,</hi> even Wars, and Bloodsheds, and discontents, and
Murmurings, and all evil things will be the product of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
cause, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of denying liberty of Conscience in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
matters, for in a word it will tend to and may effect
the overthrow of you, and ruin your Government and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for the great and mighty God of Heaven and Earth
will be provoked against you, and his wrath will go out like a
devouring flame upon you, if that ye limit the Holy One, and
will not suffer him to exercise his proper right, in being King
in mens Consciences, to exercise them in all the waies of his
Worship, and matters of his Kingdom, but do oppresse, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and persecute about the same; This I say will infallibly
work the Kingdoms ruin, and expose You and your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to the indignation of the Holy Lord God, who is
tender of his Honour, and will not give it to another, and he
loveth and affecteth the cause of such, whose Consciences
are truly tender towards him, and though ye persecute such
and seek to destroy them, and for a time exercise great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and oppressions upon them, for the matters of their
Conscience, yet the God of Heaven will appear for such in
his season, and deliver them, and avenge their persecutors;
And therefore all ye Rulers consider, and lay these things
to heart, least ye provoke the Lord against you, by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People whom he regards, and that not for evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but for the cases of Conscience, and because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
relinquish their profession and principles of their Religion,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58212:7"/>
and bow and conform in things against their light and
knowledge.</p>
            <p>14. Consider, If ye allow not Liberty of Conscience, <hi>what
exceeding danger ye run your selves into,</hi> even to dest roy just men
and righteous, as Heriticks and erroneous, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Hereticks as Church-members, both which are great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
in the sight of God, and this danger ye bring
upon your selves, for ye are not infallible Judges, who are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and who are not; and therefore may easily proceed in
that way to punish such as Hereticks that are not truly so,
and except ye could affirm and prove your possession of the
infallible Spirit, ye can no way proceed justly and reasonably
to deny Liberty of Conscience in the exercise of Religion, nor
punish and persecute any in that case; but if ye do, ye do it in
ignorance, and knows not what ye do, and may as soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
true Christians and Saints, as Hereticks, for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
judgment to discern who are, and who are not; and
this is a danger ye ought to avoid by allowing the free exercise
of Conscience, as the Lord perswades every mans heart.</p>
            <p>15. And lastly also consider what a reproach you are under,
If such whom ye call Hereticks, (and yet doth not infallibly
know that they are such) be punished, and persecuted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
for their Religion sake, who are just and upright men,
in their conversing between man and man, and unreprovable
in their dealings among men; (whether they erre in judgment
in spiritual knowledge, or not erre) and such as are drunkards
and prophane persons go at liberty, in their stage-playing and
gaming, and the like, even tolerated, and unpunished, and
not prohibited, whom all do know &amp; can distinguish who such
are when they appear, this will render your Government to
evil reputation, both in this present time and in ages to come;
and therefore consider it, if Drunkards, Gamesters, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
persons have more toleration and liberty in their
wayes of open vanity, then sober temperate persons in the
exercise of their Consciences in Religion, which if any such
do erre in principle (which is not infallibly known to you) it
is onely to their own hurt in the sight of God, and he onely
and not you ought to punish them in that case; but prophane
persons as afore-mentioned are easily judged by all to be such,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58212:8"/>
and their errour in practise is hurtful to the whole Kingdoms
and pertains to you to punish; as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> now a Bishop in
<hi>Ireland</hi> hath said, his words in this case are worth observing,
<hi>why are we so zealous,</hi> saith he, <hi>against those we call Hereticks,
and yet great friends with Drunkards, and Swearers, and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,
and intemperate and idle persons; I am certain a Drunkard is
as contrary to God, and lives as contrary to the Laws of Christianity as
a Heretick, and I am also sure that I know what Drunkennesse is,
but I am not sure that such an opinion is heresie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And these things I do in all meeknesse and due respect
both to your places and persons, present to your serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
that ye may prevent these evil effects that are so
destructive unto you and these Kingdoms, which absolutely
must follow, upon <hi>not allowing free Liberty of Conscience in the
exercise of Religion;</hi> and if any shall object, That to tolerate
and allow Liberty of Conscience in Religion is inconsistent
with the safety and peace of the King and these Kingdoms;
I shall be desirous to hear from wise men what such objections
are, stated by them, and wherein they say it is not Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
with the happinesse and peace of these Nations, to grant
and allow the premises; And on such occasion, I should
make clearly to appear the contrary, and that it is only
consistant with the peace and prosperity of these Kingdoms
(considering them in their present estate) to grant and allow
free liberty of Conscience as aforesaid, in the exercise of
Religion unto all Christian people.</p>
            <p>O! remember ye mighty men of the Kingdom, that the
Great and Mighty God takes notice of all your doings, and
accordingly will he reward you in his dreadful day, which
is near to come upon all the World; and wo unto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in that day. O! remember that ye your selves not long
since were a suffering people, and now you are raised up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
And therefore be not too zealous to afflict others, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for the cases of their Consciences, in reference to their
faith and perswasions about Religion; but be gentle, meek, and
long-suffering towards all, for that is the way to make peace
and preserve it with all men, that will gain the affections of the
contrary minded; but force and rigour will exasperate the
more, and never truly reconcile differences among men; and
make no Laws contrary or different to the pure Law of God,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58212:8"/>
but let pure Conscience go free without force or restraint in
the exercises of Religion, and let God have his Prerogative,
and Lordship, in the exercise of Conscience; but let your
Authority be extended over the outward man, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
between man and man, to preserve peace and right in
all outward relation; and be Wise and Learned ye Rulers of
the Earth, and kisse the Son least he be angry and ye perish,
and if his wrath be kindled but a little, blessed are they that
trust in him. This is your time and day, happy are ye, if it
be given to you to do the work that God requires of you
only.</p>
