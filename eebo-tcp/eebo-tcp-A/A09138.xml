         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were two Beggers (I meane not

almes of exorable people, the one
being youthfull and blind, the other very
aged and lame, (and ſuch perſons are ſeldome admitted into
the great chamber much leſſe into the Kings preſence.) This
blindman alwaies when he went abroad, carried the cripple
on his ſhoulders to direct him, ſo likewiſe the cripple oppreſt
with his infirmities, could not trauell without ſupportance.
Now it was the lame mans lucke one day about one of the
clock after dinner, being borne by his blind fellow through
Fléetſtréete, to caſt his eye on a great Oyſter, which lay on
the ground néere the Miter doore. where ſome Oyſter ſeller
ſitting (as their cuſtome is) belike had let it fall from her
baſket: and therupon he directed his fellow porter to ſtoope
and take it vp, which done they fell into controuerſie about
it, the one ſaying he deſerued it beſt, becauſe hee ſaw it and
<pb facs="tcp:6795:3"/>
guided the others hand to it; the other anſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had moſt
right to it, becauſe he brought him thither &amp; tooke the paines
to take it vp: and while they were thus wrangling, a poore
Lawyer comming out of Ram alley with his ſeacole beard
embrodered with greaſe like the ſnowt of a Maſtiue, new
lifted out of the porredge pot, and vnderſtanding the cauſe
of their falling out; my honeſt friends (quoth my Lawyer)
pray let me ſée your Oyſter, and you ſhall ſée me quickly end
this variance, the blind man deliuered the ſhelfiſh vnto the
Lawyer, who hauing fingred it, forthwith drew forth his
ruſty whittle, laid the Seabred animal vpon his knée, and
diuiding his houſe into two parts, gaue the one to the blind,
the other to the lame, and deuoured the inhabitant himſelfe:
the old cripple ſéeing that, cried out, now the Deuill goe with
it, and the Lawyer remoued himſelfe into the Tauerne from
his eye and clamors. Wherupon the blind lame bearer being
aduertiſed of the ieſt, wiſht it might poyſon or choake him.

ſitting alone in a rugge gowne, wrapping in his armes, to

haue put him by the right of his land, went to a Lawyer

and ſo ſent it ſow'd faſt in an old Napkin full of holes to the

and gaue his man this leſſon alſo, that hee ſhould giue the

The Carrier holding it a preſumptuous part to rip open the

affection, (as hee ſéemed to make ſhew of) told him, that it
grieued him to ſée ſo propper a man ſpend his time ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a companion fit for his perſon, meaning a wife: which,
if an Owle would not ſerue his turne, it had béene pitty any
better creature ſhould haue béene beſtowed vpon him. Yet
forſooth, in great ſecret he told him, and looked about, as
though ſome body had heard him that if he would bee ruled
by him, he would helpe him to ſuch a wife, as all the world
ſhould not find a better for his purpoſe. For ſhe ſhould bee
faire, and welthy, and wiſe, and what more, I know not: but
ſhe ſhould be ſuch a one, as he ſhould haue cauſe to giue him
thankes for. The young gréene Gooſe ſome what ſhamefaſt,
and yet fooliſh enough to harken to an idle tale, anſwered
him, that though he was not determined to marry, yet if hee
liked her, and ſhe him, he did not know what would come to
paſſe: but hee would beſtow a quart of Wine to haue a
ſight of her. Not to make a long tale of a little or nothing,
without many hummes or haes it was agréed betwixt them
that a day ſhould be ſet downe when the méeting ſhould bee.
The place was appointed, the parties were acquainted, the
plot was laid, and the matter performed. But while the gooſe
was gaping for one bait, he was catcht with another. For
<pb facs="tcp:6795:10"/>
the cunning raſcall, intending to make himſelfe merry with
his money, told him he muſt be finely apparrelled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
a Supper or two, in ſhew of a braue mind: but when
he had her once, then let him doe as he liſt. The foole alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in a net, began to tangle himſelfe brauely, made himſelfe
new apparell according to the faſhion, gaue money to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
vpon a Supper or two: where met him a fine boy dreſt
woman like, to whom he made ſuch loue, that a dog would
not abide to heare it. The counterfeit young Miſtris, with
kind words, and knauiſh wiles, finding the length of his foot,
gat many tokens of his loue; as Gloues, Skarfes, and ſuch
like, beſides a Ring or two, and a bracelet: all which he did
beſtow, ſolouingly that he muſt néedes be vſed like himſelfe,
and ſo he was: for nothing was refuſed that came ſo gently
to paſſe. But after many kind méetings, in the end it was
agréed betwixt them, that in a friends houſe of his, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhould be made vp: which being little better then a baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
houſe, it ſerued the turne as well as could be. There they
met, and being both agréed, vpon aſſurance of each other loue
to bed they ſhould goe that night, and bee married ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
well, that night there lacked no good chéere, nor Wine
to make the heart merry: which being taken in full cups,
wrought the matter as they would haue it: for after they
had well ſupped, and ſate a while by a good fire, the good Aſſe
fell a ſléepe: in which being laid in his bed, in ſtead of the faire
boy, they had laid a blacke Moore wench by him, with whom
I know not how he handled the matter: but in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſéeing what a ſwéet bed-fellow he had gotten, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtarting out of the bed, ran to his clothes, and taking them
in his hand, ran out into another chamber, crying that hee
was vndone, for he had laine with the vglieſt thing that euer
was, and he feared it was the deuill. In which feare bleſſing
himſelfe, as from ſprites, running out of the houſe, with the
expence of his money, almoſt loſſe of his wittes and laught
at of all that knew him, like a good woodcocke, fled away ſo

before me, which my Grayhound would quickly catch. It
fortuned that my dog died, and for very loue that I bare to
him, I made me a bottle of his ſkin, to carry drinke withal.
So, one time in hay herueſt, my folke being making of hay
in my grounds, and the weather hote, I filled my bottle with
béere, to carry to them, leaſt they ſhould lacke drinke. And
as I was going along, there ſtart a Hare out of a buſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

My bottle leaping from my girdle, ran and catcht the Hare.

And ſo leading downe againe the good Aſſe, ſhee neuer ſent
more for him. A friend of his, méeting of him comming forth,
hoping of his good hap, knowing his being aboue with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
aſked him how he had ſped. Whoſe anſwere was, Oh,
I wiſht I had had her in the wood, and then I would haue
told her my minde. Now what a notable Gull was this,
I leaue to all good humored wenches to conſider.</p>

               <p>THis tale was no ſooner ended, but another wench began
to quite her in this ſort: Nay, then I will tell thée of as
good an Aſſe, as that was for his life. In our Towne not
long agoe, one of the chiefe of our pariſh, who was twice
Churchwarden, and in election to be Bailife, a good fat groſſe
churle, hauing a good houſe of his owne, and well to take to,
married a widdow, that dwelled three miles off: who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
good cattell, and corne, and ſome houſhold of her owne,
by the motion of good friends, made a match together. But
this churle, being troubled with ſome ſixtéene diſeaſes, lay
<pb facs="tcp:6795:25"/>
himſelfe in one bed, and his wife in an other by him: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a kinde of more then good liking to a yong man in the
houſe, ſome kinſman of his, with ſhéepes-eyes, and ſmiles,
and ſuch odde kinde of wicked kindnes, ſhe made him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
her minde: and béeing agréed one night to come into
her chamber, when he was a ſléepe, ſhe told him for feare of
the worſt, that he ſhould take a paire of her gloues, and flap
them too and fro in his hand, which would make a noiſe like
vnto a great Spaniell, that vſed often to ſhake his eares:
which leſſon he forgot not. Night was come, the candles out,
they in bed, and he came créeping like a dogge. But the doore
creaking, the old man halfe awake, or not faſt aſléepe, aſked
who was there? when the fellow ſhaking of his gloues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made him thinke it was the dogge: when ſaying, Oh,
Troll, he lay ſtill as though he ſlept. But the fellow miſſing
his way in the darke, running his head againſt his maſters
bed-poſt, vpon a ſudden the old man ſtart vp his head, with,
How now? who is there? The poore man amazed, forgetting
to flappe his gloue, anſwered, Forſooth, it is the dog. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
his miſtris laughing, bad hang him vp. Whereat the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
as it were following in, and ſeeking to driue him forth,
cryed, come out. But in the morning, as I heard, the Gull
was put in a coope, where I heard no more of him.</p>
