         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

been unanimous, though you be a great body,

and many of you a knowing people, having
enjoyed the means in one part of the Parish
for almost fifty years together, and that by a
succession of very eminent and able Divines,

the Canon of the Scripture (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

which otherwise had fallen upon them. I have
found you also a very tractable people; few
families but have submitted to examination
before the Sacrament, and have freely sent in
some hundreds of your children and servants
to that end. You have begun well; perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
that no man get your Crown from you.
I have now served you above three Prentiships;
and as <hi>Iacob</hi> said of himself, <hi>Few and evil</hi> had

of trials, internal and external. So soon as I

delivered me out of all, and hath made my

            <p>1 Get your judgements rightly informed:
the Understanding is the eye and Guide of the
soul; if that be corrupt, and mislead you, you
must needs fall into the ditch: if a disease get
the brain, 'tis hardly cured; hence the learned
observe, that corruption in judgement is worse
then corruption in manners, especially when
the mind has been enlightned with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth. Leprosie in the head, was
of all other Leprosies the most dangerous and
destructive, and he was to be pronounced ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unclean: he was unclean if he had the
Leprosie in his hands or feet; but if 'twere in
his head, then he was utterly unclean.</p>
            <p>2 Be Real Christians; think it not sufficient
that you are Christians in Name, and have a
form of godliness, but be Christians indeed, and
walk in the power of godliness; be <hi>Nathanaels,</hi>

            <p>Out of all that hath been said, it is evident how needfull it is

Neither go we about to stir up the Magistrate against these men,

those means onely ought to be used, which may conduce to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

tell you, that I never yet knew the man that had but one error: if
the Devil can but draw you into one, he'll quickly lead you into
more; as in Logick, grant but one absurdity, and an hundred will
follow. He that saith Yea to the Devil in a little, shall not say <hi>Nay</hi>

censoriousness, ignorance and untruth that I met with from you:
For though you want the <hi>Latin,</hi> yet some of you want not a <hi>Lying-</hi>

            <p>My Record is on high, that I have not done any thing out of

may and must use their gifts in their private Families, and for the good

This likewise is commanded, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. They must exhort, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and comfort one another, <hi>Heb. 3. 13. 2 Thes. 3. 14, 15. Mal.

that falls through infirmity, <hi>Gal. 6. 2. Iob</hi> 2. 11. and instruct others,

commanded to private persons, but Preaching is forbidden them.</p>
            <p>2 There's a great difference between private Exhortation and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though materially they may be the same. <hi>e. g.</hi> The Pastor rebuketh
Drunkennesse as an Officer and publike Watch-man, <hi>ex officio specialis

Christian rebuketh Drunkennesse <hi>ex communi officit charitatis,</hi>
privately and occasionally, without any Pastoral charge; not authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
as one in Office. Thus the Watch-man giveth warning, the
Common souldier doth the same; the School-master teacheth one lesson,
the School fellow teacheth the same: the one, by vertue of his Office;
the other, of common Charity. But the Pastor doth rebuke sinne,

privately, but publikely, by a Pastoral obligation. Thus we see both use

               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that your Argument is not <hi>ad idem:</hi> because the sons of the
Prophets, and such as are trained up for the Ministery, do preach, <hi>ergo,</hi>
every gifted brother may preach; it will not follow.</p>
               <p>For, 1. These young men and sons of the Prophets are educated, fitted,
and set apart for the Ministery, and so are in the way to the Ministery,
and not altogether out of Office; but may be said to be Ministers <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
inchoativè &amp; dispositivè, licèt non actualiter &amp; realiter;</hi> as the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
is said to be a tree <hi>potentia, licèt non actu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is not thus with Artificers, Naylors, Taylors, &amp;c. they never
were educated, fitted, or set apart for the Ministery, as these are; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may not doe what these may doc.</p>
               <p>2 Their Preaching is for Preparation and Trial, <hi>per modum probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
as Probationers and Expectants; and that before Pastors and Elders,<note place="margin">Vide Rutherf.</note>
who can judge of their gifts, and must try before they trust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laying hands
upon no man suddenly,<note place="margin">Dae <hi>Right of Presbyt.</hi> p. 281. and 305.</note> but as the Apostle commands, <hi>I Tim.</hi> 3. 10. Let
them first be <hi>proved,</hi> and then Minister: though we cannot expect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet there must be some fit proportion for so great work, which
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a natural dexterity for Teaching. How can these be seen and known,
but by Preaching?</p>
               <p>But the Preaching of Artificers, &amp;c. is not for Trial; for then they
should goe preach before Ministers who can judge of their abilities; but
as Gifted Brethren they preach without a Call to giftlesse persons.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed how far private persons may goe, and have not
willingly or wittingly concealed one tittle of their right: it will be their
wisdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so to use private duties, as that the publike be not hindered or
neglected, and the Ministery in no wise sleighted, as the Apostle excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
commands both, I <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. They must edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and prize their Ministers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third terme to be explained, is, <hi>Preaching.</hi> And here
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49629:16"/>
we must distinguish, before we can define. Preaching may be taken,<note place="margin">Prius distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guendum, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam definien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum: Qui bene distinguir, bene docet.</note> 1. Largely, for any declaration of Gods Wisdome, Power, Goodnesse;
and thus every creature may be called a Preacher: thus the Heavens
Preach. <hi>Psa 19. 1. Coeli praedicant gloriam Dei.</hi> Thus reading the Word
may be called Preaching. But the question is not (as a<note n="f" place="margin">

may not be called preaching (taking preaching for any declaration of Gods

meaneth, who is able to read? When he saith, <hi>Give thy selfe to study, that
thy profiting may appear to all men,</hi> he meaneth that all men may see thou
readest better then thou didst. Thus hee.</p>
               <p>But take it strictly and properly, and then Preaching is thus defined.
'Tis an action of a Minister, soundly interpreting and opening the sence of
Scripture by Scripture, in an authoritative way, applying it to the use of
the hearers, by doctrine, Exhortation, Rebuke and Comfort. This is
the duty and formal act of the Ministery; 'tis a Pastoral act, and is not
common to every gifted Brother of the flock.</p>

hath appointed.</p>
               <p>2 There is <hi>Ecclesia constituenda,</hi> a Church to be planted, settled,
constituted; as amongst Heathens, Turkes, Infidells: and here, where no
Ordination can be had, gifted persons (in such extraordinary cases) may
preach: That may be done in the infancy of a Church, which may not
be suffered when the Church is growne to maturity: That may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

Church is Planted, and the Rule set. A positive Law may yeeld in a case

                  </gap> Some were called Extraordinarily and Immediately by God himself;
as the Prophets, Apostles, and Evangelists: <hi>Elisha</hi> is called from the
Plough, <hi>Amos</hi> from the Stals, the Apostles from their Nets. And of these
under the New-Testament, there are three sorts.</p>
               <p>I. Apostles: These were called by Christ immediately and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Leigh</hi> on <hi>Rom</hi> 12. 6,</note>
and they shewed it by their extraordinary gifts and abilities with
which Christ endowed them. They were universal Ministers, appointed
by Christ to preach the Word thorow the world: they were twelve espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially:
their Office was Temporary, being ordained for the propagation
of the Gospel. These are now ceased.</p>
               <p>II. Prophets: These had a gift of fore-telling things to come; as <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> fore-tels a famine, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 28. and the four daughters of <hi>Philip,</hi>
Act 21. 9.</p>
               <p>2 In those times they had a singular gift and faculty in expounding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
interpreting prophetical Scripture, in opening hard places, and fitly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their hearers for their edification.</p>
               <p>3 They were endowed with Languages, because the Church was to be
gathered out of all Nations. These were temporary and to indure only
for that time.</p>
               <p>III. Evangelists, who were Coadjutors and Helpers of the Apostles
in preaching the Gospel, and for the most part did attend on them, and
watered what they had planted; they were of two sorts. 1. Some were
called immediately, as <hi>Philip,</hi> who was called by the instinct of the
Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 39, 40. 2 Others were called by the Apostles; as <hi>Timothy,
Titus, Marke, Tychicus, Sylvanus.</hi> These latter were most frequent, yet
were but Temporary.</p>
               <p>Those Ministers which are ordinary and perpetual, are of two sorts;
Pastors and Teachers. 1. Pastors, to see to the manners of the Flock, to
preach the Gospel, deliver the Sacraments, direct them in their practice.
See their duty, <hi>Act. 20. 1 Tim. 3. 2 Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. 2. Teachers and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49629:17"/>
Doctors, whose Office is plainly and soundly to expound the Scriptures,
that the people might have the right sence and understanding of them:
and being indued with Tongues, Arts, and Sciences, they are to clear the
Truth from corruptions of Heretickes. That these are two distinct
Officers, is cleare from <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The summe of them all is thus much: That a man out of Office,
though endowed with Gifts, yet cannot authoritatively expound the
Scripture, and apply it to the people, in a setled, constituted Church,
without an external Cal of the Church, authorizing and enabling him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

beare so great an evil, (as this rent, division, and separation was) cleaves
a sunder, (one division punished with another) and swallowes up some
of the authours of it; fire from Heaven consuming the residue. Never
such a Judgement doe we read of in all the Scriptures executed upon
any sinne, as this. 'Tis the observation of a Pious and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of our age, in an excellent Tract against Separation, That private
persons may become accessary not only by yeelding Maintenance or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
but even by affording their presence, in an ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
way, at such meetings, where by the open profession and practise
of Separation, there is a flag of defiance held forth to the rest of the
Churches.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Answer which the Gifted Brethren (as they call
themselves) gave to this Argument.</p>
               <p>First, I called for the Naylor, a publike preacher, with whom I had an
open Challenge before a ful Congregation, to dispute and defend what I
had delivered against private Persons publike Preaching. I mention this
the rather, that the world way see I take no pleasure in disputes of this
Nature; but was constrained to defend the truth I taught.) But not a
word of answer could I get from the Naylor, with all my Hammering;

               </p>
               <p>I Replyed, that Logick was nothing but Reason brought into Method
and Form, and therefore he could not with Reason deny it.</p>

having finish'd his own Arguments, he never staid to heare mine, but left
his followers (of which we had more then a good many) to shift for

               <p>
                  <hi>Goliah</hi> being non-plust, vanquisht and fled, I set upon the multitude,
and with this following Argument Routed them all.</p>

            <div type="argument">
               <head>The third Argument.</head>
               <p>If all that have gifts may preach, then all that have gifts may
Baptize.</p>
               <p>But all that have gifts (say you) may Preach:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> All that have gifts may Baptize.</p>
               <p>Here the gifted Brethren (for I know not what else to call them:

the sequel of the major: For though private persons might preach
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49629:21"/>
as gifted men, yet none might Baptize but Officers. And herein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> and the Independents, who confesse, that none may
Baptize but men in Office.</p>
               <p>To this I replyed thus,</p>
               <p>What Christ hath joyned together none may separate.</p>
               <p>But Christ hath joyned Preaching and Baptizing:<note place="margin">Divino praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pto intonante, obediendum est non dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum. <hi>Aug. Cottons</hi> Keyes, p. 20. c. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore none may separate them.</p>
               <p>He that hath the power of Preaching, to him Christ hath given the
power of Baptizing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But where <hi>say they,</hi> do you prove this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I answer, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Go, Preach and Baptize,</hi> where, that
Christ speakes not onely to the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And his way of the Churches in</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, c. 4. f. 2. p. 67.</note> but also to all ordinary Pastors,
their successors, is clear, <hi>verse 30. Lo, I am with you, &amp;c.</hi> He speaks it
to such Officers as were to remaine in the Church to the end of the
world.</p>
               <p>Here I called againe for an answer; but the gifted Brethren wanted the
gift: They were like men in a Net; they could neither go forward nor
backward, but like <hi>Cuckowes</hi> they still sung one and the same song, <hi>viz.
Though they might Preach as gifted Brethren, yet none but men in Office
might Baptize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Replyed, If they had power to do the one, they had power to do the
other; which I proved thus.</p>
               <p>Those that have power to do the greater work, have power to do the
lesse. Preaching is the great work, and Baptizing the lesse. Here the Apostle
prefers Preaching before Baptism,<note place="margin">It is a harder work to Preach, then to Baptize Infants.</note> 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Christ sent me not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
but to preach the Gospell,</hi> (i. e.) comparatively; not so much to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, as to Preach.</p>
               <p>Now if none may Baptize without a Cal, then, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it concludes
more strongly that none may Preach without a Cal: If I may not do the
lesse without a Cal, surely I may not do the greater uncalled.</p>
               <p>2 See whas<note n="w" place="margin">Vide p. 17.</note> absurdities follow this absurd Tenent: For, if men may
Preach without a Call, then they may Baptize without a Call; and if
they may Baptize, they may deliver the Lords Supper, and Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then gifted Boyes, and gifted Women, and gifted Midwives, may
Preach and Baptize; and if all gifted persons be sent, it will necessarily
follow.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to those Arguments which I could not prosecute in

               </head>
               <p>If no Priest or Prophet might offer Sacrifice under the Law without a

               <p>But no man might offer Sacrifice under the Law without a Call:
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That no man might offer Sacrifice under the Law but a Priest, and one
in Office,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Willet</hi> in Levit. 8. Doct. 3. p. 142. Lev. 8. 31, 33. V. <hi>Prid.</hi> Orat. 8. totaliter. Synopsis Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oris Theo. p. 563.</note> is cleare, <hi>Exod. 28 1. Numb.</hi> 18. 22, 23. the <hi>Levites,</hi> not

as ever: and though he punish not with such visible external judgements

judgements, which are sorer; as Pride, Self-confidence, Apostacie, strong
delusions, the stone in the heart, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Preaching is as great a work, if not a greater, then Sacrificing;

1. In respect of Gods glory; 2. The honour of the Ministery:
3. for the peace and comfort of the conscience of the Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
4. That the people may know they have lawful Ministers, and
so may obey their Ministery, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4 God wil have all things done according to that Rule and Order
which himselfe hath prescribed. Now Gods Method and Order is this:
1. To call and separate men for the Ministery. 2. And then Preach.
The principal Call is from God; the manifestation and declaration of it
is from the Church: and such are said to be made by the Holy Ghost,
though men ordaine them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and if upon trial they approve
of thee, and bid thee <hi>Go,</hi> tis as effectual a Call, as if God from heaven
should call thee.<note place="margin">Bell Serm. Isa. 54.</note> As one of your owne sayes of the Ministery, He that
pretends to be taught without the Word, is not taught of God, but of
the Devil: So he that pretends he is called of God, without and against

what need we any of them? <hi>Austin</hi> writing upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> tels a story
of a certaine man that was of an opinion, that the Devil did make the
Fly, and not God; saith one to him, If the Devil made Flyes, then the
Devil made Worms, and God did not make them; for they are living
creatures as wel as Worms. True, said he, the Devil did make Worms.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49629:23"/>
But, said the other, If the Devil did make Worms, then he made Birds,
Beasts, Man. He granted all. Thus, saith <hi>Austin,</hi> by denying God in the
Fly, he came to deny God in Man, and to deny the whole Creation.</p>
               <p>2 Then every Gifted Boy, and every Gifted Woman, should be
Preachers.</p>
               <p>3 Then all that have Gifts to Baptize, and deliver the Lords Supper,
may Baptize and deliver the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>4 This would open a flood-gate to all Errors, Heresies, and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:

                     </gap>ard to be understood,
which many wrest</hi> (for want of judgement) <hi>to their owne destruction.</hi>
We have had woful experience of this, since Artificers, Souldiers, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
&amp;c. have turned Preachers. I never heard but one of this New
Tribe of <hi>Gad,</hi> and that was a Souldier, Lieutenant <hi>Phelps</hi> (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

man that had but one Error.) His Sermon was as ful of errors, as a Dogge
is ful of Fleas: Universal Redemption, Free-wil, Dipping, against
Baptizing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5 Then all vain-glorious Hypocrites (who think they have gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all others) would turne Preachers: the emptiest barrels make the
lowdest sound, the worst metal the greatest noise, and the lightest ears of
Corn hold their heads highest.</p>
               <p>6 Then the Church, which is Christs mystical Body, would be mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous,
all Eye, all Ear, all Head: contrary to that of the Apostle, who
tels us the Church is not <hi>one</hi> member but <hi>many, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 14. 15. &amp;c.
And <hi>v. 28, 29. Christ hath set some</hi> (not all) <hi>in the Church Apostles.</hi> And
then asketh the Question, <hi>Are all Apostles? Are all Prephets?</hi> &amp;c. The
Interrogation is a strong Negation.</p>
               <p>7 If this be tolerated, it wil make both Ministers and Ministery

separated.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a man may change his Calling?</p>
               <p>A. He may not lightly, or for any base end of his owne, change it: but if
he can finde a clear and just Call, he may.</p>
               <p>Q. But when hath a man a Call?</p>
               <p>A. 1. When he is called from one Calling to another immediately
by God, as <hi>Elisha</hi> from the Plow, <hi>Amos</hi> from the Herds, to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
&amp;c. or immediately by the Church of God, when upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Gifts they are called (they must not be their own Judges,
and call themselves) by those whom Christ hath authorized, to some
higher place in Church or Common-wealth. Thus he that used the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Deacon wel, was promoted to the Ministery, <hi>1 Tim.</hi> 3. 13. A
diligent man (as one wel observes) stayes not long in a low place. Thus
a private man may come to be a Magistrate; a Phisitian, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 When the Calling that a man hath wil not maintaine his family,
then the Artificer may either change his Calling, as the Artificer may
become an Husband-man, &amp;c. or adde another calling to his owne, to
support his family. 2. That he may not be burthensome to others. Thus
<hi>Paul</hi> preacht and made Tents, that he might not be burthensome to the
Church of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If</hi> Paul <hi>kept a double Calling</hi> (say they) <hi>why may not we Nayl

that they read (for, <hi>Rom: 15. 4. whatsoever is written, for our learning it
is written;</hi>) yet may he not take upon him to interpret Scripture, or to
teach any thing out of them to his Family, but what he hath learned from
the publick Ministery. Say a man have been trained up in Schools of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and have never so great gifts and fitness to exercise a publick Office
of the Church, yet may he not take upon him to minister, till he first be
proved, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. 10. much lesse may a privat Christian take upon him to
Analyse or interpret (which is the most difficult thing, and requireth most

must serve in that charge but who is there set by God, either immediatly
or mediatly, &amp;c. he shews that Lay-men may teach and instruct their
Families at home, in the fundamental grounds of Pietie and Religion, such
as they understand: God forbid I should open my mouth against it;

charge, the Pulpit, that is the Chayr of <hi>Moses,</hi> let <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> take
heed how they approach unto it, there to offer up the strange fire of their
preposterous zeal, lest fire come down from heaven and so devour them,
&amp;c. God is my witnesse, I speak not this out of any Spirit of Pride or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Gifts or Persons of others, be they never so mean, much lesse
out of any Spirit of Envie at their parts, be they never so great.</p>
                     <p>I can say (I trust) with <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the Spirit of <hi>Moses,</hi> that is, in
the Spirit of meeknesse <hi>Would God that all the Lords People were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them.</hi> But wee must
give God leave to bee the orderer of his own Ordinances, who being
the God of Order, will doubtlesse revenge the breach of Order; and wee
must take leave to call upon men to keep their Callings, not to touch
the Mount lest they die; <hi>Quam quisque norit artem;</hi> in the fear of
God let every man hold him to his Trade. <hi>Ne sutor ultra crepidam:</hi>
Let not the Taylor, instead of a Garment, cut out a Text, and it may bee
with some stoln shreds patch up a Sermon; let him not mistake the Lords
Board for a Shop-board. No, let not every man as hee list venter to be a
Watchman, or meddle with the Watchmans charge. Surely, if this bee
suffered wee shall all suffer; God will never take it at our hands. Hee
quarrelled once, that the meanest or lowest of the People were made
Priests by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> though the truth is, that service was only for
Calves, at the best but golden Calves. What is it then for the meanest
of the People to make themselves ministers of God? nay, not themselves

                     <p>My Lord, I have fully declared my judgement against
it, in my Treatise called the <hi>Keys of the Kingdome,</hi> p. 20. where I
speak thus: Though all might Prophesie (in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
as having extraordinary gifts for it) yet the like liberty is not allowed
to them that want the like gifts. In the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> none besides
the Priests and Levites did ordinarily Prophesie, either in the Temple or
in the Synagogues, unlesse they were either furnished with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gifts of Prophesie, (as the Prophets of <hi>Israel</hi> were) or were set apart
and trained up to prepare for such a Calling. When <hi>Amos</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the high-Priest of <hi>Bethel</hi> to Prophesie at <hi>Bethel, Amos</hi>
doth not alledge nor plead the liberty of an <hi>Israelite</hi> to Prophesie in
the holy assemblies, but alledgeth only his extraordinary Calling, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>

Person that hath Gifts, may use them in the teaching of his Family the
way of the Lord, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) because he is commanded so to doe;
but he hath no command for Preaching. This is all that can be gathered
out of this place, as appears by our large Annotations on the place. That
which is here said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> should bee done by every father of
a Family, who is so Religiously to order his houshould, as to make it like

not be any advantage to you; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was one of the Patriarchs,
and so was called by God immediately; for the Patriarchs were the
Prophets and Teachers of their age, and the Lord for that end prolonged
their lives, that they might be lights of the World. Besides, <hi>Abraham</hi>
is expresly called a Prophet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7. Which title is never given to a

meer privat man, in all the Scripture, but only to one in Office.</p>
               <p>Now let's see how this hangs together: Because <hi>Abraham</hi> (who was a
man that had singular familiarity with God, was a Patriarch, a Prophet,
and one immediatly called by God) did teach: Therefore, every Naylor,
Taylor, Artificer, &amp;c. that is neither Patriarch, Prophet, nor hath any Call

then it will not any way help you, who are to walk in an ordinary way; but
that their prophesying (what ever it were) was extraordinary, is confest on
all sides; even Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> grants it; and M. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> acknowledgeth
it to have been a temporary Gift and Miracle, for confirmation of their
Office, and continued but for that day, as <hi>Sauls</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 10. 6, 11.
So then they Prophesied by an extraordinary instinct and impulsion of the
Spirit, who both Gifted them and Called them.</p>
               <p>Now let our gifted-Artificers shew us how they are endowed (as these
were) with an extraordinary Spirit of Prophesie, and wee shall bee so far

               <p>Acts 13. 14 15. Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>coming into the Synagogue,
the Rulers sent to them (not as Apostles, which they acknowledged
not, but onely as men having gifts) that if they had any word of
exhortation, they should say on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were men in Office true and faithful Prophets
and Apostles, and so had Commission to teach the Nations wheresoever
they went. 'Tis a <hi>non-sequitur,</hi> Because men in Office were desired by
the Rulers to exhort, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Men out of Office may do so.</p>
               <p>2. They were known to be Teachers in Office, and (in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity)
were so reputed by the Rulers of the Synagogue: having heard the
fame of their Preaching and Miracles, which might easily come from
<hi>Cyprus</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> they desire a word of exhortation from them, <hi>v.
14. Act.</hi> 14. 1. They were known Prophets.</p>
               <p>3. This was practised in corrupt times, and times of great confusion.
So the learned <hi>Apollonious</hi> acknowledgeth, that in corrupt times especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
it was permitted to some out of Order, to teach and exhort; but
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49629:44"/>
they were alwayes such as had testimony of their gifts, and of whom
there was a general opinion of their mission, extraordinary or ordinary,
by reason of the Doctrine they preached, and the works they did.
Thus at <hi>Nazareth</hi> Christ was permitted in the Synagogue to read and
explain the writings of the Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16. as one who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Majesty and miracles did everywhere obtain audience, as
reverend <hi>Beza</hi> here noteth; by which right he taught both in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and everywhere; wherefore also the ordinary Doctors demanded
of him by what Authority he did is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23. So we find that
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were allowed, (<hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15.) publikely to speak
and exhort in the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as being such whose fame was
already known to those of <hi>Antioch;</hi> for they had before this time for a
whole year preached the Word of God to many there, and brought
many to the Faith of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But observe his conclusion: But in the practice of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
none but Prophets by Gifts and Office, either ordinary or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
were permitted publikely in the Assembly of Beleevers to preach
the Word of God in Christs Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>What have we to do with Jewish corrupt Customes? We are to wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by Rule, and not by such new Lights. The liberty given in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
can be no president to us, no more then the custome of persecuting
the godly, and casting them out of their Synagogues.</p>
               <p>Let's sum up all. 1. Because <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were men
in Office, preached; <hi>Ergo,</hi> such as are not in Office, may preach.
2. Because such as were known to be Teachers, and were famous,
preached; <hi>Ergo,</hi> such as are unknown Teachers, and infamous, may
preach. 3. Because the Jews had a custome, in corrupt times to call
forth gifted men to speak in their Synagogues; <hi>Ergo,</hi> we must leave the
Word, and follow their superstitious customes. This is sure some
Shooe-makers Logick: it's set upon the Last, and stretcheth well.</p>

more then ordinary; few in all the Scripture so highly commended for

               <p>
                  <hi>Mighty in the Scriptures (i. e.)</hi> well instructed and grounded in

expound, and perswade them to men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Instructed in the way of the Lord;</hi> He had learned the coming of
Christ into the world, and his Doctrine, when <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist had
taught obscurely and imperfectly of it; but had not participated of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49629:45"/>
clear and large Declaration which Christ and his Apostles had made
of it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Fervent in spirit.</hi> He was no cold, dead Teacher; but he taught
powerfully, livelily, experimentally.</p>
               <p>5. He taught diligently: he was no idle, Strawberry-Preacher.</p>
               <p>6. He doth not preach his own fancies, but the things of the Lord,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Baptism of <hi>Iohn, (i. e.)</hi> the Doctrine which <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist
had delivered concerning Christ, and had sealed to his Disciples by
Baptism.</p>
               <p>7. He teacheth boldly in the Synagogues, not fearing the face of
man.</p>
               <p>8. Observe his rare Humility: he doth not disdain (though he were
a man of singular abilities) to be taught what he knew not of mean
persons; an humble man can learn of the meanest; a little child shall
lead him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6. to see a Master in <hi>Israel</hi> sit by an <hi>Aquila,</hi> a Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
and a <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife, and to be instructed by them, to learn
of his Auditors, was no less an act of meekness then of wonder; but a
wise man looks more at the Counsel then the Counsellor; he regards
not so much who, as what the instruction is; an <hi>Abraham</hi> can hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the Counsel of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> of his servants.</p>
               <p>9. He hath the approbation of the Church of God for his abilities,
<hi>ver.</hi> 27. The Brethren of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> write Letters
commendatories in his behalf to the Disciples at <hi>Corinth</hi> to receive
him.</p>
               <p>10. His Teaching was operative and fruitful; he did not labour in
vain: For, 1. he furthered the faith of Beleevers and helped them much.
2. He was able to convince gain-sayers, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. he convinced, he
mightily convinced the Jews, and that not privately, for fear of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
but he undertakes them publikely; and this he doth not by weak
humane inventions, but by the Scriptures, (out of <hi>Isaiah, Daniel,</hi>
the <hi>Psalms, Moses</hi> and the Prophets) he doth Theologically demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and infallibly conclude, that this Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> was
the true Messias promised to the Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have seen this good man in his colours; how like our gifted

               <p>The second Quaere will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>When he preached?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas in a time when Churches were planting, in the Primitive
times, when God gave extraordinary gifts, and poured out the Spirit of
Prophecie in abundance, for the gathering and perfecting of his
Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49629:45"/>2. 'Twas in a time when that corrupt custom was in practice among
the Jews, of giving liberty to some (though not in Office) to preach.</p>
               <p>3. I answer by way of concession: Should we grant that <hi>Apollos</hi>
was not a man in Office, yet 'twill not help you: for this is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
(as a judicious Divine well observes) of the liberty given by the
Jews, or taken, when as yet there was no Church in being. Take in all
the commendations of the man, and, in a like juncture of time, others
of like abilities may do the like.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Parallel, that our Brethren may see how like,
or rather how unlike they are to their Pattern, and, as they conceive,
their Patron.

               <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1, 31. where the Apostle exhorts them to desire spiritual
gifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather that they might prophesie; and tels them, <hi>vers.</hi> 31. they
may all Prophesie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence our Brethren conclude, that all that have
Gifts may Prophesie in publike.</p>
               <p>Our gifted Brethren build very much upon this Text; and being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued,
they run hither for shelter; but in vain, being meerly deluded
with the word <hi>All,</hi> as if the <hi>Apostle</hi> had commanded all the Godly
promiscuously to preach, when he speaks onely to Prophets, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
clearly shews.</p>
               <p>The Question then will be, who are meant by this word, <hi>All</hi> v. 31.
<hi>Ye may all Prophesie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. I answer Negatively, It cannot be meant of all the Saints col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively;
for then women, who have gifts, should preach, who yet are
forbidden. Secondly, private Professors are nowhere commanded to
leave their Callings, and go study Arts and Sciences, that so they may be
Preachers; but are commanded to abide in their Callings 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 20.
Thirdly, then all should Baptize; (for Christ hath joyned Preaching
and Baptizing) and then what need Christ give Pastors and Teachers?
<hi>Are all Prophets? 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 29.</p>
               <p>2. I answer positively, By <hi>all</hi> is meant, all such as are Prophets: the
Text is clear, <hi>v. 29. Let the Prophets speak two or three,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v. 30.
If any thing be revealed,</hi> &amp;c. They were extraordinary Prophets, and
spake by immediate revelation, without study: then follows, <hi>v. 31. For
ye may all Prophesie, i. e.</hi> all you that are gifted and called to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
for so it follows, <hi>v. 32. The spirits of the Prophets, i. e.</hi> the
Doctrine of every Prophet, <hi>must be subject to the</hi> examination adn
censure of the other <hi>Prophets;</hi> and therefore (saith the Apostle) every
Prophet may speak in publike, to the end that he may be discerned and
approved by the rest. General words must be confined to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Argument of the speech: So that the word <hi>all</hi> must be confined to
the Prophets; Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prophets, all ye that are Prophets may preach,
but these were Prophets by Gift and Office; therefore they might and
did preach publikely in Christs Name in the Assembly: So that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks not of all Beleevers in common, nor of any in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
promiscuously but of the Prophets lawfully called to instruct the

                  </gap>hurch of God. And 'tis worth observing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the word <hi>Prophet</hi> is
never given to any in the Old Testament, or the New, but onely to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49629:46"/>
and men in Office; and therefore our Saviour expresly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
a Prophet from a righteous man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41.</p>

Gifts endure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye may, all that have them use them.</p>
               <p>2. It appears they were Prophets, because the duties of Prophets are
ascribed to them, <hi>v.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5, 12, 24, 25. they must interpret, convince,

                  <hi>A. Habemus confitentem reum;</hi> you have betray'd your cause:
for if these were Prophets, as you confess they were, and I have proved
from the Text; then unless you can prove your selves to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

                  </gap>xtemporary Revelations; they were able by the singular revelation of
the Spirit to give the sence of Prophetick Scripture, without study or
pains <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. and sometimes they would foretell things to come, as
<hi>Agabus, Act.</hi> 11. 27. and the four daughters of <hi>Philip.</hi> In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Gospel and first planting of it, the Lord was pleased to
confirm it by extraordinary gifts of miracles, Healing, Tongues, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
Prophesying, and foretelling things to come. These were
temporary, and to endure onely in those primitive times; they are now
ceased; so that he's a miracle that should desire now such miracles.
Fully to this purpose is that of a learned man: The grace of Prophesying
under the New Testament was of immediate revelation and inspiration
of the Holy Ghost to all purposes, as under the Old. <hi>V.</hi> 30, If revelation

yet) in other points might erre. <hi>Aaron</hi> erred, <hi>Exod. 32. 4. Peter</hi>

that which is not revealed to one, is oftentimes revealed to more, and

                  <p>I shall conclude this Point in the words of a Reverend Divine. It's

as Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Evangelist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Prophets. For Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such
as are under the New Testament, they are always placed next unto the
Apostles and before Pastors &amp; Teachers 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28, 29. Eph.</hi> 4. 11.
In the Primitive times there were many such;<note place="margin">

as at <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Corinth:</hi> whether these were ordinary or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
it is easie to judge, by the continuance or discontinuance of them in
the Church in after-ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an at present. If there be any so gifted by the
holy Ghost, above ordained persons, that they are worthy to take place
of them, and of Evangelists; let them by all means have the liberty of
their Gifts, and their proper denomination: I think ordinary Ministers
should give them the right hand of fellowship, and place. As for any
kinde of Prophets or Prophesying in the publike Congregation belowe
Ministers and their Ministery, there is none to be found in any enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture, either in <hi>Rom. 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. or <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. where we
were most like to finde it: and therefore it is still with me resolved, that
the Prophets and Prophesying which we read of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
He that believes three kindes of Prophets under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament

               <p>And whereas they say our Ministery is Antichristian, because we
were ordained by Antichristian Bishops: We answer; This is easily said,
but not so easily proved; for, 1. we have our Ordination from Christ by
Bishops and Presbyters; we receive it not so much from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as from
Christ our Lord and theirs. His sevants we are, and in his Name do
we execute our Ministerial Functions, and not in the Bishops. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Presbytery is onely Ministerial service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby it restifies,
declares, and approves of those whom God approves and calls.</p>
               <p>2. Neither were the Bishops which ordained us, Antichristian; which I
prove thus: Those who by their life and doctrine have witnessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Antichrist, could not be Antichristian. But our Bishops (since
the Reformation) have witnessed against Antichrist: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Witness our

as your selves can witness: for, consider whether you did not receive
the work of conversion from sin unto God, which you presume to be
wrought in you first of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in these publike Assemblies from which you
now separate. And if once you found Christ walking amongst us, how
is it that yo do now leave us? Are we less, and not rather more refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
then we were? If the presence of Christ, both of his power and
grace be with us, why will you deny us your presence? Are ye holier and
wiser then Christ? Is not this an evident token that we are true Churches,
and have a true Ministery, because we have the Seal of our Ministery,
even the conversion of many sons and daughters unto God? Doth not
the Apostle from this very ground, argue the truth of his Apostleship?

instead of joyning with them to strengthen their hands, have been
withdrawing and separating themselves and others from them. And
what, Separate from a Reforming Church! A Church that professeth
so much willingness and readiness to be conformed to the Rule of the
Word! Brethren, let me tell you, There is more in this circumstance, then
haply some have been or are aware of. When God is coming towards
a Church, then to run from it! When God is turning his face towards
it, then to turn our backs upon it! When God is building it up, then to
be active in pulling it down! This is a sad thing; and surely if rightly
apprehended, must sit sadly upon the spirits of some.</p>

               <p>For Mariners at Sea to forsake their ship when she is ready to sink,

may be saved, now to leave her, (much more to cut holes in her sides)
their owners will give them little thanks for it. Some yeers since, the
