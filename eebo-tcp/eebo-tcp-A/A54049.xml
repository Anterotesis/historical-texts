            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Myſtery of Iniquity (which overſpread the Earth under a ſhape and appearance of holy Church, and holy Worſhip) did begin to work in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>2 Theſ. 2.7.</hi> And this was the way whereby the god of this world did deceive, he Endeavoured to blind mens minds, to put out their right Eye, (<hi>2 Cor. 4.4.</hi>) to draw from the Spirit, from the Annointing <hi>(1 Joh. 2.26.)</hi> to rob of the Eye-Salve wherewith the Eye muſt be annointed to ſee the things of God; <hi>Rev. 3.18.</hi> And now when he hath done this, how eaſily may his falſe Ware paſs for true; his Synagogue (built in the likeneſs of the true Church, <hi>Rev. 3.9.</hi>) for the true Church; Antichriſt his Son (ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Temple like Chriſt, <hi>2 Theſ. 2 4.</hi>) for the true Chriſt; his Doctrines for the true Teaching, <hi>(Matth. 15.9.)</hi> his feigned, formal, dead, earthly Traditions, for the true Everlaſting Goſpel; <hi>(Rev. 14.6.)</hi> his Gentiles, or Heathens, (who are ſo in nature, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> onely in Name) for the true Chriſtians, <hi>Rev. 11.2.</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Light of the Body is the Eye</hi> (ſaith Chriſt by way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Mat. 6.22, 23.</hi>) Now if the Eye be dark, <hi>if the Light which is in thee, be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> How ſhalt thou ſee the Goſpel, the Church, the Spirit, the things of God? But if that Eye be clear, who ſhall be able to blind thee? The Devil may come with his Deceits, his falſe Church, his falſe Goſpel, his falſe Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea though his Spirit creep into the very true form of godlineſs, thou wilt be able to diſcern him there. But if thou ſee with anothers Eye, thou mayeſt eaſily ſee amiſs, miſtake Chriſt, miſtake the Church, and ſo believe as the falſe Church believes, and fare as the falſe Church fares.</p>
            <p>Oh who ſhall redeem the deceived Nations back to the Spirit! Who ſhall preach to all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel! Who ſhall open the Eye in them which hath been ſo long blinded! Who ſhall take the Golden Cup of Fornication from their lips, and looſen their hearts from the Sorceries, Flatteries, and Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the falſe Woman!</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:96895:3"/>The everlaſting Bowels of the Lord rowl toward his poor captivated Seed, and towards the poor deceived Nations, and he is now preparing to build the Ruins of many Generations; he is bringing forth that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Truth, that Demonſtration of his Spirit in the ſpirits of his People, as no Paint ſhall be able to ſtand before. He will rend the Vail of the Covering from off all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall be ſeen by the eye which he opens and annoints; &amp; that which hath, deceived, and deſtroyed, and led from the Truth, building up a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Unrighteouſneſs in the ſtead of it, even the Beaſt and falſe Prophet (which wrought Miracles, with which he deceived them that had the mark of the Beaſt, &amp; them that worſhipped his Image) ſhall be taken &amp; caſt alive into the Lake, <hi>Rev. 19.20.</hi> Then Captivity ſhall be led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and thoſe which have been led captive, ſhall creep out of their dens, and out of their holes, into the Light of the Living, and worſhip the true and everlaſting King, when this King <hi>Abaddon</hi> is deſtroyed, <hi>Rev. 15.2, 3, 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O who ſhall be accounted worthy to be taught by the Lord where to wait for this! To whom will the Lord diſcover the place of Wiſdom (the place where Wiſdom is learned, her Voice heard, and her Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to life received) which is hid from the eyes of all living! <hi>Job 28.21.</hi> Whom ſhall he teach knowledge? And whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine? They are them that are weaned from the Milk, and drawn from the Breaſts of the falſe Woman, <hi>Iſa. 28.9. &amp;</hi> chap. <hi>52.15.</hi> They that are turned from man, from the fleſhly wiſdom in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, towards the ſpring of Life, they may hear the Voice of this Wiſdom which begins in the living Fear and Power, which effectually turns the heart from death and darkneſs, towards the living God, to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, according to the pure living teachings thereof, and not after the Inventions, Imaginations, and Traditions of men: And he that is once come hither, as he is true and faithful to the Light of Life, doing the will as it is made manifeſt to him, ſhall know more and more of the Doctrine, <hi>(Joh. 7.17.)</hi> and have his feet infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly guided into, and preſerved in the way of Peace.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that they are men not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the knowledge, faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the truth, it neceſſarily implies a capacity of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, both in relation to the knowledge, to the faith, and to the obedience.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Their doubtful diſputation of things, and long canvaſing, implies an uncertainty and poſſibility or erring.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> Their way of determining things at laſt, which is by a Vote of the major part, is an uncertain way of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for it is not impoſſible but the major part may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſwayed by by-ends, &amp; relation to their own advantage &amp; intereſts, againſt the righteouſneſs and equity of the reaſon of the leſſer part; ſo that the way of determining things by a Council, is not a certain way in it ſelf, but becauſe men know not well how to find out a better and more probable way of deciding Controverſies, they judge it neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce therein: But the Votes and Determinations of men concerning a thing, do not conclude a thing to be true or falſe in it ſelf; they onely ſignifie their Opinion, Judgement, and Teſtimony concerning the thing, the validity whereof depends upon their knowledge of the thing, which if it be not clear, full, and certain, their Teſtimony, Opinion, or Judgment, is of little value; <hi>Truth</hi> remains the ſame in it ſelf, though all the wiſe men in the world ſhould teſtifie againſt it, calling it <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie</hi>; and Falſhood can never become Truth, though never ſo many wiſe men ſhould teſtifie for it, putting the faireſt habit and appearance of Truth upon it that they can.</p>
            <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That the Pope himſelf may erre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96895:4"/>The <hi>Pope</hi> hath not greater freedom from fallibility in judgement or doctrine, then <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had. Now <hi>Peter</hi> had not only a capacity of error in him, but he did erre in that doctrine which he taught the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of living after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Jews</hi>; for he did not only do the thing himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. but he compelled the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to do the ſame thing, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it forth as a practice which ought to be obſerved by the <hi>Gentiles, ver.</hi> 14. for which carriage of his <hi>Paul</hi> withſtood him to the face, and ſaid <hi>he was to be blamed, v.</hi> 11. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance</hi> depoſing Pope <hi>John,</hi> &amp; advancing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Councils above the <hi>Pope,</hi> did plainly imply that the <hi>Pope</hi> might erre; which might further be confirmed by what the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> determined concerning Pope <hi>Eugenius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. 3. <hi>That every man may erre in his interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> further then he hath a certain and infallible opening of them to his ſpirit, by that Spirit which gave them forth. The Spirit knoweth his own minde in every word which he hath ſpoken; but no man knoweth his mind, nor the meaning of his words, but as he reveals them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. So that God is true in all his ſayings in the Scriptures; but man is a lyar in all the meanings he gives of his ſayings, according to his own gueſſings, reaſonings and imaginings, without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits infallible opening of his own words to him. So that the Spirit it ſelf is the ground and foundation of all true Light and knowledge of the things of God.</p>
            <p>Prop. 4. <hi>That if there be any Light to be found any where ſhining immediately from God, that Light cannot erre</hi>; For God is pure, and that which comes immediately from him, cannot but be pure. All the knowledge which man gathers, or can gather, into his Veſſel, he may pollute: but what iſſueth from the Spring is pure, and of a perfect nature, <hi>James</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>Prop. 5. <hi>That there muſt neceſſarily be ſuch a Light communicated to all men ſince the fall,</hi> that they may believe thereby, come to the knowledg of the truth, and be ſaved: Which I prove thus.</p>
            <p>1. From the Will of God. The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. Why then there muſt neceſſarily be ſomewhat diſpenced from God to all men, ſufficient to bring them to the <hi>knowledge of the Truth,</hi> that they may be <hi>ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96895:4"/>2. From what is found in man. There is found in man a Light ſhining in his darkneſs, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5.) a Light diſcovering the darkneſs, and drawing from it, ſomewhat which checks and reproves the ſinner, but never conſented to the evil of his heart and ways: This is of God, this is from God, this is pure, this is ſpiritual, not of the fleſhly, not of the natural; for then it might be drawn ſome time or other to conſent to ſome of the corrupt deſires of the natural: but though the conſcience be never ſo much defiled, yet the Light in it can never be defiled. Indeed a man may ſet up that for Light in his conſcience, which may be darkneſs; but Gods Light, Gods witneſs there, can never be bribed, but wil ſpeak truly (when God at any time awakeneth, or raiſeth it up) witneſſing for him both againſt the evil of the man, &amp; againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earedneſs, hardneſs &amp; unfaithfulneſs of his conſcience towards God.</p>
            <p>Prop. 6. <hi>That this Light being let in, believed in, and obeyed, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more and more unto the perfect day, even until it hath wholly brought out of the Error, into the Truth.</hi> Every way of it is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and every ſtep of the creature after it is infallible. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Creatures reaſonings and conſultations about it may be fallible; but the Light is infallible in it ſelf: And ſo far as there is a pure, ſimple, naked thing begotten by it, (for it is of a begetting nature, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17, 18.) ſo far there is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of its certainty in the creature. There are ſome things that all the men of the earth certainly know to be evil by means of its ſhining, &amp; ſome things alſo that they certainly know to be good; and at ſome times there is a Will begotten in them towards the good, &amp; againſt the evil: Now if they did honeſtly wait in the ſingleneſs of this Will, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the God of Power to have it brought to victory in them, the Light would ſhine more and more from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and in the Light, the Power and ſaving Arm would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, which would effectually lead out of the Death and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, into the fellowſhip and freedom of the Life.</p>
            <p>Prop. 7. <hi>That nothing leſs can lead to eternal life, than an eternal Light in man's spirit,</hi> where the darkneſs is, which is to be diſcovered there, ſubdued there, and to be led from. This was the Apoſtle's Meſſage, (who received and came with the Meſſage of the Goſpel) <hi>That God is Light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96895:5"/>
at all,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. And this they preached to bring men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowſhip with this Light, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that they might walk with God in it, &amp; there be cleanſed by the blood of Jeſus through it, <hi>ver.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which that they might obtain, they muſt firſt be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from darkneſs to it, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. and from the Power and Kingdom of Satan, to the Seed of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Chriſt told the Phariſees was within them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the Laws of the Covenant, whereof Chriſt was the Miniſter and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, were by the tenor of the New-Covenant, to be written in the Heart and Mind by the Spirit, &amp; not to be written out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as that Covenant was which God made with the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes, (Heb.</hi> 8.6. &amp;c.) which was not the eternal Covenant it ſelf, but a ſhadow of it, which made nothing perfect, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made way for the hope of a better Covenant, by which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers draw nigh to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. Yea <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Commandment of life, the Word Eternal (according to faith wherein, and obedience whereto, they were to Live or Dye eternally) was within them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14, 15. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> that this was the Word of Faith which they preached, that it was alſo the covenant of Life and Death under the Goſpel, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.8. Chriſt is the Light of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. or the eternal Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. which Light or Word ſpeaks within in every man's conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he that believes in it, brings his deeds to it, and obeys it, is juſtified by it; but he that hates its reproof, is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21. and not only ſhut out of life, but out of the very Way to it; for the reproofs of the inſtruction of this Wiſdom, are the ſole Way or path of life to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6 23.</p>
            <p>Now behold the true certainty of the everlaſting Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and behold your own uncertainty. See the Rock of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whereupon the Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp; all the Saints have been built. See that which indeed is infallible, and ceaſe from man, who is vain, and ſubject to vanity &amp; error. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> did err, the Churches of the Gentiles alſo did err even in the Apoſtles dayes, inſomuch as their <hi>Candleſtick</hi> wa threatned to be removed, and was ſoon removed; yea the Apoſtle particularly foretold the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi> concerning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96895:5"/>
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that their ſtanding was by Faith, and that if they continued not in Gods goodneſs, they alſo ſhould be cut off, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 22. Now there was not a ſtanding in the faith, but a general backſliding and falling away from the Faith; and then the Man of ſin was revealed, and Chriſt and his Truth withdrawn, ſtrong deluſion, deceit and falſe appearances of truth ſtarting up inſtead thereof, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.11. For the Lord God upon the great defection and apoſtacy of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſeperates the outward Court from his Temple, Altar and ſpiritual Worſhippers, which Temple was his true Church, which he reſerved for himſelf, giving the outward Court to the <hi>Gentiles, Rev.</hi> 11.1.2. And then the true Church fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God for her; and ſo the <hi>Gentile-Chriſtians</hi> could build up their falſe Churches in the Cities or Places where the true Church had been built by God, and had appeared before. And theſe falſe Churches may eaſily become much larger then the true Church ever was; for while the Lord built the Church by his ſpirit, he built it onely of <hi>ſpiritual Stones,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. adding to it ſuch as he firſt converted, <hi>Act.</hi> 2 47. For ſuch alone are fit to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and ſuch alone he ſeeks out to make up his Church of, inſtead of the <hi>Jews</hi> whom he had caſt off from being a Church and People to him, <hi>John</hi> 4.23. But when man comes to build he takes in more largely then God allows, he may gather in, or force a whole City or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to become a Church, by perſwading or compelling them to receive the Doctrine and Traditions which he preſcribes, and by ſetting up an outward Knowledge, Policy, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment according to man, &amp; in the wiſdom of man, which the humane part will anſwer to, &amp; be ſatisfied with. To make this a little more manifeſt to ſuch as in ſimplicity of heart deſire to know the mind of God (in this reſpect) and the true ſtate of the Church ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God in thoſe dayes ſent his true Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with the everlaſting Goſpel, which was the Word of Faith which they preached, to gather men out of <hi>Jeruſalem, Judea,</hi> and all Nations, into the obedience of the Faith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.) that he might have a ſpiritual Houſe, a ſpiritual People
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96895:6"/>
to worſhip him, inſtead of thoſe outward Worſhippers whom he then caſt off, <hi>John</hi> 4.23.</p>
            <p>2. That this gathered people in <hi>Judea,</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Coloſs,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> were his ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Congregations, and not the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> not the City of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Rome, &amp;c.</hi> None of theſe were Churches, but only a ſelect Remnant gathered out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> theſe.</p>
            <p>3. That the Devil after he had ſtirred up the <hi>Jews</hi> every where, and the Heathen as much as he could, to cry out againſt the Truth, and ſuch as God had converted to the Faith, for Hereſie and a Sect, and to perſecute them and it, yet could not prevail that way; then he tryed another way, ſending his Meſſengers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, cloathing them as Angels of Light, teaching them alſo to preach Chriſt, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves under this colour, ſecretly to ſow the Seeds of Diviſion, Error, and Hereſie in the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13</p>
            <p>4. When this would not do, but theſe were diſcovered and judged (by the power and preſence of the Light of the Spirit in the Church) for falſe <hi>Jews,</hi> falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Satan, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 3.9 &amp; chap. 2.3. then they ſeperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Church, <hi>Jude</hi> 19. make up a body of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now, whereas before there was a Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Church at <hi>Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> when the Synagogue of Satan is ſet up, and hath got the Dominion there, the whole City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the whole City <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> can then become a Church. To make this yet more manifeſt, obſerve and weigh theſe things following in the Ballance of the true Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The falſe Prophets, the falſe Apoſtles, which had crept into the Church, <hi>Jude</hi> 4. which ſtrived to ſeduce the Church, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2 26. theſe went out from the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and went into the World, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> When they went out into the World, their intent was to leaven the World with their Doctrine, and to gather a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96895:6"/>
after them. They preached to gather people to them, and their Doctrine and form of godlineſs, as the Apoſtles preached to gather people to God, and his living Truth.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> The World heard them, they hearkened to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were willing to be gathered by them, owning their falſe Miniſtry, and their falſe Church or Synagogue, even as thoſe that were of God hearkened to the Apoſtles, and owned the truth, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.6. So that here was now two diſtinct Bodies in Cities and places where the Goſpel had come: A Body of the true Saints and true Apoſtles; a Body of the falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters, of the deceitful workers, who ſhewed Miracles and Wonders, and had all manner of deceivableneſs, of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on their ſide, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. Thus there was a great diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and breach in the places where the Goſpel had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had reigned in power; for he that was of God, heard the true Apoſtles, and kept to the true Church; but thoſe that were not of God, but of the Worldly Spirit, heard the falſe Apoſtles and falſe Miniſters, and ſo joined to the Synagogue of Satan, (1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.6.) where Satan had his ſeat and dwelling, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. even as Chriſt dwelleth &amp; ſitteth in his Temple the true Church.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> Theſe falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters, with the help of the World, which they had gathered in unto them, joined together againſt the true Church and her Seed, (as where-ever the two contrary Spirits and Principles appear, they cannot but contend and fight againſt each other, the one for the Faith and Truth of the Goſpel, the other againſt that which is true, and for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of it) ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. there is <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſide of the true Church; there's the Dragon and his Angels fighting for the falſe Church. Now mark who prevails. The true Church, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels prevail one way; the the falſe Church, the Synagogue of Satan, the Dragon and his Angels prevail another way.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth the true Church prevail?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus: Shee keeps all the ſpiritual, the inviſible, the holy things of God from the paw of the Dragon, and of all thoſe falſe Worſhippers. The inviſible <hi>Jew,</hi> the inviſible Life and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that whereof God had built up his Church, is preſerved by him; and againſt his Life and Spirit, and his Church (which he builds by his Spirit, and preſerves in it) all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96895:7"/>
cannot prevail; but do they all what they can, the Man-child is caught up to God, and the Church by God's help flies from the face of the Dragon into the Wilderneſſe, where ſhe is fed 42. Months, or 1260. dayes, which is the time of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons prevailing outwardly by his falſe Church and Miniſtry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth the Dragon and falſe Church prevail?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By putting the Man-Child and true Church to flight, by gaining the Churches ground, ſetting up his Synagogue (or falſe repreſentation of the true Church) where the true Church had ſtood before. For the Church being fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Field was left to him, and there he ſets up his falſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue in the ſight of the World, calling her the true Church, and her Seed the true Catholicks, but caſting a Flood of reproach after the Woman, reviling her (who indeed was the true Church) for a Strumpet, and all her Seed for Seducers, Schiſmaticks, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Deceivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even ſuch as were not fit to be ſuffered in the Earth, but to be made war with both by the the Spiritual and Civil Sword, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 15, 17.</p>
            <p>Thus then was the victory on each hand: The true Church and Temple (with the inward power and virtue of life) was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God, who cauſed it by the wings of his Spirit to flie out of the ſight of all falſe Worſhippers and Imitators, as far as that is from the ſight of men in a City, which flieth out of the City into a Wilderneſſe: And to the other is left the outward Court to worſhip in, the Profeſſion, the Attire, the Garments, the viſible Obſervations and Practiſes wherein the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had appeared, and in which ſhe did once truly and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worſhip: For the Church did acceptably worſhip in the outward Court, before it was meaſured and divided from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple, and given to the Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11 2.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Now how long was this falſe Church to ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Till the Church its coming out of the Wilderneſs in the ſame Spirit and Power wherewith ſhe fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. When Chriſt comes with the fiery breath of his mouth, and with the brightneſs of his eternal Light, then this falſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Church melts and diſſolves away, 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2.8. But till then ſhe keeps her ſeat on the Beaſt, on whom ſhe rides, and by vertue of whom ſhe ſits upon the Waters, even upon Peoples, Multitudes, Nations and Tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96895:7"/>Obj. <hi>But did not Chriſt ſay the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No more they did not: For ſhe had wings of an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle given her to fly into the Wilderneſſe, into the place prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God for her; into which ſhe did flye, and was there fed and preſerved, do all the Powers of darkneſſe what they could: So that the Dragon and his Angels prevailed not againſt the Woman, but ſhe was hid from the face of the Serpent, and from all his Spite and Power, who could not come within the bounds of her Heaven in the Wilderneſs, but was caſt out into the earth, and his Angels with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.8, 9. But Chriſt did not ſay that the Gates of Hell ſhould not prevail againſt her outward Eſtate, but the contrary in this very Propheſie of <hi>John</hi> is here declared, to wit, that ſhe was ſo far prevailed againſt: The true Woman who was <hi>clothed with the Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, and was crowned with a Crown of twelve Stars,</hi> was to flie away and give place, and a falſe Woman to ſtart up in her ſtead, who with her Golden Cup of her Fornications, was to deceive and bewitch all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Languages 42. Months, or 1260. days, which was the full time the Church was to remain in the Wilderneſſe: But after that time, the falſe Church with Antichriſt her Husband (who all this while ſate in the Temple) were to be revealed, judged and deſtroyed, and the true Church return again out of the Wilderneſſe into her own place.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why would God ſuffer his Church thus to be prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, thus to be baniſhed and driven out of the Building which his Spirit had reared for her, into a Wilderneſs, and a Myſtery of Deceit and Falſhood to be ſet up in her name and ſtead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, As a juſt judgement upon the World (who ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the day of their Viſitation, and would not come into the Vinyard to work) God brings the Night upon them, wherein they could not enter into the Vinyard, nor work if they would never ſo fain, <hi>John</hi> 9 4.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> As a juſt judgement upon ſuch, who though they could not but own and acknowledge the truth, yet did not love it in their hearts, but loved their unrighteouſneſſe, their darkneſſe ſtill; therefore God removes the power of his Truth from their eyes, into the Wilderneſſe, and lets out a power of darkneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96895:8"/>
upon them, wherewith they were deluded inſtead of the Truth it ſelf, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> That ſuch as were approved, might be made manifeſt in the Spirit to be pure Gold indeed. They that held the living Truth, and could not be drawn aſide with all the pleaſures of this World on the one hand, nor with all the dangers from it on the other hand, no nor yet with all the deceivableneſſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, theſe did ſhine indeed in the Light and Power of the Spirit, and were a great Honor and Crown upon the Head of their Maſter.</p>
            <p>4<hi>thly.</hi> That darkneſs might have its day, or hour, or ſeaſon of manifeſtation to the full. There hath been no Day of any diſpenſation hitherto, but it hath had a Night coming after it. There was an Antichriſt to be revealed in the power of darkneſs, as well as Chriſt (the eternal Light of Life) in the living Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now as long as the true Church ſtood, and as long as the the Man-child was found dwelling here with her, in the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God had built up for them, the man of ſin could not be revealed, but the pure Power of Life would ſoon diſcover him. Therefore at length, when the full time and ſeaſon of his diſcovery came, God removed that into the Wilderneſſe which ſtood in the way, and then he and his Spouſe, the falſe Church, make a fair ſhew in the World, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly.</hi> That the Lord might make the Name of his Son, with the glory of his Truth and Power to ſhine, by overcoming the Dragon and this falſe Church after ſo long a time of thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and after ſuch an univerſal prevalency of the powers and deceits thereof. Was it not a great glory and honor to the Lord, to overcome the Heatheniſh world, and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by the Power of his Truth ſhining through a poor deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Fiſhermen and Mechanicks? And will it not be as great (if not a greater) glory to him to overcome the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian world (after it hath taken ſo long and ſo deep root, and is become ſo ſtrongly founded) by as poor contemptible inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they were?</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how was it poſſible that ſo great a deceit ſhould get up in the world ſo near the Apoſtles dayes, or rather in the very dayes of the Apoſtles, as this ſeemeth to be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The falſe Apoſtles and Miniſters came <hi>with all deceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vableneſs

of unrighteouſneſs, and with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. And the power of Miracles in the true Apoſtles might well ceaſe: For the end of Miracles was but to teſtifie to the world, to be a ſign to the unbelievers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22 But now their work towards the world, was well nigh finiſhed, &amp; Judgement was to come upon them for neglecting and deſpiſing the day of their Viſitation. So that the power of deceit was let up in the falſe Apoſtles, &amp; the power of truth did draw inwards in the true Apoſtles, which made it very eaſie for deceit to prevail. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the falſe Apoſtles appeared in an higher appearance than the true Apoſtles did, with more glorious diſcoveries, ſo that they could hold forth all that the Apoſtles did (as to the Form &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Doctrine) &amp; more too, &amp; could ſhew wonders to confirm what they held forth further: And now how could they chuſe but prevail over all that kept not cloſe to the Annointing, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth &amp; diſcerneth not by any outward manifeſtation or appearance, but by the ſavour of the Ointment? Yea ſo great was the power of Deceit in them, that they drew the third part of the Stars of Heaven from their place, into this earthly Building, ſo that they fell from the true Miniſtry, and the true Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this falſe Church and Miniſtry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.4.

            <p>Queſt <hi>Hath there then been no viſible true Church-ſtate in the world ſince that time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is impoſſible for any to build a true Church for God, but his own Spirit: And if God removed the Church which he built into the Wilderneſſe, it is impoſſible for all the men of the Earth to build up another true one, all that ſeaſon that God appoints his Church to abide in the Wilderneſſe. Several ſorts of men may attempt it, and each may build up their different Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the thing, but none can recover the thing it ſelf, till the Lord by his Spirit (who firſt built, and then pulled down) pitty the duſt of <hi>Sion,</hi> and raiſe up the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not an outward place, into which the Bodies of perſons might flee, but a parable to expreſs ſomewhat inwardly: And it is under the feet of all the falſe Worſhippers, who are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96895:9"/>
worſhipping in their ſeveral Buildings in the outward Court. That which they trample upon, keep down, and deſpiſe, is the Holy City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. And the place where the true Church all this while hath been, (and yet in a great part is) is there.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But if God's Church hath not been in a built ſtate, but lain deſolate in the Wilderneſs ever ſince Antichriſt and the falſe Church got up, what hath the eſtate of his people been ever ſince?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> A ſtate of witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. In every Age God hath hath had two witneſſes (which was a ſufficient number to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his truth by) to witneſs to the power of his truth, againſt the emptineſs and corruptions of the forms which Antichriſt had brought in, inſtead of the living power: Which witneſſes were clothed with Sack-cloth, giving forth their teſtimony with tears, while they of the Antichriſtian party were rejoicing in the Glory, Riches and Beauty of their falſe Church, as they could ſlay, ſuppreſs and keep down the VVitneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. and chap. 18.7, 9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What did the Dragon do after this Victory, after he had got his Building up in the outward Court,</hi> (for after he had prevailed to corrupt it, the Lord gave it to his worſhippers the Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. thoſe that made a profeſſion of his truth, but were not true <hi>Jews, Rev.</hi> 3.9. not of the inward circumciſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3.) <hi>and had got the holy City under the feet of his worſhippers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He purſued his Victory againſt the Woman, and the remnant of her Seed. As for the woman, he caſt a flood of Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of Reproach after her, that ſhe might never be able to lift up her head again in the power of truth, but what ſhe cauſeth to ſpring up, might ſtill be reviled for falſhood and Hereſie, &amp; that nothing might henceforth go for Truth, but what this falſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould determine to be ſo. And as touching the remnant of her Seed which ſtil remained true to God, keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and having the Teſtimony of Jeſus, he applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now to wage the war againſt them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15.17.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth he wage the War againſt them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He raiſeth up a Beaſt out of this Sea of Cofnuſion and VVickedneſs, (which enſued upon this great Battel and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his ſide) to whom he gave <hi>his Power, his Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Rev.</hi> 13.2. He had hitherto kept his Seat in his Synagogue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96895:9"/>
where he had been ſlaying the faithful Martyrs of Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. and had put to death ſuch as loved not their lives unto death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. Now he finds it more for his advantage to raiſe up this Beaſt, and to give his Power, Seat and Authority to him. This was the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, which till it was thus depraved and enſlaved by Satan, was not a Beaſt, but more noble and juſt in Government than the corrupted <hi>Jews</hi> were, but now it becomes a Beaſt: And this Beaſt he ſtirs up againſt the very Name and Form of Godlineſs, that he might root out the very appearance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from off the Earth: For he got but into the Form, to eat out the Power; and now, ſeeing the Power is removed, it is for his advantage alſo to corrupt and deſtroy the memorial of the true Form.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth he effect this, and prevail likewiſe againſt the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, as he effected the other. He overcomes the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes after the manner that he had overcome the Church, (to wit, by captiving the outward man, and killing with the Sword; but they overcome him by patience and Faith, in their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Sufferings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10.) and this in all Kinreds, Tongues and Nations; and ſo all the publike Worſhip of the Earth is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why would God ſuffer him to do thus, ſeeing he hath all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in his hands, and could have reſtrained him if he had pleaſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was greatly needful to the preſent eſtate of his people: For by this God raiſed up that which was good and pure in any, and kept life in it, which otherwiſe might have periſhed in the eſtate of that corrupt Form, which then had prevailed, and had gotten Dominion outwardly over the true Power.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But did not this tend to deſtroy Satan's Kingdom alſo? For this ſtroke going againſt the very Name of Chriſtianity, and Profeſſion of Godlineſs, might light upon his carnal Goſpellers likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They could eaſily ſave themſelves, turning about to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſufferings, and crying, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is able to make war with him? Rev.</hi> 13.4. Being already one with him in Spirit and Principle, they would not eaſily differ from him, and ſuffer about a Form, eſpecially ſeeing their Maſters intereſt and ſervice ran now another way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96895:10"/>Queſt. <hi>What became of this Beaſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord did rend and teare him outwardly by his Plagues, Famines, Peſtilences, Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch as one of his Heads was wounded as it were to death, and inwardly by the innocency and power of his Truth appearing in his Witneſſes, which ſcorched and tormented the Adverſary, ſo that this Engine of the Dragon grew faint, and weary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for this ſervice, as he ſtood in this capacity.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What doth the Dragon do then, to carry on his war againſt the witneſſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> After this tempeſtuous Sea was over, he raiſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Beaſt out of the Earth, with another kind of Power, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>Horns like a Lamb, Rev.</hi> 13.11. but <hi>he ſpake as a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> exerciſing all the Power of the firſt Beaſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. ſo that he is the Man in Power hence-forward; yet he ſetteth up the firſt Beaſt alſo, cauſing <hi>the Earth and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> And thus theſe two join together, to ſet up an Image to be worſhipped: And all that will not worſhip this Image (but the living God alone in his pure Life and Spirit) this latter Beaſt hath power to cauſe to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and ſuch muſt not ſo much as buy or ſell, who will not receive the <hi>Mark of the Beaſt, or his Name, or</hi> at leaſt <hi>the Number of his Name</hi>; to which number the higheſt growth and perfection in Religion and Worſhip after the Wiſdom of the Fleſh, (or man's Wiſdom) is to be reckoned, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18.</p>
            <p>Obſerve now diligently the place of the true Church, and her eſtate, and the eſtate of her Children all the 42. Months. Her place of Habitation is a Wilderneſs, her eſtate an eſtate of Widowhood, (a City un-built, trodden under the feet of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) her Seed Witneſſes, reproached, perſecuted, and ſlain by the falſe Woman and her Seed. Obſerve likewiſe the place and eſtate of the falſe Church and her Children; She rears up a glorious Building as to the outward, ſhe is a City built and richly adorned, ſhe hath a Golden Cup of Doctrine and Diſcipline, of Ordinances and Worſhip to hold forth to the Kings and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Earth in all Nations, Peoples, Kinreds and Tongues; ſhe is arrayed in Purple and Scarlet-colour, and decked with Gold and precious Stone, and Pearls, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17 4. and all her Daughters, who though they may deny her, yet partake of

her Spirit, and learn to rear up Buildings of Churches like her) they alſo flouriſh in their degree and meaſure. None is poor but <hi>Sion,</hi> none is deſolate but God's <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but his Church which fled into the Wilderneſs, to abide there all the time of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: And her Witneſſes are clothed with Sackcloth, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying to God's deſpiſed and reproached Truth, with mourning and grief of Spirit, and not with that fleſhly joy, wiſdom, and confidence, wherewith <hi>Babylon</hi> and her Merchants vent their Wares, but onely in the evidence, demonſtration, and aſſurance of the Spirit in their hearts, which all the wiſe and confident Builders and Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon</hi> trample upon, and deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>Now it behoveth all to conſider what this <hi>Babylon,</hi> what this Woman is, ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. which came in the place of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Woman ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. what this built City is, which the Wrath of the Lord will make deſolate, what this Beaſt or falſe Prophet is which appears like a Lamb, (and ſheweth ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to deceive the Earth) and yet is fierce and cruel to ſuch as witneſs for God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13 13, 14, 15 for dreadful are the Plagues, Woes, Vials of Wrath, Thunders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which God hath prepared for her, even the Cup of the Lords Indignation without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, torment with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10, 11. and <hi>chap.</hi> 18.8.

               <hi>Rev.</hi> 17 6. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, O ye <hi>Papiſts,</hi> wait on the Lord in his fear and dread, that he may vouchſafe to make known to you what, and where this City <hi>Babylon</hi> is, and that ſuch of you as belong to him may hear his voice calling you out of her, that ye may eſcape this bitter Cup, <hi>Rev</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p>The great Judgement is already begun (this we know, who have taſted of it.) It hath begun at God's Houſe, and is ſpreading further, yea even over the Nations which have diſowned you, &amp; yet have learned of you to build up a Church and VVorſhip, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of your Whoredoms. Theſe the Lord will judge firſt: He will plead with the Daughters who have diſowned their Mother, and yet have gone on in the Spirit of VVhoredoms, worſhipping the works of their ovvn hands, and admiring and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96895:11"/>
magnifying the beauty of the Churches which themſelves have formed. Now is your time to conſider, now is the time for the ſimple-hearted among you to flee from <hi>Babylon,</hi> before the wrath of the Lord beſiege her. There are three things in general (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many particulars) which the Proteſtant Nations and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have learned of you, which will coſt them dear, ere they be made willing to part with them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Their taking upon them Authority over mens Conſciences,</hi> commanding them what they ſhould believe, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles never did, but ſaid expreſly, they had not dominion over the Faith of others, but were helpers of their joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. They could not command any to believe their Doctrine, but ſpake in the demonſtration of the Spirit, waiting till God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.2. and would not have men profeſs, believe, or practice from their Words, but by a feeling of the Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. And when men did believe ſome things, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unity &amp; fellowſhip of the Faith, they did not require them to believe all the that Church taught or held forth as true, but waited till God pleaſed to reveal further, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. Indeed they could command obedience to the Faith; What Truths the Spirit of the Lord revealed and taught any man, they could charge him in the Name of the Lord to be faithful to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. but they knew it was God alone who could ingraft the Truth into the heart and conſcience, and alſo give the encreaſe of it: And ſo from him alone they expected it, waiting in patience on the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and perverſe, till God ſhould pleaſe to work upon them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25. and likewiſe on thoſe that were convinced, and had ſubjected themſelves to the Faith, for his encreaſe of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7.</p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>Their abridging mens liberty in things wherein God hath left them free,</hi> and preſſing an uniformity in things which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſs to be indifferent. Now the Apoſtle (who had the care of all the Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11:28) though he knew certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how to determine about meats and dayes, as himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14. yet he telleth the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> expreſly, that Chriſt was the Lord and Maſter of every Diſciple, to whom he muſt ſtand or fall herein, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and that every man ought to do is he is fully perſwaded in his own mind, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Nay he is ſo far from preſſing a neceſſity of uniformity in ſuch Caſes, that he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96895:11"/>
preſſeth a neceſſity of bearing on each hand, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. So that in the Apoſtles judgement, the Church hath not Power to lay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the Conſcience, but muſt receive the weakeſt in the Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. leaving him to the liberty of his Conſcience and to his ſubjection to his own Lord and Maſter, to whom every Believer muſt give an account of what he receives, and of what he obeys and performs, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and 12.</p>
            <p>3dly. <hi>Their ſetting up a Church-building, Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline by the Magiſtrates Power.</hi> This the Apoſtles no where taught nor practiced. They converted men by the Power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they cut down Errors, Hereſies, Seducers and Hereticks by the ſame Word, and they found the Weapons of their Warfare ſufficient, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. they had no need of running to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. But that Church, thoſe Doctrines, that Government and Diſcipline which is ſet up by the Magiſtrates Sword without and againſt the Spirit, that hath need of a carnal Sword to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it againſt the Spirit, and to cut down God's Witneſſes (whom he raiſeth up to teſtifie againſt it) for Schiſmaticks and Hereticks, or its nakedneſs wil ſoon be made manifeſt, &amp; it's ruin approach.</p>
            <p>Now when the Lord hath judged all the Daughters of <hi>Babylon</hi> for theſe things, then will he at length begin to plead with their Mother, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, who hath gone a whoring from the Spirit, and built up a gawdy Church without the Spirit, which ſhe hath defended by violence and blood, drinking the Blood of the Saints who have been inſpired by the Spirit to teſtifie againſt her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7, 8. and hath taught all her Daughters to do the ſame, to wit, to drink the blood of the Witneſſes againſt them, even as ſhe hath drunk the blood of the Witneſſes that have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified againſt her. And though becauſe ſhe hath had an half day more given her, after her time ſeemed to be even expiring, and after Judgement and Deſolation was beginning to enter upon her; though becauſe of this, ſhe thinks the bitterneſs of death is paſt, and ſhe ſhall now ſit as a Queen, a Lady, a glorious Church for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. yet for all this is ſhe come again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's remembrance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.19. and ſhe ſhall ſee Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and be caſt into a Bed of Torment, and all her Children into great Tribulation with her, and ſhe ſhall be deſolate, and naked, and drink of the Cup, and not repent that ſhe might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.11. and 9.20, 21. This is her portion from the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96895:12"/>
hand of the Lord: Oh happy is he whoſe eyes the Lord ſhall open to flee out of her for his life! For the Lamb is ariſen to make War, and his Spouſe is making her ſelf ready for his pure Bed of Life, &amp; his anger is kindled againſt all the Kings &amp; Powers of the Earth that ſtand in his way: and though they fight never ſo reſolutely againſt him and his meek ones, they ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but the Lamb will overcome all, for he is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> and they that are with him in this Battle of his Spirit, are <hi>called, and choſen, and faithful,</hi> Rev. 17.14. And though this Woman (the falſe Church, in her various dreſſes) is ſo ſtrong every where (getting the Earthly Powers and Authorities on her ſide) that now it may be ſaid concerning this Beaſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral appearances of it, as was concerning the former, <hi>Who is able to make war with her</hi>? Yet there is an inviſible Power ſtronger than ſhe, who will call her to judgement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. and make her give an account of all the Saints blood which ſhe hath drunk her ſelf, and which ſhe hath taught her Daughters to drink: And <hi>Salvation, Glory, Honor and Power</hi> ſhall be aſcribed to the Lord for his righteous and powerful judging of her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.1, 2. And he that hath any glimmering of this in the eternal Light of the Lords pure ever-living Spirit, let him even now ſay, <hi>Alleluja</hi> to him who is <hi>ariſen out of his holy habitation,</hi> and hath already begun this Work, who will not fail to perfect it. <hi>Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>Somewhat concerning the GROUND of ERROR, and the way to Truth and Unity, for the ſake of ſuch as are more ſpiritual, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THere is no way to become an Heir of the Kingdom of God, but by being begotten and born of his Spirit, which blows upon the ſpirit of a man, breaths life into him, and forms him in the Eternal Image, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>There is no way of having this Work of God preſerved, but by turning to the Spirit, which begets, ſtanding and keeping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in that which is begotten, and taking heed of the fleſhly wiſdom, which ſtands near to corrupt and deſtroy the work of God, tempting, and leading aſide from the Truth it ſelf, into ſome Image and Reſemblance of it: And if this prevail, there is ſuddenly a departing from the living God, and a running a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the inventions of the fleſhly Wiſdom, which appears in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96895:12"/>
the likeneſs of the true Wiſdom, that it might the better deceive:</p>
               <p>Now when man is firſt breathed upon, and begotten towards God, there's but a little life, a little ſimplicity, a little Light, a little Power, a little of the Wiſdom of the true Babe; but a great Body of Death, Deceit, Darkneſs, Power and Wiſdom of the Fleſh ſtanding: And all theſe apply themſelves to overturn &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the truework of God, by raiſing up a falſe Image of it, which is eaſily done; but abiding and preſervation in the Truth is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and alone maintained by that Power, which at firſt begat.</p>
               <p>Now the Power preſerves through keeping out of the ſenſual and reaſoning part (where the corrupt one hath his lodging) in that poor, low, little, childiſh ſenſibility of the life, which the Father hath begotten. Here is the entrance unto the Truth, here is the growth, here is the preſervation and ſafety: Which makes it ſo hard for thoſe that are wiſe and ſtrong in the reaſoning and comprehending part, either to enter in, or to abide and grow in the nakedneſs, ſimplicity, and ſeeming folly of the truth of the Goſpel. Oh what a deal is to be brought down, before they can be truly reached and convinced by the fooliſh &amp; weak things which God chuſeth to effect his great Works by, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28! What a Work hath God with them to batter their Wiſdom, and bring down their Underſtanding, which the larger it is, the more it ſtands in the way of his Light, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. And if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced at any time, what an eaſie and natural return unto them doth their own Wiſdom find, by ſome ſubtil device or other, to draw them back from the plainneſs and ſingleneſs of the Truth, into an holding it in the wiſdom and ſubtilty of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part, where the ſimplicity is ſoon loſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.</p>
               <p>In the Spirit which begets and in the Truth which is begotten by it, is the true Unity. Feeling that in one another, is that which unites us to one another. Every one keeping to that in his own particular, is kept to that which unites; and that is kept alive in him which is to be united: But departing from that, there is a departing from the true Unity into the Error and ground of diviſion. And then that which hath erred and departed from the true unity, ſtrives to ſet up a falſe Image of unity, and blames that which abides in the Truth, becauſe it cannot thus unite: For that which abides in the Spirit, and in that which the Spirit hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and formed, cannot unite according to the fleſh; as that which is run a whoring from the Spirit, into an Image of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96895:13"/>
fleſhly Wiſdom's forming, cannot unite according to the Spirit. Conſider this, O ye Profeſſors of this Age, ye blame us for depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from you, for withdrawing from unity with you; we blame you for departing from the living Principle, wherein our unity with you formerly ſtood, and wherein alone we can again unite with you, and not in ſuch things as uphold a fleſhly and falſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the true Unity.</p>
               <p>Oh that ye could hear the Lord's voice, who cryeth aloud to the Profeſſors of this Age to ceaſe from man! Ceaſe from man in thy ſelf, O thou who haſt ever had any taſte of the pure Grace and Power of God. Ceaſe from thine own underſtanding, thine own affections, thine own zeale, thine own gathered knowledge and wiſdome from the Scriptures, with all the ſparks of thine own kindling, that God may be all in thee, and his eternal habitation be raiſed up in thee, and perfected, &amp; thou ſwallowed up and comprehended in it for ever. Oh what a Work hath God to do to drive man's Reaſon and VViſdom out of his Temple, out of his Scriptures, out of all his holy things! He that hath an ear, let him hear, for the ſake of his ſouls eternal peace. Alas, Alas how many ſtumble at, and blaſpheme that, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can ſave the ſoul. There have been many diſpenſations of, but there is but one living Truth, but one Subſtance, but one Arm of Salvation: And he that ſtumbles at the thing it ſelf, how can he be ſaved by it? It is eaſie miſ-underſtanding a former diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, reading it in the Letter, and ſo to miſs of the Salvation hoped for by it. The <hi>Jews</hi> owned the Meſſiah (according to the Scriptures, as they thought) but rejected him in the way he came to ſave them in. Now if Chriſtians have gathered ſuch a kind of knowledge from the Letter of the Scriptures, as they did, how can they avoid the ſame error, namely, of owning Chriſt according to the Scriptures, as they think, but rejecting him as he comes to ſave them, rebelling againſt his living Miniſtry, and the pure povver and demonſtration of his Spirit, becauſe it appears vveak &amp; lovv, becauſe it doth not appear the ſame thing to them vvhich they expect to be ſaved by, according to their apprehenſions of the Scriptures? Thus reading the Scriptures in another Spirit &amp; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom then that which vvrote them, they muſt needs conclude and gather another thing from them, then what is vvritten in them, and ſo make that a means to them of erring from the life, which was written to teſtifie of, and point to the living Principle from whence life and ſalvation ſprings, and vvhere alone it is to be had.</p>
