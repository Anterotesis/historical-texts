         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That God had made them able Miniſters of the New-Teſtament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, <hi>2</hi> Cor <hi>3.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the diſpenſation of the Law, which was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of good things to come; and after the diſpenſation of the Prophets, who foretold of better days, and of a better ſtate to come, then the days and ſtate under the Law was; it pleaſed God firſt to ſend the fore-runner <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> to prepare the way for the King and his Kingdom; and then to ſend the King himſelf in the fulneſs of his ſpirit, to gather Diſciples to him, and to furniſh them with a competent meaſure of the ſame ſpirit, to raiſe up a Spiritual Seed to him, in whom he would ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, dwelling, walking, and reigning there, cauſing his Light to ſhine from thence round about the Earth, as from his holy City, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his holy Hill of Sion.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe Diſciples or Miniſters whom he choſe to raiſe up this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed unto him, he made fit and able to miniſter his New Covenant, by which it was to be raiſed: yea he furniſhed them with ſuch a power of his Spirit, that they were able through him to miniſter, not in the Letter (as the old Covenant was miniſtred, which left the people ſtill dead: nay, becauſe of the tranſgreſſing nature, made the offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and ſo encreaſed death upon them) but in the quickning ſpirit, which raiſeth from death, and bringeth into the light of the living, to walk with the living God towards the land of Eternal reſt and peace. So that that which they miniſtred was spirit, and that which they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to, was ſpiritual. By the power of the ſpirit, in preaching the living Word of Faith, they reached through the vail to that which lay in death, they ſtirred up a living Principle, and miniſtred life to it through the ſpirit, <hi>Gal. 3.5.</hi> and ſuch as were born of this living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, they taught to live in the ſpirit, to walk in the ſpirit, to be made perfect by the ſpirit, and not to run back to the Miniſtration of the Letter (as was proper for the Jews in their day) after the manner of the former diſpenſation, but to keep in the living Principle, to grow up
<pb facs="tcp:108881:3"/>
in the Seed, into the eternal life and immortality of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Mark well, (O ye Chriſtians, who deſire eternal life) the different way of Miniſtration between the Law and Goſpel. The Law was a Miniſtration of the Letter, in which they were to wait for aſſiſtance from the Spirit, by which they might be kept in the faith of, and be made obedient to the Law, <hi>Nehem. 9.20.</hi> The Goſpel is a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, wherein they are to begin with the ſpirit, and to go on with the ſpirit; not to gather outward Rules out of the Letter, from what is written or ſpoken, but to keep to the living Principle, and feel refreſhment to that, in reading or hearing what is written or ſpoken by the Spirit. And thus the Scriptures being read, or any one ſpeaking from God being heard, it is mingled with faith, and becomes profitable, feeding and refreſhing the young tender plant, the living Principle, and cauſing it to grow up into God: whereas whatever is underſtood, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or held out of this, feeds but the earthly, and doth but thicken the vail over the living Seed, to which the Kingdom belongs, and to which the Goſpel is ſent to be preached to raiſe it, that it might live, and thrive, and grow up into its ſtature, that ſo it might inherit.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, ſaid <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> Mat. <hi>3.2.</hi> It is come unto you, ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 12.28.</hi> that Power of Life which was made manifeſt in him, was it: and this Kingdom is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo within you, ſaith Chriſt to the Phariſees, <hi>Luk. 17.21.</hi> The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees demanded of him when the Kingdom of God ſhould come? It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, ſaith he, with outward ſhew or obſervation, it cometh not that way you look for it, to wit, by the manifeſtation of an outward glorious King, to reign outwardly in the Common-wealth of the outward Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: but the Kingdom is within you. How was it within them? Chriſt explains to them in another place, it was in them like a Grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-Seed; it was the leaſt of all the Seeds in their hearts. There were many great ſeeds of darkneſs there, but yet there was alſo one little Seed of Light. It was there, as well as the reſt (though leſs then them all) and did ſometimes caſt ſome glimmerings of light, and of its ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the darkneſs, though the darkneſs could not comprehend it. This Seed was alſo likened to leaven, which being received by faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lump, would leaven the whole lump, and bring it into the ſavor and Dominion of the Kingdom. Now the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles was to turn men from Satan's Kingdom to this Kingdom, from his large compaſs of Dominion in the heart, to this narrow Seed; from his great
<pb facs="tcp:108881:3"/>
Territories of darkneſs, to this little Principle of Light; from his great Power of Death, to this little weak Thing of God, wherein the Eternal Power and God-head is made manifeſt, as this comes to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and encreaſed by the Spirit. Here light is ſown for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and joy for the upright in heart; where it is to grow up, and from whence it is to be reaped after its growth to perfection.</p>
            <p>Oh how long have Chriſtians (ſo called) wanted the Spirit! How have they wearyed themſelves, in running to and fro about the Letter, to find out the mind of God, and are ſtill unſatisfied concerning it, and even drowned in fleſhly imaginations and contentions about it! They ſeek to have that ſatisfied, which is not to be ſatisfied: They ſeek to have that know, which is not to know: they offer to God the ſervice, faith, and obedience of that, which he will not accept; &amp; keep that from him which he calls for. They ſeek for the Spirit in the Letter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of the Law; but wait not to feel it in the Seed, quickening the Seed, raiſing up the Seed, and dwelling in the Seed, whither Chriſt and his Apoſtles directed to wait for it. They looke for that knowledge, that faith, that life, that ſpirit from words written, which the Apoſtle preached was to be waited for from the word in the heart. And by this means they raiſe up ſeveral buildings, and get va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of knowledge, each according to his underſtanding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Letter, every ſort being very confident concerning their own apprehenſions that they are the right: And thus they wander from the City of the living God, and from the living knowledge, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up Images, ſome outwardly, ſome in their minds; ſome more groſs, ſome more refined; but all more or leſs who are not acquainted with the living knowledge and truths of God, but have gathered apprehenſions with the wrong tool from the Letter, have ſet up ſomewhat elſe inſtead of the true Life and Power. (The knowledge of the true God, which is life eternal) the knowledge of the true Chriſt (whom no man can indeed call Lord, but by the ſpirit) the knowledge of the everlaſting Gospel (which alone is read in the ſpirit) the knowledge of the ſpirit (which alone is read in the Seed) theſe are ſtrange things to the ſeveral genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Chriſtians of this age, who commonly know no more of them, then according to the apprehenſions they have taken in concerning them, even from that wiſdom and underſtanding which hath not a capacity in it to receive them, but muſt be deſtroyed before theſe things can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood aright, <hi>1 Cor. 1.19.</hi> O that ye could read in the eternal light of life! O Chriſtians, Chriſtians, O that ye could ſee how your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and knowledge from the Letter ſtand as much in your way,
<pb facs="tcp:108881:4"/>
as ever the <hi>Jews</hi> did in theirs, and muſt be broken down as flat as ever theirs was, before the foundation of the Kingdom can be laid, and the building of eternal life reared up in your hearts. Be not offended at my zeal for the Lord my God, and for your ſouls. It hath coſt me very dear, what I teſtifie to you in the ſimplicity and integrity of my heart; and this I know to be moſt certainly true, that that ſpirit of man which without the leadings of the eternal Light, hath neſtled it ſelf in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> got a ſeat of wiſdom and knowledge there, raiſed up a building from thence, either of inward or outward Worſhip, will be diſſetled &amp; driven thence, even by that very ſpirit which gave forth the Letter. And when this is done, and God's ſpirit again openeth the Letter, O how ſweet, how profitable, how clear, how refreſhing will it be, being read in the light of the ſpirit, &amp; in the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus, which is begotten in the heart by the word of Faith, which is nigh there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From that light, from that ſpring (as the Lord pleaſed to open, enlarge and fill the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel) all the words of the holy men of God came; and in that alone they have their ſweetneſs, freſhneſs, vertue and fulneſs: but how to read the words outwardly written, keeping to that, and underſtanding them in that (and how to keep out the natural man with his natural underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which knoweth not the things of the Spirit, nor can know or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, <hi>1 Cor. 2.14.</hi>) is a myſtery to them who have not been tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inwards to this word, nor have known or heard his voice. The Lord is recovering the Myſterie of Life: and as that appears, the Myſterie of Death under all its paint (under all its painted Faith, painted Love, painted Knowledge, painted Obedience, painted Duties, Ordinances, and Worſhip) will be made manifeſt. Happy is he, whoſe inward Building will ſtand, whoſe Gold will abide the fire and everlaſting Burnings of the jealous God, whoſe Eye-ſalve was bought of the true spirit, whoſe raiment is right spun: but exceeding hard wil it go with that man, whom the Lord (when he cometh to ſearch him) ſhall not find a right inward <hi>Jew,</hi> as he took himſelf to be, nor truly circumciſed by the Lords eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit with the light thereof; but onely by ſuch a circumciſing knife as he himſelf had formed out of the letter of the Scriptures. This is the great miſery of Chriſtians, the vail lies over their hearts, even the ſame vail which covered the Letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the <hi>Jews;</hi> and they are groping after the mind of God in the Letter, but the life is hid from them, even as it was from the <hi>Jews:</hi> &amp; becauſe they alſo ſay they ſee, &amp; that they have the life &amp; the spirit, therefore the vail remains, &amp; the caul of iniquity ſurrounds them, ſo that they cannot ſee into that which makes free from it, but remain yet in captivity and bondage to the Enemy.</p>

            <p>Query 1. <hi>WHether the Fourth Commandement, expreſt,</hi> Exod. 20. <hi>be not morall and perpetuall, as well as the other nine be, yea or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That Covenant, which God made with the Jews at mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> when they came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was not to be perpetuall, but to make way for that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Prieſthood, Law-giver and Law which was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall. That Law, ſo given forth, made nothing perfect, but was a continuall hand-writing of Ordinances againſt the Jews, and the very Salvation of the Jews was by another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and by the Laws thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30 11. By which Covenant and by which Law they might be made perfect, and come to the better hope. Which other Covenant is the Covenant of Grace, or the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, or the Word which is nigh in the mouth and in the heart, and ſpeaks Life to them that can hear and believe the joyfull ſound of it.</p>
            <p>Now that this former Covenant was not to abide, but to give place to the other, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Which treateth of the New Covenant. For God's ſpeaking of a New Covenant, importeth that he himſelf hath made the firſt Old, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. It had had a long continuance among that people of the Jews; but now againſt the coming of Chriſt, who was to be Mediator of a better Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 6. even of a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108881:5"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 8. as it had been long decaying and waxing Old, So now it was ready to vaniſh away, as <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>And indeed it was neceſſary it ſhould paſs away, for it was not faultleſs. <hi>How not faultleſs? was there any ſin in the Holy Law &amp; Miniſtration of God by Moſes? can there any juſt blame be found in any thing that proceeded from the Lord?</hi> Nay ſurely, the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> was holy and without blame: but it was weak through the fleſh, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.) and therefore God would lay that aſide, ſo far as it was weak, and ſuited to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a fleſhly people, and bring inſtead thereof a miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law in the Spirit, which ſhould be lively, and powerfull, and effectuall in the Spirits of his people.</p>
            <p>That which God aimed at in a Covenant, was to keep him and his people together: Now this Covenant was weak on the peoples part, they continued not in it, and ſo, according to that Covenant, God diſ-regarded them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Now God finding this Covenant not able to effect his purpoſe of Love towards his people, he finds fault with it, bringing forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother or ſecond, which this gives place to, <hi>v.</hi> 7. And this other Covenant, or New Covenant is not according to that. <hi>How not according to that?</hi> Why thus: It was not written out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, as that was: <hi>Not according to that which I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>For I will put my Laws in their mind, and write them in their hearts,</hi> ver. 10. And here they ſhall learn the knowledge of God every one from the leaſt to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>So that all the Children of this Covenant ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> and learn the Law from his mouth; not as it was given at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> (which miniſtration was to the children of the Old Covenant) but as it goes forth out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and from the <hi>Jeruſalem which is above,</hi> which is the mother of all the children of this Covenant, and nouriſheth them not with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but with the milk of her own breaſts.</p>
            <p>Now if any think to reſtrain this to the types and ſhadows of the Law, they therein err: for the main Covenant was the Law of Commandements, which they ſtill broke, worſhipping
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108881:5"/>
other Gods, making Images and likeneſſes, taking his Name in vain, prophaning his Sabbaths, and ſo of the reſt. It is true, <hi>The firſt Covenant had a worldly Sanctuary, a Tabernacle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Candlestick, &amp;c.</hi> But the chief matter of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was the ten words, therefore the Tables wherein it was written were called the Tables of the Covenant, or the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wherein the Covenant was contained, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. Yea the ten words are expreſly called the Covenant it ſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. Obſerve therefore diligently theſe few things following in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ten Commandements, given by <hi>Moſes</hi> from mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> was the Covenant which God made with the Jevvs, when he took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That Covenant God found fault vvith, becauſe it was not able (through the weakneſs of the fleſh in their parts) to keep them to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Againſt Chriſt's coming God provideth a New Covenant, a better Covenant for him to be Mediator of, which Covenant was not outvvard like the former, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard, put in the mind, vvrit in the heart. As the people was invvard, the Sanctury inward, the Ark invvard, The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Covenant invvard, ſo the Covenant it ſelf and the Writing of it was invvard alſo. And this Covenant, as it is onely written in the Spirit, and in that which is Spirituall; So it cannot be read in the Letter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That where-ever this New Covenant cometh, the other waxeth old, whether to a Perſon or People. Where ever the Lavv of the Spirit of Life is made manifeſt, the Law of the Letter is ſvvallovved up in it, and is knovvn no more, but as it is comprehended, appeareth and is brought forth in it. And he that is in the Spirit, and hath received the Law of Life from the Spirit, knovveth not Chriſt after the fleſh, hovv much leſs <hi>Moſes</hi>? but taking the vvhole miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Spirit, not onely the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but all the Sacrifices and other types alſo, here they are ovvned and received, even in Chriſt the ſubſtance: but the ten Commandements, ſo far as they vvere a ſhadovv, paſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108881:6"/>
avvay before the Son of Righteouſneſs, as vvell as the other types and ſhadovvs of the Lavv.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. But was there any thing of the ten words a ſhadow? Do they not all command abiding things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Moſes</hi> his whole Miniſtration (as it ſtood in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without) was but a ſhadow of the fulneſs and perfection of that Miniſtry of the Spirit, which was to come, and to be ſet up by the Son in his houſe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Moſes</hi> his people but a ſhadow of the ſpiritual people, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prieſts and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but a ſhadow of the ſpiritual Prieſts and Sacrifices. <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law in the letter miniſtred from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but a ſhadow of Chriſts law in the ſpirit to be miniſtred from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11.) The Law it ſelf which was given by him, but a ſhadow of the grace and truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. of whoſe fulneſs every believer receives a portion of the ſame Grace, <hi>even Grace for Grace,</hi> v. 16. which <hi>Grace</hi> is to be his Teacher, both of what he ſhould deny and turn from, and how he ſhould live and carry himſelf both towards God and man, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. Look particularly on the Commandments, and ſee if there will not appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a ſhadow in them.</p>
            <p>The firſt commandment to that people, <hi>That they ſhould have none other Gods</hi> (like the heathen) <hi>but him onely whoſe powerful Arm had brought them out of Aegypt,</hi> This is a ſhadow of the ſubjection of the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſingly in ſpirit, to the Lord of ſpirits, who by his mighty arm redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out of ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Now muſt they bow to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lords no more, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13.) as they did bow in the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (oh, who can read this!) but bow alone at the Name of Jeſus, and be ſubject to the arm of his power in their ſpirits alone for ever.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Commandment, <hi>That they ſhould not make any Images or likeneſſes of things in Heaven or Earth, or bow down to them,</hi> is a ſhadow of what God requires of ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the inward, where all likeneſſes, inventions, imitations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of what they have ſeen in the ſpirit above, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in the earthly nature, they muſt not make themſelves, nor bow to ſuch as any others make.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108881:6"/>And they muſt not <hi>take the Name</hi> (of the Lord their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer) <hi>in vain,</hi> pretending to the living Power, when it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts not it ſelf in them, pretending to meet in the living Name, and to worſhip in the ſpirit, when they are gone a whoring from it, and become ſtrangers to it. What ſhould I mention any more? It is eaſie to obſerve, how the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments were ſhadows of the inward innocency and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the believer receives inwardly into his heart, from the powerful operation of the law of the Spirit of life in him.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But may any of theſe Laws be broken? if they may not be broken, then they are perpetual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The reaſon why they may not be broken, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the diſpenſation of them is ſtill in force, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diſpenſation of the law of the ſpirit, comprehends all the righteouſneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law: and the end of Chriſts diſſolving that Covenant, was not that any man might have liberty to do any thing which is there manifeſted to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous; but that the righteouſneſs of it might be fulfilled in them who receive his law in the ſpirit, which never could be fulfilled by receiving of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law in the letter, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.4. And mark this diligently, ye that have been exerciſed in ſpirit towards God, The law of ſin is nearer to us, then any law of the letter can come; the covenant of Death and Hell (with the laws thereof) are written within by the finger of Satan; and that which blots them out muſt be as near, even an inward covenant, an inward writing from the Eternal Word in the heart, by the law of his Eternal Spirit of life.</p>
            <p>This then is my <hi>Anſwer; Moſes</hi> his law in ſubſtance remains, as it is taken in by Chriſt and adminiſtred by him in ſpirit; but not as it was given in the letter to the <hi>Jews</hi>; for ſo it was a ſhadow, making nothing perfect, but making way for the better hope, for the Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, for the inward law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; which effects that in the ſpirits of his people, which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his law could by no means do.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is the ſubſtance of the law which abides?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108881:7"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſubſtance of the law is <hi>Love</hi>: To love God above all (above all without, above all within) and to love one's Neighbor as ones ſelf. To receive this love from God, and to bring it forth in his ſpirit; this is the ſubſtance of the law, this is the thing which the law drove at in a ſhadow. The law is fulfilled in this one word <hi>Love</hi>: but that love muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God which fulfils the law. A man may ſtrive to love abundantly, and ſtrive to obey in love, and yet fall ſhort of the covenant; but the Lord muſt circumciſe the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that love can ſpring up, which fulfils the law, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 30 6.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not the Apoſtle Paul ſay,</hi> That by the law is the knowledge of ſin, and that he had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet; <hi>plainly referring to the tenth Commandment, which ſaith,</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the law outwardly was the knowledge of ſin out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the people of the <hi>Jews</hi>; by the law inwardly is the knowledge of ſin inwardly to the ſpirits of Diſciples. Now a little conſider and wait on the Lord to know, what admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the law it was that <hi>Paul</hi> knew ſin by: whether it was by <hi>Moſes</hi> his adminiſtration of the law in the letter, or by Chriſt's Miniſtration of his law to him in the ſpirit? It is rendred in our laſt Tranſlation, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet</hi>: but it might more properly be rendred, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt</hi>: For if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be properly rendered <hi>Luſt,</hi> then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may as properly be rendred, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> And he that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the adminiſtration of the law in the Spirit, knoweth it thus to iſſue forth from the Word of life, into his Spirit. It diſcovers the luſts and affections of the fleſh, which draw from the yoke and ſubjection to the ſpirit; and then by a command from the living ſpirit, it hedgeth up the way after the other lovers, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> And as the law of the fleſh ariſeth, kindling deſires after vanity, and after fleſhly eaſe and delight: ſo the law of the ſpirit ariſes in the inner man, forbidding, pricking, ſtopping, and limiting that which would be at liberty out of the life and purity of the holy law. And here begin the bitter fights, and terrible battels and conflicts between the two Seeds, wherein all the powers of heaven, earth and hell are engaged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108881:7"/>Now becauſe this interpretation of <hi>Paul's</hi> words may ſeem ſtrange and uncouth, to perſons who have drunk in another apprehenſion, and have taken it for granted that <hi>Paul</hi> there refers to the tenth commandment; conſider the place yet further, and perhaps the Lord may pleaſe to open it to you from the very Letter, even as he hath opened it to others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his Spirit, by cauſing them to feel the thing which <hi>Paul</hi> felt, and to receive the Law as he received it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſeventh of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeakes of three ſtates vvhich he had known.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a ſtate of life before the law; <hi>I was alive without the law once, v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a ſtate of death after the commandment came; <hi>Then ſin revived and he dyed.</hi> When the Word of Life came with its living commandment, to ſet upon ſin indeed, then ſinne would dally no longer, it would no longer lye as dead, and let <hi>Paul</hi> live in his Zeal and Worſhip as he had done before; but it ſlew him, it ſhewed its power in him, ſometimes decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, and ſometimes forcing him from that which was holy, ſpiritual, juſt and good, and to that which was unholy, inſomuch as he did do what he hated, and could not do what he loved; and found himſelf a wretched man, and in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable captivity, becauſe of the body of death, and the law of ſin in his members, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> A ſtate of life, after the commandment had done its Work in throughly ſlaying of him. When that was removed which the law came againſt then, then he was marryed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother husband, then he could bring forth fruit unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. then he could walk freely with God, not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, <hi>ch.</hi> 8.4. and rejoice in the life, and the peace, inſtead of roaring out becauſe of the death, which came from the carnal mind, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Now when was the time when <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>alive without the Law?</hi> Was it not when he was righteous, when he was whole? then he had no need of the Phiſician, then he had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Wound, even the terrible Wound which Chriſt then gives the ſoul when he calleth to it by his ſpirit, and giveth forth the commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt.</hi> When he had <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108881:8"/>
in the fleſh,</hi> being circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as touching the Law a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> concerning Zeal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Church; touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law blameleſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. Here was a living man: and his exact receiving the Miniſtration of the Law in the letter, was part of his life: yea but he had not received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment yet that ſlew him. <hi>Paul</hi> was alive yet, and could flouriſh in the freſhneſs of his life, zeal, and abundant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge under this adminiſtration of the Law. But when God, who cauſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhined in his heart, when God begun the Work of the new Creation in him by his living light, when the commandment came freſh from the Spirit (the commandment which was ordained to life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. which the Miniſtration of the Law in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not, no not to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but another, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14, 15.) then <hi>Paul</hi> began to feel the ſting of death, and the Power of ſin, which now aroſe up in its ſtrength to retain one of its ſubjects, and to keep the ſtronger man then he, from diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing him, if he could. And now, how was poor <hi>Paul</hi> rent and torn, and harraſed by the Enemy, and made to ſee and feel his miſerable captivity, until he had paſſed through the death, and was redeemed from under ſin, and conſequently from under this bitter Miniſtration of the Spirit, by his holy, pure, and ſevere Law againſt ſin! for the man being dead, the law hath no force againſt the Seed, nor againſt that which is one with, and lives in the Seed: And this is it he ſpeaks to the <hi>Romans</hi> concerning, who alſo were acquainted with this Miniſtration of the law, as <hi>v.</hi> 1. of this ſeventh chap. Now is it not very manifeſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew not ſin ſpiritually by the Miniſtration of the law in the letter, but was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, until he felt the Miniſtry of it from Chriſt in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? and that ſoon ſtruck at his life, and by degrees ſlew it, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the body of ſin in him, with its members, and ſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him for the marriage to another Husband.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But by this then, a man is not only freed from the Law of the letter, but alſo from the law of the ſpirit: for if this law be miniſtred to him til death paſs upon him, &amp; til he be married to Chriſt; then after
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108881:8"/>
death is paſſed upon him, and he is baptized into death and riſen with Chriſt, and married to him, then this Law paſſeth away likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a double miniſtration of the Law of the Spirit: a ſharp miniſtration againſt ſin, and a ſweet mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the renewed ſpirit. The miniſtration againſt ſin paſſeth away, as the ſin is wrought out: but then the ſweet Spirituall current and law of its holy and pure life in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Spirit, is more vigorous and full. So that the law of the Spirit remaineth for ever, but its convictions, its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, its chaſtiſements towards the worldly part, diminiſh and paſs away, as the worldly part is waſted: and its ſweet comforting preſence, pure peace, freſh joy and life increaſe, as the new man grows and flouriſhes.</p>

                  </gap> of that fourth precept, be not to perſwade us to lay by the works of our calling one day in ſeven, that we may on that day wholly give up our ſelves to wait on the Lord, in the performance of duties of piety and mercy, for our attaining of, and growing in ſanctificaion and holineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſcope and drift of the fourth Commandement was to injoin the Jews to keep the Sabbath ſtrictly as a ſign, by forbearing all works, and ſanctifying it as a day of reſt to the Lord, according to the law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12. But the ſubſtance being come (Chriſt, who is the body, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17.) the day and reſt of the Spirit being known, the ſign is at an end, and the thing ſignifyed taketh place. So that the reſt is now in Chriſt, through the Faith, by his Spirit, where the worſhip is. And this in the Goſpel comprehends the time of worſhip, the place of worſhip, and the worſhip it ſelf (which are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual) where in ſubſtance all is known, injoyed and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which was figured out in ſhadows under the law. The ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification being come, the reſt being come, the Lord of the Sabbath being come, ſhall not the ſign of the ſanctification, the ſign of the reſt, (which reſt the Lord of the Sabbath was to give, &amp; lead the Spirits of his people into) paſs away? <hi>Ex</hi> 31.13</p>
            <p>Quer. 3. <hi>Whether the fourth precept, do not as ſtrictly bind us to keep holy the ſeventh day, of or from the creation, as it bindeth us to the obſervation of a ſeventh Day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw,</hi> The fourth Commandement did not require the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108881:9"/>
of a ſeventh Day in general, but of the ſeventh day in particular, of thoſe of whom it required it: for what the law required, it required of thoſe who were under the law, and not of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Quer. 4. <hi>If the ſeventh days Sabbath, be not morall and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then how comes it to paſs that it was inſtituted, or appointed from the firſt Creation, when man by guilt ſtood in no need of a Saviour, nor yet of ſuch a ceremony, Gen.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it was inſtituted or appointed from the firſt Creation, or that God intended to require of man the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it had he abided in innocency, is not manifeſt in the Scriptures: but that God did then bleſs and ſanctifie it (in relation to the ſervice he had for it) that is expreſſed in Scripture; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. And that this was one end for which he did ſanctifie it, namely that it might be for a ſign unto that people of the Jews (which was the people he choſe to ſet up his ſigns and figures of the inviſible things among) the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alſo teſtifies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20 11. But what further meaning there is in it, and what relation it hath to all the redeemed of the Lord, in whom, God brings about the New Creation, with the reſt thereof, (as he did the old) it is better to wait to know and feel in the Spirit, then to be prying into with the curious, ſearching, fleſhly underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Quer. 5. <hi>If the ſeventh days Sabbath be not morall, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to Jews and Gentiles: then how comes it to paſs that it was given to all men in</hi> Adam, <hi>when there was no difference between Jew and Gentile? and was obſerved by command from the beginning, as appears by comparing together, Gen.</hi> 2.3. <hi>and Exod.</hi> 16.18. <hi>to</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, or to all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> I do not find, nor do theſe places quoted make it manifeſt. But its being practiſed before the giving of the law, doth not prove its perpetuity, or that it was not given for a ſign: for circumciſion was inſtituted and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long before the giving of the law, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 17.) &amp; ſacrificing long before that, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.) both which were ſigns of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and not perpetuall, as to the outward obſervation of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108881:9"/>Quer. 6. <hi>If when our Lord Jeſus ſaith,</hi> Mat. 5.18. <hi>that till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or tittle ſhould in no wiſe paſs from the law. If he there meant not the law of the ten Commandements, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in</hi> Exod. 20. <hi>then what law did he mean</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the law is meant the whole miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as by the Prophets, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. the whole miniſtration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: and that it is not to be reſtrained to the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, is manifeſt by the inſtances which Chriſt gives, more of which relate to other parts of the law, then to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: for there are but two inſtances out of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but there are four inſtances out of other parts of the law, as may be ſeen, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 33, 38. and 43. of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that Chriſt doth not onely take in the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he takes in the reſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtry in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not one jot or tittle whereof is to paſs, till it be all fulfilled; but was to ſtand in the letter to the Jews its full ſeaſon, and then in the Spirit till all be finiſhed there alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill John,</hi> from that time the Kingdom of God began to be preached, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. and both the law, Prophets, and <hi>John</hi> himſelf were to decreaſe and Chriſt and his Kingdom to increaſe. Chriſt in this 5 of <hi>Matth.</hi> had been preaching the Kingdom, declaring to whom it appertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the bleſſedneſs of ſuch: Now this his manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might ſeem to derogate from the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from the Prophets, whoſe doctrine and diſpenſation hereby he might ſeem to deſtroy. But Chriſt taketh away the occaſion of ſuch a miſ-apprehenſion, bidding them not think he came to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; for he was not come for that end, but to fulfill. Wherein he doth theſe two things,</p>
            <p>Firſt, he eſtabliſheth that miniſtration of the law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for its ſeaſon, till it ſhould be fulfilled by him the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who was to fulfill all the righteouſneſs of it. It ſhould laſt out its whole day, and ſhould not fail in the leaſt tittle of it (as he himſelf explaineth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.17.) til the heaven and earth of the Jews paſſed away, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.27.28.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He taketh in the ſubſtance of it into his own mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and layeth it more inwardly, and cloſely, and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Spirits of his Diſciples, then <hi>Moſes</hi> had done in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108881:10"/>
letter upon his Diſciples. But he doth not give it out in full, but onely giveth a taſt to his Diſciples how ſtraitly he would mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it to them by his Spirit, as they came under his yoke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. which yoke is his Spirit or the law thereof, as <hi>Moſes</hi> his yoke was the law of the Letter.</p>
            <p>Now mark yet further, Chriſt doth not give out the letter for his law, as it was delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi>: but requireth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his Diſciples, which comprehends the letter. As now when he adminiſters the law againſt revenge, from whence murther proceeds, he doth not ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kil,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid to them of old time, but ſaith, thou ſhalt not be angry without a cauſe, nor give thy brother any provoking language, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Nor does he ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery</hi>; but thou ſhalt not let out a luſtfull look, nor let in a luſtfull thought, <hi>v,</hi> 28. And had he ſpoken here about the Sabbath, would he have adminiſtred it in the letter, or would he have commanded the obſervation of the true Sabbath, where no work is done, no fire kindled (nor ſo much as any ſticks gathered to make a fire with) nor no burthen born; but the Man-ſervant, the Maid-ſervant, the Oxe, the Aſs, and every creature reſts in the ſeed. <hi>The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.</hi> It is true he ſubjected himſelf under the law, but yet he was ſtill Lord: and he maketh all his, Kings and Prieſts to God, who being once baptiſed into his death, know alſo his reſurrection and reign.</p>
            <p>Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect. <hi>But all the other Commandements are to be kept according to the letter; for although it ſhould prove ſo, that believers are not bound to obſerve them by vertue of</hi> Moſes's <hi>miniſtration in the letter, but by vertue of the miniſtration of the Spirit, yet the Commandements themſelves are kept: but take away the outward obſervation of the Sabbath, and this Commandement hath no fulfilling at all according to the letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ariſeth from the different nature of the thing: for the other Commandements require or forbid that which is either good or evill in its own nature; but this is but good or evill by inſtitution or command. To keep a Day, or not to keep a Day, is not good or evill in it ſelf, but as it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or forbidden, or left at liberty in the Lord, and according as it is done or forborn by him, who receiveth the command
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108881:10"/>
or prohibition, or is let into the liberty of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6 So that if the Nature of the thing required in this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had been alike with the nature of the things required or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the other Commandements, it would have been as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable after the diſſolution of that Covenant, as the other things therein contained were, which vaniſh not in themſelves upon the diſſolution of that Covenant, but only paſs into an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way of diſpenſation, where they retain their full vertue and ſtrength, even according to the letter, though not by vertue of the adminiſtration of the letter, another higher and fuller adminiſtration of a better Covenant challenging and taking its own place.</p>
            <p>Qu. 7. <hi>If the ſeventh Days Sabbath be not morall, but an abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated ceremony now ſince the death of Chriſt; then wherefore ſhould our Saviour inſtruct his beloved Apoſtles, that muſt inſtruct Chriſtian Churches to pray,</hi> Mat. 24.20. <hi>that they might not flie on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, knowing that their flight would fall out more then thirty yeares after his death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Great was the hardſhip the Jews under went in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by that apprehenſion of theirs that they ought not to do any work (not ſo much as of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) on the Sabbath, which hardſhip ſuch Diſciples of Chriſts among the Jews, as could not eaſily be drawn of from the law and Jewiſh obſervations, but ſtill were for circumciſion and keeping of an outward Sabbath, might be liable to: now Chriſt and the Apoſtles after him, were not haſty to draw them from ſuch things, but for a time bore with them therein, inſomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> and became to the Jews as a Jew and to them that were under the law as under the law him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo. But the ſtrength of the Query ſeems to lye in this, <hi>that it ſhould bear the name of Sabbath from Chriſt's own mouth, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſomewhat which ſhould happen on it more then thirty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhould ceaſe to be a Sabbath.</hi> To which my Anſwer is plain, that that may as well bear the name of Sabbath, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the Temple bear the name of the holy place, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. of the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple did as much ceaſe to be the holy place above thirty years after thoſe words were ſpoken, as the Jewiſh Sabbath could ceaſe to be the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108881:11"/>Now for the ſakes of ſuch as have been truly exerciſed in their ſpirits by the ſpirit of the Lord (and have felt the powerfull work of his grace, &amp; a building raiſed up by him) &amp; may yet be further exerciſed, I ſhall add this. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a type of an inward building in the Spirits of Gods people, both in its rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, in its ſcituation, in its ſtanding, in Gods dealing with it all the time of its ſtanding, and laſtly in its downfall and utter deſolation. There is an appearance and building of God in the Spirits of his People, which is to give way to, and be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in a fuller and higher appearance. But the fleſhly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, getting into this building, will not give way to the further and more inward &amp; ſpirituall appearance of the Spirit, but will have the firſt building ſtand as the building, and will entertain no further appearance of God, then as it can comprehend it, ſubject it, and afford it a place in the firſt building: Hereupon God diſtreſſeth <hi>Ariel,</hi> even the City which <hi>David</hi> built (ſaying within his heart, ſurely <hi>that which I have built will I break down,</hi> and <hi>that which I have planted will I pluck up,</hi> even <hi>this whole land</hi>: So he cauſeth the overflowing ſcourge to paſs, even over <hi>Thy whole land, O Immanuel</hi>) Now when the enemy enters within the holy City and within the holy Temple, it is time to fly, and exceeding great diſtreſs will befall that Diſciple, whoſe flight is either on the Winter or on the Sabbath day. Do not imagine at this, but if the Lord open it not at preſent, wait his ſeaſon: for the thing is true and ſealed, both by the openings of the Light eternall, and by ſenſible exerciſes and experiences from that Light.</p>
            <p>Thus I have anſwered ſuch of the Queries as concern the ſeventh days Sabbath. Such as ſeem to argue the unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of obſerving the firſt day of the week for a Sabbath, I leave to thoſe to whom they are tendred (and of whom an Anſwer ſeems ſo conſcienciouſly &amp; zealouſly deſired, as I do not ſee how it can be reaſonably neglected or denied) that by weighty evidence of Scripture he may be reduced, if he hath erred: but if not, but it be truth vvhich he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in held forth, the Lord may be honored in mens bovving and ſubjecting to every truth of his, by vvhat inſtruments ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it pleaſeth him to make it manifeſt.</p>

            <p>Query 1. <hi>IF the whole Law of Moſes, the Law of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as well as the Law of Sacrifices, were both added upon one and the ſame account for tranſgreſſions; Then why doth the holy Spirit in the Scriptures lay forth ſuch an antiphitical uſe of them</hi> (I ſuppoſe he means anti-tipical) <hi>the one that ſin might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> Rom. 5.20. <hi>the other ſacrificing for ſin</hi>? Heb. 9.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Lavv of <hi>Moſes</hi> vvas added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, is manifeſt from that Scripture quoted by me in my Epiſtle, as vvel as from other Scriptures: and one end, vvhy it vvas added in relation to tranſgreſſion vvas, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence might <hi>abound,</hi> vvhich vvould make the Sacrifice or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for ſin appear more neceſſary and more acceptable. And the ſacrifices alſo relate to the ſinner, ſome referring to the ſin committed, others to the thankfulneſs and acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement due for the peace, mercy and bleſſings of God tovvards his poor, ſinful, erring creatures; both vvhich vvere to laſt till the time of reformation from the ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. (But that they vvere both added <hi>upon one and the ſame account,</hi> that I did not affirm, that is vvrongfully put upon me.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108881:12"/>Now though both theſe were added becauſe of tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they had not both the ſame uſe and ſervice in relation to tranſgreſſion, but the one was added to diſcover ſin, and to make it appear exceeding ſinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. the other to blot it out, to take it away, to make atonement for it, which the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did, making the ſinner upright and perfect as relating to that outward ſtate and capacity, though they could not as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9.</p>
            <p>Qu. 2. <hi>If the whole Law, the ten Commandments as well as the Sacrifices, were repreſentations, figures, or ſhadows of ſomewhat rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Chriſt the Seed: Then what did they in general, or either of them in particular repreſent, figure, or ſhadow forth, before they were written in Tables of ſtone, or ſince they were written in Tables of ſtone, more of Chriſt then, then now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the ten Words were ſome of the Precepts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and appertaining to the firſt Teſtament or Covenant, all which Precepts were ſprinkled with blood, cannot be denied: And the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the Precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law, which were ſprinkled with the blood of the Sacrifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. from the Precepts of Chriſt which he writes in other Tables, ch. 10.16. which alſo are ſprinkled with blood, but not with the blood of Bulls and Goats, but with his own blood: and he that receives any of theſe Precepts out of the blood of Chriſt, cannot truly and ſpiritually obey them, though he may ſtrive much to form his ſpirit into the obedience thereof. Now the time and ſeaſon of their ſignification, was the time which God allotted them under the Law, wherein was the uſe of ſigns: but the Goſpel is a ſtate of ſubſtance, of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life and immortality into the heart, and into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of believers, which the ſtate of the Law ſhadowed. So that they are not ſigns ſince the Goſpel, ſince Chriſt put an end to the Law-ſigns, ſhadows and figures, not yet before the Law to Believers, ſo far as they were in the New Covenant: (For as the thing ſignified cometh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that which ſignifieth it paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) though that was a mixed ſtate, wherein God gave a taſte of both Covenants, before his perfect diſpenſing or bringing forth of either.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:108881:12"/>Qu. 3. <hi>If the whole diſpenſation of the Law was given to the Jews, and not to the Gentiles, and ſo the Gentiles not bound to that Law, but another way for them to know the mind of God Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Law cited</hi> Rom 2 15. <hi>which the Gentiles ſhewed (the work of in their hearts) be another Law contrary to that Law that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Jews, even the ten Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Law which is the ſubſtance, is not contrary to the Law which is the ſhadow, but is the comprehending and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. The Law in the Spirit (written by God's power and preſence in the heart and mind) is not contrary to the Law in the letter, but is an higher and more glorious Miniſtration of it. The one commandment which God gave by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 30.11. which was the commandment of life and death, as relating to their inward and eternal ſtate, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ten commandments, which God had commanded them before by another covenant, which he had made vvith them as an outward people, and which was to be their Rule as to their outward ſtate: for they were choſen by God to be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people outwardly, and ſo an outward Rule of holineſs and obedience was preſcribed them: but by all their obedience thereto, they could not be juſtified, but only by hearing, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and obeying Chriſt the Word nigh in the heart, and by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſpirit the blood of that one offering.</p>
            <p>Qu. 4. <hi>If the Gentiles were not bound (under that Law that the Jews were) which carryed the curſe with it: then which way have the Gentiles redemption by Jeſus Chriſt: ſeeing all that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, are redeemed from the Law and the Curſe thereof, Gal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.13:</p>
            <p>

               </gap>ſſed of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs of the holy Land, and ſtill met with Wrath and Judgements, and at laſt utter cutting off, as to their outward ſtate, and as to all their hope from that Covenant: ſo he that comes to receive the Miniſtration of the Law of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108881:13"/>
find the curſe as abundantly inwardly, even till that be cut down by the ſword of the Spirit, which the curſe is to, and that brought into dominion, to which is the promiſe and bleſſing. So that the Gentiles find as great need to be redeemed from the curſe inwardly, which the inward Law brings upon the tranſgreſſor, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did outwardly; yea and find a more heavy burthen and load then ever the <hi>Jews</hi> did outwardly. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the outward Adminiſtration of the Law, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the inward, he knew little of the curſe, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it blameleſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. but when he came to receive the living light of the ſpiritual Adminiſtration of it into his ſpirit, then he felt the burthen, and weight, and miſery of ſin and the curſe indeed, and cryed out, <hi>O wretched man, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi>!</p>
            <p>Qu. 5. <hi>If the duration of the diſpenſation of Moſes Law in the Letter was till Chriſt the Seed ſhould come and fulfil it, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law (ſo ſtated without diſtinction) between that that was perpetual, and that that was ceremonially vaniſhing, and ſo in the fulfilling of it beſides: Then what law or commandments that or they were, which while</hi> Moſes <hi>diſpenſation was in full force, is ſaid to be perpetually ſure to ſtand faſt for ever and for ever, as</hi> Pſal. 10.11.7, 8. <hi>and when Chriſt the Seed was come, and had fulfilled all that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had appointed him to do, was eſtabliſhed,</hi> Rom. 3.31. <hi>and not one jot or tittle of it to paſs ſo long as heaven and earth remain</hi>? Mat. 5.18. &amp; Luke 16 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That diſtinction between ſomething in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law being perpetual, and ſomething ceremonial, is not ſound and proper in this place: For all that was under <hi>Moſes</hi> law was but a ſhadow, as in that diſpenſation, and that Teſtament was dedicated with blood (with the blood which was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) which related to every precept, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18, 19. and it was all ſubſtantiall and perpetuall in what it ſignified and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to. The ſacrifices were ſubſtantiall in that Sacrifice which they ſignified, as well as the law and precepts were ſubſtantiall, in the law and precepts which they ſignified. And as the firſt Covenant pointed at a ſecond Covenant, ſo the laws of the firſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108881:13"/>
Covenant pointed at the law of the ſecond Covenant, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration whereof is from the Mediator of that Covenant, and they come into the heart ſprinkled with his blood. Now the law or Commandement, which even under that diſpenſation was to be perpetuall and laſt for ever, was <hi>the word in the heart,</hi> and the laws thereof, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. which <hi>Moſes</hi> by eſpeciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from God, and according to the tenor of an other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant directed the Jews to <hi>v.</hi> 4. For the law, as adminiſtred by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the letter is not perpetuall or eternall; but as it comes from the Spirit, and is adminiſtred in the Spirit, ſo it is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and eternall. That adminiſtration was fitted to that people: and (we knovv) the Lord, if he had pleaſed, could have given a fuller adminiſtration of his law in the letter then that was, as Chriſt plainly intimates divers times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. But if it had been never ſo full, yet the adminiſtration of it in the letter, is to give place to the adminiſtration of it in the Spirit: So that the adminiſtration of it in the letter is not perpetuall, but for the time which God allotted it: but the adminiſtration of it in the Spirit is eternal and perpetual, and there it remains an eternall Light, witneſs, and ſword againſt ſin and the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. And thus it is eſtabliſhed in the hands of the Spirit, after the ſeaſon of that miniſtration of it in the letter was ended; and thus not one jot or tittle of it was to paſs away, after the other miniſtration with every jot and tittle of it was ended.</p>
            <p>Qu. 6. <hi>If the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh: and his fulfilling all the righteouſneſs of the law: and being foretold by</hi> Moſes <hi>to be that Prophet, that was to be heard in all things which is not denyed by us: but if by theſe he put an end to the law of the ten Commandements and gave forth an other law to his houſe or family: Then what law that is. And whether it be contrary to that law that he with the Father gave forth as</hi> Deut. 33.2. <hi>with</hi> Pſal. 80.17. <hi>which now is in Goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration holy juſt good as</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>and Spirituall</hi> ver. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the law of the Spirit, or the Light of the Spirit in the heart, which diſcovers ſin (not only in the outward acts, but in its principle, riſe, firſt motions and inward nature) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth his living commands againſt it. This is the law now, in which the believer is to begin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. and according to which he is to go on to perfection. For as the believer is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108881:14"/>
of the Spirit, and born of the Spirit, ſo he is to receive the miniſtration of his law from the Spirit, and in the Spirit, Hee receives a gift of Faith, a meaſure of Faith from the eternall Spring of Life, and that's his Law. His law is <hi>the law of Faith.</hi> The Light of Life, which receives in the Faith, opens the mind and will of Chriſt to him in the Spirit, ſhewing him both ſin and alſo the things of God more fully, then the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could, though opened by the Spirit: for it is a fuller, a deeper kind of miniſtration; and ſo opens the things which it miniſters, more fully then a miniſtration of an inferiour nature can. Yet it is not contrary to <hi>Moſes</hi> law, but comprehends all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, all the righteouſneſs and equity of it, (as I ſaid before) which it, as a ſhadow, repreſented and commanded to that outward or ſhadowie people, the Jews. But the law which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. was the law of the Spirit, or ſuch a miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law as <hi>Paul</hi> knew not, all the while he was under the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law blameleſs: but this law found out ſufficient blame in him, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Qu. 7. <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt as he is the Son gave forth another law to his houſe or family: and that law contrary to that that the Father gave forth: then whether there is not two law-givers, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay there is but one,</hi> Jam. 4.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſubſtance, when it is ſhadowed out, or when it is nakedly diſpenſed, is one and the ſame thing; ſo that when ever it comes, it cannot be an other thing, then what the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow repreſented it to be. <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſpenſation and Chriſts are one in Spirit: and when he cometh in Spirit, he doth not deſtroy either <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, but comprehends them. So that the law is but one, although the diſpenſations of it have been various: but the proper diſpenſation of the law now to Chriſtians is Chriſt's diſpenſation, not <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſpenſation; &amp; Chriſtians are now to look for the Light and Knowledge of it, in the Tables where Chriſt writes it, according to his Covenant. So that there have not been two Laws given out, but the one Law of God hath been variouſly diſpenſed: in and according to the letter by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews, in and according to the Spirit by Chriſt to his Diſcipes.</p>

(Yet the Son of man is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath</hi>: and if he bid a man <hi>Take up his bed and walk,</hi> which was bearing a burthen and doing of work on the Sabbath day, it is no breach of the Sabbath.)

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:108881:16"/>Anſ. This Query is altogether from a miſtake; for it was not ſaid by me, That <hi>the keeping the Law of God acccording to the Letter, is a breaking of it in the ſpirit</hi>; but that he that <hi>runs back to the Law in the letter, to take up any command as hold forth in it, will be found a breaker thereof in ſpirit.</hi> And for this, the <hi>Jews</hi> in general, and <hi>Paul</hi> in particular may be my inſtances, who was exceeding ſtrict according to the Letter of the Law, but yet was a grievous breaker of it in ſpirit, and did not love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor as himſelf, but in a blind zeal was a bitter perſecutor: And if the <hi>Jews</hi> had taken that direction of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30.14. the obſervation of the law in the letter might have been more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to them. So that the turning towards, and receiving the Word in the heart, from whence the letter came, is the onely way to fulfll the letter; and the Law is not ſo much as to be known, much leſs fulfilled, by running to the letter of it in the firſt place. And this I certainly know, that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord of life, nor no keeping chaſt to him, but in the New-Covenant, and in the light of the Lord, as it is there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed: and till then, the mind cannot forbear making of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and falſe repreſentations of him to it ſelf, though being from the light of this Covenant, it cannot diſcern that it doth ſo, no more then <hi>Paul</hi> by the Letter of the Law could diſcern how he was a breaker thereof in his violent perſecutions.</p>
            <p>Qu. 15. <hi>Whether the Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt or the Apoſtles, their keeping the Law according to the letter: that they did do ſo, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, did break the law in the ſpirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Prophets were under the Law as to their outward ſtate, though inwardly not without feeling the vertue of the New-Covenant. Chriſt alſo was made under the Law, and took upon him the fulfilling of that diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might bring the believing <hi>Jews</hi> from under it, into the liberty of the Spirit, that they might receive the adoption of Sons, and the free Miniſtration which was appointed for the Sons, and might not be held under that Miniſtration of bondage, which was appointed for the ſervants. And the Apoſtle bids Believers to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free, not making themſelves debtors to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. for they were children of the promiſe, children of new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the

            <p>Qu. 16. <hi>If there be but one day of reſt holy to the Lord and all the Sabbaths of the law were but ſigns of it. that is ſaid to be the day of redemption: that the Lord hath made: Then whether that day be a day natural, one of the ſeven days of the week which either reſpect the Day on which our Redeemer ſuffered, or that on which he roſe again from the dead, or any other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As the Goſpel is not natural, but ſpiritual: ſo its day of reſt is not natural, but ſpiritual likewiſe. Yea I may add this alſo, the ſix days Work in the new Creation are not natural nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Qu. 17. <hi>If not ſo, but that it ſhould he intended applicable to the day or time of the Goſpel Adminiſtration from the time that Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh, unto the end of the world.</hi> Then whether <hi>this day that is intended as a Sabbath, is one with that day that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures intend and call a Sabbath, which Chriſt himſelf gave his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples charge to have reſpect unto in their flight, Matt.</hi> 24.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſuppoſition here put, demonſtrateth that thoſe that put it, have no acquaintance with the Goſpel-Sabbath, but propoſe another outward time for it, even the time from Chriſts ſuffering in the fleſh to the end of the World. Now if any ſhould ſo affirm, it were as juſtly to be excepted againſt, as preſſing the obſervation of the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which ſignifieth is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or natural, and ſignifieth to that part which is without: that which is ſignified, is inward and ſpiritual, and is known, entred into, kept and enjoyed in the ſpirit. It is a ſpiritual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, not a natural, which God hath inſtituted for his ſpiritual people, after he hath led them out of ſpiritual <hi>Aegyt,</hi> into the ſpiritual Wilderneſs, where he adminiſtreth to them the Law in the ſpirit, and teacheth them to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth.</p>
            <p>Qu. 18. <hi>If they intend one and the ſame Sabbath day, then how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible was it for the Diſciples of Chriſt to eſcape flying on that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, though never ſo fervent in prayer, in regard that this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſpoken of begun when Chriſt had ſuffered and put an end to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of</hi> Moſes <hi>Law: and the flight ſpoken of by Chriſt, which reſpect the Lords Sabbath, was not until many years after his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>

            <p>Qu. 19. <hi>If they intend not one and the ſame Sabbath day, then which are the Diſciples of Chriſt to have reſpect unto, whether that that Jeſus Chriſt injoined his Diſciples to have reſpect unto, or that that</hi> Iſaac Penington <hi>would injoyn the Diſciples of Chriſt to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpell-Sabbath begins not in the obſervation of outward time: but as it is Spirituall, ſo it hath a Spirituall beginning, increaſe, and perſecting, wherein there is a reſt to the Spirit from ſin and from the creaturely works, &amp; a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Spirit, even as on the outward Sabbath there was a bodily ceaſing from labours, and an outward worſhipping. And he that heareth the joyfull ſound of deliverance from ſin and ſelf-working, and entreth into the faith (beginning to ceaſe from his own works and working, and to wait in the Spirit on the power for its working in him) hath a taſt of the Goſpel-Sabbath, and beginneth to ſee that day, which the type pointed to and ends in.</p>
            <p>Qu. 21. <hi>If that that was miniſtred to</hi> Paul, Rom. 7. <hi>thou ſhalt keep the Sabbath or believe in the Light, follow the Light and the obſerving of either of theſe in the Spirit to be a keeping the whole Law.</hi> Then how <hi>are the Scriptures obſerved if the keeping of one Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement be a keeping the whole Law when the holy Spirit in Scriptures ſays that he that offends in one point is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I did not ſay, that the keeping of one Commandement is the keeping of the whole Law; but that the obſerving in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of any one of thoſe there mentioned by me, is the keeping of the Law: which was not barely ſaid, but demonſtrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no part of the Law can be broken, but every one of theſe muſt be broken. He that commits any ſin, breaks the Goſpel-Sabbath, which is a reſting from all ſin and ſelf-works; errs from the law of love received in the Spirit, which ſhuts out all enmity and tranſgreſſion both againſt God and man; departs from the fear, which keeps from departing from God by any iniquity; and enters into the luſt, which is the womb of ſin, out of the compaſs of which womb ſin cannot be conceived, much leſs committed. So that <hi>Paul,</hi> in that Law received from the Spirit, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Luſt,</hi> ſaw the whole body of ſin ſtruck at, whereas before, under the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the letter (according to which he ſaid he was blameleſs) there was not ſo much as the life of one ſin ſtruck at, but for all his exact an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of the Law according to that miniſtration, he was alive

ſtill. To decide this controverſie, let it be put to tryall, let any one ſingly wait on the Lord for the adminiſtration of his Law in the Spirit, and if the Lord give forth that Command to him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> in the clearneſs of the Light of his eternall Spirit, let him try, if continuing in obedience and ſubjection thereto, he can commit any one ſin whatſoever. I do not ſay, that a mans propoſing to himſelf that he will not luſt, or his ſtriving of himſelf to love and fear the Lord or his applying himſelf to keep the Sabbath or reſt from ſin to the Lord will do this. (Nay this is but an adminiſtration in the letter, and will prove weak againſt the inward ſtrength of the enemy) but receiving the Law in its pure living adminiſtration in the Spirit, and from the Spirit, here comes ſtrength againſt the enemy, which is too hard for him, while it is abode in. And this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were running backward towards the Law, and not forwards in the Spirit: He bids them <hi>Walk in the Spirit, Gal,</hi> 5.25. and ſo doing as they ſhould not be under the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. So neither ſhould they be breakers of the Law: for within thoſe bounds ſin enters not, but is kept out, not ſo much as a luſt againſt the Law being there known, much leſs any open tranſgreſſion againſt it: and againſt ſuch as thus keep within the bounds of the Spirit there is no Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.23. But againſt all that make themſelves debtors to the Law of the letter, there ſtands in force both the law of the letter &amp; of the Spirit alſo; &amp; they cannot in that ſtate be free from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and curſe thereof, whatſoever they may imagine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves, and their own ſtate, from a mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and mis-application of the Scriptures.</p>

He that believes, he that hath received the Spirit, is to have recourſe to the law of Faith,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108881:19"/>
and to the Spirit for his light or law: he who was under the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to have recourſe to the law of <hi>Moſes</hi>: for the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to them who were under it in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giving forth the precepts or commandements of that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to them who were under his Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20. And Chriſt ſpeaks to his family by his Spirit, whom his Diſciples are to hearken unto, and not to grieve him, or quench his motions, or deſpiſe his propheſyings, but give diligent heed thereto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the day dawn and the day-Star ariſe in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Now to obey in love, doth not make the diſtinction of the miniſtrations: for love belongeth to each miniſtration. The Jews in their day were to obey the law in love, and to have it in their hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5, 6. But this makes the difference, the Jews were to ſeek to the letter for it, the Diſciple is to receive it from the Spirit: for he is to begin in the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Jews beginning was in the letter. And this is obedience in the newneſs of the Spirit, when the law is received freſh from the Spirit, who both writes new things and brings to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance old things livingly and powerfully: but to go to <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtration and learn it there, and get it into the heart from thence, that's according to the old miniſtration or Covenant, which was given in the letter to the Jews; as may appear in that place laſt cited, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5.6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>That in the ſame ſpirit and love, that we have the Lord for our God, &amp;c. in the ſame we are to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Lord teacheth believers to know him to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God, &amp;c. by the Law of the Covenant of life in Chriſt Jeſus, which he miniſters to their Spirits in the Spirit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he teacheth them ſo clearly and effectually, that they need not run back to the Tables of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Covenant, from thence to teach one another to know the Lord, but they ſhall all know him from this teaching from the leaſt to the greateſt: yea, and I may add this, This Covenant by its miniſtration teacheth more clearly, then the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law in the letter could teach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. They that have been with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and have learned the Law of him, under the miniſtration of his Covenant, have yet need of coming to Chriſt: but they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108881:19"/>
that have been with Chriſt, and have learned the law of his Spirit, by the teachings of the new Covenant in their hearts, have not need of being ſent back to <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> pointeth forward to Chriſt, but Chriſt (even in the fleſh) ſendeth not his Diſciples from his own diſpenſation back to <hi>Moſes</hi> (though he alſo eſtabliſhed the diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> for its ſeaſon) but pointeth them forward to the Comforter, or to his appearance in the Spirit. And this is the mark of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which it is the intent of the letter to direct him to, and not for him to fix in the letter, as men have done ſince the Apoſtacy from the Spirit.</p>
               <p>This Argument is further inforced thus, becauſe <hi>he that ſaid the other, ſaid this, in the ſame Law and Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, he that ſaid the other by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews, ſaid this alſo to them, and they were ſtrictly bound thereto: but that which binds the Diſciple is the miniſtration of the new Covenant, where Chriſt writes this Law in the minds and ſpirits of his people, by which they are bound, and ſuch as as are out of that the Lord when he cometh to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them concerning their faith and obedience, will ſay to them, <hi>Who hath required this at your hands? Were ye children of the New Covenant? Did ye receive the Spirit? had ye a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith given you? were ye new creatures? Why did ye not keep to your rule? Why did ye not wait on the Spirit, and receive the Law from the New Jeruſalem, from whence it iſſues forth to the family of believers?</hi> The Jews were to be taught by precepts and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid yet further, <hi>So that if thou keepeſt the other, and not this, thou art a tranſgreſſor of the ROYAL LAW OF LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is the Royall Law? what is the Law of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Was the law as it was adminiſtred by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Royall Law? or is it the Royall Law as it is adminiſtred by the Son, who is the King of Saints, and writes his law in their hearts as their King? Again, was the law, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to the Jews, a law of Liberty, or a law of bondage? did not the miniſtration on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> gender to bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24? but in the miniſtration of the law by the Spirit
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108881:20"/>
is life and liberty, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. And this very law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf</hi> is Royall, and a law of pure liberty, and there is no bondage in it thus admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred: but let any man now read it in the letter, and ſtrive to obey it to the utmoſt he can, he ſhall find it weak through the fleſh, accuſing and in bondaging him. And this is the reaſon that Chriſtians ſo mourn in their prayers, even as perſons in bonds, becauſe they know not the Royall law of liberty, becauſe they feel not the love which the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, but ſtrive to get the letter into their hearts, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Commands in the letter with what love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they can come at; and this (through not ſeeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Covenant and miniſtry of Chriſt) they call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying in the Spirit. The teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. is the Spirit of prophecy, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.10. and his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come freſh from that Spirit of prophecy, which are to be taken heed to, till the day dawn and the day-ſtar ariſe, and then a fuller miniſtration is witneſſed then that of prophecy, even the ſhining and appearing of that which was propheſied of, which every believer is to wait for in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the Spirit, and in obedience to thoſe Commands, which come livingly into his heart from the Spirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>That the fourth Command is to be in love kept by all believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All the Commands of Chriſts Covenant are to be kept by believers, according as he pleaſeth to diſpence them, under his adminiſtration in the New Covenant: but the laws of the Old Covenant are not the laws of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as ſo diſpenſed, but only as they are comprehended in the righteouſneſs, which is taught and required by the ſpirit, which is fuller, ſtricter, and exacter, then that which the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> required.</p>
               <p>Nor do I hereby go about to teach any to break the leaſt of Chriſt's Commands, but the way to fulfill them, which is, by keeping to the certain knowledg and obedience of them, in that miniſtration, where Chriſt hath promiſed to diſpenſe and make them known to believers, which is, under the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108881:20"/>
of his own Covenant, writing them in their hearts and minds by his Spirit. And here the keeping of all Chriſts Commands is poſſible, yea this is the onely way to have the righteouſneſs of the Law fulfilled in us: for he that keeps the eye which the ſpirit hath opened in him, cloſe to the Spirit, ſhall not be able to break any law of righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs even of <hi>Moſes</hi> his law ſhall be fulfilled in him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the reſt of the Goſpel (as he is alſo the holy land) believing is the entring into this reſt: here's his Sabbath, and the keeping of it. Keep in the faith, the Goſpel reſt is kept. Parting with every luſt that he makes manifeſt, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every thing that this King calls for by his Spirit, and waiting for the further manifeſtation or ſhining of the Light of his Spirit in the heart, here's the obedience of the faith, and the holy and ſpirituall life and ſubjection of the living ſoul to its living King. Here's the beginning of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, his growth, his perfection. But as for times, places, perſons, &amp;c. theſe are of another nature, to another part, even to that part in man which is to be done away, as hee comes into the faith, and into the reſt. Let that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, whoſe habitation is out of the reaſoning part, feel and read me in that which is inviſible: for I do not make void the law by faith, or through publiſhing the miniſtry of the Spirit, but eſtabliſh it in its miniſtration in the Spirit to the Diſciples of Chriſt; who, keeping to the Spirit, cannot tranſgreſs the righteouſneſs of it, though they may there learn not to eſteem one day above another, but to eſteem every day no days having ever had any reall holineſs in them one above another, but only a figurative or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, which the ſubſtance, Chriſt and his Goſpel ſwallow up: for as his day dawns, thoſe things which were the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of it fly away.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Goſpell is a ſtate of ſubſtance, of fulfilling the types and ſhadows of the Law, by bringing believers into the poſſeſſion of that which they ſignified of. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type of Chriſt, who is the land of the living, in whom every believer hath an habitation at preſent, according to the proportion of his faith: and the Sabbath is the day of reſt, which every believer is to celebrate to Chriſt in this holy land, which he doth by believing and obeying his Spirit in the faith, which keepeth him out of the ſin, the unbelief, the unreſt. But that the Sabbath of the law the reſt thereof, which pointed to the faith, is ſtill to be held up in the times of the Goſpel, I know no Scripture which ſo teacheth, and I know ſomewhat which teacheth me otherwiſe. The day is dawned, bleſſed be the Lord God Almighty, the everlaſting day is dawned, and the ſhadows of the Law are flown away.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. It is ſaid, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>Speaks of three reſts, The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day or Sabbath reſt, Iſraels reſt in Canaan, and a remaining reſt whereof</hi> David <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> Pſalm. 95.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant it, There were two reſts under the law, which were ſigns of the one reſt under the Goſpel. The two under the Law were outward and natural, the one under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel inward and Spiritual, anſwerable to the ſtate of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel· <hi>David</hi> was not only acquainted with the Law-ſtate, but with the free ſpirit, (<hi>Pſalm,</hi> 51.) and the eternal law thereof. He knew the new Creation, the creating of a new Spirit, (with its travell through the law) &amp; alſo the new reſt. He knew the circumciſion of the heart, the ſpirituall ſacrifices of a broken heart and of praiſe, he could take the cup of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſing the ſong of praiſe to the Lord, which none can do in the ſtrange land, nor on any other day but the day of reſt.

this reſt, believe and enter. This reſt remains, ſays the Apoſtle, the others were types of it under the law-ſtate, which was to paſs away.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. It is ſaid, <hi>Ceremoniall ſigns are done away, but the ten Commands under the mercy-ſeat are of an other nature: and that there are ſigns which are not yet aboliſhed (as the Rainbow, Sun, Moon, and Stars) but ſtill remain for us to make good uſe of.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The mercy-ſeat under the Law is done away, and the ſubſtance thereof is come, and will ye not give him leave to write his law in the Tables which he ſhall chooſe, where his Diſciples may read it with the eye which hee gives? Is his law now to be read in the ſhadow, or with the outward eye, or to be looked for under the old mercy-ſeat of the outward tabernacle? or is it to be read with the eye of the new creature, with the eye of faith, with the eye of the Spirit, in the everlaſting Goſpel, where the life it ſelf is read, and in other books or writings without, but tidings or relations of the life? Here Chriſt, here the Spirit, here the eternall life, here the love, the joy, the peace, the reſt, the purity, which is eternall, is ſeen, is felt, is handled, is injoyed: for the true faith is indeed the ſubſtance of the things hoped for, giving victory over the enemies which diſturb, and a quiet habitation in him who is the reſt.</p>
               <p>And as touching ſigns, I do not ſay that ſigns are ſo done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as that there is now no good uſe to be made of them; but in reading the law and ſhadows thereof, the Lord may pleaſe by his Spirit to enlighten the Spirit of him, who reads in his fear, to ſee through them: but this I do not find, that ſo much as any one ſign or ſhadow under the law, was to be continued in that way of ſervice under the Goſpel (for indeed to what end ſhould it? When that is come, which it ſignified, is not its work at an end?) and that that Sabbath was given for a ſign (as well as any other Sabbaths of the Law) I find expreſly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. to 18.</p>

and the other holy mens hearts, long before this Covenant of the Law in writing was made with the Jews. And conſider wel which is now to ſtand in the times of the Goſpel, the writing of the law by the Spirit in the hearts of believers, as it was written by vertue of the promiſe before the law was given, or the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible writing under the Law, which was done for the ſake of, and as a ſuitable diſpenſation for that outward peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was not thus from the beginning, but after a long time: for when God choſe an outward people, he choſe alſo this way of writing to ſignifie ſomewhat by, which ſignification is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning another ſtate; in which ſtate, that which was ſignified is to be ſet up and advanced, and not the ſhadows which were ſignificant of it.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid, that <hi>the Lord writes theſe things new in his peoples hearts, to know the Lord, as their God, and as the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, and as their Father in him: and to love their brethren as Chriſt loved them. And he writes this law alſo in their hearts, Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me, make no Image, exalt my name, keep holy the Sabbath, &amp;c.</hi>

And if I can read there in this living book, what God writes in it by his Spirit, is not this nearer to me and clearer, and read by a more certain eye, then what I can read with my outward eye in Tables of ſtone? Oh, do not turn the believer out of his way: do not hinder him from reading in the book, which is clear and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, the clear and infallible things of God. Will God write in my heart, and will he not give me an eye to read? Shall he give me an eye to read, and ſhall I not read therewith? Thou haſt here confeſſed this to be the new writing, and the new writing belongs to the new Covenant, both which are proper to the Goſpel-ſtate and to Chriſts meditation, who is Mediatour of the new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>And in that he ſaith, a new, he hath made the firſt old.

This is the new birth, and the path thereof, the other is but the old creature, with its ſtriving after the path and inheritance of life.

            <p>Novv in this hard travel, and grievous labour under the cloſe lavvs and ſpirituall Commandements of the life (hard I mean, yea, very hard to the unrenewed part, though eaſie and natural to that which is renewed and born of God) it pleaſeth the Lord novv and then to give a day of refreſhment, cauſing his life ſo powerfully to ſpring up, that it even ſenſibly is, and doth all in the heart.

And here not only a Sabbath of days, but alſo a Sabbath of vveeks, yea ſometimes a Sabbath of years (beſides the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Jubilee or year of perfect redemption it ſelfe) are known &amp; vvitneſſed by ſuch as have vvaited on the Lord, in ſingleneſs of heart under the yoke of his Spirit, for the bringing down of the rough and untovvard nature, and for the raiſing up of the meek and lovvly heart.</p>
            <p>But here it is exceeding eaſie, running out and ſtarting aſide: it is eaſie running out from under the yoke to avoid the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the hardſhip to the earthly part; it is much eaſier run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out on the day of reſt, and ſo looſing the truth in a joy and rejoicing, even ſuch an one as might have a true ground. Oh
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108881:24"/>
who can but think the bitterneſs of death is paſt, when all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are vaniſhed, and there is nothing left but the Lord and the ſoul imbracing each other! and who can but be unwilling to come back again to his labour, and to the reſidue of his hard travel afterwards! and yet it is far better to return to the work in the Vineyard, and to ſuffer again with the ſeed, then to keep up the reſt in a notion, and ſo to loſe the life and pure preſence and vertue of the ſeed, when it returns unto and cals back to the labour. Oh how many have periſhed here, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a divource from that which led them into the reſt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to go back again with it to fill up the reſidue of its ſufferings, which were yet behind, and ſo have kept up a falſe, dead, notional reſt, after the true Sabbath was ended.</p>
            <p>Now there is no way for ſuch, but to wait to feel the living breath, the quickning vertue, the day-ſpring from on high, which by the brightneſs of its riſing can diſcover this falſe reſt, this dead reſt, this notionall reſt, this eaſe in the earthly, in the fleſhly, in the underſtanding part, which they uphold by things they have formerly gathered from the Scriptures, or from their own (perhaps once living) experiences; but now hold, out of the feeling and poſſeſſion of the life, in the dead part. But that it is thus with them, they can never ſee, untill the light, from which they have erred, ſpring up and diſcover it to them: and when the light doth ariſe and diſcover it, they will find the way of return and the path of redemption much more difficult to them, then it was at firſt. Yet it is better to part which the eaſe of the fleſh, and to undergo the pangs of a new birth, then to miſs of the inheritance in the good land.</p>
            <p>There are three ſteps or degrees of the bleſſed eſtate: Firſt There are <hi>deſires,</hi> thirſtings and breathings <hi>begotten after the life.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There is <hi>a labouring in the ſervice</hi> (under the yoke) <hi>by the vertue which ſprings from the life.</hi> Thirdly, There is a <hi>Reſt,</hi> or ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down at eaſe <hi>in the life.</hi> By the ſtirring of life in the ſoul, deſires after life are kindled: he, in whom the deſires are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and who feeleth the eternall vertue, cannot but be running the race: he whom the Spirit of the Lord findeth faithfull in running the race, it pleaſeth the Lord ever and anon to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him a taſt of the reſt. Thus the ſpring ſtirring, the ſoul
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108881:24"/>
cannot but move towards its center: and as it entreth into, and fixeth in its center, it partaketh of the reſt. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That man who is born of the ſpirit, is to wait for the movings, breathings and kindlings of the Spirit in him: and when the Sun ariſeth, he is to go forth to his labour in the light thereof, and in the night and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Sun, to retire: And when his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of reſt comes, he is to receive it from, and enjoy it in the Spirit; and afterwards to be willing to begin his week again, even till his whole race and the full courſe of his Pilgrimage be finiſhed. Yet if it were poſſible for man after he is come to Chriſt, to abide perfectly with him, to ceaſe from luſt, to keep within the faith, to draw naturally in the yoke, to bow in the Spirit continually to the Father of Spirits, there would be a continuall Sabbath kept in the paſſage, even before the great, full and perfect Sabbath in the end. The hardneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the labour, is becauſe of a part contrary to the life, which when it is worn out, there will be no more labour, but the yoke will become the reſt, and all the motions and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life will flow forth naturally in the reſt. And here is <hi>the Patience and Faith of the Saints,</hi> to wait under the yoke, under the daily croſs to that Part which is to be brought and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till all the bonds of Captivity be broke through by the life, and the vail of fleſh rent from the to to the bottome (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of which, is that which ſtops the free current of life) and then ſhall the ſoul enter into <hi>the holy of hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He raiſed up Judges likewiſe to defend them: and although they were weary of his Government, deſiring a King after the manner of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo vehemently, that they even forced a King from him, yet he took him away from them, and after him choſe <hi>a man after his own heart, to feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his People and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands.</hi> What ſhould I ſay more? what was wanting of Love, of Care, of Goodneſs, of Kindneſs, of Mercy, of Gentleneſs, of any thing that a People could deſire of their God?

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their Covenant is that which they entred into with God, the Covenant that their hearts choſe to unite with God by: and that was to this effect, <hi>That if God would ſhew them his Will, they would obey it.

remembred to them in the days of their youth, while they were young and tender, and not yet grown up to be a people under the other Covenant: and this is the Covenant which laſts for ever, which is not founded upon their obedience, but on God's free Love to them for his own Name ſake, and for their Fathers ſake with whom he freely made it.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no other way but that to which <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf directed them, after God had made the other Covenant with them, and tryed them long by it, together with many Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Signs and Wonders both before and after it; and ſeeing by all theſe they had not had an Heart to perceive, nor Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear, <hi>Moſes</hi> at length directs them to another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Word whereof would give them Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, and an Heart to underſtand. Which Covenant was a Covenant beſides the former, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1. And was indeed the Covenant concerning Life or Death eternal, <hi>chap.</hi> 30.15. (the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108881:28"/>
other being but a Covenant of their outward ſtate, made with them after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon their deliverance there from, and according to their choiſe to become a People to God according to it.) This Word, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, was near them (nearer then that which was ſpoken by God on the Mount, and afterwards written in Tables of Stone.) The voyce of this Word and the Commandment thereof was nearer, that they need not ſeek any where abroad for it, but only liſten at home to hear its ſpeech, obey it in the faith, and live for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, &amp;c. This is the way for them and all Men to come into this Covenant, and there is no other; There is a Light ſhining in the Darkneſs of Mans heart, which Springs up in him, and caſts forth it's rayes to diſcover and draw him out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now as this Light is felt, loved, underſtood in Spirit, hearkned and cleaved to in the pure Faith, which it begets; that which cleaves to it, is drawn out of the darkneſs by it, into the Covenant of the pure eternal Light, where God is, and whither all they are tranſlated, who are drawn to him in and by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as they are kept, preſerved, and continue in the Faith, Love and Obedience of it. Now I would yet put theſe few things more to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether that People of the Jews, as they ſtood related to God in that Covenant (given by <hi>Moſes</hi> at Mount <hi>Horeb</hi>) with the Covenant it ſelf and all things appertaining thereto, were not a ſhadow of ſome inward and Spiritual thing afterwards to appear and be made manifeſt in its ſeaſon. Whether they themſelves were not a ſhadow of a more inward and Spiritual People, to be gathered to God by the inward and Spiritual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and whether their outward Covenant was not a ſhadow or viſible repreſentation of that Covenant, and the Laws of it a ſhadow or repreſentation of the inward Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were to be written in the hearts of that Spiritual People? Was not their Tabernacle, or Temple, a ſhadow of the true Tabernacle or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, but in a poor, humble, contrite Spirit, and in the Heart that trembles at his Word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 66.1, 2. So was not their circumciſion a ſhadow of the circumciſion which is to paſs upon the Hearts of God's choſen? Were not their Sacrifices types or repreſentations of the Sacrifices of praiſe and of a broken
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108881:28"/>
Heart? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.14. Was not their <hi>Canaan,</hi> or Holy-land, a type of the true Holy Spiritual reſt which the faith gives entrance into? Their City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Tipe of the <hi>Jehovah-ſhammah</hi>? Their Prieſts and Levites Tipes of the Spiritual Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which was to offer the pure offering and Spiritual Sacrifices among the Gentiles? <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.11. Mark that place, if it did not plainly foretel the caſting off of the Jews, with the rejecting of their Offerings, Prieſts and Levites, and God's raiſing up a ſeed among the Gentiles, where he would have a more acceptable People and Worſhip, even a pure Spiritual People, and a pure Spiritual Offering.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they were Types, Repreſentations, or Shadows of ſomwhat Spiritual to come, then were they not to give place to that which is Spiritual when it came, and ſo to be ſwallowed up in it? Is not the Spiritual Glory, the Glory? the inward Jew, the Jew indeed? the circumciſion of the Heart, the choice circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? the offering up of praiſe and of a broken Heart, the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sacrifice? the Land of Life and Righteouſneſs, the true Land of reſt to the living by Faith? Is not the Spiritual City, Houſe, or Temple which God builds, the <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> or Temple of the new Covenant? Is not this the choice Houſe to God? and is not this Spiritual Glory to be expected in the days of the Meſſiah, and all the Tipes and ſhadows of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which pointed at him, to end in him, when once he comes to ſet up his true, inward, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſubſtantial Glory among his inward and Spiritual People? When the day of Meſſiah dawns, ſhall not <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſhadows fly away? O that your Eyes were opened to behold the inward Glory of Life, the good things of the new Covenant, the great Treaſure and Riches which are revealed and poſſeſſed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; by the Spirits that are redeemed unto God, that ye might partake thereof; and then your Eye would not be ſo much on that which is outward, which if ye had even to the utmoſt of your deſires, are not comparable to the inward.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Search the Prophets, ſee if the Meſſiah is not firſt to come in a deſpiſeable way, as a man of ſorrows, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2, 3. whoſe viſage in that appearance was to be more marred then any mans, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.14. and conſider whether he was not to be cut off, though not for himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. and then to ſit at the right Hand of God, until his Enemies be made his Footſtool; <hi>Pſa.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:108881:29"/>
110.1. before he come in that Glory wherein ye expect him. So that if he be not thus come already, then that coming of his is yet to be expected, and his Hands and Feet are yet to be pierced by you, and then afterwards ye may look upon him whom you have pierced, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and all the Families of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourn bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly apart for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Law, the vail was over his face: your Fathers were not able to bear the Light wherein the Law was given, nor the Light wherein the Prophecies of the Prophets were given, and ſo they ſtill erred from the Law, were offended at the Prophets while they were alive, &amp; miſ-underſtood their words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death. Now do not ye ſearch into <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in the ſame Spirit of error as your Fathers did, being ſhut out from the Light of them, even as they were? If it be thus, if the vail be over your hearts, if ye be ignorant of the true Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the true eternal Power wherein the Scriptures were given forth, ye muſt needs miſ-underſtand them miſ-underſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Prophets, miſ-underſtand the things ſpoken concerning the Meſſiah, &amp; ſo not be able to ſee unto the end of thoſe things mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; of that miniſtration which was to paſs away, nor into the beginning of the miniſtration of the Meſſiah, which was to ſucceed it. O turn within to the Word nigh in the Heart, that the true Jew may be begotten and formed in you, and his Light may ariſe and overſpread you, that in that Light ye may ſee the Light of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Light of the Prophets, and not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe meanings from their words, but underſtand them a right in the ſame Holy Spirit, and injoy the bleſſedneſs they ſpake of and directed to, which lyes in the inward raiſing up of an inward Seed, and not in an outward conformity of the outward man, while the heart and mind remains unchanged and unrenewed, which can never be made new by any miniſtry of the Letter without the Spirit, but alone by the miniſtry of the Spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without the Letter, as he pleaſeth.</p>
