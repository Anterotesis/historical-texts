         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OH <hi>London, London,</hi> what Lamentation may I take up for Thee, who was of late a flouriſhing City; whoſe Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by a pleaſant River, thorough which great Riches in abundance hath been brought to thee, by which thy Inhabitants have been made rich; thy <hi>Pomp</hi> and thy <hi>greatneſs,</hi> thy <hi>Excellency,</hi> and variety of <hi>Treaſures,</hi> hath allured many to flock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, from one end of the Nation to the other; and many have counted themſelves happy, that could get a convenient Habitation in or about thy Borders: A <hi>City</hi> that was ſo <hi>joyous</hi> and counted a place of <hi>delight,</hi> and a <hi>Palace</hi> for <hi>Princes,</hi> a meeting place for thoſe called the <hi>Nobility of the Land;</hi> unto thee hath the <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> from far <hi>Countries</hi> reſorted: <hi>Oh how is this City become ſolitary</hi> that was full of people, ſhe is now left as a <hi>widow of youth</hi> that was counted the pleaſant place of the Nation, and as a <hi>Princeſs</hi> in the <hi>Province,</hi> for how hath thy great Men left thee, and are fled as from a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous woman; how are thy Inhabitants a dread to the <hi>Country,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Plague</hi> that is broken out in thee; Oh my heart hath been in ſorrow for thee, and a burthen hath layn upon me as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, ever ſince the Lord began to manifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt thee, even ever ſince the <hi>Ship</hi> called the <hi>London</hi> was <hi>blown up,</hi> where more then 200. <hi>perſons were torn in pieces,</hi> whoſe <hi>Graves were in the Sea;</hi> this then was the cry of my heart; ſaying, <hi>think yee they were greater ſinners above all men?</hi> and this was the anſwer from the Lord, <hi>Except they repent they ſhall likewiſe periſh with a mighty ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though not in the ſame way.</hi> This was ſignified unto me by the Spirit of the Lord when I was in his dreadful fear, overſhadowed with his Heavenly power, and I waited to ſee it effected, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord by cealing from unrighteouſneſs, which moſt of all I deſired, that he might have diverted his intended Judgments; But Oh how haſt thou diſhonoured his name, and walked after thy own hearts luſts, as thoſe that have <hi>forgotten the Lord dayes without number, and haſt not humbled thy ſelf before him, but haſt regarded ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>

And as thou haſt ſent near threeſcore more of the ſervants of the Lord away, ſo hath his Plague encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to near three thouſand by the weekly bill; though it's judged to be more; and by many of the Inhabitants of this City here is a cry, ſaying, <hi>this is that which will encreaſe the Plague;</hi> yet ſtill were the hearts of thy <hi>Rulers</hi> hardened againſt this innocent people: Well, they may all know the Lords anger is not yet over, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill; for, as thou haſt encreaſed in cruelty, ſo hath the Lord executed his righteous Judgments (and will yet more and more) yet wouldeſt thou go on like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the dayes of old, though the firſt born was ſlain, yet he would purſue <hi>Iſrael</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, which became a Grave for him: Oh that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have taken notice of the dealings of the Lord, and have ceaſed from all <hi>oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>cruelty;</hi> that thoſe whom you have nothing againſt but as concerning the Law of their God, might have lived peaceable amongſt you, being ſuch that loves peace, and can learn war no more; yet they are aſſured the Lord will plead their cauſe, who is their reward in the day of tryal, and hath and is with them in the hour of temptation; Oh but thy <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>wantonneſs</hi> and <hi>fullneſs of bread,</hi> thy <hi>drunkenneſs, whoredoms, couzenings</hi> and <hi>cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> hath ſo eaten thee up that thou haſt not conſidered <hi>the moſt High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men;</hi> for in ſeeing thou couldeſt not ſee, and in hearing thou haſt not conſidered, but thy heart hath waxed fat thorough the abundance of thy <hi>Dilicacy;</hi> the voice of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and the sound of the <hi>Organs</hi> thou haſt delighted in; but now inſtead thereof, the voice of <hi>ſorrow, weeping,</hi> and bitter <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>

Neither have you regarded the ſervants of the moſt high God, which have been ſent unto you from ſeveral places, who have warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you and exhorted you, and beſeeched you in the bowels of Gods love that you would give over <hi>oppreſſing the innocent</hi> and <hi>perſecuting the upright,</hi> knowing that <hi>vengeance belongs to the Lord and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it;</hi> and that thoſe might not ſuffer <hi>Perſecution, Impriſonment,</hi> or <hi>Exilement,</hi> whom you have nothing againſt, but as concerning the Law of their God; yet them nor their Teſtimony hath not been regarded, but they have been <hi>villified</hi> and <hi>derided</hi> of many, and have been counted as thoſe who have been telling of idle Tales.</p>
            <p>Oh, but many may ſay, <hi>why doſt thou upbraid us in the day of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, or tell us of our Iniquities in this day of our ſore Diſtreſs,</hi> to which I anſwer, I do not upbraid you, but rather lay thoſe things before you which you have been guilty of, that you may conſider the Mercy and Juſtice of the Lord, and look back and ponder the long-ſuffering of the Almighty, and of the meanes of grace that he hath afforded thee, and of the Light that he hath lighted thee withall, and that thy Inhabitants might have been as his pleaſant Children, and that now whilſt thou haſt a Day to live thou mayeſt return unto him with unfeigned repentance, for they that repents and turns unto him, they ſhall finde mercy: Oh, but thy <hi>Prieſts</hi> and falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> have dealt deceitfully with thee, who have ſaid, <hi>Peace, peace, none evil ſhall come upon us;</hi> they have not diſcovered
