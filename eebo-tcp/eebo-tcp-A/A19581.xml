            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Ordinance and Appointment of GODS owne Wiſdome in the Law, that all his Sacrifices and burnt Offrings ſhould be ſeaſoned with Salt, the Fire impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Zeale, by which euery Sacrifice

            </p>
            <p>Hence it is Right Honourable, and Worſhipfull, that as our gracious King, out of his Humilitie and holy Zeale, commanded publike Faſting &amp; Prayer, for the diuerting of this publike Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="tcp:19291:3"/>
So now, out of holy and deepe diſcretion hath ſuſpended for a time thoſe publike meetings within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Out of no diſlike of Faſting and Prayer, nor any wearineſſe of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſes, as ſome Malignant Spirits malitiouſly traduce Him. But out of conſcience to his God &amp; care of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects liues: wiſely conſidering (&amp; in our knowledge moſt truely) that ſeeing the ſick &amp; ſore (do what we Miniſters could to the contrary) mingled themſelues confuſedly, with the ſound (by which meanes its more then manifeſt, many thouſands haue periſhed in this Citie and Suburbs.) It therefore lay vpon him as Supreme Magiſtrate and Gods Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to looke to the <hi>liues</hi> as well as to the <hi>Soules</hi> of all his people, and to take order, that the Faſts ordained for the bettering of the <hi>Soule,</hi> ſhould not ſo be vſed, as to tend to the deſtruction of the <hi>body.</hi> Leauing vs therefore in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Citie, the Lords Day or Sunday for our ſoules, which being of Diuine Inſtitution, can admit no Diſpenſation by humane power, and ſtill commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19291:4"/>
and commanding vs that Day to faſt &amp; pray in priuate, and all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome elſe to doe it in publike for vs: And for the ſauing of our liues, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd the tempting and prouoking of God. Hath wiſely forbidden all other publike meetings of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in places Infected, till order can be taken (which is no eaſie thing to doe) to keepe the ſound and ſicke aſunder.</p>
            <p>Now as all thoſe that be well are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to repaire to the Church, to be partakers of the publike Prayers &amp; the holy ſeruice appointed for that day, ſo, for a helpe, of Humiliation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deuotion to them that ſtay at home, whereof alſo many thouſand Families eſpecially in our Suburbs are not able to buy the Booke, I haue therefore beene perſwaded to make publike this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Confeſſion, and Prayer, which in theſe dayes of publike Calamitie, I walking hourely through the valley of the ſhadow of Death, (burying forty, fifty, ſometime ſixty a day, and in the Totall, more then two thouſand alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I poured out in the preſence of my
<pb facs="tcp:19291:4"/>
God: Firſt, in priuate for my ſelfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for the vſe of thoſe many thouſand ſicke ſoules that are or haue beene in my great poore Pariſh: And laſtly, that hereby I might offer ſome Sacrifice and ſpeciall piece of Seruice in way of holy thankfulneſſe to the Lord our God, who hath hitherto pleaſed to preſerue me, and my Brethren the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of this Citie by his owne hand and power, beyond all humane helpe and hope; walking continually, euen in the midſt of the fiery flames alwayes in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and neuer in more perill then in the Pulpit: wherein the Lord hath beene ſo marueilous, &amp; ſo magnified, his loue and power vpon vs, as if he ſhould now take vs away, yet hath hee ſo deliuered vs, in diſcharging our duties, and by his holy Angels kept vs, thus being in our way, till hee hath literally made good that promiſe in the Pſalme, yea, and much more: for alas wee haue not only ſeene a <hi>thouſand fall at one ſide of vs, and ten thouſand at another,</hi> but (alas, alas, that our ſinnes ſhould ſo prouoke our God) euen more then ten thouſand on
<pb facs="tcp:19291:5"/>
the one, and more then twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand on the other. Which mighty work of God, if wee ſhould ſit ſtill and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſuperficially paſſe ouer, and not commend it, to our Brethren in the Countrey, whoſe turnes muſt follow God knowes how ſoone, as ſure as God hath begunne with vs; and if we did not preſerue the memory of it, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to Poſterity, for their inſtruction, and that the Generations yet vnborne may prayſe the Lord; all holy men would accuſe vs, Gods Church would cenſure vs, our own Conſciences would condemne vs, and God himſelfe take vengeance of vs, as moſt vnthankfull Caitiffes, euen Monſters of Mankind, &amp; vnworthy to breath vpon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Being therefore in ſome ſort touched with the ſenſe of this hand of our God, both of his hand of Iuſtice and of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and being euerymoment put in mind of our mortality, eyther by the ſound in our eares, or ſights in our eyes; can we but be moued (vnleſſe we were ſenſeleſſe <hi>Stocks &amp; Stoicks)</hi> to take into our ſerious and continuall Conſideration, the now
<pb facs="tcp:19291:5"/>
moſt lamentable Caſe, of this late ſo flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a Citie, and of this whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into which this wild-fire of Gods wrath begins ſo faſt to flie, and can wee but lay to heart ſo great a ſorrow? Or dare wee for our ſoules but deale truly with our God, in ſeeking ſincerely and carefully ſearching out the true cauſe in our ſelues, in our people, and in the whole Kingdome that ſhould thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the Lord againſt vs? Certainly ſome heauy judgement muſt fall vpon vs if we doe not, and will follow them whoeuer they bee that double and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with their God in this caſe.</p>
            <p>And if any that be abroad and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſited, thinke I deale too farre and too freely in this Confeſſion. I aske no more but to forbeare his judgment, til they be vnder the hand of God, as we haue bin now three moneths and more, and then they will iudge I am too ſhort: The while God in mercy pardon that, and wherin I may be thought to go too far, I ſhall eaſily anſwere it to God or Gods Anointed: &amp; ſhal ſigh &amp; ſob in ſecret to conſider the wrath &amp; woes that wait for
<pb facs="tcp:19291:6"/>
thoſe wicked ones, who as they deeply haue had their hand in pulling downe this Plague, ſo careleſſely ſeeke to paſſe it ouer, and looke not after the God that hath ſmitten them, and the whole Land for their ſakes, and will if they turne not betimes, ſmite them downe to Hell: What ſtony hearted Stoicke can he be who ſees more then forty thouſand Chriſtians, many as good, and ſome better then Himſelfe laid in the duſt, in little more then twice forty dayes, and is not humbled vnder the Hand that did it, and ſenſible of the Sin that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it? Can hee bee a good Seruant of God or Subiect to his Souereigne, that beſides ten thouſand aged, weake, and poore, ſhall ſee an Army of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more, braue, luſtie, and ſeruiceable young men, and tenne thouſand more comely and mariageble young women, and ten thouſand more young Infants, whoſe proofe and hope had beene ſtill before them, already taken out of one Corner of this Kingdome, and ſits not downe in duſt and aſhes mourning to that God that tooke them, for that King
<pb facs="tcp:19291:6"/>
that loſt them, with that Land that wants them. For that Sinne that pluckt them from vs? I dare pronounce vpon him from God whoeuer hee bee that can or dare thus ſleightly and ſliely paſſe by the workes of God, and laughes in his ſleeue at ſuch a judgement as this, is markt vp by God for ſome greater vengeance as ſure as the fourteenth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is Gods true Word. For if hee that mournes for ſinne be the man that is Markt by God for bleſſing and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, whats hee that makes a ſport of ſinne; and layes from his heart the Iudgements thereby procured, but one thats ſealed vp for confuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: O therefore that my heart were a Fountaine, and my eyes Riuers of teares, that I might worthily bewaile the ſinnes of our Nation together with mine owne, and weepe for the ſlaine of the Daughter of my people: So cried the holy Prophet of the abundance of his holy Zeale; and ſo I am ſure in their ſeuerall meaſures doe all the Miniſters and men of God amongſt vs, that haue but taſted of the ſame ſpirit, mourning
<pb facs="tcp:19291:7"/>
for the deſolations of this Citie; and more for the Contagion that cauſeth it, and moſt of all, for the ſinnes that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them both: And who would not care to ſacrifice themſelues what way the Lord ſhould pleaſe, ſo the wrath of God might bee pacified towardes this Church and Nation, and thoſe plagues remooued which are the cauſe of this Plague: And till theſe be remooued, we ſhall find the Prophets tell vs true, that eyther this Plague ſhall ſtil ſtay &amp; creep like a Canker ouer our whole body, or elſe only make make way to ſome more fearefull that ſhall follow after it.</p>
            <p>That this may be preuented, he cannot be a Chriſtian that will not both cry to God, and confeſſe to him the publike, and priuate, and perſonall ſinnes that be the cauſe thereof. And as all that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and taught by the holy Spirit of God; to poure out their ſoules in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer, and hearty Confeſſion, will in holy obedience to the holy Prophets<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 2.</note> counſell; <hi>Take vnto themſelues words, and returne vnto the Lord:</hi> So for thoſe that cannot open their mouthes as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb facs="tcp:19291:7"/>
and yet haue hearts that groane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, and ſoules that ſeeke the Lord. For their aſſiſtance only haue I beene perſwaded to publiſh this, which now I leaue to them, and them and it together, with our ſelues to the mercifull accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gracious bleſſing of our <hi>Good God:</hi> who grant vs all in theſe dayes of danger (when ſomtimes almoſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand a day are pickt vp, and pluckt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before our faces) So to liue and ſo to dye, as when we dye we may be ſure to liue for euer.

This done, then take for thy Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, in the Name of the Lord, a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bleſſed Bible, and ſo ſet thy ſelfe vnto thy worke, and faithfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of thy lawfull Calling. Then after thy dayes labour done, bodily refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take for thy Spirituall Dinner and Supper thy heartfull of holy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations of thoſe mightie Workes of God, both of his Iuſtice and Mercie towards thy ſelfe and others: which all that day long, eyther thine eyes haue ſeene, or thine eares haue heard of. Then the day beeing done, ſee that thou and thine for your Banquet, or reare Supper, doe cloſe vp your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, with thoſe true Sweet-meates, certaine ſelected Chapters of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Bible: Then after a holy Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, of what euery one hath heard or ſeene, or obſerued that day touching the wondrous Workes of God, and application of the ſame one to another: and each one to himſelfe, Let then the Heart command the Tongue with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and boldneſſe, to recommend the ſoules and bodies of Thee and Thine

            </p>
            <p>But forget not noe thing as thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue all this profitable, and to doe thee any good, namely, to learne (which thou maiſt doe, of that excellent <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38.</note> Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> what it is <hi>to liue the life of faith,</hi> when naturall reaſon and humane helpes not only faile thee, but haply are all againſt thee: This Faith I tel thee afore-hand is not eaſily found, but I deale truly with thee who had it, and can teach thee how to get it, for though himſelfe cannot giue it thee, yet hee will both direct and lead thee, and bring thee acquainted with that holy Spirit, who gaue it him, and will not denie it thee if thy Tongue doe begge it, and thy Soule ſeeke it: Neuer ſo little of this Faith is precious, therefore ſo thou get it and haue it right, care not for the quantity; for it is a holy <hi>Elixir,</hi> a true <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> which will preſently and perpetually multiply, beyond ordinary beliefe, to the infinite inriching of the Soule that enioyes it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19291:26"/>
But this Faith hath one ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, that although it will bee content to bee <hi>gathered vp by graines</hi> of young and weake Chriſtians, and treaſured vp by drammes and ounces of ſuch as be rich and ſtrong men in Chriſt, yet can it not abide to be meaſured or mixt with <hi>Scruples:</hi> For theſe <hi>Scruples</hi> are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature to true Faith: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, be it more, be it leſſe, ſo it be true, its perfect, and thou ſhalt find thy ſelfe happy if thou haue it: for the leaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of this Faith will affoord thee eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning and Euening a proportion of that true <hi>Treacle,</hi> or <hi>Methrydate,</hi> which yet was neuer made at <hi>Venice</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept cloſely in ſome corners) by reaſon of that great Iugler the <hi>Pope,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyes in corrupt Drugs and falſe Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients: This <hi>Methrydate</hi> is made of more ſtrange Simples, then bee the bloud of Scorpions, or the fleſh of Vipers: For it is and muſt bee confected of the fleſh and body, and bloud of a Man, but ſuch a Man as the World neuer had a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, for he muſt be the child of <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet the Sonne of no Man, and a
<pb facs="tcp:19291:26"/>
true Man, and yet no Man to be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now his bloud taken from him while he is aliue, and yet ſo taken from him as he muſt needs dye, is of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne excellency, and that infinite vertue and Merit, as the <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> that may be extracted out of it, (which only this fore-named <hi>Faith can doe,)</hi> Is that Superexcellent, nay, Supercele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall <hi>Methry date</hi> of that high infallible, and inualuable vertue, as the Soule that out taſtes of it Morning and Euening, did neuer periſh, nor ſhall to the Worlds end. Therefore, I ſay againe, as thou wouldſt haue this Medicine worke, and become powerfull for thy preſeruation, forget not to take a taſte of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, the firſt thing in the Morning, and the laſt at Night.</p>
            <p>Then lye thee downe in Peace, and ſecurely take thy reſt, for thou art free from the feare of all that are able to hurt thee. But bee ſure, for a ſigne whereby to know this Phyſicke workes well, that inſtantly when thou wakeſt thy heart, doe forth-with fixe it ſelfe on God, and vpon him beſtow thy firſt thoughts:
<pb facs="tcp:19291:27"/>
And ſo when thy body hath receiued ſo much ſleepe and reſt as may make it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable for the Soule, then vp with it in the Name of the Lord, that ſo both Body and Soule may ſet themſelues to ſerue their God: Then taking this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and following all the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, thou mayſt ſafely enter vpon thy buſineſſe, and aduenture vpon the dangers of that day both thou &amp; thine. Prouided firſt, that you alwayes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe (as occaſion is) together with the duties of your Calling, ſuch workes of Piety towards God, Iuſtice and Equity towards Man, Mercy and Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Poore, as the Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall lay before thee, or caſt in thy way: For take it for a Rule, that theſe foure muſt alwayes goe together, and God himſelfe hath ſo ioyned them all together, <hi>as curſed bee the Man that puts them aſunder,</hi> for hee carries ſuch a heart about him, as this Phyſicke can neuer doe him good: But where theſe foure are conſcionably conioyned, this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke neuer fayled to worke his worke: but where any of the foure is wanting,
<pb facs="tcp:19291:27"/>
and totally neglected, there the other three will doe no good, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they cannot get the company of their companion, they mourne and pine away, and in a ſhort time will bee gone, and ſtay no longer there, where they cannot be compleate.</p>
            <p>Prouided alſo that Man, nor God doe euer find thee out of thy way, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eyther walking faithfully in thy lawfull calling, or elſe doing ſome good in the performance of ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid duties of Piety, Iuſtice, or Mercie: For theſe bee the wayes of a Chriſtian, and hee that is found out of all theſe is vtterly out of his way, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of that protection which God hath granted to them that wayte on him, which runnes in theſe words, That <hi>Hee hath giuen his Angels charge ouer</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11.</note> 
               <hi>them, to keepe them in all their wayes,</hi> &amp;c. And the power of this Protection no Creature can infringe. So as by vertue thereof, the Seruants of God haue wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in ſafetie in the midſt of ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as hath beene an amazement to the World, and a wonder to themſelues:
<pb facs="tcp:19291:28"/>
And for the want of this, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands haue miſcarried, not only of <hi>Gods Enemies,</hi> who walke in wrong and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes, but euen ſuch of his friends and followers, who being miſled by the World or their owne Preſumptions, tooke to themſelues the boldneſſe to ſtep aſide, out of their owne wayes, and ſo haue ſhifted themſelues out of that ſhelter or ſafetie, which otherwiſe they might haue challenged as their owne.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Prouided that in all times of danger thou take heed of tempting God, for otherwiſe thou mayſt iuſtly prouoke him to deny his bleſſing to this <hi>Medicine,</hi> without which, as Souereigne and powerfull as it is, it can do no good. Now if thou wilt auoid this feareful and dangerous Sinne of tempting GOD, thou muſt take heed:</p>
            <p>Firſt, of putting thy ſelfe into any needleſſe danger: And it is then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, when without neceſſary cauſe or lawfull calling, eyther for gaine or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or any priuate reſpect thou puts thy ſelfe into places, or among perſons infected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19291:28"/>
Secondly, thou muſt alſo at thy vtmoſt perill, carefully vſe all good helpes of Nature and Art, which Gods good Prouidence affoords thee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee commended vnto thee by the Learned Phyſician, or approued by true and reall experience, and whether they be meanes Preſeruatiue, Curatiue, or Reſtoratiue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou muſt bee wary of all wilfull diſtemper, and bee diligent in keeping a carefull and orderly dyet, not only for moderation and ſobriety, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the quantity both of meate, and drinke eſpecially, but alſo for Wiſdome in the choice of the quality and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that little thou feedſt vpon.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, abhorre more then Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or the Plague it ſelfe theſe wicked Opinions, and all that hold them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Peſtilence is not infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in it ſelfe, and of it owne nature, but ſo immediately, and only the hand of God, as none become infected, but only by his ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that euery mans dayes are ſo numbred, as doe or not doe what hee
<pb facs="tcp:19291:29"/>
will, he cannot liue longer, nor die ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then his day and houre appointed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that therefore all carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of perſons or places infected, and diligent vſing of meanes appointed for preſcruation are needleſſe and to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The fouleneſſe and falſeneſſe of all theſe three appeares:</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19291:30"/>
fled from the danger, fledde not from his calling, but preacht Gods Word vnto them, himſelfe in the Ship, and the people on the ſhore.</p>
            <p>The laſt wicked opinion to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is, that none who loue, feare and ſerue God, and beleeue in him can dye of the Plague, and all that doe, doe want Faith: The wickedneſſe of which Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine appeares in this, that diuers of the deareſt of Gods Saints haue taſted, nay drunke as deeply the Cup of all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Croſſes, and bodily afflictions whatſoeuer, as any Vnbeleeuers or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God haue done. Againe, in that many of Gods Children, who in common Calamities turne to the Lord in Faith and true Repentance, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thereby they ſaued their Soules, yet for their bodily liues were ſwept away with the reſt, by the generall Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As a great number of them that periſhed in the Floud, and diuers of thoſe that dye by the hand of Iuſtice, and all Hiſtories and Ages affoord fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19291:30"/>
And laſtly, if thou wouldeſt take heed of tempting God, ſtand in thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, make Conſcience to doe thy duty, Flie not with <hi>Ionah from the preſence of</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ionah.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord,</hi> for hee can follow thee, and find thee where euer thou art, and reach thee afarre off as well as at home, and make <hi>Ionah</hi> feele him (being fled from his duty) euen when hee thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt ſafe, and ſlept ſecurely: Thou therefore that mayſt boldly begge <hi>Gods bleſsing</hi> in thy place and duty, how da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou tempt and try the power of God, by flying from it. Vſe this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and obſerue theſe Rules, and as ſure as God is true and juſt, thou mayſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue the Plague ſhall either not touch thee, or not hurt thee; but in ſtead of a Plague ſhall bee a <hi>Bleſsing</hi> to thee: And whereas many of GODS good Children haue taken and died of this Infection, as it is manifeſt on the one ſide they wanted not Grace, nor Faith for Saluation, ſo it is as cleere on the other; that thev ſome way failed in the vſe of this Medicine either, in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lceuing what in this caſe ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued,
<pb facs="tcp:19291:31"/>
or in not doing ſomething to bee done for their deliuerance in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: In all which Caſes, the Rule of Chriſt is certaine: <hi>according to thy faith,</hi> and conſequently thy obedience, which alwayes waits on true Faith, <hi>So be it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Medicine is ſo ancient and ſo approued, that ſince the World began it was neuer found to faile in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſauing only ſuch as either ſeeme to vſe it but did not, or vſing it in part; yet failed in ſome particulars which in the vſe of Medicines may not bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And by the vertue of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine alone, many about this Citie haue beene preſerued to this day, whoſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Duties ineuitably bound them within the reach of ſuch dangers, from which all the humane helpes in the World could not haue deliuered them: And ſtill if they faile not in Faith, nor diſcharge of their Duties: God who is the Authour of this Medicine will not faile in performance of his promiſe.</p>
