            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>BOth kind and fortunate the Year begun</l>
               <l>Her happy Course, and long went smiling on;</l>
               <l>Fresh Blessings daily ope'ning to our view,</l>
               <l>With Promises of Greater to ensue.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Senate</hi> did their <hi>Sove'reign</hi>'s Wants supply,</l>
               <l>And ready Grants are half a Victory:</l>
               <l>That done, He early opens the Campaign,</l>
               <l>Armies at Land, and Navies on the Main.</l>
               <l>Where never <hi>British</hi> Sails before were spread</l>
               <l>In Hostile Guise, our conqu'ring Fleets are led.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lords of the Ocean</hi> long our selves we nam'd,</l>
               <l>And now as far as that does reach, are fam'd.</l>

                  <hi>Spain,</hi> whose <hi>Armado</hi> made the World afraid,</l>
               <l>Fell by our Strength, and rises by our Aid.</l>
               <l>Though from the vaster <hi>Continent</hi> dis-join'd,</l>
               <l>The Balance falls, as <hi>Britain</hi> is inclin'd:</l>
               <l>If Peace she gives, she does compose the Jar,</l>
               <l>And does as surely conquer, if 'tis War.</l>
               <l>To their own Ports confin'd, the <hi>French-Men</hi> see,</l>
               <l>"We ride without a Rival on the Sea.</l>
               <l>As <hi>Tourville, Russell;</hi> so their Gen'ral too</l>
               <l>At Land does think it safest out of view,</l>
               <l>Entrench'd he lies, and fights us by delay;</l>
               <l>But let him think of <hi>Cannae</hi>'s fatal Day.</l>
               <l>A Day like that, and quickly too, may come,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Paris,</hi> took, be humbled in her Doom,</l>
               <l>Though that less famous Warrior fail'd of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            </lg>

               <l>Thus our Affairs abroad—At home no less</l>
               <l>The bounteous Year did all our Labour bless.</l>
               <l>The fertile Soil, like <hi>Aegypt</hi> heretofore,</l>
               <l>By Handfuls a prodigious Product bore:</l>
               <l>Ne'er had the Reaper's Gripe so large a Pull:</l>
               <l>And still our Garners and our Stores are full.</l>
               <l>Mean while our neighb'ring Foes, by want of Rain,</l>
               <l>To Dearth reduc'd, had scarce their Seed again:</l>
               <l>Starving, and harass'd by their <hi>Tyrant</hi>'s Lust,</l>
               <l>They crouch beneath his Spurn, and lick the Dust.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Harvest o'er, another yet succeeds,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>William</hi> return'd! and crown'd with glorious Deeds!</l>

That just Restorer of our Rights and Laws:</l>

               <l>Welcomes, at once their great Deliv'rer home,</l>
               <l>Our <hi>CAESAR,</hi> too, from <hi>Gaul</hi> in Triumph come.</l>
               <l>Bells, Guns, and Shouts in one loud Concert joine;</l>
               <l>The Voice of Nations is the Voice Divine.</l>
               <l>Scarce Sacred <hi>Charles,</hi> whose Absence long we mourn'd,</l>
               <l>Joy of our Hearts, more lov'd and blest return'd.</l>

               <l>Thus far w'are happy—Hitherto the Year</l>
               <l>Was not th'Occasion of a Publick Tear:</l>
               <l>Almost expir'd, who wou'd expect to find</l>
               <l>Her blackest Day, and gloomiest Scene behind!</l>
               <l>It now has cancell'd all it gave before,</l>
               <l>Ne'er but with Grief to be remember'd more!</l>
               <l>Our Sun of Beauty's set! Our Joy is done!</l>
               <l>And with Her Life the <hi>British</hi> Glory gone!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where was the Guardian-Angel of these Isles?</l>
               <l>(On which, 'tis said, delighted Nature Smiles)</l>
               <l>Or where was Hers? To what strange Region gone,</l>
               <l>And left his Charge to Perish here alone?</l>
               <l>Return! Return! and, paler than Her Ghost,</l>
               <l>See what the World by your Neglect has lost!</l>
               <l>Death of thy Absence has th' Advantage took,</l>
               <l>And dreadfully he grinn'd, and deep he strook!</l>
               <l>Banish'd from <hi>Paradise</hi> be now thy Doom,</l>
               <l>Ne'er to thy Native Seat again to come:</l>
               <l>

Hadst thou been careful, as thy Nature's kind,</l>
               <l>Our Light that is extinguish'd, yet had shin'd!</l>
               <l>But with our Hopes let now our Lives be done,</l>
               <l>And that way mourn the QUEEN of <hi>Britain</hi> gone!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But though thy Ministers their Charge forsake,</l>
               <l>O Heav'n! thy Eyes for ever are awake.</l>
               <l>You might, at least, (but you are pleas'd 'tis so)</l>
               <l>Have stood between HER and the Fatal Blow;</l>
               <l>Nor let the pale-fac'd Tyrant from us torn</l>
               <l>That <hi>GEMM,</hi> by <hi>Britain</hi> with such Glory worn.</l>
               <l>Why do we Mortals Adoration pay?</l>
               <l>For Blessings praise you, and for Blessings pray?</l>
               <l>If those we dearest love, and highest prize,</l>
               <l>Are snatch'd the soonest from our wond'ring Eyes!</l>
               <l>Hard your Decrees! your Laws unequal made!</l>
               <l>Why must the fairest Flow'rs the soonest fade?</l>
               <l>Why must that Sacred Life so quickly end,</l>
               <l>On which the Peace of Nations does depend?</l>
               <l>In all Her Sweetness, Glory, Youth and Prime,</l>
               <l>Abhorring Vice, and still redeeming Time:</l>
               <l>Ah, cruel Heav'n! so little in your Eye,</l>
               <l>And yet less great in Pow'r than Piety.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When the bright Sun hastes to his Ev'ning-Fall,</l>
               <l>Like Age deceas'd, he scarce is miss'd at all:</l>
               <l>But if, in his Noon-Station in the Skyes,</l>
               <l>A black Eclipse does shroud him from our Eyes,</l>
               <l>W'are pale with Fear, and his lost Glory mourn,</l>
               <l>Though sure both Heat and Light will soon return.</l>

How shall we then our present Fate deplore?</l>
               <l>Our Light's extinct, and is to shine no more!</l>

            <lg>
               <l>'Tis true, the Stars their baleful Infl'ence shed,</l>
               <l>And Death's fierce Agents thro' the Town were spred,</l>

               <l>And flew in Pestilential Air unseen:</l>

               <l>And all <hi>SHE</hi> shou'd have liv'd transfer to <hi>HIM.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet so to pray is scarce to be His Friend,</l>
               <l>Since but with Lite His Sorrows will have End!</l>
               <l>Ah, Gracious PRINCE! when You hereafter come</l>
               <l>From <hi>Gallia,</hi> cover'd with Your Lawrels, home;</l>
               <l>When You have done what Y'are prescrib'd by Fate,</l>
               <l>Enlarg'd our Bounds, and rais'd a sinking State;</l>
               <l>Compos'd our Foreign and Domestick Jars,</l>
               <l>And put a Glorious Period to the Wars;</l>
               <l>Though all the Nation shall in Joy appear,</l>
               <l>The Court for Your Reception Balls prepare,</l>
               <l>Will You not grieve to miss <hi>MARIA</hi> there?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>SHE</hi> was the Soul, the Nation's but the Ghost,</l>
               <l>That, but the Shadow, <hi>SHE,</hi> the Substance, lost!—</l>
               <l>But then remember, <hi>SHE</hi>'s but lost to gain</l>
               <l>A Brighter Crown, and a more Lasting Reign!</l>
