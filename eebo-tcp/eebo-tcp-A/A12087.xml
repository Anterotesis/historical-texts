            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in another place he giveth us a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of many heathen men, who <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very old, and neere to death, sang their Swan-like songs more sweetly then they were wont in younger yeares.</hi> The Author of this Treatise hath given us a larger catalogue, not only of heathen
<pb facs="tcp:14489:6"/>
men, but also of holy men, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, who in their OLD-AGE have beene endowed with excellent and eminent abilities, especially of mind: withall he sheweth, that if it so fall out as is objected, it is in such an OLD-AGE as followeth upon distempered <hi>youth,</hi> and disordered manage: but where former yeares have beene tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately ordered, and well imployed, OLD AGE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though somewhat debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated in bodily strength, will prove vigorous in the indowments of the soule.

            <p>Let no man thinke that this Treatise is onely for <hi>OLD-MEN,</hi> chiefely it looks towards them: yet every age, once come to yeeres of discretion, may hap'ly by it be put in minde of some thing or other, that

                  <p>Here it will be objected: Is all counsell then lockt up in the breast of the aged? may not

young-men be able to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I answer, Yes, but wee speake comparatively, and say onely, that Old-men have better meanes and opportunities for it then the younger, and yet the Philosopher doubts not to aver, that a young-man wanting time and experience, cannot be wise, so wise as I understand it. But further I answer, that my speech tends not to the disabling of any: onely it would free the age I treat of, from disgrace and contempt. Howsoever there is an instance that will extort from us a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of thus much at the least, that when the counsell of the aged hath beene rejected, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of younger men preferred before it, the successe hath beene very unhappy.

                  <p>But againe, some man hap'ly will say that the Old-mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and insufficiency seizes not onely on the body, but possesses the mind also.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14489:27"/>
as neither the inward nor outward senses can doe their office so well as otherwise they might, but all this is to be imputed to the body, and not to the mind, and the young-man in that place standes charged with it, as with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits of his wilde and unbridled carriage. <note n="l" place="margin">Epist. 26.</note>

                  <p>Publique civill affaires may be distinguished by the times of peace and warre. When there

is peace, questionlesse the gowne<note place="margin">Old-men of best use in peace.</note> (which best fits the Old-mans backe) is preferred before the sword, shield, or helmet, as of greater use for that time.

are carried downewards: that which is light, soares upwards, so the unregenerate, the naturall man, being earthly, and of a lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish quality, sinkes downe still lower and lower, even towards hell, till he is converted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his condition and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and the neerer he is to <note n="n" place="margin">Acts. 1. 24.</note> his owne place, the faster hee moves, if grace prevent it not.

                  <p>And heere now this also must

                  </p>
                  <p>To grow towards a conclusion of this point; I say further, if we grant that some inability for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be found in this age, yet it will thence receive no disgrace: nor hath any man in yeares cause to complaine in that behalfe.

The object of pleasure is some<note place="margin">Good is the object of pleasure</note> good that accrewes unto us: and according to the difference of things tearmed good, must plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures be differenced and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, for either they are falsely, or they are truely so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

was in <hi>Thrasilaus,</hi> who thought all<note place="margin">False plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</note> the ships that arrived at the haven, to be his, and received them with great pleasure and rejoycing: that all (likewise) which set forth were his, which he dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a joyfull expectation of a gainefull returne: all the while counting himselfe an happy man that was the owner of so great substance, if any of the ships mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, he enquired not after them: if they returned safe, hee rejoyced. Thus was it with him in his frensy: and when he came to himselfe, he professed that he never lived more sweetely then when he was in that error, for hee had much pleasure (though false) and no care or trouble at all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, things may not rightly be called good, when they are not so good, as they are

                  <p>Touching the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kinde of good, which we said is the object of pleasure, to wit, that which is truely and in its nature good, it is of two sorts: the one worldly and corporall, the other heavenly and spirituall: and answerable are the pleasures which come of

them, either worldly or heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the worldly;<note place="margin">Worldly pleasures</note> though often, through the abuse of them they become carnall and divelish, yet in themselves they are good and lawfull.</p>
                  <p>First, because they are as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall<note place="margin">How worldly pleasures are good</note> that releeves the infirmities of our weake nature: or as an Inne after a long and wearisome journey.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God to animate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to obedience. <note n="b" place="margin">Psal 104 15.</note>

                  <p>Another difference is, that they have a different pedigree: the one proceeding from Gods speciall favour, the other from worldly things.</p>
                  <p>A third: when the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall<note place="margin">3 In satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> nature is satisfied, those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures cease: as when men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated their hunger and thirst, meates and drinkes afford no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

                  <p>Fourthly, the sensuall pleasures<note place="margin">4 In sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> are not at all times in season. There is a time when <note n="h" place="margin">Eccle. 1.</note> to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

For even in the greatest heavinesse (which is the godly sorrow for

                  <p>Fiftly, another difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene<note place="margin">5 In sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse.</note> them is in regard of the unstablenesse of the one, and the firmenesse of the other.

                  <p>Sixtly and lastly, in regard of purity. Worldly pleasures and delights have alwayes some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bitternesse, while a man feedes his conceit with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of temporall things, his heart is fed upon by three devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vultures: much care in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, more feare in keeping, and most griefe in loosing: and as for greatnesse (so greedily hunted after) it is ordinarily a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vexation; because of envy from inferiours, thwarting of competitors and jealousies of Princes and such like. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great mens hearts have burst with the blasting frowne of a Kings fore-head?

In answer whereto I say, first that our corrupt nature is ever ready to abuse them: and therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and safer it is to want, then to have them. Can we so mistake our selves as not to know either who or where we are? Our owne weakenesse or inability to stand upright? or the ground on which we are while given to pleasures how slippery it is?

It will be misery upon misery, even an heape or pile of evills. The tempter was so flesht by the foile hee gave, and the victory he got in Paradice, that he presumed to lay the same baite for our Saviour himselfe in the wildernesse; and though there he was repulst, yet by the same temptation hee hath since, and doth continually prevaile more or lesse with all the sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>

                  <p>God usually layes afflictions<note place="margin">Afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to weane us from pleasures.</note> upon his deerest children, giving them the soure of this world, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the sweet: and it is to

                  <p>But the Apostle makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect<note place="margin">Lawfull things in danger let goe.</note> answer to this objection; <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>All things are lawfull,</hi> &amp;c. He standes there stoutly upon his priviledge, his dominion and power which he hath received from God over all these lawfull things; and resolves with an eye to God first, and then also to his owne dignity and safety, not to be so uncircumspect, so unthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his Lord and creator, or so base in respect of himselfe, as to lay downe this great prerogative, and to become a servant to his

servants, he will not embrace and hug that with danger of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and wronging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which he hath received to a quite contrary end.</p>
                  <p>When a man is on the sea in great danger, he will cast out all the wares be they never so rich, for the safety of his life, so would we in this case, were we as sensible of the soules danger, as of the bodies.</p>
                  <p>It is our Saviours both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and charge in case of offences, to be contented to part with our right hand and right eye, which we know of how great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use they are to us.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14489:53"/>
For they plainely shew us in the fable of the Sirens (what we are not apt of our selves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) how dangerous a thing it is to be within the reach of these deceitfull, enticing, and bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delights.</p>

                  <p>THe next imputation is, that in elder yeares we are weake. For answer, first I see not why the Old-man should bee singled out, as one liable to the greatest disgrace, in respect of the curse and punishment which was laid on all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> without exemption or immunity of any age. But I will addresse my selfe to a more distinct and particular handling of this point.</p>
                  <p>There are two things inquira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it: one touching infirmity, the other concerning sicknesse.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14489:56"/>
Wee will consider of them both, and that comparatively, that it may appeare, which of the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ages of mans life is least sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this imputation.</p>
                  <p>And first of Jnfirmity: which<note place="margin">Infirmity what it is.</note> in my sense is an inclination and aptnesse in such or such an age to any thing that is evill, either in body or mind.</p>

                  <p>True it is, that our good God and provident Creator, whose tender eye is continually on this his so weake a creature (his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments

                     <hi>upon thee have I beene staied from the wombe</hi>) yet miserable is the infant consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in himselfe, in respect of this his nakednesse, which is not as that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 25. then our first Parents, when they stood upright before their Creator, were cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with admirable glory (as <hi>Chrisostome</hi> noteth) such as to which no outward covering could adde any grace, ornament, or helpe; there being then no need: but this I speake of was and is still a punishment of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne and ours: such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as (but that God reaches forth his helping hand and gives meanes in this great weakenesse
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14489:58"/>
and distresse) would expose the infant to the greatest corporall misery: and as it is, it cannot passe for better then a heavy case, a great infirmity.</p>
                  <p>Yet besides this, a most pitifull<note place="margin">Infants come into the world crying.</note> cry (ordinarily) accompanies its comming into the world; which tells us that it foresees, or rather forefeeles the innumerable miseries to which it is borne, when it lookes into the vale of teares. And so proper is this cry to its birth, that the Law suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it dead-borne, or (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon word is) still-borne, if then it cry not: if it be still at the birth and doe not testifie (by this one and onely voice or meanes it hath, to expresse it selfe and call for life and preservation) how weake it is.</p>
                  <p>These are the lamentable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14489:58"/>
of this miserable life in the Infant. And as it begins, so it continues to the end of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably-weake age, finding no great alteration or amendment, it is still apt to give notice of its paine and feeblenesse.</p>
                  <p>But see further, how this weak<note place="margin">Infants how first handled.</note> guest is afterwards entertained in this troublesome tempestuous world. Immediately after the birth, it is taken, and hands are layed on it (as if it had highly trespassed by breach of prison and comming forth of the wombe) and then presently it is bound hand and foot, which is so grievous unto it, that it doth not so much as smile (if wee will beleeve <hi>Plinie</hi>) before the fortieth day.</p>
                  <p>Of this age therefore we may truly say, that it is weakenesse

and misery in the abstract.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of the men of <hi>Thracia,</hi> that when a child was borne, the neighbours sitting round about it, were wont with great lamentation and mourning, to reckon up the many miseries with which it was to enter into this world: and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when any dyed, to carry the corps foorth with no lesse joy and rejoycing; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating the calamities from which it was delivered.

                  <p>That which hath beene said J take to be sufficient to cleare this point, that the young-mans strength and flourishing estate when it is at the highest pitch, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily makes him no whit the better nor more happy: but much

The child (as I shewed before) is as a tender twig, newly planted and

easily brought out of frame; yet flexible. Youth, the flower of mans life, is like a tree in the spring-time, beautifull in blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes, which gives hope of fruit: and though these blossoms, many times are blasted, and so the tree becomes unfruitfull, yet is it of a more yeelding disposition: and vice being not yet habituall in it or deepely rooted, is more easily nipped in the head.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14489:75"/>
they tell us that old-men are not so subject to sicknesse as the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that the reasons of it are these.

Whence it is (<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 50.</note> saith <hi>Plime</hi>) that they are lesse subject to the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

evill, which is foregon by a good life. Thou art loth to die, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? thou hast lived ill, and so art unprepared for death, know that the reason of this want of preparation is, because thou art not throughly perswaded and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that thou shalt die, nor dost truly beleeve it; hap'ly thou canst say, from a generall swimming thought of death, that we are all mortall, or the like: but a firme and constant beleefe of it, is farre from thee, for otherwise thou wouldest live in continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of thy dissolution, and prepare thy selfe for that day, that houre, knowing that then instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art brought to judgement. If newes be brought to a City, that the enemie is comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it and ready to besiege it; shall we thinke they beleeve it,

when they make no preparation for defence, <hi>Quotidiè morimur, quotidie mutamur, &amp; tamen aeternos nos esse credimus,</hi>

Or hap'ly, the reason of thy feare of death, is, thou art fast glued to thy earthly portion, thy riches, thy pleasures, thy honours, thy friends. Shake hand (at least in contentment) with these, and all will bee well, forsake them now while thou livest, and then thou canst not in regard of them, thinke death thine enemie, or that it takes either thee from them, or them from thee; if thou have thy treasure in Heaven, there thy heart will be, and from thy heart and treasure thou wilt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly; but wilt love and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

the messenger and guide which conducts thee to them; namely thy death.</p>
                  <p>But (will some man say) how can there bee happinesse in that which all men, yea all the other creatures doe shunne? for they all naturally desire to preserve their estate of being what they are, and by all meanes avoid their being dissolved.</p>
                  <p>I answer, first, Death and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution<note place="margin">How death ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and how desired.</note> is two waies to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: either simply, as it is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of a present estate, or as it is a passage to a future better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: as it is the former, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is abhor'd; but as it tends to perfection, it is both in it selfe desirable, and by the creatures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired and longed for before it comes; and when it presents it selfe, right welcome and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14489:84"/>
so was it by th' Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23, he desired to depart, or as some translate it, to be dissolved. Why? not in respect of death it selfe, but because by this death he should passe to a better life; he should live with Christ, hee should bee deliver'd from his claiey house, as that word dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved imports: or dismissed, as <hi>Beza</hi> reads it, and our newest tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation; that is, set free from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment in the body, and from the miseries of this life, and hence it is that the Apostle there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that he shall gaine by death, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. he shall gaine Christ by it, enjoy him fully, and with him glory, even the crowne which he aspires unto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. hence it is also that death is longed for, and earnestly groned after, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. neither is this true which hath
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14489:85"/>
beene said, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>onely of the faithfull among men, but of the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures also; with earnest expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they grone and travaile in paine for the day of their renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 22.</p>
                  <p>So then, it is plaine that death though it be not simply and in it selfe good and desirable, yet for that which commeth of it, it is.</p>
                  <p>And this may be further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by similitudes, with which the same Apostle doth furnish us.</p>
                  <p>First, in the place afore-named,<note place="margin">Death a pulling downe of a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. the body, our earthly mansion, is compared to a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacle, a weake and moveable house or dwelling: our heavenly habitation to a firme building, <hi>not made with hands, but eternall in the heavens,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14489:85"/>
interred bodies are likened to the<note place="margin">Death as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of seed.</note> seed which is cast into the ground, and is there corrupted and dies. I will apply these comparisons to our present purpose.</p>
                  <p>True indeed, an old weake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed house, is not in this happy, that it is taken downe, better to be in that meane estate in which it was before, then not at all to be, but herein consists the happinesse of its demolishment, that thereby it becomes a new faire building, farre more glorious in it selfe, and more profitable for use then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>So againe, the seed is not in that happy, that it is corrupted and rotted in the earth, but that <hi>corruptio unius</hi> is <hi>generatio alterius,</hi> the dying of the seed, is the life of the corne that springs from it. <hi>Thou foole,</hi> saith th' Apostle, <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:14489:86"/>
                     <hi>which thou sowest, is not quickned, except it die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see there is still hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse<note place="margin">The grave as a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths forge.</note> in death. The grave may be likened to the Gold-smiths Forge; in it our bodies are refined and polished by Gods Almighty hand, and by the power of Christs Resurrection; and they are made of corruptible incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of mortall immortall, and so that comes to passe which we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>That all things worke together for good to them that love God:</hi> it is true of afflictions which are the fore-runners of death, and true of death it selfe, and therefore the <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22.</note> Apostle tells us, <hi>that whether it bee life or death, things present, or things to come,</hi> all are ours: and well saith <note n="d" place="margin">In Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. Serm. 51.</note> Saint <hi>Bernard, Bona mors, quae vitam non aufert, sed transfert in melius,</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:14489:86"/>
O happy death that deprives us not of life, but changes this for a farre better. <hi>Dies mortis</hi> (saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca) quem tanquam extremum formidas, aeterni natalis est,</hi> How art thou deceived in thy thoughts of death? the day of thy death, which thou so much fearest as thy last day; to thee is the <hi>Birth day</hi> of eternity; and <hi>Euripides</hi> answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>vivere mori est, mori autem vivere,</hi> to live is to die, and to die is to live. <hi>viz.</hi> eternally.<note place="margin">Deaths curse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, another block lies in our way, another Objection, which must also bee answered. How blessed by that (may some man say) which is a curse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for sinne? that which God hath armed against us (as was said before) for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that doome, <hi>In the day that thou eatest, thou shalt die the death?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14489:87"/>To this I say first, that the Apostle answers it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54, 55. the most hurtfull creatures, if once they bee disarmed and weakned, cannot hurt us; much lesse when they are overcome and slaine for us, and to our hand, as we say; so is death, Christ hath taken away the sting of it, and conquer'd it, and all adverse power that might stop our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to Heaven. And as when <hi>Goliah</hi> was overcome by <hi>David,</hi> this victory made all the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> for whom hee fought, Conquerours, and freed them from the power of the enemie: so our <hi>David,</hi> having overcome and conquered death, we are safe, being all more then Conquerours by and in him.<note place="margin">Other ages as liable to death as Old-age.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, the second point fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which I proposed for the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14489:87"/>
answering of this last accusation (that Old-age is a neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to death:) <hi>viz.</hi> that other ages are as liable to it as this, and many times as neere.</p>
                  <p>It is observed <note n="e" place="margin">Hugo de Claustro.</note> by one, that there are three messengers of death, casuality, sicknesse, and Old-age.</p>
                  <p>Casualities and the unhappy<note place="margin">Casualties befall all ages.</note> accidents that doe befall men, and shorten their lives, are indeed many, somewhere whole Cities have beene overthrowne by earthquakes, others burnt up by lightnings: some by fire: whole regions swallowedup by the earths gaping for them, many men and places destroyed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of the sea, and many other casualities happen daily; a haire drunke in milke, a stone in a grape, a small bone in a fish, have
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14489:88"/>
beene meanes of choaking, some have dyed with suddaine joy. Warres, and the Pestilence, how many thousands doe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure? a multitude of such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there are: but no age is more free from these messengers, then this we speake of, and that for these reasons. First, because this is an age of the best temper and greatest moderation, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, whereby divers of those dangers are avoided. Secondly, because it is not so much in bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action, as the rest. Thirdly, for that it mooves lesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stirres lesse abroad, giving it selfe to retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Fourthly, it is not prest to the warres, where death compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses men about, and is daily and hourely expected. Besides, it is free from quarrells, and lesse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to surfettings, to breaking and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14489:88"/>
disjoynting of limbs, or to dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the second messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">Deseases befall all.</note> of death, Bodily diseases, they are in other ages moe, more sharpe, and more incurable: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man will grant it.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that though these<note place="margin">Every age hath a more certaine period then Old-Age.</note> two messengers should passe by Old-men, yet their age it selfe will stand ready every houre to arrest them. I answer, that neither is that so; for <note n="f" place="margin">Tho. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. Sent. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct 43. artic 3.</note> the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tells us that OLD-AGE sometimes equals all the other in yeeres and durance, and whereas of the rest there is a certaine set pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod and end; of this there is none: for no man knowes when an Old-man shall die, and cease to be an Old-man. <note n="g" place="margin">In epist. quadam.</note> Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> tells us, that <hi>Nemotam fractis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus &amp; decrepitae senectutis est, quin</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:14489:89"/>
                     <hi>non se putet unum adhuc annum esse victurum,</hi> that there is not any in strength so decayed, and in age so decrepit, as not to thinke he shall live yet one yeere longer.</p>
                  <p>Further we know that the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest<note place="margin">No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of life.</note> hath no lease, no certainty of the number of his daies; and therefore must still be in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, as well as the aged: for it behooves him that hath no set day for his debt, to be at all times <hi>solvendo,</hi> ready for payment. <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say, that to Old-men death stands before them continually in their sight; but to young- men hee lurks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that unawares he may come upon them, as an enemy that lies<note place="margin">Distemper of former agesmakes Old-Age the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> in ambush.</p>
                  <p>The third part of my answer remaines: which retorts the fault (if it be one) of Old-ages being
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14489:89"/>
so neere to death, upon the true cause of it: <hi>viz.</hi> mens intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and disorder in the former part of their life. I will briefly passe through the particular fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ages.</p>
                  <p>In Infancy many times the<note place="margin">Causes of infants death.</note> milke in the nursing, or food, when it hath left the brest, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holsome: whereby an ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is laid for the bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. And heere (by the way) I cannot but blame the indiscreet peremptorinesse of some, who doubt not to make this a generall rule or Maxim, that God never makes the wombe fruitfull, and the brest barren: and thereupon stick not to conclude, that no woman may put forth her childe<note place="margin">In what cases chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be put out to nurse.</note> to nurse: true, not of nicenesse, and to shunne the paines and trouble of it. Yet it cannot be denied,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14489:90"/>
that there are many cases in which the mother not onely may refuse this office (which in it selfe is most naturall, I confesse, and lies neerely upon her) but is a cruell mother to her child (to say nothing of her selfe) if shee doe otherwise: for what weaknesse, and how many deseases may bee derived from a mother (in some cases, I say, and of some constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) to the child, to its utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and undoing? and besides, it is not true that the mothers breasts are never dry: nor that there can be no other thing, that may justly excuse her refusing to be a nurse. But I leave the digression, having but occasionally and by the way fallen upon it. And now further I say, that often through want of attendance the poore infant falls into many mischiefes; all which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14489:90"/>
it carries with it to Old-age, if the grave prevent it not.</p>
                  <p>Child-hood is subject to as great distempers and hurts.</p>
                  <p>The Young-man is next, and<note place="margin">Causes of death in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> his affections for the most part, are strong and violent (as hath beene shewed) whatsoever comes of him, he resolves to please his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite in diet, to satisfie his desire of pleasures in immoderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, and to nourish the pride of his bodily strength and active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in violent exercises, and his lusts also in wantonnesse, and then no marvaile if an intemperate youth leaves to OLD-AGE a weake and worne-out body.</p>
                  <p>Of mature, or the ripe age,<note place="margin">Causes of death in man-age.</note> what shall we say? that (a man would thinke) will be wary of doing wrong to so good, so neere a neighbour as OLD-AGE is to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14489:91"/>
it. Yet we know, and cannot but observe so much, that the two vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before noted do adhere to it; covetousnesse and ambition put men upon many labours, toyles and attempts, which hotly and eagerly pursued, according to the extent of their desires; cause sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings and bring many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">Evill of former ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Old-Age</note> and diseases upon it: which tend directly to death.</p>
                  <p>Now all these evills in the end, fall to the lot of the Old-man, brought upon him (as we see) by the foregoing part of his life; and therefore to it they must be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and it may truly be said, that if Old-men bee neere to death, they are thrust upon it by their predecessours, the former ages. <note n="h" place="margin">Ita <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

heape is growne great for succour and food: so to Old-men all the forenamed good things come in, and crowne this age with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of blessings: If (I say) the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going times have not beene sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unprofitable servants to their Master for whom they were all set a worke. So tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the eye of Gods providence cast on the Old-Man, that hee takes order for his being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furnished with all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, before he brings him to this infirme bodily estate. As at the Creation man was not made, till God had in a readinesse for him, the whole worlds provision.</p>
                  <p>But soft, will some man say: let not the Old-man vaunt too much of the good hee receives from the times past and gone: they store up evill to him as well as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14489:97"/>
good: they daily set him on the score, and he must pay all when the reckoning comes in. A disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly impenitent fore-led life brings heapes of wrath upon him, and the heavie burden of sin, then when he is least able to beare it: to say nothing of other distresses in his temporall estate.

Now when wee see innocency suffer, how will it affect us? with contempt, or commiseration? surely if OLD-AGE be in any man so happy (in some by Gods gracious working it is) as to make a Comedy of that which

this, That many yeares and long<note place="margin">Old-Age an helpe to grace.</note> life is no small help this way; and that in divers respects: First, in regard of the time it gives for it.

Thirdly, because God the best and richest, the bountifullest master doth give the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to them that have served him longest.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the first. Time and<note place="margin">Fit time and place must bee for every thing.</note> place fit and convenient must be granted to every thing. As it was said by the grand Enginer <hi>Archimedes, Da ubi consistam &amp; movebo terram:</hi> set mee in a fit place, and I will move the earth: so saith the skilfull and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, give me time, and I will worke wonders. Time it is, by which being and increase is given
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14489:98"/>
to every creature. Six daies God tooke for the Creating of the world, and all things in it; that short time hee allotted to that worke: and the rest of time he hath appointed for his providence in governing whatsoever he hath made: for his preserving, ordering, and blessing with growth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease every creature, and each good thing hee hath bestowed on it. From hence it will follow,<note place="margin">Old-Age hath best meanes for grace.</note> that the men to whom God hath granted a long time and many yeeres, have by it the better meanes and helps for adding still more and more to the grace they have received. As, to insist in some particulars: they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to more knowledge then others, and a riper judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. the Apostle compares the Word of God to food: and the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14489:99"/>
hearers &amp; learners of it he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes according to the severall kinds of food. The Word hath milk, the first principles &amp; easiest parts of it; and that is for children and babes in Christ. It hath also stronger meate, points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine more hard to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: this is for men of riper age in Christianity, such as through custome, have their wits exercised to discerne betweene good and evill, as in that place, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. the difference there is in the time: <hi>Concerning the time</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>yee ought to be teachers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14489:101"/>
in their elder yeares, they were the trumpets of the Gospell in preaching: Martyrs in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: and with knowledge, faith, constancy, zeale, and all manner of gifts miraculously furnished. It is true: This was not to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed chiefly to time (as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the other encrease afore mentioned) but to the mighty working of the Spirit in them yet this, that increase of age, or time, gave opportunity for it, cannot be denied.</p>

                  <p>The next Reason to prove that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14489:101"/>
many yeeres give great helpe to increase of grace; is from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it. It is naturally apt, yea mighty and powerfull in growth. Whence it followes, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it continues in any, the more it may grow and increase: and OLD-AGE affoords time for it. As the Word of God, from which it arises and springs, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> is <hi>immortall seed,</hi> and the sower, or Seeds-man, God himselfe, the most skilfull and Almighty Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man, who with the same hand, <hi>plants, waters, and gives the increase:</hi> so the grace and fruit it selfe, is in such manner blessed by the worker of it, as that it hath power to grow abundantly.</p>
                  <p>In the first of <hi>Geneses, ver.</hi> 28. It is said, that God blessed his creatures by giving them power to bring forth fruit, and multiply,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14489:102"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as the blessing upon those reasonlesse creatures was for increase, and conveyed to them a power for the same, which wee call the Law of nature: so the other blessing upon man, gives power likewise, not onely for naturall propagation, but also for spirituall growth; which we may call the Law of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God by the gracious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Spirit, confers on it this power of increasing. Now, as time is required for it, so the more time (which is a priviledge of OLD-AGE) the more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and meanes. <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 13 11.</note> 
                     <hi>When I was a child</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man, I put away childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The seeds of grace, when they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14489:102"/>
are first sowne, are the least of all seeds: yet growth (by time) makes them the greatest: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour instances for it, <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 13. 31.</note>

The third and last, is taken from Gods speciall love and respect to an old servant, (a point before touched) and his bounty in rewarding him above others. Every good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster doth so: and God is the best Lord that any creature can serve. He rewards, not onely at the end of the day, when all our worke is done, with a crowne of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but, the meane while, in the Kingdome of Grace likewise while we are in working, and even by meanes of our work, and for it (as our reward) with a greater

measure of grace, even heere in this life. Such a servant shall dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his talents, and thereupon bee made <hi>ruler over much, and enter into his Masters joy.</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14489:104"/>
reward of righteousnesse in whomsoever. I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belongs to the very age of an Old-Man: for it is certaine, and will not be denied, that men in yeeres, even for their yeeres, are to be ranked among the Fathers meant in the fift Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now to all Fathers is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there allotted, asto Fathers; and therfore even for this to Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Magistrate in the Common-weale, the Minister in the Church, the Father and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in a Family have right to it, as they are Fathers. May the subject, or the flock and people, or the child and servant withhold this Honour, in case the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med superiours doe faile of what is required of them? no man may, no man will say it. The meaning of the place therefore,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14489:104"/>
I conceive to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, That when the Old-man is not old one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also vertuous, then his honour is much the greater, even a crowne of glory, as is also the Magistrates, the Ministers, the Fathers and the Masters. In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. it is said, <hi>That the Elders which rule well, are worthy of double honour,</hi> of honour (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse no man will gaine-say it) as they are Elders and Rulers; but when they rule well, the honour must be doubled upon them. So in that place of the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> it is plaine therefore, that honour is due to Old-men, even for their yeeres, which is a priviledge not granted to any of the other ages.</p>

                  <p>THis also falls to the lot of<note place="margin">Retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a priviledge</note> OLD-AGE. And a sweet priviledge it is, when a man hath leave <hi>secum esse</hi> and <hi>secum vivere,</hi> as the Proverbe is, to be by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe after that he hath attained the <hi>pabulum animi,</hi> the soules pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, of which God gives grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter store (or at least meanes for it) to the greatest storer, the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

of it, for that all Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses depend upon this duty, <hi>Aske and yee shall have: Call upon mee and I will deliver thee.</hi> Secondly, the incouragement, in that God invites us to it, calls upon us to call upon him (which may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden us to come unto the throne of grace.) Thirdly, the strictnesse of the command con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this part of Gods service. Fourthly, the many examples of the faithfull that hereby have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God. Fiftly, Gods gracing it, in that it is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture usually put for the whole service or worship of God, as <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 32.

we have our conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven: and the objects of this heavenly Exercise are many.

The workes of God also: the Creation, Preservation, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; and therein Gods glory, in his Power, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Goodnesse, Mercy, Justice, and his other Attributes. Our owne particular estate likewise: how miserable in our selves, how happy through Gods mercy in Christ Jesus. Our frailty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our lives heere; the last judgement, Heaven and the joyes thereof, to bring us to them: Hell, and its torments, to keepe us from them: and other

What pleasure and delight hee tooke in reading these things, his Psalmes doe abundantly testifie.
