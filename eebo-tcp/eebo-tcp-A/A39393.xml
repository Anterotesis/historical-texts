            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </label>
            </p>
            <p>THe Town of <hi>Little Yarmouth</hi> hath formerly enjoyed the priviledges of lading and unlading Herrings, and other Merchandize, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and importing Goods, of all ſorts, in Veſſels of their own, for many years formerly; whereby it came to be in a very flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <label>From what cauſe it is faln into Decay.</label>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> having by their much greater power procured ſeveral Grants and Letters-Patents from the Kings and Queens of this Nation, upon many plauſible and ſpecious pretences, whereby they appropriated to themſelves, and thoſe who are Free-men of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> the Monopoly of lading and unlading all ſorts of Merchandize within ſeven miles of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> whereby the Town of <hi>Little Yarmouth</hi> were neceſſitated to forſake their habitations for want of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereby the ſaid Town in a ſhort time fell into decay, and became almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the Inhabitants.</p>

                  <hi>By what Authority the Town of</hi> Little Yarmouth <hi>hath its former Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges reſtored and enlarged.</hi>
               </label>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Little Yarmouth</hi> is not only incorporated with the Town of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> to partake and enjoy equal Priviledges with them, by an Act of Parliament made in the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth year of the Reign of our Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Entituled, <hi>An Act for ſetling of differences between the Towns of</hi> Great <hi>and</hi> Little Yarmouth, <hi>touching the lading and unlading Herrings, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize;</hi> but alſo by Letters-Patents from the King, bearing date the tenth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> in the twentieth year of this preſent King: and hath as well by the ſaid Act, as Letters-Patents, this priviledge above any other Corporation in <hi>England,</hi> that the Inhabitants of this place, from their firſt habitation, are intituled to all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it, as much as if they had purchaſed their Freedome, for which in <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> men pay thirty, forty, fifty pounds, or had ſerved an Apprenticeſhip.</p>

               </label>
            </p>
            <p>Within a mile on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of the Town, lies the Main Ocean; on the <hi>North-weſt</hi> is the River called <hi>Brayden,</hi> where three Rivers (<hi>Wavenee,</hi> which parts the Counties of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk; Yare,</hi> which runs through the City of Norwi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which comes from the North-parts of <hi>Norfolk</hi>) meet; from whence this River falls <hi>Eaſt</hi> and by <hi>South;</hi> and before it runs into the Sea, continues its courſe on the Key of <hi>Yarmouth.</hi> By theſe three Rivers to the Landward, all ſorts of the growths and Manufactures of theſe Countries are with great eaſe and little charge brought to <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth:</hi> And up theſe ſtreams, the Town of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> with like eaſe and ſmall charge, furniſhes thoſe Countries with all ſorts of Forreign and Domeſtick Commodities; and this done with much facility, by reaſon the Flux of the Sea doth make the Current into the Country, almoſt equal with the Current out of the Country.</p>
            <p>As the Town is naturally ſeated with theſe advantages for the Trade of theſe Countries above any other of the Eaſtern Coaſt, ſo it lies in the ſame Latitude as <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> and by conſequence, more convenient then any other Town on the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> for the trade of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and almoſt equal with <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> for the trade of <hi>Hambrough,</hi> the <hi>Haunce</hi>-Towns, the <hi>Baltick</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi> It is moreover inriched above any Town in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or perhaps in the world, with a yearly Revenue of the Fiſhing-trade; which if it were mannaged and improved to the beſt advantage, might equallize, if not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to the Dutch Fiſhing-trade. But this for many years, by reaſon of this Towns appropriating this trade to a few hands, hath both rendred this trade uſeleſs to the reſt of this Nation, beſides the Free-men of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> who have not Veſſels enough to maintain the ſame; but hath alſo given the Dutch an opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt gainers by it, who have for many years laſt paſt brought over their Buſſes, and other Fiſhing Veſſels, and have taken the Herrings on this Coaſt, and brought the ſame into <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and ſold the ſame to them for ready money; which money might as well have been got by our ſelves, and kept at home.</p>
            <p>Though this place be thus naturally and advantagiouſly ſeated for trade, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and at home, yet it is no way conveniently built for it: for the back-part thereof is ſo narrowly built in Lanes, or Rows, as no acceſs can be made to it but by Barrows, uſed no where in <hi>England</hi> but in this place, and for this reaſon only: beſides, the houſes are built ſo low, as alſo being ſtreightned for Ware-houſe-room, they cannot receive ſuch quantities of Merchandize as their trades are capable of. And though the houſes to the Key are fair and well built, yet they are not of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent capacity to entertain the fourth part of ſuch Merchants as might trade upon the account of this Harbour; neither have they the conveniencies of freſh water.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, by reaſon of the advantages aforeſaid, they have and do flouriſh and proſper in trade above any other Town in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow;</hi> which they are able to do upon their own account, without any dependency of any other place.</p>

                  <hi>The Scituation of</hi> Little Yarmouth.</label>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Little Yarmouth</hi> lies <hi>South</hi> and by <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Great Yarmouth,</hi> on <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſide, upon the ſame River, oppoſite to the ſaid Town; and ſo is equally capable of all Forreign and Domeſtick trade, as <hi>Great Yarmouth;</hi> and capable of a farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the building may be built more commodious and convenient for trade.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Theſe buildings may be continued further upon that River, then they can be in <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Channel runs deeper on this ſide then it doth on the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath the conveniency of freſh water.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Priviledges are greater then the Town of <hi>Great Yarmouth:</hi> for if any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor in any houſe already built, or to be built, ſhall be willing to let out his houſe to any under-Tenant, he ſhall ſooner have a Chapman for his houſe then thoſe of <hi>Great Yarmouth</hi> ſide; ſuch Tenant being by his Tenure a Free-man of <hi>Great Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> as well as <hi>Little Yarmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town to be built is contrived with all imaginable conveniencies as to the Key, for lading and unlading Merchandize, convenient Warehouſe-room, Storehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Cellerage, or any other conveniences whatſoever.</p>

               <p>And for his or their further direction, he ſhall, before he proceed in his building, have a printed paper directing him therein.</p>
               <p>There is no further Obligation on the Undertaker, then his building even with his Neighbours in the front, and no higher: he may build backward as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Undertakers alſo have the advantage of the Key of fifty foot wide, only for Wharfing and repairing the ſame, where they may have liberty to lay their goods.</p>
               <p>Materials in this place for building are very reaſonable: as, Brick eleven ſhillings or twelve ſhillings a thouſand; Lyme made juſt upon the place; Oaken Timber brought down by the three Rivers at reaſonable rates; Firr-timber and Deal very reaſonable, being juſt againſt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> Ships going daily from this Harbour thither.

               <p>The buildings here deſigned, and ſuitable to the place, are to be two Stories and a half high, beſides Cellars: ſo one hundred, or one hundred and twenty pounds, will build an indifferent large and convenient habitation.</p>

It is contrived and propoſed, that every eighty, or one hundred foot front, ſhall have a free Key belonging to thoſe which build in this Street, as alſo a back-Row, or Lane, in every eighty or one hundred foot, which is to be ten foot wide; out of which Lane they may diſcharge their carriages of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize into their Warehouſes, ſo that their houſes need not to be troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: by which means the greateſt part of the Town will be as commodious, as if it were all to be built on the Key.</p>
               <p>The oppoſite buildings which are to front theſe on the other ſide, are to be built in this manner following:</p>
               <p>The Street to be thirty eight foot wide, and to be built as the other ſide. Thoſe houſes which have the ſame dimenſions in front and depth, are to pay twenty pence <hi>per annum</hi> for every foot front, and a hundred foot deep.</p>
               <p>The Proprietors in the ground are willing to erect a convenient Market and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the old place, at their own proper coſts and charges.</p>
