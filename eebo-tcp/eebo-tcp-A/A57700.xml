         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am commanded by the House of Commons to present to your Lordships, a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Impeachment against Dr. <hi>Cossens</hi> and others upon the complaint of Master <hi>Peter Smart</hi>; which Master <hi>Smart</hi> was a Protomartir or first Confessor of note in the late dayes of persecution: the whole matter is a Tree whereof the branches and fruits are manifest in the Articles of this Declaration, which being read, I shall with your Lordships favour, discover and lay open the roote.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Declaration was read, and then hee proceeded as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Am now to discover the Roote of Master <hi>Smarts</hi> persecution, your Lordships have heard of a great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49805:3"/>
designe to bring in Popery, you have heard of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Souldiers, and particularly of the Popish <hi>Irish</hi> Army, the burthen and complaint of the Commons; but there is another Army not so much spoken off, and that is an Army of Priests, for since Altars came in, so they delight to be called; it is a saying of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, that when Antichrist comes, <hi>Preparatus est exercitus Sacerdotum</hi>; there is an Army of Priests ready to receive him, this is fulfilled in our time, for certainely this Army of Priests doth many waies advance the designes and plots of Popery.</p>
            <p>A first way is by the subversion of our Lawes and governement, our Lawes and Popery cannot stand together; but either Popery must overthrow our Lawes, or our Lawes must overthrow Popery: but to overthrow our Lawes, they must first over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Parliaments, and to overthrow Parliaments they must overthrow property, they must bring the Subjects goods to bee arbitrarily disposed that so there may bee no need of Parliaments: this hath beene done by Doctor <hi>Manwaring,</hi> whom we finde wanting, yet not in the seates but the Barre of the Lords house, and the like by Doctor <hi>Beale,</hi> and I thinke it was the intention of the late Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
            <p>A second way by which this Army of Priests advanceth the Popish designe, is the way of Treaty, this hath beene acted both by writings and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences <hi>Sancta Clara</hi>: himselfe saith, <hi>Doctissimi eorum quibuscunque</hi>: So it seemes they have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference together, &amp; <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> on his part labours to bring the Articles of our Church into Popery
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49805:3"/>
and some of our side strive to meete him in that way, Wee have a Testimonie that the great Arch-Priest himselfe hath said: It were no hard matter to make a reconciliation, if a wise man had the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off it; but I verily beleeve that as the state of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy stands, a far wiser man than he, cannot reconcile us, without the losse of our Religion. For the Pope being fastned to his errours, even by his chaire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errability, he sits still unmooved, and so wee cannot meete, except we come wholly to him.</p>
            <p>A man standing in a Boate tyde to a Rocke, when he draweth the rop, doth not draw the Rocke to the Boate, but the boate to the Rock. And <hi>Sa. Clara</hi> doth in this somewhat honestly confesse it; for hee saith, that he dealt in this way of Treaty, not to draw the Church to the Protestants, but the Protestants to the Church.</p>
            <p>A third way, is a way of violence, this violence they exercise partly by secular Armes, and partly by priestly Armes, which they call spirituall, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Armes, we have their own confession; that the late Warre was <hi>Bellum Episcopale,</hi> and we have the Papists confession, that it was <hi>Bellum Papale.</hi> For in their motives they say, that the Warre concernes them not only as subjects, but as Catholiques, for so they falsly call themselves: and if it be so, then <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Episcopale</hi> is also <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> and in the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall-Warre, the Papall cause is advanced, for the spirituall Armes thus they come to execution.</p>
            <p>When a great man is comming, his Sumpters, his Furniture, his Provision goes before, the Popes furniture, Altars and Copes, Pictures and Images, are come before: And if wee beleeve Dr. <hi>Cossens,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49805:4"/>
the very substance of the Masse, a certain signe that the Pope was not afarre of.</p>
            <p>Now these fore-runners being come, if any man resist them, fire comes out of the Brambles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi>: the Army of the Priests falls upon him, with their Armies of Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sequestration, Excommunication, Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Deprivation; and by these Armies hath Master <hi>Smart</hi> been oppressed and undon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: He falls upon their Superstitions and Innovations, and they fall upon him with their Armies, they beate him downe: yea, they pull him up by the Rootes, taking away all his meanes of Maintenance and Living: yet they leave him life to feele his misery: <hi>Ita feriunt, ut diu se sentiat mori,</hi> there is no cruelty to Priestly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. These are they that did put our very <hi>Saviour</hi> to death, the Calling is reverend; but the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is most pernicious: <hi>Corruptio optimi pessima,</hi> I know no reason of this change, except it be that of the Apostle, <hi>because when they knew God, they did not worship him as God</hi>; but made a God of the World, placing the excellency of Priest-hood in worldly pompe and greatnesse, and gave the glory of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissible God,</hi> to Pictures, Images and Altars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gave them up to vile affections, to bee Implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unmercifull, and without naturall affection:</hi> But whatsoever the cause is of corruption, certainly their Armies have fallen heavily upon Mr. <hi>Smart,</hi> and Priestly cruelty hath cast him into a long misery, from which hee could get no release by any Priestly mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49805:4"/>And now it is pray'd, that as these <hi>Delinquints</hi> by the cruell oppressions of Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> have advanced the cause of Popery, so they may in such a degree of Justice be punished, that in them Priestly cruilty, and the very cause of Popery may appeare to bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and suppressed, and that Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> suffering for the cause of Protestancy, may be so repayed, that in him pious constancy, and the very cause of Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy may appeare to be righted and repaired.</p>
