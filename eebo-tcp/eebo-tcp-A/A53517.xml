            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen first it entered into my thoughts to make this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Your Lordship, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not onely Encouragement, but Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, since upon due examination of my self, I found it was not a bare Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but my Duty to the remembrance of many extraordinary Favours which I have received at Your hands.</p>
            <p>For heretofore having had the honour to be near You, and bred under the same Discipline with You, I cannot but own, that in a great measure I owe the small share of Letters I have to Your Lordship. For Your Lordship's Example taught me to be asham'd of Idleness; and I first grew in love with Books, and learnt to value them, by the wonderfull Progress which even in Your tender years You made in them; so that Learning and Improvement
<pb facs="tcp:59653:3"/>
grew daily more and more lovely in my Eyes, as they shone in You.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship has an extraordinary Reason to be a Patron of Poetry, for Your great Father loved it. May Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Fame and Employments grow as great, or greater then His were; and may Your Vertues find a Poet to record them, equall (if possible) to that great <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Waller.</hi>
               </note> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius which sung of him.</p>
            <p>My slender humble Talent must not hope for it; for You have a Judgment which I must always submit to, a general Goodness which I never (to its worth) can value: and who can praise that well which he knows not how to comprehend?</p>
            <p>Already the Eyes and Expectations of men of the best Judgement are fixt upon You: for wheresoever You come, You have their Attention when present, and their Praise when You are gone: and I am sure (if I obtain but Your Lordship's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) I shall have the Congratulation of all my friends, for having taken this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to express my self</p>

                     <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, 'tis now even Thirteen years. Young <hi>Marius</hi> then too was but a Boy. My <hi>Lais</hi> and she were both of an Age. Well, <hi>Lais</hi> is in Happiness: she was too good for me. But as I was saying, a month hence she 'll be Sixteen. 'Tis since <hi>Marius</hi> triumph'd now full Thirteen years, and then she was weaned. Sure I shall never forget it of all days.... Upon that day, (for I had then laid Wormseed to my Breast, sitting in the Sun under the Dove-house-Wall) my Lady and you were at the Show. Nay, I do bear a Brain! but, as I said before, when it did tast the Wormseed on my Nipple, and felt it bitter, pretty Fool! to see it teachy and fall out with the Nipple. Shout quo' the people in the streets. 'Twas no need, I trow, to bid me trudge. And since that time it is Thirteen years; and then she cou'd stand alone, nay, she cou'd run and waddle all about: for just the day before, she broke her Forehead, and then my Husband (Peace he with him, he was a merry man) took up the Baggage. Ay, quoth he, dost thou fall upon thy Face? thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; wilt thou not, <hi>Vinny?</hi> and by my fackings, the pretty Chit left Crying, and said, Ay.... I warrant and I should live a Thousand years, I never should forget it. Wilt thou not, <hi>Vinny?</hi> quoth he; and, pretty Fool, it stopt, and said, Ay.</p>

                  <p>Yes, my Lord: yet I cannot chuse but laugh, to think it should leave Crying, and say, Ay.... And yet in sadness it had a Bump on its Brow as big as a Cockrill's stone, a parlous Knock, and it cry'd bitterly. Ay, quo' my Husband, fall'st upon thy Face? thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to Age, wilt thou not, <hi>Vinny?</hi> Look you now, it stinted, and said, Ay....</p>

                  <l>But, just as you were all, to stay at home.</l>
                  <l>And now for you who here come wrapt in Cloaks,</l>
                  <l>Only for love of <hi>Underhill</hi> and Nurse <hi>Nokes;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Our Poet says, one day to a Play ye come,</l>
                  <l>Which serves ye half a year for Wit at home.</l>
                  <l>But which amongst you is there to be found,</l>
                  <l>Will take his third day's Pawn for Fifty pound?</l>
                  <l>Or, now is he Cashier'd, will fairly venture</l>
                  <l>To give him ready Money for's Debenture?</l>
                  <l>Therefore when he receiv'd that Fatall Doom,</l>
                  <l>This Play came forth, in hopes his Friends would come</l>
                  <l>To help a poor Disbanded Souldier home.</l>
