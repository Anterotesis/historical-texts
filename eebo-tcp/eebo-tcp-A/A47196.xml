            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>m from this Rough and Foul Spirit that was riſen up; and the Lord did anſwer me in my Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That this Spirit was riſen up for the Tryal of hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95769:3"/>And ſo, when the Lord hath tryed his People, and their ſingleneſs to him, and when this Spirit hath ſpent its Strength, and gone the Way of all that hath riſen before it, Then they may ſee how all things work together for the good of them that love God. And therefore ſtand faſt in the Liberty where-with Chriſt hath made you free, in his Light, Grace and Truth, and Power, and Spirit, and Faith, to Chriſt, from whence it comes, Chriſt your Rock and Foundation, that cannot be ſhaken, and in whom is your Election, Life and Salvation. So that all may ſtand to Chriſt their Lord and Maſter, to be ordered by him, with his glorious Goſpel, which is not of Man, but from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>For I ſaw all Friends as if they were bedewed from Heaven, and they ſate as in a Valley, and wet with the Dew of Life; and the other hard dead Spirit was floating a top with the Words of Truth, which Spirit is for the Tryal of his People, of their ſtanding singly in the Life, to God, upon their own Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>So as I was at Prayer, the Lord anſwered me, That this Spirit of <hi>J. S. J.
