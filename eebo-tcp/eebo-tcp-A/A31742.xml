            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF THOSE TWO <hi>Proteſtants in Maſquerade.</hi> HERACLITUS, AND The Obſervator.</head>
            <p>THey are Teeming Animals, that ſwell with Noiſe and Nonſence, but onely bring forth a Penny Pamphlet. No ſooner is the Travel over, but the Weekly Infants are ſnatch'd from the Boſom of their Parents, and being hurried into Publick, they create a Diſturbance with their clamorous Shrieks. No ſooner do the troubleſom Brats yelp themſelves into ſilence, and expire, but another Iſſue is ſucceſſively continued; and if the timely Caution of a <hi>London</hi> Grand-Jury had not broke their Crain-Eggs, the numerous Progeny might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd the State. They are the Offenſive Humours of the Body-Politick, and at laſt are broke out in the Itch of Scribling. They are the fatal Doſe of unqualified <hi>Mercury,</hi> that in ſtead of carrying away the Obſtructions of the Body, ſtrike up the Malignancy to the Head. They pretend to heal Breaches, and to regulate the State; but are as unfit, as a Common Strumpet is for a Lady Abbeſs, or a Novice in Military Experience for the Conduct of an Army. They arraign Officers, and cancel the very Private Acts of Magiſtrates; as if a Word muſt not be ſpoke, but theſe ſawcie Scriblers muſt make the Comment. They are two gaudy Blazing Stars, that would appear at once both Terrible and Beautiful. They are compos'd of the Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Vapours of an unquiet State, and are ſet a-fire by their own Sulphureous Nature. They would admoniſh and deter, yet only portend their own Fate; and whilſt the gazing Multitude devoutly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, the inflam'd Jellys conſume themſelves, and diſappear. They are the Speaking Trumpet of a deſigning Jeſuit, and are onely Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental loudly to proclaim what he privately whiſpers; but when the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41856:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Intrigue is accompliſh'd, the ſerviceable Utenſil is laid by as uſeleſs. They'l ſuffer none to ſhare in the Senſe of the Nation, or in the leaſt to pretend to that thing call'd Wit, beſides themſelves; and yet the Man that believes their Talent to be ſo extraordinary, muſt have more Faith than they have Senſe, ay, to that degree of a grain of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed. They are elaborately dull: but with Induſtry and Toil at laſt they produce an inſignificant Sheet; but ſo ſtuff'd with blunt Raillery, and <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Invectives, that the Language of the ſharp-nos'd Sluts is, in compariſon, modiſh Complaiſance, and good Breeding. Take but a Pair of Oars from <hi>Black-friars</hi> to <hi>Whitehall</hi> Stairs, and the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy will furniſh you with as much Matter as will complete a dozen of theſe Pamphlets, with a great deal of Applauſe after the Publication. The Apprentice that miſ-call'd <hi>Haraclitus, Heteroclitus,</hi> made a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent miſtake, and very adapt; for ſo irregularly doth his two Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Dialogize, that ſometimes <hi>Jeſt</hi> is very ſeverely in Earneſt, and <hi>Earneſt</hi> reciprocally encroacheth upon his Fellow-Babblers Prerogative, and accidentally ſtumbles upon a Quibble: And when the faultring Fancy of the jaded Author is at a ſtand, he is forced to be beholden to the Publiſher to fill up the bottom of the Sheet with a Train of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. Now and then you ſhall perceive them nibling at Hiſtory; but you ſhall find more in the very Title Page of a <hi>Livy,</hi> than in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their inſignificant Scribbles. They are the Weekly Fomenters of Feuds and Diviſions, and prejudge all that diſſent from their Perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are ſure that <hi>Care, Curtis,</hi> and <hi>Janeway</hi> will come to the Gallows; but I am afraid their Prophetick Faculty will fail them: ſo induſtrious was <hi>Haman</hi> to erect a Gibbet for <hi>Mordecai.</hi> They are thoſe <hi>Sicilian Satyrs</hi> mentioned in <hi>Polybius,</hi> that in the <hi>Interludium</hi> of a Parliament do wantonly bask themſelves upon the Plains, and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly indulge their own Brutality; but when the Seaſon alters, and the Honourable Senate is aſſembled, then they daſtardly return to their Caves and Groves, and are content to vent their uneaſie Malice in private Ruminations. They are a Couple of <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-Fair Merry <hi>Andrews,</hi> that to incite the Charity of a Bookſeller, and provoke the Reader to a forc'd Laughter, will Ape themſelves into any Antick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. So beaſtly ſeveral times are their Expreſſions, and ſo offenſive to a modeſt Ear, that as they have been Preſented for Reflexion and Diſturbance, ſo let them be Indicted for Nuſance. They pretend 'tis their Loyal Inclination, and Duty to their Sovereign, that obligeth them to this Scribling Diligence: But <hi>Hannibal</hi> might as well have believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Hanno</hi> was his Friend, becauſe he publickly applauded his Actions: For what Circumſtantials is there of Loyalty, where Feuds and Diſſentions are fomented? They are Slaves to Intereſt, and have no more Loyalty than what they are paid for. They are byaſs'd by Neceſſity; and 'tis as eaſie for one that would undertake it, to turn the Current of their Ink another way, as it is for a Money'd Man to ſubborn a Perjurer.</p>
