         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ By the King.</head>
            <head>¶ A Proclamation for restraint of the disordered trading
for Tobacco.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Wee, out of the dislike Wee had of</hi> the vse of
Tobacco, tending to a generall and new corruption both of mens bodies and
maners, and yet neuerthelesse holding it of the two more tolerable, that the
same should be imported amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vanities and superfluities, which
came from beyond the Seas, then permitted to be planted here within this
Realme, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to abuse and misimploy the soile of this fruitfull Kingdome,
did by Our Proclamation dated the thirtieth day of December now last past
straitly charge and commaund all and euery person and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of what degree
or condition soeuer, That they or any of them by themselues, their seruants,
workemen or labourers, should not from and after the second day of February
then next following, presume to sow, set or plant, or cause to be sowen, set or
planted within this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> and the Dominion of Wales,
any sort or kinde of Tobacco whatsoeuer, and that they, or any of them, should
not maintaine or continue any olde stockes or plants of Tobacco formerly sowen
or planted, but should forthwith vtterly destroy and root vp the same. And
whereas We haue taken into Our Royall consideration aswell the great waste and
consumption of the wealth of Our Kingdomes, as the endangering &amp; impairing
the health of Our Subiects, by the inordinate libertie and abuse of Tobacco,
being a weede of no necessary vse, and but of late yeeres brought into Our
Dominions, and being credibly informed, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Tobacconists, and other
meane persons taking vpon them to trade and aduenture into the parts beyond the
Seas for Tobacco, to the intent to forestall and engrosse the said commoditie,
vpon vnmerchantlike conditions, doe transport much Gold bullion and Coyne out
of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and doe barter and vent the Staple commodities of Our Realme
at vnder-values, to the intent to buy Tobacco, to the discredit of Our natiue
merchandizes, and extreame enhansing of the rates and prices of Tobacco, and
the great disturbance and decay of the Trade of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and good Merchant:
We taking the premisses into Our Princely consideration, and being desirous to
put a remedie to the said inconueniences, which Wee haue long endeauoured,
though with lesse effect then Wee expected, haue resolued to make some further
redresse, by restraining the disordered traffique in that Commoditie, and
reducing it into the hands of able persons that may manage the same without
inconuenience, whereby the generall abuse may be taken away, and the necessary
vse (if any be) may be preserued. We doe therefore not only by these presents,
straitly charge and commaund, That Our said Proclamation restraining the
planting of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, be in euery respect obserued and performed according to
the tenour thereof, vpon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties therein contained; but also that no
person or persons whatsoeuer, Englishmen, Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or Strangers, (other then
such as shall be authorized and appointed thereunto by Letters Patents vnder
Our great Seale of England) doe import or cause to be imported into this Our
Realme of England or Dominion of Wales, or any part of them or either of them,
any Tobacco, of what nature, kind, or sort soeuer, after the tenth day of Iuly
next ensuing the date hereof, from any the parts beyond the Seas, vpon paine of
forfeiture to Us of all such Tobacco so to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported contrary to the true
meaning of these Presents, and vpon such further paines and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as by
the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, or by the seueritie or censure of Our
Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted vpon the offendors, for contempt of
this Our Royall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And likewise that no Master, Merchant, or Purser of
any Ship or other Uessell, doe at any time or times after the said tenth day of
Iuly, presume or attempt to take into their ships to be imported into this
Realme and Dominion, or either of them, any sort, maner, or quantity of Tobacco
whatsoeuer, but onely to the vse of such person and persons as shalbe so as
aforesaid authorized and appointed vnder Our great Seale of England to import
the same, &amp; which shalbe by them, their deputies, seruants or factors
deliuered to the said Masters, Merchants or Pursers of ships to be imported,
vpon the paines and penalties aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And to the intent that no such offendor may colour or hide his
offence and contempt, by sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the Tobacco to be brought in, contrary to
Our pleasure before expressed, vnder pretence of former store, We doe hereby
signifie and declare Our will and pleasure, and doe straitly charge and
command, That all and euery person and persons which now haue, or hereafter
shall haue within or neere the Cities of London or Westminster, in their hands,
custody or possession, any Tobacco heretofore imported, or hereafter and before
the said tenth day of Iuly now next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb facs="tcp:1071:2"/> to be imported into
this Realme, amounting to the quantitie of ten pounds weight or aboue, shall
before the said tenth day of Iuly now next comming, bring the same vnto the
house com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, <hi>The Hawke and Feasant,</hi> situate in Cornehill in
the said Citie of London, and shall cause the same to be there sealed and
marked by such person and persons, and with such marke or Seale as by Us shalbe
for that purpose assigned and appointed, without giuing any Fee or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
for the said Seale or marke.</p>
            <p>And to the intent that the Tobacco to be hereafter imported by
Warrant or Authoritie vnder Our great Seale, may be knowen and distinguished
from such as shall be secretly and without Warrant brought in by stealth, We
doe likewise charge and command, that all such Tobacco as from and after the
said tenth day of Iuly shall be imported by force of any such Warrant or
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and none other, except the olde store aforesaid to be sealed as
aforesaid, shall be sealed and marked with such Seale and marke as aforesaid.
And we doe hereby prohibite all person and persons from and after the said
tenth day of Iuly, to buy, vtter, sell or vent within the said King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and
Dominion, or either of them, any Roll or other grosse quantitie of Tobacco
whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, before the same be so as aforesaid marked or sealed, vpon paine of
forfeiture vnto Us of all such Tobacco so bought, vttered, solde or vented
contrary to the intent of these Presents, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such further penalties as
by Our Lawes, or by the censure of Our Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted
vpon the offenders, as contemners of Our Royall command.</p>
            <p>And for the better execution of this Our Pleasure, Wee doe hereby
command all and singular Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, and other
officers attending in all and euery the Ports, Creekes, or places of lading or
vnlading, for the taking, collecting, or receiuing of any Our Customes,
Subsidies or other duties, to take notice of this Our pleasure; and We do
hereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and giue power and authority vnto them, and euery or any of
them, from time to time, as well to search any Ship or other Uessell or
Bottome, riding or lying within any Port, Hauen or Creeke within their seuerall
Charge and place of attendance, for all Tobacco imported contrary to the intent
of this Our Proclamation, and the same being found, to seize and take to Our
vse, as also to take notice of the names, and apprehend the bringers in, and
buyers of the same, to the end they may receiue condigne punishment for their
offences, vpon paine that euery of the said Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which shalbe found
negligent, remisse or corrupt therein, shall lose his place and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and vndergoe such paines and penalties as by Our Lawes, or the censure of Our
said Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted vpon them for the same.</p>
            <p>And likewise We doe hereby will, ordaine and appoint, That it shal
and may be lawfull to and for such person and persons, as shalbe so as
aforesaid authorized and appointed by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents vnder Our great Seale,
to import Tobacco by himselfe or themselues, or his or their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or
Deputies, with a lawfull Officer to enter into any suspected places at lawfull
and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, and there search, discouer and finde out any Tobacco
imported, vttered, solde or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not marked or sealed as aforesaid,
contrary to the true meaning hereof, and all such Tobacco so found, to seize,
take away and dispose of, and the owners thereof, or in whose custody the same
shalbe found, to informe and complaine of, to the end they may receiue
punishment according to Our pleasure before herein declared.</p>
            <p>And further We doe by these Presents will and require all and
singular Mayors, Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables,
Headboroughes, Customers, Comptrollers, Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Waiters, and all other Our
Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, That they and euery of them in their
seuerall places and offices be diligent and attendant in the execution of this
Our Proclamation, and also aiding and assisting vnto such person and persons,
and his and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties and Assignes as We shall so as aforesaid authorize
and appoint to import Tobacco, aswell in any search for discouery of any acte
or actes to be performed contrary to the intent of these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, as
otherwise in the doing or executing of any matter or thing forthe
accomplishment of this Our Royall Command. And lastly Our will and pleasure is,
and Wee doe hereby charge and command Our Atturney generall for the time being,
