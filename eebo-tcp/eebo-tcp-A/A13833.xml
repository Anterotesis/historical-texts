            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at one, and the ſelfe ſame tyme; nor are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-thoughts
only, better then the workes
themſelues. Some yeares past, I wrote the
like of <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> with as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnes
and fidelity, as poſsibly I could: but
the very ſhape thereof, when I ſaw it (being diuulged in my
abſence) could I hardly know, it was ſo defiled &amp; diſtayned
with faults. Nor came it forth, indeed, more faulty, then
mayned. For when as formerly the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> had
commanded <hi>Xauerius</hi> famous Deedes to be ſought out by his
Viceroy of <hi>India;</hi> thoſe things only of note, which he had
wrought within the <hi>Portugheſes</hi> dominions, were then col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and ſet downe: nor yet thoſe entierely neither, but
only ſuch, as could be knowne, and testified by ſufficient
Witneſſes that were preſent. As for his other acts, eſpecially
thoſe which he perfourmed among the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
(although very memorable and illustrious) they were
for the moſt part, as yet, detayned in ſilence, and obſcurity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19094:6"/>
Thoſe therfore in like manner comming at last vnto my
hands, &amp; being written by ſuch perſons as at that tyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed
with the <hi>Iaponians</hi> and <hi>Chineſes;</hi> I was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
induced to ſet my ſelfe to worke againe, by tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them into Latin, and inſerting them in their due place
amongst the reſt. And although I was heerein to vndertake
the compiling of almoſt a new worke, and thereby driuen at
the firſt into ſome feare from the enterprize: yet my loue, as
well to <hi>Xauerius,</hi> as my deſire of the publicke vtility, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all the difficultyes with were preſented to my fancy. For
ſo great was the copiouſneſſe and worth of his new exploytes,
that of foure Bookes (least they might grow ouer-great) it
was neceſſary to make ſix. Beſides, I haue in this, done my
best alſo, to procure, that, as our <hi>Xauerius</hi> hath heereby
gotten a new Make; ſo he may appeare in publicke, more
corrected and exact, although humane frailty can neuer be
wary inough against errours. So as, he may well be ſaid a moſt
wiſe and iuſt Esteemer of things, who iudgeth that to haue
bin corrected best, which in this kind may ſeeme to haue feweſt
faults.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I purpoſe heere to ſet downe
the admirable &amp; renowned Lyfe
of <hi>S. Francis Xauier:</hi> a man ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
borne for the ſaluation of <hi>India,</hi> and the
furtheſt Eaſterne world. Of all the nine firſt Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Holy Father <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> of <hi>Loyola,</hi> he
moſt reſembled his Mayſter: and of the Society was
the firſt who laboured in <hi>India, Iaponia,</hi> &amp; thoſe
barbarous Countries, opening the way both for the
Indians vnto heauen, &amp; for the Society into <hi>India;</hi>
wherby he brought no leſſe renowne, then left exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to his Order. For which cauſe, the whole Society
not without good reaſon, deſired long ſince to haue ſo
fayre a Pourtraicte, beautified with ſuch admirable
vertue, liuely drawne in colours for Ours to behold;
ſeeing the glorious exploits of Predeceſſours, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
inflame the harts of generous ſpirits, with a
<pb facs="tcp:19094:11"/>
certaine kind of heauenly fire, which hardly can be
quenched, vntill by imitation they become true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
of their noble Vertues.</p>
            <p>Now, as on the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide I perceaued, that other
Authors in their Hiſtories, had with great honour,
touched <hi>Xauerius</hi> chiefeſt acts: ſo was I on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide not a little grieued, that for the ſpace of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
35. yeares, there had bin none who thought v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ſetting forth his life (then shining with ſo
many and ſo illuſtrious vertues) in a proper volume
by it ſelfe, either by giuing that charge, to ſome
other, or by vndertaking it themſelues. VVherfore
being moued of late, as well through perſwaſion of
ſome dearest friends, as (which is more) by the
command of Superiours to vndertake the ſame, I
was put in ſome hope to performe, what others had
conceaued of my ability therin; &amp; for my deuotion to
<hi>Xauerius,</hi> I was not only not vnwilling, but very
willing alſo, as tyme should afford, to ſet vpon this
taske, to th'end the memory of a man ſo worthy, yea
euen of immortality it ſelf, &amp; who triumpheth now
in heauen, might be renewed, not only to the minds of
our owne Religious, but to Posterity alſo.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it ſeemeth vnto me, this falleth out, not
ſo much by humane, as diuine prouidence, that euen
<pb facs="tcp:19094:11"/>
at this tyme his moſt induſtrious and laborious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life, should be layd open to the view of Ours,
when as we behould ſuch a glorious haruest of ſoules
brought in from thoſe far countries, which by him
were firſt cultiuated &amp; manured. For now the newes
is brought vnto vs, of the conuerſion of many great
Princes &amp; Kings of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> with almoſt all their
people, to the Chriſtian faith; and of a paſſage alſo,
through Gods aſſiſtance, made into <hi>China</hi> for the
preaching of the Ghoſpell there, which was hertofore
by the Diuels craft wholy ſtopped, &amp; euen ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pier'd
vp aſwel with walles, as lawes. Both which certainly
next after God, we muſt attribute to holy <hi>Xauerius</hi>
who not only lead the way to our Society for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of thoſe Nations, but left that enterprize
alſo fully ready, and eaſy to be compaſſed.</p>
            <p>VVherfore my intention is to ſet downe heere in
writing the life of this most Bleſsed man, being full
of all variety of matter. And though my VVill and
Deſire be more ready to obey, then either Ability or
Hope to ſatisfy; yet confiding in <hi>Xauerius</hi> praiers
for whoſe ſake I vndertooke the worke, and alſo in
the diuine power of Obedience, I trust my Forces wil
in ſome ſort be anſwerable to my VVill, &amp; my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
to Expectation. The which, if through my
<pb facs="tcp:19094:12"/>
ſlendernes I be not able to bring to paſſe; yet shall I
gaine this much at leaſt, that my endeauours, how
poore ſoeuer, may ſerue to ſtirre vp others, more
studious &amp; induſtrious, to vndertake the ſame And
howſoeuer it falleth out, I will neuertheleſſe reſerue
this comfort to my ſelfe, that I haue bin obedient to
my chiefeſt Father, and (as much as in me lay) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured
to preſerue the memory of ſo great, and
holy ſeruant of God. For peraduentnre I may giue
future Ages to vnderſtand from what ſeed ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
a harueſt of new Christians, in thoſe deſert
places, hath ſprunge, whereof that moſt induſtrious
and skilfull Husbandman, <hi>who ſowed in teares,</hi>
hath <hi>with abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndant ioy,</hi> brought his handfull
home. And albeit our Predeceſſours haue ſtudied
more how to expreſse the worthy acts of <hi>Francis</hi> in
their deeds, then put them downe in writing; yet
will I gather only that which is either extant in
approued Authors, or els is come vnto my hands fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thoſe who haue byn preſent, or haue had them from
eye witneſſes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, concerning his infancy and childhood
I shall ſet downe ſome few things, which my ſelfe
came to know by <hi>Martin Azpilqueta</hi> of <hi>Nauar</hi>
(ſome few months before his death) a man for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb facs="tcp:19094:12"/>
and learning famous, who was both kinſman, &amp;
in former times companion alſo to <hi>Xauerius.</hi> For
the rest of his life, thoſe who conuerſed with him,
when his vertue did not ſo greatly appeare, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to obſerue; but when as afterward it began to
shew it ſelfe vnto the world, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his acts to be more carefully obſerued, &amp;
put downe in writing; &amp; for this reaſon we haue not
all the parts of his life furnished alike with vertues
and worthy deeds. Nor do I thinke that thoſe who
knew the life of our Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> will take any
great delight in reading the beginnings of <hi>Xaueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
or thoſe firſt actes of his ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue, as known
for the moſt part vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> already, but will rather
make haſt to thoſe other of his notable Acts in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi>
yet muſt they remember, that ſeing from thoſe
firſt beginnings <hi>Xauerius</hi> became ſo noble a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

we will firſt ſpeake of his parentage, which was
very Noble, on either ſide.</p>

<hi>Pyrenaean</hi> mountaines, not far from

Nobility (according to the cuſtome of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
dwelleth for the moſt part in Caſtles out of Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
His Anceſtours, for their warlike proweſſe, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19094:14"/>
approued loyalty to their Kings, haue purchaſed to
themſelues and their poſterity, many great Honours
and Dignities, and haue byn no leſſe renowned for

them.</p>
               <p>His kindred by the mothers ſide, was very Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and Noble; The antiquity wherof may for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
a thouſand yeares togeather,<note place="margin">His No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of birth.</note> draw a very fayre
pedigree of famous Warriours, teſtifyed by approued

named <hi>Martin Azpilqueta,</hi> a man no leſſe noble for
his owne vertue, then for the greatnes of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
who was now almoſt the only branch left of
that moſt renowned family. He tooke to wife <hi>Ioane
Xaueria,</hi> a Virgin in honour equall to himſelfe. By her
he had iſſue an only daughter called <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſtemme
&amp; hope of both families; ſo that, two of the nobleſt

Ioynter, &amp; hauing more fortunate ſucceſſe in marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
then his ſayd Father-in law had, prouided better
for the family of the <hi>Xauiers</hi> then his owne. For hauing
by <hi>Mary</hi> many children (wherof this our <hi>Francis</hi> was

one) he began to take great care how he might keepe
vp, two of the moſt ancient families of <hi>Nauar,</hi> which
were now ſomewhat in declining. Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to leaue the Name of his own Family, although
it were neither meane nor obſcure, and to giue his
children, and poſterity the name of his wiues kindred;
ſo as ſome of them were called <hi>Azpilqueta's,</hi> others
<hi>Xauiers.</hi> Theſe therfore were the Parents and Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours

was his courage to indure all incommodities and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

which through continual ſtirring about neceſſary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
of the houſe, had cauſed the fleſh to ſwell, and
therby gauled him moſt pitifully. Yet ſo great was his
deſire and courage to ſuffer, that albeit the iorney he

not for al that take of thoſe cordes which did ſo much
afflict him.</p>
               <p>When therfore this torment being of it ſelfe very

he taking breath awhile, which was before ſtopped
through griefe, was enforced to open vnto them the

then as ſoone as they thought he had reſted inough,
&amp; recouered a little ſtrengh, they brought him fayre

which he neuer forgot, although they had been

ſo much the more admired &amp; eſteemed this great cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Francis</hi> towards the ſicke, by how much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
this his labour continued with them then before.
For it fell ſo out, that the Turkes and Venetians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
that yeare to make warre vpon one another,
the paſſage into <hi>Palestine</hi> was ſtopt, which before was
alwayes open for Pilgrims. And the ſeas were ſo beſet
with the Turkiſh ſhips that none could paſſe out of
<hi>Italy</hi> to the Eaſterne coaſts without manifeſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

delayed the good Fathers iorney to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſo it
afterwards brake it cleane of, God reſeruing their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
for better vſes. For he ſent theſe his hyred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants

they might employ the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſome in pruning
the ouergrowne vineyardes of Chriſtians, &amp; others
in cultiuating the deſertes of <hi>India,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iaponia,</hi> which
before that were neuer ſo much as touched. So whilſt
<hi>Francis</hi> (not knowing Gods deſignement) betweene
hope and feare expected euery day ſome opportunity
for his long deſired nauigation, many monthes paſſed
away in his foreſayd labours of the Hoſpitall, in all
which time he neuer became ſlacke in his indeauours
nor any whit remiſſe in his charitable exerciſes.</p>
               <p>But ſeing at laſt all hope of going to <hi>Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>

This is certaine, that the litle which he begged would

was the ardent fire which inflamed both his ſoule and

For he was indeed (as is ſaid of <hi>Daniel) a man of

many of that Citty, but eſpecially his Hoſt to the loue

turned into a Chappel, that it might be a monument

thought good to take in that Chappell to the ſame, &amp;

                  <hi>Francis,</hi> hauing performed all things wel at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi>
came to <hi>Rome</hi> (as was agreed) about the midſt
of Lent in the yeare of our Lord 1539. The fathers at
that time, had begged a lodging at the foote of an hil
of certaine litle Garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (now called <hi>Mons Trinitatis</hi>)
in a place there which <hi>Quirinus Garzoni,</hi> an honeſt and
vertuous Cittizen of Rome had lent vnto them. There
they all liued by begging; and being no leſſe deſirous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19094:32"/>
of their neighbours ſaluation, then of their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in vertue, they agreed amongſt themſelues to
imploy all their endeauours in aduancing Chriſtian
Religion, and to labour what they could in Chriſts
vineyard, hoping that, that Citty being the ſeat of
Religion, and made fertile by the bloud of ſo many
Martyrs, would yield moſt plentifull fruit of piety.</p>
               <p>Taking therfore a right courſe in the execution
of this their vertuous determination, they firſt preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
themſelues to the Vicegerent of the Pope, and to the
Paſtours of Pariſhes. And hauing obtained leaue to
preach wherſoeuer they would, they deuide themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
throughout the principall Churches of the Citty.
And <hi>S. Laurence</hi> in <hi>Damaſus,</hi> a very famous &amp; remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable

to preach therin by turnes. In this Church therfore
preaching oftentimes before a frequent and fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
audience, not of pleaſing but profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
matters, he reaped a harueſt proportionable
to his ſeed, and cauſed in his auditours not ſo much
admiration as profit, which is the chiefe thing in a
Preacher. For by his often preaching he endeauoured
to allure the people to an honeſt &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate life, &amp; to
frequent the holy Sacraments. And his other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all their forces likewiſe to the ſame end,
deuotion ſeemed now againe to be ſet on fire in the
harts of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and old <hi>Rome</hi> by little &amp; little to
appeare agayne in her former luſtre and renowne.
Yet <hi>Xauier</hi> was not ſo imploied in helping the people
by his Sermons, as that he forgot the yonger ſort
therof, but with very diligent care inſtructed them,

euen ſtreet by ſtreet, in the precepts and myſteries of
the Chriſtian faith; knowing for certaine that the
chiefe good of the whole Citty depended principally
vpon the inſtruction and vertuous education of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
In the meane time theſe good Fathers, through
their induſtry and labours, brought the Society of
Ieſus to a forme of Religion, which then began, not
only to be eſtabliſhed at home, but alſo to be in great

to vndertake all things for Chriſt his ſake, with teares

after martyrdome, began to hope for that in <hi>India,</hi>

God himſelfe had commaunded him. And ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

reioycing much that the employment which he
deſired, was thus now put into his hands euen by God

               <p>There was not any one of the whole howſe who

               <p>Afterwards as they trauayled ouer the Alpes,

euer after as the author of his life, and ſaluation. The

or the encountring with barbarous nations; or that

cleere and the ſea calme they ſaw many vnuſuall &amp;

of the paſſengers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Xauerius</hi> although he did not indeed contemne
the knowledge of ſuch things, yet thinking with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that he went not to fetch learning or pleaſure out
of <hi>India,</hi> but for the glory of God, and ſaluation of
ſoules, began himſelf within the ſhip to ſet forth ſights
more gratefull to God, &amp; more profitable to men. The
chiefe Admirall-ſhip was rather like a Towne then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
being full not only of marriners, but alſo
of ſouldiers, the Gouernours retinew, merchants, &amp;
ſeruants, to the number of a thouſand perſons or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.
<hi>Francis</hi> therfore as ſoone as he was entred into
his iourney, began togeather with his companions
to employ himſelfe in the moſt diligent manner he
could in procuring the ſaluation of his neighbours,<note place="margin">He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, &amp; the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diars in the ſhip.</note> by
inſtructing the marriners, and paſſengers, and ſoldiers
in the Chriſtian doctrine, partly by reprehending their
ill behauiour, and partly by exhorting them to cleanſe
their ſoules from all filth of ſinne. And not in vaine.
For thereby the cuſtome of ſwearing was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
many of deadly enemies became friends, many
confeſſed their ſinnes with ſorrow of hart and many
were reclaymed from a bad, to an honeſt life. <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:19094:48"/>
carried alwayes a cheerfull countenance,<note place="margin">He win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by his ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> winning
the affections of all by the ſweetnes of his behauiour.
And for this cauſe ſome who were euen drowned in
moſt abominable vices &amp; villanies, &amp; who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
could not endure the ſight of a religious man, were
much delighted with <hi>Francis</hi> his moſt pleaſing conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
And he knowing well how to deale with ſuch
kind of diſpoſitions, drew them at firſt, by ſweet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and by litle &amp; little, from their bad courſes; and
when at length he found them tractable, then he inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; ſpurred them on in the way of piety &amp; vertue.<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the meane tyme God afforded him matter anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable
to his generous and vertuous mind. This tedious
and laborious nauigation (as commonly it hapneth)
had ſo extremely worne out the marriners, and other
paſſengers, that now very many fell ſicke in the ſhips,
and their victuals greatly increaſed the ſame. For they
fed continually vpon ſalt meates, &amp; oftentimes vpon
muſty bisket: beſides, they had for the moſt parte,
no other drink but ſtinking &amp; corrupted water, which
by reaſon of the nature of the liquour, and ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
thereof, did rather increaſe then allay the extreme
thirſt which the ſalt meates cauſed in them. So as the
bad humours of ſuch vnwholſome diet being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
through their veines, ingendred in them diſeaſes
no leſſe grieuous then deadly. For their gummes ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
after a loathſome manner, and breaking out into
horrible vlcers, did not only put the ſick men to great
torment, but alſo (which was moſt miſerable) made
them that they could not eate. And this contagion by
litle and litle increaſing through their griefe of mynd,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19094:49"/>
and want of neceſſary commodities, began to ſpread
it ſelfe ouer the whole multitude, who were much
thronged vp in ſtraite places for want of roome. For
though the King had, beſides neceſſary prouiſion of
victuals appointed for euery ſhip an Apothecary-ſhop
of excellent drugs, which is no ſmall comfort for ſicke
perſons, yet the ſame could not ſuffice the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the diſeaſed. The great feare alſo of the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as it hapneth) made euen friends themſelues to
leaue off the care of one another, &amp; euery man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
as well as he could for his owne ſafety. So as the
ſicke being deſtitute both of phiſicke, and attendance
dyed not more through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagious diſeaſe, then for
hungar, which was a worſe plague. Beſides the filth of
the ſhip did ſo extremly annoy theſe poore wretches,
that it was farre more troubleſome and loathſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, then vnto the others who were in health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauier</hi> therfore when he ſaw the ſhip, wherin he
ſayled full of ſick perſons, calling to mind what he had
accuſtomed himſelfe vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the beginning of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
gaue an euident proofe of his benignity and
vertue.<note place="margin">His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible courage of mind.</note> That which hartned him on, would haue
made another afrayd. He ſaw the hatches of the ſhip
ſtrowed not only with ſicke bodyes, but alſo with
halfe dead; he knew the diſeaſe to be very infectious;
he ſaw deaths griſly lookes before his eyes. Yet for all
this, turning feare into charity, and knowing it was
a kind of Martyrdome, to hazard ones life by ſuch
contagion, for the ſauing of ſoules, he reſolued to
help the ſayd ſicke the beſt he could. And ſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
began to heare the confeſſions of thoſe who lay
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19094:49"/>
a dying; he cleanſed the ſick mens bodies of their filth;
he waſhed their linnen, dreſſed their meate, minced
it ſmal, and fed them with his owne hands. He mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
phiſicke to the weake; he moſt louingly cheered
vp thoſe that were ſad; and put them, that were out of
hart, in hope of recouery both of body, and ſoule.
And thus by ſeruing all indifferently, without regard
of perſons, &amp; that with diligence &amp; alacrity, he made
euen thoſe that were in health to beare him great reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and reuerence.</p>

this one thing got <hi>Xauerius</hi> much more loue &amp; eſteeme

from his owne belly, he would moſt freely deuide
amongſt the ſicke all what he begged of the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and what was aſſigned him by the Generall. For
being reſolute in keeping his purpoſe, he eate very

&amp; alſo exhorted them by pious ſermons to liue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianlike.
And in all theſe labours you would haue
thought him not to be tyred out, but to grow ſtronger
thereby. Which was neuer more apparently ſeene,
then in this <hi>Indian</hi> voyage. For beſides his extreme
labour, this alſo was, as it were, added thereto, that
whilſt he did all theſe things,<note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Zone</note> he paſſed the Torrid
Zone and the Equinoctiall line not long after the
tyme of the Equinoctium. At which tyme there is
commonly in that tract of the ſea, eyther through the
ſcorching of the ſunne which ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth ouer their heads,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19094:50"/>
or by the reflexion thereof vpon the ſtill ſea, ſuch an
intollerable heate, that the ſtrongeſt men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
burnt vp, and conſumed with heat and ſweat,
do euen faint away, and languiſh. And no meruayle,
ſeeing the paſſengers being thruſt vp togeather in
cloſe roomes of the ſhip, can hardly draw their breath,
or at thoſe tymes ſcarſely take any comfort, eyther in
meate or drinke. For all their drinke, and victualls
being vſually corrupted by the vapors of the ſcalding
ſunne, do for the moſt part looſe their force and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for a tyme, vntil they be paſt the forſayd line. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times alſo the winds wholy ceaſing, there followeth
for many dayes, &amp; ſometymes weekes together, ſuch a
calme, that the ſhips are not able to moue, to the great
irkeſomneſſe and griefe of the paſſengers. And as the
intollerable heate of the ſunne, continuing almoſt
throughout the whole Torrid Zone, cauſeth vehem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
feuers amongſt them that paſſe vnder it, ſo doth it alſo
bereaue many of their liues.</p>
               <p>At this time when ſicknes came vpon them ſo
faſt, in ſo great a mortality of marriners &amp; paſſengers,
as euen they who were well, and had nothing to do
could ſcarſe breath, <hi>Francis</hi> forgetfull of him ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
the burden of all theſe inconueniences with
courage anſwerable thereunto, iudging it meet as he
ſaw the ſick mens incumbrances to grow greater, ſo
alſo to increaſe his diligence in helping them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he was ready to languiſh away alſo, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable

ſuch the force of the holy Ghoſt (who is euer a moſt

               <p>Hauing thus ſayled through the exceſſiue difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Equinoctiall line, and being now paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

mortality then they had already endured. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory
taketh its name of <hi>Bonae ſpei,</hi> or <hi>Good Hope,</hi> for
this reaſon, that hauing once paſſed the difficulties &amp;
dangers therof, you then may hope for a proſperous
nauigation. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the African coaſt growing ſharpe
in the forme of a wedge, runneth an huge way into
the ſouthern Ocean towards the frozen climate: ſo as
two moſt vaſt ſeas meeting from both ſides of Africk
and continually toſſed with contrary windes, make
a moſt hydeous conflict with themſelues. And this
hapneth eſpecially in the monthes of Iune and Iuly, at
which time in thoſe parts it is the midſt of winter
wholy contrary to Europe, and in which moneth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
they muſt paſſe that Promontory, who go
from <hi>Portugall</hi> into <hi>India.</hi> And although the ſhippes to
auoid that raging fury &amp; violence of the ſea, as much
as they can, vſe to keep off a great way from land, yet
do they ſeeme to fly the danger more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the domage.
For whilſt they fetch a great compaſſe about, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they go from the Promontory, the neerer they
come to the frozen Zone, &amp; ſo do neither auoid the
cruell ſtormes, nor yet eſcape the intollerable cold.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19094:51"/>
Wherfore although they be more ſecure from danger
of ſhipwracke, yet by reaſon of the vnuſuall and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
toſſing of the ſhippes, the paſſengers become
extremely ſea-ſick, and vomit. And as the ſame could
not but augment their diſeaſe who were already ſick;
ſo alſo <hi>Francis</hi> his labour was of neceſſity increaſed

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19094:52"/>
was now paſt, and ſcarſe the fourth part remained.
But the nauy came later to <hi>Mozambicum</hi> then it ſhould
haue done, becauſe both conuenient tyme, and

to ſtay there al the following winter. At <hi>Mozambicum</hi>

better then eaſe, tooke almoſt no reſt at all,
through the inflamed deſire he had to inſtruct the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,

who ſhall read this often repetition of <hi>Francis</hi> his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious

ſeruing the ſick, will beſides their ſatisfaction therein,
reflect vpon that alſo which my ſelfe in more ſerious

he had thoſe wonderfull forces, by which he was ſo
often able to vndergoe at once ſo many, &amp; ſuch great
labours. But the worthy man being indowed with an
incredible courage both of body and mind,<note place="margin">His ſtrength of body &amp; mind.</note> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Grace miniſtring ſtrength to his able nature, was
of ſuch force and vigour, that he alone would, and
could do in a manner all things for Gods ſake. And
wheras he applied himſelfe continually in the ſame
workes of Chriſtian charity without any weariſome
tediouſneſſe, he neuer omitted any thing, which he
ſaw was either good for men or gratefull to God.</p>
               <p>Therfore as though he had come thither with his
forces intire, &amp; no whit weakened, he preſently tooke
vp his lodging in the Hoſpitall at <hi>Mozambicum,</hi> erected
there by the King, as in other places alſo where the
<hi>Portugheſes</hi> haue fortes. His labour was now no leſſe

at land,<note place="margin">New la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering places.</note> in the hoſpitall, then it had bin at ſea in the
ſhip. For there was, at that time, in Towne both very
great ſickneſſe, and a multitude of diſeaſed perſons.
And that which greatly augmented this contagion in
time of Autumne was this, that all the ſhippes which
had ſet out from <hi>Portugal</hi> that yeare for <hi>India<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> lighting
alike vpon ill weather, and peſtered with the ſame
ſicknes, were forced to ſtay all winter in that place.
This occaſion gaue an new edge vnto <hi>Xauiers</hi> induſtry
to vndertake the care of that great multitude of ſick
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For thinking it fitting for him to beſtow his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
alſo vpon the other ſhippes, in as much as he was
able, by labouring continually both day and night he
applied himſelfe to help the afflicted, to adminiſter
the Sacraments to the ſicke, to comfort the ſad, and to
rayſe them vp that lay a dying to hope and confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
in God. All therfore that were ſick eſteemed <hi>Francis</hi>
to be ſent them by God almighty, as the onely remedy
which the afflicted Nauy had. Yet he did not giue
himſelf ſo wholy to the ſick, as to become vnmynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the reſt. For at the ſame time vpon holy dayes
he preached before the Viceroy &amp; others, in preſence
of a very great audience, that he might thereby helpe
the ſoules alſo of thoſe who were in health.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was thus buſied, and wholly imployed
in helping both ſicke,<note place="margin">His care of ſoules</note> and healhfull in all he could, he
vnderſtandeth that a boy, who came in the ſame ſhip
with him, was fallen ſuddainly dead. Whereupon he
preſently asked euery one (whome he met) whether
that boy had learned the principles of the Chriſtian
fayth? And when he found that he dyed wholy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19094:53"/>
therof, he was preſently ſtroken to the hart with
ſuch griefe, that he ſhewed exceeding ſadnes in his
countenance, although otherwiſe he was alwayes
wont to looke cheerfully. Wherefore <hi>Soſa</hi> the Vice-Roy
demanding of him the cauſe of his heauines, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he vnderſtood what it was by his own relation, asked
him, whether he knew that boy to be ignorant in his
Chriſtian fayth? No quoth <hi>Francis,</hi> for if I had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known that, I would not be ſad, for I would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt haue taught him with the reſt. Then <hi>Soſa</hi>
vrging him agayne, why therefore would he afflict
himſelfe ſo much, ſeeing it was not his fault? Becauſe
(quoth he) there was one in the ſame ſhip with me,
who knew not his Chriſtian fayth, &amp; I knew it not:
Such a care he had of the good of mens ſoules,<note place="margin">He fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſick.</note> and
of the inſtruction of children. But how much profit
and benefit aroſe from his great Charity, the ſicke
found rather by wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the ſame then by inioying it.
For within a few dayes after <hi>Xauerius</hi> fell ſicke himſelf
whilſt he was helping others with the greateſt feruour
he could, wherin indeed, his fortitude wanted not
matter to worke vpon. So great and dangerous a feuer
inuaded him, that he was let bloud ſeauen tymes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few dayes; whereof, for all that, he did not only
make light account, but imbraced it willingly, as
though it had bin ſent from God. But to the end his
generous vertue might be the more euidently ſeene,
this corporall ſicknes was ſeconded with a greater of
the mind; for he fell alſo into a Phrenſy. This held
him three whole dayes, during which time the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
who had care of him, tooke their ſolemne
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19094:54"/>
oathes, that in things blonging to the body, and his
health (as the nature of the diſeaſe was) he ſeemed
to be out of his wits: but in matters diuine, and
things belonging to the ſoule (wherin phrenſy vſeth
chiefly to ſhew it ſelfe) he was to their great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo well in his ſenſes, that he ſpake not one word

He lay in the publicke Hoſpitall amongſt the

There wanted not men of Nobility and Eſteeme, who
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fell firſt ſick ſtroue to take him into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
&amp; there to haue care of him, and this as earneſtly
they intreated of him, as poſſibly they could. But all
in vayne. For being a true louer of holy Pouerty,
in few wordes, he thanked them for their courtely,
but would not accept of their liberality. As long as
he was ſicke, he lay amongſt the common multitude
without any difference at all. But the violence of his
ſicknes was more dangerous then long, which being

cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did not any whit diminiſh his alacrity in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,

Neuer did <hi>Francis</hi> his benignity ſhew it ſelfe with
more ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour &amp; admiration then at this time. For the
Phiſitian viſiting (as his cuſtome was) the ſicke that
kept their beds, light by chance vpon <hi>Xauerius,</hi> who
hauing a great feuer vpon himſelfe, ſtood notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
by them that lay ſick, and did his beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auour
to ſerue them, no otherwiſe then if he had byn
perfectly well. The Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being amazed at that ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
accident, ſtood ſtill a while, then feeling his pulſe,
and finding him certainly to haue more need of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
then they whome he ſerued, intreated and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
beſought him to go to bed, and reſt himſelfe
at leaſt, vntill his feuer had remitted of its heate, and
then he might, if he would, riſe agayne, to help the
ſicke. Whereupon <hi>Francis</hi> thinking he was bound to
obey the Phiſitian, &amp; yet not to leaue thoſe that were
in danger, anſwered, That this next night he ſhould
haue ſome occaſion with a certaine ſicke perſon who
was not well prepared for death, and was in immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger, and hauing ſecured his ſaluation then he
would take his reſt. He whome he meant, was one
of the pooreſt marriners of the ſhip,<note place="margin">A marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad ſeemeth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hauing fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him vpon a ſuddain lying on the hatches
he was ſo moued with compaſſion towards him, that
he preſently layd him in his owne bed. And it ſeemeth
this ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge charity of his was honoured with as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
a miracle. For as ſoone as this frantick man was

ground. For the very ſame day towards night he
dyed, after he had receyued the Sacraments, full of
great confidence in God. And then it was manifeſtly
ſeene that <hi>Xauerius</hi> tooke ſuch paines with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he forſaw him to be in imminent danger, both
of lyfe and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Francis</hi> being very glad for this marriners
ſafety, went preſently to bed, for his owne health,
obeying the Phiſitian in al things, leauing behind him

able for want of tyme to free them, for the preſent,
whoſe mynds were wholy led away with ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

vouchſafe to beſtow his grace and light vpon them.</p>
               <p>After a ſmall ſpace, he ſet to ſea againe, &amp; with new
feruour of ſpirit held on his old cuſtome to help the
paſſengers, but eſpecially the ſicke (who were not

like ſheep without a paſtour, &amp; abandoned of al, were
greatly oppreſſed by tyranny. For in that Iland there

tyrannizeth ouer the inhabitants, who be eyther Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

giuen him ſuch ability, that he alone of all the Kings
in Chriſtendome was able to performe it, would alſo
giue him the will and deſire to protect &amp; defend thoſe
miſerable and afflicted ſoules. Wherefore he ſhould
with all ſpeed endeauour by his Royall aſſiſtance, to

redeemed both them, and vs with his moſt pretious

without any danger or charges at all. For he needed
only to command his Royal Nauy which was yearly
to paſſe that way, to deliuer the <hi>Socotoreans</hi> by force

for the Chriſtian cauſe, then from ſo ſmall a number
could haue byn expected, yet through want of Prieſts,
could not do ſo much good, as neceſſity required.
There were then no religious men in all <hi>India,</hi> but
the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> who were ſo imployed in aſſiſting the
<hi>Portugheſes,</hi> that they had no time to attend to the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes.
Of theſe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

both for his learning, vertue, and zeale of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
the Chriſtan fayth. For he hauing conuerted
and baptized certayne <hi>Indian</hi> children, after he had
inſtructed them in the myſtertes of the Chriſtian faith,
and taught them the <hi>Portugheſe</hi> language, he vſed them
as his interpreters in the conuerſion of Ethnickes;
which inuention had good ſuueſſe, anſwerable to the
witty contriuing therof. He therfore aſſiſted by pious
and worthy perſons, began to thinke vpon greater
matters; and inſtituting a Seminary for the <hi>Indians,</hi>
he imployed himſelfe wholy in teaching the ſtudents
therof. Wherfore albeyt the Biſhop, and the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
out of their ſingular piety,<note place="margin">The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Goa.</hi>
                  </note> deſired to ſpread the
Chriſtian fayth ouer <hi>India,</hi> yet they being but few in
number were not able to ſupply ſo many places. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſuperſtition of the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> bare
great ſway not only in other townes of the <hi>Portugheſs</hi>
but alſo in the Citty of <hi>Goa</hi> it ſelfe. For the Pagans &amp;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19094:62"/>
                  <hi>Saracens</hi> being wealthy, and liuing euery where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> practiſed their execrable rites
publikely euen at noone day, the Gouernours of the
Fortes winking therat, eyther becauſe the forces of
their new commaund were not as yet ſufficiently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
or elſe becauſe their was no body to couince
them of their errour, and bring them to the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if any inferiour <hi>Ethnickes</hi> chanced to
become Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Neophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> they were ſo tormented by the
richer ſort, that they durſt ſcarſe profeſſe themſelues
Chriſtians. For the <hi>Ethnicke</hi> and <hi>Saracen</hi> merchants,
who dealt with the Kings wares, and cuſtomes, were
ſo rich euen in <hi>Goa,</hi> that through fauour, &amp; power
they could do much both with the <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> &amp; the
Chriſtian Magiſtrates. So as the new Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppreſſed, the conuerſion of the <hi>Ethnickes</hi> grew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cold. The ſtate of the <hi>Portugheſes</hi> themſelues was
not much better. In many places there was very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vſe of Sacraments,<note place="margin">The looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of the <hi>Portughe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
                  </note> and of ſermons almoſt none
at all. Becauſe in all <hi>India</hi> there were but two or three
Preachers at the moſt, and not many more Prieſts.
Wherfore moſt of the <hi>Portugheſe</hi> garriſons were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tymes for whole yeares togeather, without eyther
ſermon or Maſſe. And beſides this, the beaſtly and
wicked conuerſation of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Ethnickes,</hi>
drew them on to much lewdnes. For none were more
corrupted in their behauiour then they, nor more
forcible to ſet ſenſuall luſt on fire; &amp; ech one giuing
himſelfe to vncleane pleaſures, eſteemed nothing
lighter almoſt, then his owne wiues honeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:19094:63"/>
Wherfore the <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> although naturally they
be inclined to temperance and frugality, yet giuing
themſelues amidſt ſo corrupt a nation, to ouermuch
banquetting, &amp; to other things which follow therof,
kept commonly with them in their houſes, many har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotts,
which they had bought, as ſlaues. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
none to reprehend their vices, their luſt was
growne to ſuch a height, that they counted it a point
of honour, to liue lewdly, &amp; eſteemed no gaine vniuſt
or diſgracefull; ſo much had couetouſneſſe, fortifyed
by bad cuſtome, changed all things. It was ordinary
amongſt them to paſſe diuers yeares, without eyther
Confeſſion or Communion; and if any did confeſſe
more then once in a yeare, they were commonly held
for hypocrites. In ſo much that if any one would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
out of remorſe of conſcience, go oftener to
confeſſion, he muſt do it priuatly to auoyd the note &amp;
ſpeach of others, like <hi>Nicodemus</hi> who came to Chriſt
by night. Moreouer the <hi>Portugheſes</hi> wiues, and harlots
being natiue of that Country, although they were
Chriſtians, yet through ignorance of the myſteries of
the Chriſtian fayth, were entangled with the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pagans and <hi>Saracens.</hi> And their children
were like their parents, or rather worſe. This was the
ſtate of matters in <hi>India</hi> when <hi>Xauerius</hi> came thither;
who being very ioyfull that he was at laſt (according
to his hartes deſire) arriued there, &amp; vnderſtanding of
the foreſayd things, bent all his endeauours for the
remedying of ſo many and great euils. And which is
to be much admired, in ſo great feruour of ſpirit, he
carried himſelfe no leſſe warily then diligently.</p>

to them the Sacraments of pennance and th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
Euchariſt, vntill their change of behauiour gaue
him hope of amendment in their liues. His chiefe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
was to help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were grieuouſly ſicke, vpon
whome he attended very diligently, not only in the
day, but alſo in the night, which made all to admire
his ſingular charity, and more then fatherly loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, who were meer ſtrangers vnto him. For
<hi>Francis</hi> his bed was commonly ſayd to be at his feete

But fearing leaſt his difference in apparel might
auert the <hi>Indians</hi> affections from him, he reſolued to
cloath himſelfe according to the cuſtome of the Prieſts

<hi>Xauerus</hi> not liking ſuch curious apparell, You may,

without either girdle or cloake, chooſing rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

in this, his moderation was not more apparent then
his conſtancy. For the ſame kind of habit he vſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

was commonly to viſit thoſe that were in priſon, and
to relieue them with almes which himſelfe begged
for them; where alſo teaching them how to make a

their whol life paſt. This example alſo of <hi>Xauerius</hi> was
not without force with others. For the new Viceroy
tooke this courſe once euery weeke, both in a louing

commonly ſeeke after it: So as now all might ſee, that
nothing could happen more heauy, or croſſely vnto

to deale with <hi>Xauerius,</hi> that in caſe he neither could,
nor would take vpon him the charge &amp; Gouerment,
yet that he would at leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the ſame to ſome one
of his Companions. Now <hi>Francis</hi> euery day expected
<hi>F. Paul</hi> and <hi>F. Manſilla</hi> from <hi>Mozambicum,</hi> &amp; others
alſo out of <hi>Portugall.</hi> And therfore conſidering with
himſelf of what vſe ſuch a Colledge might proue, at
laſt he accepted of the offer, &amp; made <hi>F. Paul Camertes</hi>
Rector therof in his place; and with the good liking
both of the Viceroy and <hi>Borban,</hi> he ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for
ſome others of the Society, to be maiſters to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
ſchollers.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the reuenewes being by the Kings li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
increaſed, when they thought of enlarging
their houſe to receiue more ſchollers, <hi>Soſa</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
furthered them therin, both with his authority &amp;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19094:72"/>
bounty. Wherupon both a new Church, and other
buildings were begunne, and in ſhort tyme finiſhed,
principally by his help and aſſiſtance. The Church
was dedicated to <hi>S. Paul,</hi> whence alſo the Colledge
was called <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Colledge. And from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Fathers were called by the Name of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</hi>
For when afterwards that Colledge (excepting
the Seminary of the <hi>Indians</hi>) was by the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi>
giuen to the Society of Ieſus, for the inſtituting
of ſuch as were appointed for <hi>India,</hi> and the Eaſt, the
Fathers tooke their Name from the place.</p>
               <p>It is now enlarged by the Kings liberality, and
furniſhed with buildings, being indeed a worthy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> his bounty, and
a moſt ample Seminary of Preachers and Prieſts for
the help of <hi>India</hi> and the Eaſt; the Seminary at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimbria</hi>
being by his Maieſties order turned into that
of <hi>Goa.</hi> For beſides many ſtudents of the <hi>Indian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who liue in ſeparate houſes, there be to the
number of an hundred of the Society, wherof ſome
are there receiued, and others ſent thither out of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi>
to be brought vp in learning and vertue, vntill
they be able to helpe the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the people of
thoſe Eaſtern partes by their preaching and example.
This place the diuine Prouidence ordained firſt of all
for the Society in <hi>India,</hi> before their Name was ſo
much as heard of in thoſe parts, and it is the mother
and head Seate of many other Colledges which were
afterward founded in the Eaſt. But now to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19094:73"/>
Knight (called <hi>Iohn de Cruz</hi>) a man of good account in
his own Country,<note place="margin">Iohn de Cruz.</note> a <hi>Malabar</hi> by birth, yet more reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
a Portugheſe then his owne Nation; who for

what they ſhould do? <hi>Cruz</hi> being a man both graue
and pious, and hoping this feare of theirs might be
an occaſion to bring in the Goſpell of Chriſt among
them, ſo as at once, they might be ſet free from the
miſery, both of their warre, and their ſuperſtition,
tould them his opinion was, that in this extremity of
danger, they were to fly to extreme remedyes: and
ſeeing, contrary to all iuſtice and equity, they were
betrayed by their owne Kings, and hardly charged on
all ſides by their enemies forces, they ſhould implore
ayde of the Almighty King of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſes
their friends, who were his deuoted and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
ſeruants; that ſo, protected by the Portugheſes
and the diuine aſſiſtance, they might not only defend
themſelues, but alſo triumph ouer their enemies. For
if they would yield themſelues ſubiect to the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Religion, &amp; to the Portugheſes, they certainly would
fight with all their forces for them, both in regard of
religion, and becauſe they were now become their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and would alſo by the help of God, carry the
whole buſineſſe with as good ſucceſſe, as valour. And
hauing conquered, &amp; ouerthrowne the Saracens, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19094:74"/>
deadly enemyes of Chriſtians, they might alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,

               <p>To this counſaile they gaue willing eare. And the

For the <hi>Saracens</hi> were ouerthrowen at the firſt
onſet, and entirely conquered by one battaile. Then
the <hi>Paraua's</hi> being deliuered from all feare of warre,
the Gouernour turned his care to procure the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſoules; and ſending thither Prieſts, there
were baptized to the number of 20000. Now the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugheſes
returning Conquerours, were not content
with the protection &amp; ſafegard of their ſubiects, but
gaue them moreouer (as <hi>Cruz</hi> had foretould) the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing
of pearles, for congratulation of their becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19094:75"/>
Chriſtians. Wherby the caſe was now ſo alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Saracens might not fiſh, without the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raua's</hi>
gaue them leaue. Thus, God drawing good out
of euill, by the tearing of one eare, was an occaſion of
the ſaluation of a whole Nation.</p>
               <p>But humane frailty was not anſwerable to the
will and ordinance of God. For the Prieſts (I ſpake

<hi>Paraua's,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morines are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts.</note> being diſmayed through the intemperatneſſe
of the ayre, and want of victualls, returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
And ſo thoſe poore new Chriſtians, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
had not byn conuerted to the fayth of Chriſt
ſo much for the loue of true Religion, as for the
feare of daunger they were lately in, being left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of Paſtours and wholly ignorant, fell agayne
into their old ſuperſtitions and cuſtomes. <hi>Xauerius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certifyed hereof by <hi>Michael Vaſaeus</hi> the Suffragan,
his mynd was poſſeſſed with various affections; for as
he much reioyced at ſo great an aduancement of the
Chriſtian cauſe, ſo was he extremly grieued for their
ſuccourleſſe eſtate; yet was he agayne comforted
through firme hope, that himſelfe might be able
ſhortly to help &amp; comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For now the Ethnicks
and Neophites that were about the Citty of <hi>Goa,</hi> and
who at that tyme vſed his help, were very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
through the endeauours of <hi>F. Borban</hi> &amp; others,
and therfore he much deſired to ſuccour theſe, who
were left deſtitute of all aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Whereupon forthwith he reſolued to go to <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caria,</hi>
to fiſh for the ſoules of the fiſher-men themſelues
which were farre more precious then their pearles.

And preſently he goeth to the Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his cuſtome

to combat both with the heat of the ſunne, and
with the ſand, which in that parching ſhore did not
only ſinke vnder him, but ſorely ſcorched his feete as
he trauayled. But he diſcouraged at nothing, went
through with that ſo hard an enterpriſes with as great
a fortitude as he had vndertaken it. For he alone, as if
he had had the courage &amp; forces of many Prieſts, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
regarding the heate of the ſun, imploied himſelf
continually in trauerſing the villages and townes of
that Coaſt, going oftentimes euen barefoot through
thoſe ſcorching ſands (after his bootes were worne
out) and daily baptizing of infants, children, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whome he found willing to become Chriſtians;
inuenting many ſtrange meanes to hinder them from
ſacrificing vnto Idols, in ioyning men and women
together with the lawfull bands of marriage, cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing
euery one according to their capacity, and
making friends thoſe who were at variance, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19094:77"/>
a ſtranger: yet aboue all other difficulties the want
of language did moſt trouble him. For when he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of matters belonging to Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they anſwered they were Chriſtians, but being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of the Portugheſe language,<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> they had not
learned the inſtructions and precepts of the Chriſtian
fayth. <hi>Xauerius</hi> had brought with him two ſchollers
from the Colledge of <hi>Goa,</hi> who were of ripe yeares, &amp;
skillfull both in the Portugheſe, &amp; the <hi>Malauarian</hi> ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
which thoſe country people vſed. But finding by
experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that to inſtruct children &amp; ignorant people
by an interpreter, to be a thing both very tedious, and
of ſmall profit, he chooſe rather to learne himſelfe
their language, then to vſe interpreters; ſo great deſire
he had of their conuerſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore he cauſed his ſayd Interpreters to turne
the principles of the Chriſtian doctrine into the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarian</hi>
tongue. Then he (although he were now grown
into good yeares) becomming agayne, as it were, a
child for Chriſt, getting the ſame by hart, went vp &amp;
downe the ſtreetes with a little bell in his hand calling
the children and people together, in ſome conuenient
place, and there taught them thoſe principles he had
learned in their owne language. His feruour in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
made the people learne with more alacrity.<note place="margin">Their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arning.</note> And
in the ſpace of a month the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which before were

what he had taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſo that <hi>Francis</hi> neither repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe of his labour in teaching them, nor they
of their diligence in learning. Nay they were ſo ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
learning, that they neuer ceaſed to ſolicite him to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19094:78"/>
giue them ſet prayers one after another to learne by
hart, &amp; heerin they would ſo preſſe him, that he could
ſcarce haue leaſure to recite his diuine office in quiet,
they neuer making an end of begging of him, vntill he
had performed their deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> therfore as ſoone as he perceiued all things
to ſucceed well in theſe firſt beginnings,<note place="margin">He vſeth children for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and others.</note> not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe with the good of a few, bethought how
he might help a greater number. And to the end his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
might the more dilate it ſelfe, he cauſed the
children by litle and litle to teach their parents, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes,
ſeruants, and neighbours thoſe things which
they themſelues had learned of him. So as theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
of ſchollers becomming in a ſhort time maiſters,
were no ſmall furtherance to the Chriſtian cauſe. Yet
<hi>Xauerius</hi> although he vſed theſe helpes, did not for al
that take any leſſ paynes himſelfe. For vpon ſundaies
before a great company, of children, men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
beginning with the Creed, he briefly explicated
vnto them the twelue articles of the Chriſtian fayth
&amp; the ten Commandements, ſome at one time, ſome
at another. He was heard attentiuely and diligently,
with the aſtoniſhment not only of the Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law in the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nikes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to reaſon.</note> but
alſo of the Ethnickes, who came in great troopes to
heare him, admiring that the Chriſtian Law, was ſo
agreable and conformable to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Xauerius</hi> well knowing, that to explicate
diuine matters as they ought, the diuine aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was
more neceſſary then humane induſtry, before euery
article of the Creed and ech Commaundement he
cauſed the people to recite certayne verſicles made for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19094:78"/>
the purpoſe, wherein Chriſt, and the B. Virgin Mary
were piouſly inuoked, to aſſiſt them particularly both
to belieue, and practiſe thoſe things with they heard
taught. Sometymes alſo he would tell them confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if they could obtayne thoſe things of God,
which they deſired of him, concerning the obſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the Chriſtian Fayth, and his diuine Law, they
would afterwards receiue more good, and aboundant
benefits from heauen, then yet they durſt in their harts
preſume to wiſh for. He inſtructed the <hi>Neophites</hi> and
the <hi>Cathecumens</hi> altogeather with, whome indeed he
tooke more paynes and labour, becauſe they were in
more danger of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">He bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth whole villages.</note> But the number was ſo great
of ſuch as became Chriſtians (for oftentimes he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
whole villages in one day) that euen his hands
&amp; armes were ſo weary with baptizing, that he could
not poſſibly lift them vp. And oftentimes alſo he was
ſo ſpent with repeating ſuch things vnto them as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned
to the Chriſtian myſteries, that both his
voice and forces fayled him.<note place="margin">His ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ouer come by labour.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for all this his noble vertue and courage ſought
for no releaſement of his labour, but rather how he
might gaine new matter of merit: ſo that you would
haue thought his body could not be tyred out, nor
his courage ouercome by any labour whatſoeuer. He
ſought out dayly many infants heere and there,<note place="margin">His tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of yong children.</note> and
baptized them: yet his chiefe endeauour was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
litle children, knowing very well that the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vp of tender youth was a matter of great impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance,
as forſeeing that they being inſtructed in their
infancy, might be more profitable to the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19094:79"/>
of the Chriſtian fayth, then their parents;
whereof he had many euident tokens. For he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
that theſe Neophite-children being very apt
to learne their Chriſtian doctrine, were greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to teach the ſame vnto others; and that they
did ſo deteſt the worſhipping of Idols, and all kind
of ſuperſtition, that if their parents did offend therin,
they would not only reprehend them themſelues, but
preſently tell <hi>Francis</hi> of it. And to this forwardnes of
the children, his helping hand was not wanting. For
if at any tyme they tould him of any ſuch thing, he
would preſently take the children by the hand, &amp; go
with them to the houſe, where that heynous offence
was committed, and as though an alarum had byn gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to battaile, he would ſet vpon the place where the
Idols were, and together with the children ruſh vpon
them, breake them to pieces, ſpit and tread vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; laſtly vtterly deſtroy them, making in this manner

the reſt of the townes. All which when he had
once gone ouer, neuer thinking of reſt, but as it
were dallying with his labours, he againe returned to
the firſt village, there to amend what he ſhould find
amiſſe; and in the ſame manner went ouer all the reſt
which before he had viſited.</p>
               <p>In the meane time alſo, thinking it neceſſary to
eſtabliſh the Chriſtian faith, nor only for the preſent
but alſo for the time to come, he left in euery towne &amp;
village a Copy of the Chriſtian doctrine, willing thoſe
that could write, to copy it out, and the reſt to learne
it by hart, and to repeate it ouer euery day. He orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alſo in all the forſaid villages, that vpon all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
the Neophytes ſhould aſſemble themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one place, and there all togeather ſing the Chriſtian
doctrine. And that theſe things might be well and
duely obſerued, thinking it expedient to leaue ſome
in his place, he appointed in euery Towne and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
one to haue a care of matters concerning Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
religion, whome in their language they called the
<hi>Canacaple.</hi> And that this order which was ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
might neuer ceaſe, or decay, he procured of the
Viceroy of <hi>India</hi> an yearly ſtipend for the <hi>Canacaples.</hi>
The reaſon of this was, that in tyme of neceſſity there
might alwayes be ſome to baptize the infants newly
borne when they ſhould be in any danger of death,
and to ſupply in other things that which could not
be well differred, and withall to aſſiſt the Neophytes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19094:83"/>
when <hi>Francis</hi> was farre of, and could not ſo ſpeedily
come vnto them. So as, in euery place he appointed
one or two who excelled the reſt in the vnderſtanding
of the Chriſtian doctrine, graue carriage, feruour of
piety, and integrity of life, teaching them the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and forme of baptiſme, and giuing them in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
that if at any tyme neceſſity ſhould require, they
ſhould with all ſpeed baptize litle infants; and if any
matter of importance beſids, chanced to happen, they
ſhould preſently certify him thereof.</p>
               <p>Theſe, euery one in his Village, for want of Prieſts,
being as it were the Curats or Paſtours, had the care
of the Church, and twice euery day they taught the
Catechiſme both in Latin, and in their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
language: in the morning to the men, and in the
afternoone to the women. They alſo, as the Chriſtian
cuſtome is, denounced the Banes of Matrimony, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
enquiry what impediments there might be to
hinder any from lawfull marriage; but their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
charge was to baptize litle infants, who through
weakenes might be in danger of death. And when <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius</hi>
made his viſit in the ſayd Villages, theſe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
preſently deliuered vp vnto him the number
of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were borne that yeare, of thoſe who
kept concubines in their houſes, and of ſuch as had

by this meanes he knew, &amp; compoſed all difficulties

               <p>To theſe <hi>Canacaples</hi> at <hi>Xauerius</hi> requeſt were aſſigned

               <p>

their falſe dealing: which occaſion cauſed the

Chriſtians. And the <hi>Brachmans</hi> being aſtoniſhed as wel
at his great learning, as at the miracles wrought by
him, turning their hate into reuerence, endeauoured
to gaine his fauour and friendſhip, both by guiftes, &amp;

though he reiected their guiftes, to keep his owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
free, yet notwithſtanding he conſerued good
correſpondence, and friendſhip with them. And as he
went his circuit about the townes of the Chriſtians,
oftentimes he lodged in their abiding places (which
are alſo called <hi>Pagods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pagods.</note> as their Gods are) hoping that
ſome of them might be conuerted, with the ſaluation
of many ſoules.</p>
               <p>Vpon a tyme he came to a certaine Pagod, where

one another, and many wordes paſſed to and

their Gods commaunded thoſe to do, who were to
come into heauen to them? After long ſtrife amongſt
them who ſhould giue the anſwere, it fell at laſt, by
common conſent, to the lot of an ancient man of 80.
yeares of age, the eldeſt amongſt them; who craftily
ſhifting off the Queſtion, asked <hi>Xauerius</hi> agayne,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19094:85"/>
what the Chriſtians God commaunded them to do?
But he perceyuing the old mans euaſion, tould him
he would not ſpeake a word of any Chriſtian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres,
vntill he had anſwered his queſtion, as good
reaſon he ſhould. Then the old man being driuen
to it by neceſſity, with open manifeſtation of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
ſayd: That their Gods commaunded them two
things: The one was, that they ſhould not kill any
Cow, becauſe with kine the Gods were worſhipped:
The other was, that they ſhould beſtow liberall guifts
vpon the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>achmans,</hi> the chiefe Prieſts &amp; Miniſters of
the ſayd Gods.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Xauerius,</hi> moued at the ignorance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency
both of the man, and the thing, preſently
roſe vp, and intreated them, that they would alſo now
heare him. And with a lowd voice reciting the Creed
and the ten Commandements, he briefly explicateth
the ſame in their country language:<note place="margin">The Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans approue of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
the ioyes of the bleſſed in heauen, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the damned in hell: and finally who they
were that ſhould go to the one, and other place. As
ſoone as they heard this, on a ſuddain they all roſe vp,
and euery one imbracing him, wonderfully extolled
the Chriſtian Religion, containing ſuch agreable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes
and precepts as thoſe were: ſuch is the force of
truth, euen with peruerſe minds, if light from heauen
ſhine vpon them.<note place="margin">The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> Then they asked him many other
things very ridiculous, and ſuch as we who by Gods
goodnes vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Truth, do abhorre to heare; to
wit, whether the Soule of man dyeth togeather with
the body, as other liuing creatures do? What ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19094:86"/>
be the cauſe, why we ſeeme in our ſleepe to be with
our friends, although they be far of? Is it not becauſe
our ſoule, the body being aſleep, leaueth its manſion,
and flyeth abroad? Whether God be white or black?
for they themſelues being blackiſh by nature,<note place="margin">The Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans thinke God to be black.</note> out of
the eſteeme they beare to their owne colour, thinke
that God is black, and do oftentimes beſmeare their
Idols with oile in ſuch manner, that they be not only
black, but euen vgly alſo, and horrible to behould; in
ſo much that you would thinke you ſaw the Diuels
themſelues, and not their images.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> when theſe queſtions were asked him,
knowing well how to accommodate his ſpeech to his
Auditours, anſwered not ſo learnedly, as ſutably to
their capacities, ſo that not one of all the company
durſt open his month to contradict him. But when
he preſſed them to imbrace the Chriſtian Religion,
which they ſaw ſo manifeſtly proued vnto them, they
anſwered, that indeed they were afraid of what the
people would ſay, and that they ſhould want meanes
to liue, if they ſhould change their courſe of life. And
ſo theſe wretches making more account of what the
people would ſay, then of their owne ſaluation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the light which began to ſhine vpon them, &amp;
remained obſtinate in their darknes.</p>
               <p>Now although, as we ſayd, the <hi>Brachmans</hi> carry
away the bell for wiſedome among the <hi>Indians:</hi> yet
there was only one found among them all, worthy of
that name, a Schoole-man of a famous Academy of
<hi>India,</hi> who out of the familiarity which he had with
<hi>Xauerius,</hi> declared to him certain myſteries of that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19094:86"/>
Academy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> held: that there was one God maker of
the world, who raigning in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of mortal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that euery eight day (which we cal
Sunday) ought to be kept holy: &amp; that a time would
come when all ſhould profeſſe one Religion. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he deſired to know the myſteryes of the Chriſtian
fayth, which at length <hi>Francis</hi> declared vnto him, and
withall ſpake theſe wholſome words of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Marc. 16. Math.</note>
                  <hi>Qui crediderit &amp; baptizatus fuerit, ſaluus erit,</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth
&amp; is baptized ſhal be ſaued. The Brachman no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
downe in a litle booke theſe words with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
and intreated <hi>Xauerius</hi> to baptize him vpon
certayne conditions. But <hi>Xauerius</hi> reiecting his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
being neyther iuſt nor honeſt, thought it good
to differre his requeſt for a tyme, &amp; ſo diſmiſſed him;
bidding him to publiſh that myſtery of one God to the
people, hoping that he would indeed become a perfect
Chriſtian, &amp; be occaſion of no ſmall aduancement to
the Chriſtian cauſe. But yet there was another yong
<hi>Brachman</hi> who gaue not only greater hopes,<note place="margin">A Brach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized teacheth children the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme</note> but alſo
proued better indeed. He being of an excellent wit &amp;

by his appointement vndertooke to teach children
their Catechiſme; Chriſt thus chooſing to himſelfe
mayſters of his doctrine, out of the Diuels ſchoole.</p>
               <p>At this time now, God would ſhew manifeſtly
how pleaſing <hi>Xauerius</hi> labours were vnto him.<note place="margin">An iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged by God.</note> He we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
vpon ſome occaſions to an Ethincke noble-man, who

Serue me in the ſame ſort, if euer I come to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Church. This iniury offred to <hi>Francis</hi> being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
abroad by thoſe who were preſent, no body
had leſſe feeling of it, then he to whome it was done.
It ſeemed doubtleſſe, both to the <hi>Portugheſes,</hi> and the
Neophites an vnworthy fact, as deſeruing indeed to
be reuenged by God himſelfe. Therfore he who taketh
vengeance vpon iniuries done vnto his ſeruants, ſent
ſpedily a due puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon that contumelious man.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, the ſame Noble man being vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
chanced to meet with his armed enemies not far
from the Chriſtians Church: wherefore being not
able to reſiſt he thought to defend himſelf by running
away. Now as he fled, they followed him cloſe with
their deadly weapons, &amp; were euen come to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Church, wherin that wretch (not thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the contumelious words which formerly he had
vtteed againſt <hi>Xauerius</hi>) thought to ſaue himſelfe. But
the Neophites comming forth in haſt at the clamour
and tumult which they heard, ſo ſtopped vp the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to the Church, and, as it ordinarily hapneth,
the laſt came ſo hard preſſing vpon the firſt, that he
could not poſſibly haue way to enter, ſo to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
They ſeing this, &amp; knowing the man, cryed out
that God the reuenger of <hi>Xauerius</hi> his iniury had by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
iudgment debarred him of the refuge he deſired.
And ſo he who before had contumeliouſly ſhut <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
out of doores, being purſued by his enemies, and
endeauouring to ſaue his life by flying to the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

to be ſerued in the like manner, as he ſerued <hi>Xauerius.</hi>

of thoſe labours, ouerwhelmed with heauenly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
he hath bin ſecretly heard to breake forth into
theſe words: <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord, do not euerwhelme me

               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> therfore liued a whole yeare in the coaſt
of <hi>Piſcaria</hi> with infinite labour,<note place="margin">The mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude of thoſe that were baptized</note> and the like comfort;
and that which much increaſed his ioy, was the great
augmentation of the Chriſtian faith. For as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by his owne letters, he baptized aboue a 1000. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
who preſently after their Baptiſme went to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen.
Wherby we may gather what a multitude there
were, either of infants that liued, or elſe of elder peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whome he made members of Chriſts Church. And
it is well knowen, that in that coaſt many villages, &amp;
ſome whole Townes, were by him conuerted to the
Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>When he had thus carryed, and ſet in order the

Wherfore <hi>Xauerius</hi> reioicing at this ſo fortunate
ſucceſſe imployed himſelfe inceſſantly in going about
from towne to town, to baptize &amp; inſtruct the people
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19094:91"/>
in the myſteries of the Chriſtian faith. What an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

aboue ten thouſand. His manner of inſtructing and
baptizing was this. When he came to any village to
baptize, calling all the men, women, and children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
into one place, after he had taught them, that
there was one God, the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy
Ghoſt, he commanded them euery one to make vpon
themſelues thrice the ſigne of the Croſſe in honour of
the moſt B. Trinity, according as he had before inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them. Then putting on a Surpliſe, with a cleare
voice he pronounced the myſteries, &amp; precepts of the
Chriſtian Religion,<note place="margin">His ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note> &amp; explicated the ſame briefly (as
well as he could) in their owne language. And when
they ſeemed to be ſufficiently inſtructed, he bad them
aske God pardon publickly for the ſinnes of their life
paſt, and demanded whether they did really and truly
belieue all and euery point of the Chriſtian Religion?
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, by putting their armes a croſſe gaue a ſigne
that they did belieue, and ſo he baptized them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe euery ones name in writing, as his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
was.</p>
               <p>When all were baptized,<note place="margin">He ouer throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the temples &amp; Idols.</note> 
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> cauſed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

which a litle before they had with ſo great reuerence
adored. Which great iniury the Diuel certainly would
not haue left vnreuenged, if <hi>Francis</hi> had not had as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19094:92"/>
great courage to withſtand the danger, as to offer him
that affront. For he ſtirred vp the <hi>Badages</hi> agayne
(of whome we ſpake before) who are no leſſe cruell
enemies to Chriſtian Religion, then brutiſh &amp; ſauage
by nature, againſt the flock of Chriſt, which as yet
was but yong and tender. Wherfore a mighty army of
theſe barbarians made a ſuddaine incurſion vpon the
borders of <hi>Trauancoris,</hi> &amp; began to ſpoile the villages
of the Chriſtians. The inhabitants making a dolefull
outery,<note place="margin">Atumult amongſt the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and children, being all in vproue, betooke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to flight, yet with little hope to eſcape, being

               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> (for it happened he was then preſent)
being ſtirred vp by the tumult, wrought a memorable
act. For, wholy forgetting himſelfe, by reaſon of the
eminent danger he ſaw before his eyes, he flyeth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, like a Lion, and with an vndaunted
courage,<note place="margin">A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable deed of his.</note> both of ſpirit and countenance, rebuketh
thoſe barbarous people; who were wonderfully ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to behold his courage and boldnes, ſince being
ſlaues to the Deuill and forgetfull of their owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and ſaluation, they came ſo violently to offend
others. Then as a good Paſtour he putteth himſelfe
into the formeſt preſſe of the Chriſtians, either to rule
his flocke by authority, or if he could not do that, to
dy togeather with them. But the <hi>Badages,</hi> although
moſt barbarous &amp; cruell, could not indure thoſe fiery
flames which ſeemed to ſhine forth of <hi>Francis</hi> his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

was not free from danger of death. For the Ethnickes
out of hatred to Chriſtian Religion, lay oftentimes in

of their owne accord, watch in the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

omitted neyther his nightly prayer, which ſcarcely
permitted him two houres reſt, nor ceaſed from his
dayly iourneys of the day, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the heat of the ſunne;
for that going about the Townes, he went barefoote,
in a ragged coate, and with an ordinary Hat on his
head. Yet this careleſnes of his corporall habit did no

eminent.<note place="margin">He is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led great Father.</note> He was now commonly called the <hi>Great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

was not leſſe in augmenting the flocke of Chriſt, then

a great ſtorme of perſecution, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
proued very profitable vnto them. For the King
of <hi>Iafanapatana,</hi> vnder whoſe dominion that Iland is,
out of a Barbarous cruelty, being alſo incenſed with

that ſending thither an army of men, what by fyre &amp;

conuerted to the Fayth of Chriſt. This <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaria</hi>

They had therfore ſent certayne men to the
Citty of <hi>Malaca,</hi> to requeſt of the Portugheſes there,
ſome Prieſts who might better inſtruct them in the

commanded them, was only this: that ſince they had

to liue like men, and withall to ſerue one God
with purity and ſanctity of life. The Gouernour of
<hi>Malaca</hi> approuing their demands, granted them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
Prieſts. And although <hi>Francis</hi> made no doubt
but they would worthily behaue themſelues for the

a great deſire to be partaker of that labour, thinking
that in ſo large a Kingdome there would be great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

to plant and cultiuate the holy Ghoſpell.</p>
               <p>At the very ſame tyme almoſt, there came newes
alſo from the Iland of <hi>Ceilanus,</hi> which at the firſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
heauy and ſad, but afterwards proued ioyfull.

King his Father had notice therof, all-mad with rage
and fury, commanded his ſonne, with others of his
conſayle (to the number of 600. as was reported) to be
publikely ſlaughtered. But the enemy of Baptiſme,
baptized them in their owne bloud: and whileſt he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19094:95"/>
endeauoured to depreſſe Chriſtian Religion, he exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>For at the very ſame tyme, the Inhabitants ſaw
a great Croſſe of Fire in the ayre; and in the place

Phyſitian of the ſoule, laying before his eyes the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19094:96"/>
clemency, and mercy of Almighty God, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all malice (which was an ordinary cuſtome in

as he came to <hi>Ceilanus,</hi> as though he had byn certaine

&amp; began to find excuſes, and withall to auoid

with all his ſleights. For on a ſuddaine, and vnawares

now becauſe he could not auoyd meeting with him,
hauing byn already eſpyed, &amp; that he might not ſhew

ſinnes, as by <hi>Francis</hi> his exceeding mildnes, but indeed
by Gods diuine impulſe, reſolued to make a confeſſion

feare and baſhfulnes, hearkened carefully vnto him
firſt, as they walked vpon the ſhore: But afterwards
when he perceiued him to go on with more courage
and freedome, taking him gently by the hand, he led
him into a chappell neere by. The other out of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the holy place, began to kneele downe, as the
cuſtome is, therby to make an end of the Confeſſion
which he had begun. But <hi>Francis</hi> perceauing he had
ſome difficulty therin, forbad him to kneele for the
preſent; and to induce him to confeſſe the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
he ſpread a mat vpon a banke, that they might
there ſit more commodiouſly. They had not ſate
long when God ſo touched his hart, that riſing vpon a
ſuddain, he fell downe at the Fathers feete, and with
aboundance of teares and ſighes layd open all the ſins
of his whole lyfe. And hauing thus waded out of
the pudle of ſinne, &amp; disburdened his ſoule of all filth,
he began with great feeling to frequent the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Confeſſion (of the fruit and wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
whereof he had now gotten a taſt) and ſeriouſly
to prouide for the ſaluation of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme <hi>Xauerius</hi> hauing inſinuated
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19094:97"/>
himſelfe into the <hi>Ceilanians</hi> friendſhip, got acceſſe to
the Kings ſonne, whome he found perplexed, as well
by his brothers example, as by thoſe prodigious ſignes
whereof we ſpake before, &amp; priuately baptized him,
together with his Couſin-German; whereupon he
reſolued to fly, together with ſome chiefe men of the
Kindgdome, to the Viceroy of <hi>India,</hi> and to craue his
ayde agaynſt the ſauage cruelty of his Father, who had
already imbrued his hands in the innocent bloud of
his brother &amp; kinſmen, &amp; now thirſted after his alſo.
<hi>Xauerius</hi> was likewiſe by him informed, that moſt of
the <hi>Ceilanians</hi> being moued by thoſe miraculous ſignes
of the Croſſe in the ayre, and vpon the ground, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
much incline to the Chriſtian fayth, but that
their good deſires were hindred, through feare of the
Tyrant his Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> being very glad of this newes, ſendeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
letters to <hi>Fa. Paul,</hi> who remayned at <hi>Goa,</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him to ſend two of the Fathers, who were euery
day expected from Portugall, to <hi>Ceilanus,</hi> with thoſe
noblemen, who where to be reſtored to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to haue a care of the Chriſtian cauſe in that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
And ſending backe <hi>Fa. Manſilla</hi> immediatly into
the Promontory of <hi>Comorinum,</hi> he himſelfe croſſeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to <hi>Nagapatana,</hi> for the occaſion which we haue
already mentioned. But all that preparation, &amp; <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
his expectation, when it ſeemed now to be vpon
the point of ioyning battayle and obtayning victory,
vpon a ſuddaine falleth to nothing. For at the ſame
time a ſhip of the K. of <hi>Portugall</hi> (which being fraught
with rich merchandize was bound back agayne from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19094:97"/>
the Kingdome of <hi>Pegu</hi> into <hi>India</hi>) being by force of
tempeſt driuen into <hi>Iafanapatana,</hi> was preſently ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
by that barbarous King. Wherefore the Viceroy
imploying his ſeruice for the Kings affayres, ſurcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from battaile, vntil the Kings goods were recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And ſo by making this delay, the warre, as many
tymes it happeneth, was by differring, broken cleane
off. Yet God afterwards gaue to <hi>Xauerius</hi> what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.
For not long after that Tyrant being diſconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by many ouerthrowes which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy

from him, &amp; all the inhabitants became Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
Thus the death of a few for Chriſt his ſake, was the
cauſe of liberty and ſaluation to many. <hi>Francis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to looſe the labour which he had taken in that
iourney, and alſo ſeruing himſelfe of the wynd, which

left behind him a worthy example of abſtinence. For

with a deſire to viſit the holy Apoſtle, he had byn fed

which reſpect the Apoſtles Sepulcher is had in great

For that there come vnto this place from all parts, a

who beare great eſteeme to the Martyrdome &amp;

               <p>Hither therefore <hi>Xauerius,</hi> out of deuotion to <hi>S.

of a Pilgrime, therby both to honour the Apoſtles
Sepulcher, and to aſſiſt the bordering neighbours in
matters concerning their ſaluation. He found in that
towne, beſides many inhabitants about 100. families
of Portugheſes, who had there ſetled themſelues, and
their meanes. <hi>Xauerius</hi> therefore, preſently vpon his
arriuall to this place, viſited no leſſe religiouſly then
affectionately the Apoſtle of the Indians; admiring
his ſingular glory, whoſe vertue he emulated, as farre
as a mortall man was able. And firſt he earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
God, that ſince he being a poore wretch was
called from heauen to imitate, though neuer ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19094:99"/>
ſo great an Apoſtle in conuerting of the <hi>Indians</hi>
to the faith of Chriſt, he would inſpire him with ſome
of his Apoſtolicall vertues. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he inſtantly requeſted
<hi>S. Thomas,</hi> for the care and patronage which he had
ouer the <hi>Indians,</hi> that through his interceſſion, he
might neither want courage to vndergoe the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers,
nor forces to endure the labours in trauailing ouer, &amp;
manuring <hi>India,</hi> &amp; other barbarous Countryes: and
that neither his owne, nor others ſinnes might be any
hindrance of his following the Mowers ſteppes, as
<hi>Ruth</hi> the <hi>Moabiteſse</hi> did, in gathering vp the gleanings
of that our Lords field, and (to his poore ability) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the ſame in Chriſts ſacred granary.</p>
               <p>When he had ſatisfied his deuotion to the Apoſtle
he lodged with the Biſhops Vicar (which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to do, where there was no publicke Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

who was much edified with the great reſpect he ſaw
him beare to Eccleſiaſtical perſons, &amp; with his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affability of ſpeech &amp; true ſimplicity. So as making
himſelfe wholly knowne vnto the Prelate, by laying
open his hart before him, he eaſily wonne his fauour
and good will. This manner of courteſy, as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Xauerius</hi> vſed,<note place="margin">A man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to gayne &amp; help friends.</note> not ſo much to gayne friends, as to
help thoſe whome he iudged worthy of friendſhip.
For when he had once found out their dipoſitions, he
would by litle and litle draw them to whatſoeuer was
requiſite, both for their owne ſaluation, and the diuine
ſeruice. This good Prelate therfore of <hi>Meliapora</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
<hi>Xauerius</hi> courteſy by returning him the like, &amp;
imbracing him as a worthy perſon, whome he vſed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19094:100"/>
thence forwards with much affection and reſpect, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecialy
after he perceaued in him moſt euident markes
of ſanctity. For by the conference which he had with
<hi>Xauerius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xauiers Virginal chaſtity.</note> and by hearing his Confeſſions, he playnely
found (as he afterward teſtified vpon his oath, which
teſtimony we haue now in our hands, iuridically ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned)
that he had kept vnſpotted the flower of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Chaſtity, wherwith he was borne.</p>
               <p>He remained in the Vicars houſe three or foure
months, to the great profit both of the townes men,
and himſelfe. For he drew many out of the ſinck of
grieuous ſinnes: &amp; many diſhoneſt louers, whome he
could not well ſeparate, he ioyned togeather in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.
He reconciled alſo to friendſhip, ſuch as before
were at deadly hatred one with another. He freed
many who had bin long entangled with heinous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and abominations. Yet for all this, whilſt <hi>he ſo</hi>
much profited others, he neglected not his owne, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
himſelfe very much to contemplation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things, eſpecially in the night, when he was
free from other employments. And it hapned very
often, that when he was ſought for by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions,
he was found praying in ſome corner of the Apoſtles
Church. For being at that time doubtfull what to do,
and very vncertaine whether he ſhould go forward to
the <hi>Macazarians,</hi> or returne back into <hi>India,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with God in the holy Apoſtles Church; ſo as
there ſpending almoſt whole nights in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with great feruour of ſpirit, he craued the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
one while of the moſt B. Virgin mother of
God, and another while of <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> &amp; other Saints.
<pb n="073" facs="tcp:19094:100"/>
And at laſt being repleniſhed with incredible ioy from
heauen, he perceiued it to be Gods will that he ſhould
go forward to the <hi>Macazarians,</hi> not ſo much to inſtruct
them (as afterwards he vnderſtood) as to help ſome

This howſe ioyned cloſe to the Apoſtles
Church, into which was made a little dore, for the
vicar to enter priuatly. Now <hi>Xauerius</hi> had a cuſtome,
when he perceiued the vicar to be aſleepe (for he lay
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19094:101"/>

noiſe, from of his bed, and to creepe along with great
warines into the Apoſtles church: yet did he not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceaue the vicar, who often awaking on a ſuddain
perceiued him to be abſent. Wherfore he firſt diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled
the matter, but afterwards, out of the friendly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which was betweene them, aduiſed him not to
go into the Church in the night time, nor to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
himſelfe by going that way which was knowne
to be haunted with bad ſpirits, for he might perhaps
meete with them in their vgly ſhapes, when he leaſt
thought of them. At this <hi>Xauerius</hi> ſmiled, thinking he
had ſaid it to make him afrayd, and ſo putting the
Prelate off with a ieſt, ſtoole notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the next
night priuately into the Church when he perceiued
him to be faſt aſleepe.</p>
               <p>At this deuotion of Francis the enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
were mad with rage and hatred, intending to
driue him by terrour from that cuſtome: &amp; ſo at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
as he was praying before the Aultar of our B.

the Church with horrible roarings, confuſed cryes,
and hydeous noyſes. But finding him nothing afraid
at theſe their threates, they fal vpon him altogeather,
and beate him moſt cruelly with ſcourges, exerciſing
their malice vpon him, both in railings, &amp; blowes.
Amidſt all theſe their violent ſtrokes he hauing more
care how to remaine conſtant, then how to defend
his owne backe, called vpon the mother of God who
beheld this combat; and ſo with vndaunted courage
deluded at laſt the Diuells vaine aſſaults, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19094:101"/>
on his prayer, not only without feare, but alſo
with greater conſtancy. So as by this his manly &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible

that he by this victory, ſo brake their forces, that they
neuer afterward durſt attempt any thing in that kind
againſt him.</p>
               <p>There lay a certaine yong man in a chamber ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

with that noiſe, heard <hi>Xauerius</hi> crying out (as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils

B. Virgin for help. And he obſerued, that he very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

For by the benefit of that holy Sacrament he was not

God to turne from them the wrath which hung ouer

a little after fell vpon them. For the yeare following
<hi>Malaca</hi> was greatly afflicted by a ſtronge ſiege of the

of Gods diuine indignation, &amp; moued to compunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
aroſe out of their deadly ſleepe, and came againe vnto
themſelues. Amongſt many paſſages of this kind, a
certaine wonderful act which <hi>Francis</hi> there wrought,
did not a little moue the whole Citty.</p>
               <p>There was a yong man of that Country called
<hi>Antony Fernandez,</hi> who by the Deuils cruell tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him had loſt the vſe of his tongue, and was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
fallen into a moſt dangerous diſeaſe, wherof he had
layne now three whole dayes in deſpaire, giuen ouer
by the Phiſitians. Wherfore his friends and kins-men
being ſuperſtitious and wicked people bring vnto him
certaine Sorceres, a kind of diuelliſh Phyſitians, for
remedy. But when their Witchcrafts did no good,
<hi>Xauerius</hi> is ſent for,<note place="margin">A poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and cured of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</note> who was no ſoeuer come into the
chamber where the ſick man lay, but preſently he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
to rage, cry out, and writhe about his face,
eyes and mouth, after a foule and vgly manner: you
would haue thought the Deuill were now rouſing
himſelfe for the combat which he ſaw to be at hand.
There you might haue ſeene <hi>Francis,</hi> moued both out
of compaſſion towards the yong man, and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Deuill, to fetch many a deepe ſigh. Then
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19094:106"/>
preſently falling vpon his knees, he firſt offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by earneſt prayer vnto God, and then began to
exerciſe the raging yong man, after the accuſtomed
manner; wherein he continued, vntill comming to
himſelf he remained ſomewhat quiet without ſo great
vexation as before. The next day <hi>Xauerius</hi> hauing ſaid
Maſſe for the yongman, commeth agayne with coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
and alacrity to the battayle. A wonderfull thing:
that obſtinate and importune foule Spirit which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
him, being ſuddainly vanquiſhed, and driuen
out, the ſickman preſently recouered both his ſpeech
and ſenſes, and remayned free from any corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.
There was nothing which euer made <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
ſanctity of life, more remarkable both to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and Barbarians then this. For heerupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be ordinarily called the <hi>Holy Father,</hi> hauing his
old name now renewed at <hi>Malaca,</hi> which he had left
behind him in <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His name grew alſo famous,<note place="margin">A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy.</note> and much renowned
by reaſon of a certaine prophecy which he afterwards
vttered in this manner. Vpon a tyme demaunding of
a Portugheſe Merchant who was to go into <hi>India,</hi> in
what ſhip he meant to go. The merchant pointed to
a certayne ſhip that lay there in the road. I would not
haue you (quoth <hi>Francis</hi>) go in that ſhip. But when
the merchant anſwered, that he had already put his
merchandize therinto, yet if he thought there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
daunger, he had rather haue his goods caſt away,
then himſelfe; <hi>Xauerius</hi> recollecting himſelfe a litle, as
though he had taken aduiſe of God, vttered this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
ſince, quoth he, you haue put your mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſe into
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19094:107"/>
this ſhip, you may alſo venture your life therein. But
if any tempeſt, or other accident happen, beware you
do not caſt your goods ouer board, but haue a firme
confidence that God will ſend you help, which will
free both you and your goods from danger. The euent
afterward ſhewed him to be no falſe prophet. For the
ſhip in the mideſt of her courſe being driuen by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
tempeſt was caſt vpon the ſands. Now the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
being affrighted at the ſuddayne danger went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the lighten the ſhip of her burden, by caſting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
board her loading, when as the merchant remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
what <hi>Xauerius</hi> had commaunded him, forbad
them ſo to do in any caſe, telling them what the holy
man had fore tould, and withall promiſing them, by
that which he had ſayd, that God would aſſuredly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them. Which preſently proued true. For the
ſea comming vpon a ſuddayne ouer thoſe ſands, the
ſhip was ſtraight afloate, and ſo eſcaping that danger
arriued ſafely at the hauen, by Gods &amp; <hi>Xauerius</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The newes heereof being afterwards brought
to <hi>Malaca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the night tyme to the peoples prayers the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and men in deadly ſinne.</note> it is wonderfull to ſay, how much it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
his credit, and eſteeme of ſanctity.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſpace <hi>Francis</hi> did not only omit any
thing of his former old exerciſes of Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but alſo inuented new. For after the ſunne was
ſet, he going vp and downe the Citty with a litle Bell,
by ſome graue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or ſpeach admoniſhed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to call vpon Gods diuine clemency, for the ſoules
which were tormented in Purgatory, and for them
that were in deadly ſinne. Which new inuention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſſe profitable for the liuing then for the dead,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19094:107"/>
did not a litle ſet on fire the <hi>Malacenſians</hi> harts. Theſe
labours of his, wherby he reſtored the Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
wholy decayed in the Citty of <hi>Malaca,</hi> were
much increaſed, by no ſmall employment, which he
tooke in tranſlating, with the help of an Interpreter,
the Chriſtian doctrine into that language, which the
<hi>Macazarians</hi> did alſo vnderſtand,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Macaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> to receiue the Ghoſpel.</note> to whome he greatly
deſired to go, moued therto by the often good tydings
which came from thence. For that about the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
newes was brought, that the people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were greatly inclined to receiue the ſeed of the
Chriſtian Fayth, becauſe there were no Temples of
Idols amongſt them, nor Idolatrous Prieſts to draw
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the worſhip of falſe Gods: They only adored
the Sunne when it roſe, and beſids that, they had no
other God at all.</p>
               <p>Nothing now ſeemed longer to <hi>Xauerius</hi> then that
day, when as hauing turned the Catechiſme into their
language, and vnderſtood the ſtate of the Iland, he
might go to inſtruct them: yet in the meane tyme he
furniſhed himſelfe with contemplation of diuine
things, but ſpecially with heauenly prouiſion, for the
vndertaking of ſo great a charge. For after he had
ſpent whole dayes in offices of charity, he would in
the night defraud himſelfe of his ſleepe, and ſit vp
watching in prayer and meditation, that ſo he might
come vnto the <hi>Macazarians</hi> wholy inflamed with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
fyre, and burning loue, both to God and men.
He had now ſpent ſome moneths at <hi>Malaca,</hi> yet there
came no newes of the ſhip which he expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
Wherefore with the Gouernours good leaue he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19094:108"/>
reſolued to go to <hi>Macazaria,</hi> haſtning to inſtruct that
nation in the Chriſtian fayth.</p>

(which is a Country in the other world, not further
diſtant from <hi>Amboynum</hi> then from Spaine) and going
to the <hi>Moluca's,</hi> arriued with his whole nauy at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boynum.</hi>
There were many ſhips, a very great number
of marriners &amp; ſouldiers, an incredible multitude of
ſick, beſides a cruell peſtilence that had taken away
many Spaniards: whereupon it manifeſtly appeared
that God out of his ſingular bounty, had ſent <hi>Xauerius</hi>
before to be ready to aſſiſt &amp; help them.<note place="margin">He relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the calamity of the Spaniſh nouy.</note> For preſently
his inflamed charity began to ſet vpon the violence of
that peſtiferous diſeaſe, aſſiſting ſome by ſeruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and reconcyling others by the Sacrament of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
One while he comforted the ſick, another while
he aſſiſted, ſuch as lay at the point of death, and buried
thoſe that died with funerall obſequies. Thus he being
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19094:109"/>
but one man, performed the office of many.</p>
               <p>But his greateſt labour of al was, to procure of thoſe
that had meanes, things neceſſary for the poore and
ſicke, and to ſeeke about with vnſpeakable labour &amp;
paynes medicines for their diſeaſes, whereof in that
place there was great ſcarcity. Therefore hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes
begged ſuch thinges of one <hi>Iohn Arauſius</hi>
a Portugheſe merchant,<note place="margin">He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels that <hi>Arauſius</hi> will ſhortly dye.</note> who had great ſtore of ſuch
like wares, he at laſt tooke it ill, &amp; was very angry to
ſee that he made no end of begging. So as when vpon
a tyme, one asked him ſome ſuch drugs in <hi>Francis</hi> his
name, he with much grudging gaue at length what
he demaunded, but tould him therewithall, that he
ſhould aske him no more. Which thing comming
to <hi>Xauerius</hi> hearing, preſently by diuine inſtinct, What
quoth he, doth <hi>Arauſius</hi> thinke that he ſhall long inioy
thoſe things which he hath? He is ſurely deceiued;
Go tell him from me, that he need not be ſo ſparing
of his wares which death wil ſhortly take from him, &amp;
that he himſelfe will dye ere it be long, in this very
Iland, and that his goods will fall to the ſhare of the
poore: therfore if he be wiſe, let him largely beſtow
what he hath vpon the ſicke poore people, for Gods
ſake, and make his benefit of that which may help
him after he is dead. The euent was anſwerable
to what he foretould. For not long after <hi>Arauſius</hi> dyed
in the ſame Iland, leauing no heyre behind him, &amp; his
goods were diſtributed amongſt the poore, according
as the cuſtome is there, when one dyeth without hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:
and <hi>Arauſius</hi> being ſtroken with the terrour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath
which was declared to him to be at hand, became
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19094:110"/>
more wary of his owne carriage, and more liberall
alſo of his drugs to the poore.</p>
               <p>He ſpent three monthes (for ſo long the Spaniſh
nauy remayned at <hi>Amboynum</hi>) in ſeruing the ſicke, to
their exceeding great good, both of body and ſoule.
Yet <hi>Xauerius</hi> his diligent endeauours were no leſſe
profitable to the whole, then to the ſicke. For he neuer
gaue ouer to drawe out the corruption of their minds
both by the medicines of the Sacraments, and by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
and publike exhortations. Which labour of his
was not in vayne. For he reaped indeed plentifull
fruite of peace, from thoſe warlike people: many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

               <p>When <hi>Xauerius</hi> therfore was come thither, he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

and blind, euen in matters of ordinary humanity, that
in making their bargaines concerning trafficque, they
eſteemed nothing vnlawfull, or vniuſt, whereſoeuer
there ſeemed any hope of gayne. This Citty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

for cure, with the ſame art which he had formerly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19094:111"/>
done at <hi>Malaca.</hi> For hauing gotten the Inhabitants
good will,<note place="margin">Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling wicked men.</note> partly by winking at their manners, and
partly by the ſweetnes of his conuerſation, he began
by litle and litle to diſcouer their ſores, and to apply
remedies thereunto. Wherein his ſingular prudence
manifeſtly ſhewed it ſelfe. For if he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in the ſnares of diſhoneſt loue, if he were a
perſon of authority and eſteeme, he vſed moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
to deale with him in this ſort.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he would diſcourſe after a ſweete familiar
manner, &amp; if he did not inuite him to his houſe, he
would gently offer himſelfe to be is gueſt. Sitting at
table he would diſcourſe pleaſantly, thereby to open
a way for good and wholeſome counſayle. Then as
ſoone as he had gotten to be in ward and familiar with
him, he would begin to ſpeake of the foulenes of ſin,
and ſo by litle and litle come to the loathſomneſſe of
carnall concupiſcence, &amp; the inconueniences which
enſue thereon; to which he would often alſo adde
threats and vengeance from heauen. At laſt when he
perceiued him to be moued, he would take him, in a
gentle manner by the hand, and induce him to make
his confeſſion. And ſo in fine without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he eyther made him put away his Concubine, or
elſe to take her in lawfull wedlocke. It is well knowne
that in this kind he brought many to marry their
Concubines, that the lawfulnes of wedlocke might
extinguiſh the flames of diſhoneſt luſt.</p>
               <p>The like courſe he tooke to draw from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
which they had gotten by vſury or deceipt; the
fumme wherof was ſuch, that the <hi>Sodality,</hi> called <hi>of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19094:112"/>
Mercy</hi> there erected, being but meanly fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, became
therby rich &amp; wealthy. This was not a litle furthered
by his often exhorting and inſtructing of the ignorant
people and children. Whereby the behauiour of the
Citty was amended, vniuſt Contracts diſſolued, and
the childrens eares and tongues ſo filled with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme,
that al places round about ſounded with the
pleaſant tunes of the Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
               <p>But the chiefe thing which moued the <hi>Ternatians</hi>
was a certayne Prophecy that <hi>Francis</hi> vttered. He
being now at <hi>Ternate</hi> ſo far off from <hi>Amboynum,</hi> ſaw
by diuine reuelation <hi>Iohn Arauſius</hi> the merchant a
dying, as he had foretould it would ſhortly happen.
Therfore ſaying maſſe before a great aſſembly, when
after the Offertory he turned about, as the cuſtome is,
to the people, ſaying <hi>Orate fratres,</hi> Pray for (quoth he)
&amp; commend to God the ſoul of <hi>Iohn Arauſius</hi> who is
now dead at <hi>Amboynum;</hi> yeſterday I ſaid maſſe for him
and ſo do now againe to day. Wherat they that were
preſent were ſtroken into an amazement, looking one
vpon another, and asking how he could come to
know that, ſeeing <hi>Amboynum</hi> was aboue 200. miles
from that place, and it was knowen that no man had
come from thence at that time. Then their admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being turned into expectation of what would be
the euent therof, they who had bin preſent, noted
downe his words, and the time; and a few dayes after
there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a ſhip from <hi>Amboynum,</hi> and bringeth
newes of <hi>Arauſius</hi> his death. Wherupon comparing the
things and times togeather, they found all to be iuſt as
<hi>Francis</hi> had foretould. Then they made no doubt but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19094:112"/>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> aſſuredly knew the ſame by diuine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and therefore euery one did reuerence him, as a
Prophet.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Xauerius</hi> began to prepare himſelfe for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cazaria,</hi>
which was diſtant from that place only two
dayes iorney. But if ſeemes it was not Gods holy will
that he ſhould help them, who were already ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly
prouided for. At the ſame time he was informed
by perſons of credit, that in <hi>Maurica</hi> (commonly
called the Country of the <hi>Mauri</hi>) there were very
many Chriſtians, who through want of Prieſts were
brought into extreme danger of their ſaluation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
iudging it beſt to aſſiſt thoſe who ſtood moſt in
need, leauing of his iourney to the <hi>Macazarians</hi> who
wanted not other helpes, he ſetleth himſelfe, and his

               <p>Neuer did his ſingular courage, and confidence

of wild beaſts, then of men: That moſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
haue their hands imbrued in the bloud of their

more to be kept farre from their fury. They moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

was to be in euident danger of his life amongſt thoſe
people, who make but a paſtime &amp; ieſt of murdring, &amp;
poyſoning one another, &amp; thirſt after nothing more
then humane bloud. What prudence therfore could
it be, to preferre ſuch dangerous places, before thoſe
that were quiet? What reaſon had he, being a ſtranger
to truſt his life in their hands, who, as all wel knew,
tooke no other delight, but in killing, and murdering
one another?</p>

Whileſt his friends ſtood beating theſe things into

ſaying: <q>what Portugheſe is there in the world
yea what ſtanger or Barbarian who knoweth <hi>Xauerius,</hi>
will endure, that the inſtruction of a baſe Country
ſhould be bought with the hazard of his life? Who
can now hope, that the chiefe ſtay of the Eaſt, which
ought to be perpetuall, will continue long, if ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
he put his life into manifeſt danger, forgetting
that he draweth with him the ſoules of ſo many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
into the ſame ruine? He ſhould remember how
the ſaluation of all <hi>India,</hi> &amp; in numerable other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
dependeth on his life. If he, out of incredible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and courage of mind, contemned all dangers,
yet at leſt he ſhould not draw with him, the ſoules of
ſo many people, into hazard. The deſire of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, ſhould ouerſway the particular; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſeeing it is manifeſt, that it was not worth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to inſtruct ſo ſauage a Nation, which had byn
forſaken by their Prieſts, not ſo much for feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as out of deſpayre to do any good among them.
Wherfore they beſought him for Chriſt IESVS ſake,
the redeemer of mankind, that he would not, out
of an vncertayne hope to ſaue a few, caſt both his
owne life, and the ſaluation of innumerable nations
into certaine danger, but would, as well beſeemed his

Let God prouide for theſe things, who vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
is the author of this determination; vnder the

feare death, which layeth hould on euery one, though
they feare neuer ſo much. But a good death (which
is the entrance to immortality) is to be deſired. And if
I dye, God certainly will not dye, who hath both a
farre greater deſire of the ſaluation of Nations, then
I haue; &amp; can alſo eaſily ſend labourers into his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.

replied, that he feared neither dangers, nor death
where the honour of God &amp; ſaluation of ſoules was to
be ſought, and that he eſteemed none for his enemies,
but thoſe that hindred Gods diuine ſeruice. He was
certainly determined and reſolued to follow God who
called him into <hi>Maurica,</hi> neither was it want of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

               <p>When therfore his friends perceiued him to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

in his determination, not inuenting what more to do,
they came all weeping vnto him, &amp; brought him all

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19094:115"/>
haue him preſerued from all plagues and poiſons, they
ſhould dayly pray to God for him. For that was
the moſt infallible, and moſt preſent remedy which
could be found. And ſo taking leaue of his friends,
he prepared himſelfe for his iourney, with all alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

venture vpon ſo great danger, there came good newes
out of <hi>India,</hi> which added more flames to his zealous

the tyme of Lent: wherfore very many of them did

               <p>This King therfore being moued aſwell by <hi>Xauerius</hi>
courteſy, as by his ſanctity of life, vſed him with all

openly repined thereat; and he much deſired his

become a Chriſtian; as when he ſayd, that the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens
and the Chriſtians adore one God, and a time
would come when they ſhould both profeſſe one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
But although he ſeemed to take delight in <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>This viſion was altogether ſecret, no mortall

ſpoken thereof to any. Being therefore after a while

called backe to <hi>Malaca,</hi> and making his confeſſion to
<hi>Xauerius</hi> as his cuſtome was, he ſayd nothing of the

asketh him, what that was which happened to him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
in a Church of the Iland where he was? To me
(quoth he?) I remember nothing. The Father gently
vrged him to tell, but <hi>Durus</hi> refuſed, &amp; vtterly denied
to haue ſeene any thing: &amp; being in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
asked (ſo obſtinate he was to haue concealed
the matter) forgetfull both of obedience &amp; Religion,
he ſtill anſweared from the purpoſe. Then <hi>Francis,</hi>
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw that he had to do with one of ſo obdurate
a nature, began himſelf to recount euery thing in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as if he had byn preſent. Whereat <hi>Durus</hi> ſtood
like one amazed, and being filled with an holy feare,
declareth all the matter in order as it hapned; and ſo
at laſt the good Father receiued him agayne into his
friendſhip. But this truth being wrunge out of <hi>Durus</hi>
by diuine reuelation, made him more obſeruant heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
vnto <hi>Xauerius,</hi> &amp; eaſier in yelding to the truth.
Who after <hi>Francis,</hi> his death declared all this vpon his

ſo ſoone as they were landed, and with all ſpeed,
they ſet vp ladders to the Caſtle to haue ſurprized the

For the garriſon being inſtantly rayſed by the

beat backe the enemy.</p>
               <p>But now the buſineſſe of their ſhips in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſucceeded not ſo fortunately. For the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
fell fiercely vpon the ſame at vnawares, and
in the darke of the night, ſet on fire their principall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19094:126"/>
ſhippes, ſtriking there withall ſuch a terrour into the
Portugheſe marriners that they ſtood wholy amazed,
like men without ſenſe, not knowing what aduiſe, or
courſe to take to help themſelues. In the meane ſpace
the Barbarians being out of danger, ſtood looking on,
and reioicing to ſee the Chriſtians Nauy on a flaming
fire. And ſo at laſt with a moſt clamorous ſhout, and
outcry they departed, inſulting ouer the Portugheſes,
and Chriſtians, as though they had gotten a notable
victory.</p>
               <p>The Barbarians not content with this,<note place="margin">An e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelty.</note> hauing in

vpon the ſea, they manifeſted vpon them a moſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
cruelty. For after they had cut of their noſes, eares,
&amp; heeles, they ſent them to the Gouernour of <hi>Malaca,</hi>
with a letter written with their bloud, wherein moſt
proudely, and inſolently they prouoked him to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.
When the fiſher-men had giuen this letter to the
Gouernour, he cauſed it to be publickly read before
the Souldiers, who were no leſſe moued at the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
brutiſhnes of their enemies, then at the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpectacle of their friends, who were thus mangled
&amp; disfigured by their wounds, and euery one had his
hart full of pitty, and indignation.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were in this perplexity and trouble
of mind, <hi>Xauerius</hi> by chance commeth newly from
ſaying maſſe in the Church of the Hoſpital, in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
where he lodged, according to his former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.
And euery one might ſee, that the Barbarous
<hi>Acenians</hi> had done this, out of their naturall hatred
to Chriſtian Religion, and in contempt of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugheſes.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19094:126"/>
The Gouernour therfore named <hi>Simon Mello,</hi>
asked <hi>Francis</hi> his aduiſe, what he iudged fit to be done
vpon ſuch an affront offered? He, by diuine inſtinct
(as afterwards appeared) tould him, that he thought
it beſt to ſend out ſome ſhippes preſently after the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
who was yet in ſight, &amp; by ſetting vpon them
of their owne accord, to quit themſelues of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
to the end the Barbarians might be taught by
their owne harme, to abſtaine from doing iniury to
others. And this he thought beſt to be done the rather,
becauſe he ſaw that this publicke diſgrace was not
offred ſo much to the Portugheſes, and their King, as
to Chriſt himſelfe, &amp; to all Chriſtians; and that by no
meanes it was to be indured, that the Portugheſes,
Chriſtians ſo renowned for their fortitude, ſhould be
now accounted cowards, and made a laughing-ſtock
to their enemies. For who ſeeth not, quoth he, that
Chriſtianity wil be ouerthrowne, if barbarous people
be ſuffered, not only to hate it, but alſo to vſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly?
Wherfore he willed them to take courage
worthy of Chriſtian ſouldiars, and with alacrity pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
the barbarous enemy, with all hope &amp; confidence;
for although they were inferiour to them in forces,
yet their cauſe was better, and had alſo God to fight
for them, whoſe cauſe they mantayned. For certainly
he would not faile to aſſiſt them, whilſt they behaued
them ſelues manfully in that pious conflict, and that
through his fauourable conduct they ſhould remayne
victors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> counſell was approued of all that were
preſent, but they wanted ſhippes to put the ſame in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19094:127"/>
execution: for there were but only ſeauen left which
had eſcaped burning, and theſe alſo much impayred
through tempeſtuous weather at ſea, &amp; ſtood in need
of reparation before they could be ſet forth for ſuch
an enterprize.<note place="margin">He deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that he may haue the charge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy.</note> Beſids, they were not only out of order,
but wanted tackling and other furniture neceſſary. As
the Gouernour therfore was telling him the want of
ſhippes: I eſteeme it, quoth he, a matter of much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
to be forward in the vndertaking of this
great Buſines, in which not only the Kings, but God
Almightyes Maieſty is intereſſed. And ſeeing in this
fearefull enterprize you are amazed, not knowing
what to reſolue vpon, I deſire with your good leaue,
I may haue the charge of preparing the Nauy. Then
turning to the ſoldiars: Brethren, quoth he, God cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſtadeth for vs, in whoſe name I warne you all
before hand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Xauerius</hi> putteth ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe ſoldiers.</note> that you ſuffer neither feare, nor any

calleth you. Behould heere I offer my ſelfe to go

ſoeuer may happen; that we may reuenge our
ſelues vpon theſe Barbarians, Enemies of moſt our
Vertuous King, and Aduerſaryes of the Croſſe of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe words ſo inflamed the ſouldiars harts, that
al of them, being as it were ſuddainly inſpired by God
ſtroue to giue in their names to fight in ſo religious a
warre, nothing doubting but it would haue a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
iſſue, hauing <hi>Xauerius</hi> for the author, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19094:127"/>
therof. And the Gouernour being glad to ſee
ſuch conſent of the Captains &amp; ſoldiars left al things
to <hi>Francis</hi> diſcretion, who with no leſſe prudence then
courage managed a buſines w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to all mens iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
ſeemed moſt ful of difficulty; as was to prepare a nauy
ſo preſently vpon the loſſe of ſo many ſhips, for that
the Armoury was wholy empty, &amp; ſmall help could
be expected from the publicke treaſury. <hi>Xauerius</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

He calleth them euery one by their names, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling
gentle words with imbracements earneſtly
requeſteth them, that they would both for the honour
of their King, of Chriſt our common Lord, and of
the Chriſtian Name vndertake this buſines, how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourſome
or chargeable ſoeuer it ſeemed, &amp; that they
would with al ſpeed cauſe ſeauen of thoſe ſhipps that
lay in the hauen to be ſpeedily repayred, and they
ſhould infallibly be repayed ſhortly all their expences
with an 100. fould.</p>
               <p>The ſhip-maiſters were by theſe words ſo ſet on
fire, that euery one ſtriuing who ſhould make moſt
haſt, the nauy within foure dayes ſtood ready in the
Port, well appointed of all things. One <hi>Francis Saa</hi> a
kinſman of <hi>Mello</hi> the Gouernour was made Generall
therof, to whome there were alſo aſſigned 180. Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe
ſouldiars. <hi>Xauerius</hi> was to go with them, but
that the <hi>Malacenſians,</hi> out of their great affection to
him, hindred it. For they came flocking to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and what by lamenting their fatherleſſe &amp; deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
ſtate, what by proteſting vnto him that they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19094:128"/>
would abandon the Citty, if <hi>Francis</hi> their only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and vphoulder ſhould depart, they got at laſt both
the Gouernour of the Citty, and Generall of the fleet
to intreat him (being himſelfe doubtfull what to do
in this affaire, ſince the people were of ſuch different
affections) to remaine at <hi>Malaca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> therfore calling togeather the Captaines
and ſouldiars into the Church,<note place="margin">Precepts giuen to ſoldiers at their going to warre.</note> and making to them a

and he for his part, becauſe he could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them in perſon, would be preſent with
them with his beſt wiſhes and prayers: and that they
ſhould ſo diſpoſe themſelues both in mynd and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to eſteeme nothing more pretious vnto them,
then to dye for Chriſt the ſonne of God, who dyed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

before their eyes that amiable and deuout ſpectacle of

enter into combat with the Barbarians. Moreouer,
in the midſt of the battayle, they ſhould cal vpon God
imploring his diuine aſſiſtance, and confidently hope
that he will be ready to helpe thoſe who fight for
him.</p>
               <p>Hauing ſaid this, he began to heare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,

But when, all that tyme, there came no newes of the

that he might at laſt imbrace that with greater deſire

               <p>Neyther did <hi>Xauerius</hi> aſſiſt theſe only who were
his friends and acquaintance, but ſtrangers alſo whoſe
ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeemed to be euen deſperate. There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

Portugheſe Sea-ſouldiar, who deſpayring of his
ſaluation, had not bin at Confeſſion for the ſpace of
18. yeare, and was now ready to imbarke himſelfe
for the ſea to go with the Nauy to <hi>Meca,</hi> when as <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis</hi>
by chance had notice of him.<note place="margin">His zeale of ſoules</note> Wherfore thirſting after

by ſpeaking friendly vnto him, by ſitting by him

him, he ſo wonne his affection, that of himſelfe he
greatly reuerenced him,<note place="margin">He by all courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a ſoldiar of very bad life to make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> &amp; much deſired his company.
Wherupon <hi>Francis</hi> thinking it now a very good time
to put that in execution which he had reſolued, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vpon him vnawares. And falling with him into
familiar ſpeach of the danger of a Soldiars life, began
to aske him in a friendly manner, how he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for death, which this mortality could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
&amp; was haſtned on alſo by a ſouldiars life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
how long it was ſince he was laſt at Confeſſion
by which Gods wrath agaynſt ſinne, the reuenger of
Iniquity, is appeaſed. At which words he fetching a
deepe ſigh ſayd, That he had now continued many
yeares in the filth of ſinne without going to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
but it was rather another mans fault then his.
For before the ſetting forth of the laſt fleete, he reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
to disburthen his conſcience of the many and
henyous ſinnes which he had committed; and hauing
confeſſed them to the Vicar, he refuſed to giue him
abſolution, ſo as he had now no hope of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Francis,</hi> a ſingular Phyſitian for the curing
of forlorne ſoules, telleth him, that he wondred the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19094:144"/>
Vicar was ſo ſeuere, if he had confeſſed his ſinnes as
he ought to do. Then he biddeth him be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
promiſing that he would willingly heare him, &amp;
abſolue him, aduiſing him to call to mynd all his ſins
from his childhood, as farre forth as he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them, preſcribing him alſo an eaſy and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
method how to do it; which he, being now ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vp againe to hope, did willingly, and diligently
practice for many dayes togeather. And when he was
thus prepared, the opportunity alſo of a place was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at hand; which was, that by the way the whole
fleet was inuited to make ſome ſtay at a towne as they
paſſed.<note place="margin">He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his penitent a ſmall penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diug himſelfe to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy for him.</note> When therefore many went a land, <hi>Francis</hi>
alſo with his ſouldiar went with them. And there in a
place remote from any company, he beganne to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are
his Confeſſion, who ſhewed himſelf truly penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

abſolueth him, inioining him to ſay for his penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
once <hi>Pater</hi> and <hi>Aue,</hi> and for the reſt himſelfe promiſed
to ſatisfy his diuine Maieſty. Wherupon <hi>Xauerius</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the ſouldiar, withdrew into the next wood, and
there ſtripping himſelfe naked, beate and ſcourged his
backe extremely, with a whippe full of moſt ſharpe
prickes, and whereof he made no end, or meaſure.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the Soldiar hauing ſaid his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and following the Fathers footeſteppes, came
into the wood, and by the ſound of the laſhes, came
right vnto the place where <hi>Francis</hi> was a diſciplining
himſelfe. As ſoone as he ſaw that horrible whip, &amp; his
backe all torne, and begored with bloud, at the firſt he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:19094:144"/>
ſtood ſtill in amazement. Then with teares guſhing
forth of his eyes, he leapeth vnto him, and caſteth
himſelfe at <hi>Xauerius</hi> feete, nor would he riſe vntill he
left off tormenting himſelfe for anothers ſinnes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that he afterwards by voluntary mortification
waſhed away the ſpottes of his former life, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

<q>I haue aſſuredly (quoth he) ſuch certayne ſignes
and pledges of the diuine prouidence, that I thinke it
would be a great ſinne in me to feare any daunger,
though neuer ſo certayne and manifeſt. For, by Gods
ſpeciall goodnes, I haue paſſed infinite tractes of the
Ocean, and haue compaſſed round the Promontory
of <hi>Good hope,</hi> and haue at laſt arriued ſafe hither to this

<hi>Malaca,</hi> &amp; the golden <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> the Ilands of <hi>Moluca,</hi>
ſtanding almoſt in the vtmoſt partes of the world.
Without any harme haue I gone to <hi>Maurica,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed

Wherſoeuer I ſhall be, I will remember that I am

He was carryed in a goodly ſhip, pointed and barbed

Wherefore he would looke on whilſt others plaid

the Captayne, who was not yet familiary acquainted
with him, although he liked well of his courteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
yet in words he impeached the fame of his

he would often caſt forth certayne inconſiderate
ſpeaches; as that <hi>Francis</hi> ſeemed to be but as other men
are, and that his ſanctity was not anſwerable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

both in <hi>Noronia</hi> and the reſt, that turning their raſh

honoured his ſingular ſanctity, and courteous huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

miles, but the breadeth is various, yet for the moſt

of wayes &amp; meanes how to do it, &amp; chiefly to inquire
of their manners &amp; religions. And hauing diligently
ſounded them all out, he found the matter for the
moſt part thus to ſtand: to wit, that the whole Nation
was of a very tractable diſpoſition, and for the moſt
part cannot endure any double dealing. They haue
no great ſtore of gold, riches, or wealth; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as moſt commonly where there is leaſt money,
there alſo is leaſt ſeeking after it) their ſtudy is leaſt
about ſuch kind of things. Neyther do they account
any thing more diſhonourable, then to increaſe their
wealth &amp; ſubſtance by trafficque, or any other art.
So as their manner of lyfe is vpheld by the direction
of pouerty, yet in ſuch ſort, that they hyde the ſame
with a neat and handſome adorning of their bodyes.</p>
               <p>They ſtand very much vpon their dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
ſo that you would thinke them therin moſt

take content in any thing elſe. Notwithſtanding
(which is incredible to be ſpoken or heard) although

them accounted a monſtrous thing. Wherfore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

deale about any buſineſſe of importance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy

obſerue, not only with ſtrangers, but alſo with their
friends, and thoſe of the ſame houſehold with them;

and peace with others.</p>
               <p>They take very great delight in hunting, in ſo
much that they eate no fleſh which is not gotten by
that meanes. They can no more endure mutton, ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes-fleſh,
beefe, or veale, then we can dogges, or horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh.
They abſteine from milke and cheeſe as we do
from raw bloud. They keep hennes and geeſe, not ſo
much to eate, as for their recreation &amp; pleaſure. They
do therefore ſeldome eate fleſh, which when they
doe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſes</hi> ſpare dyet.</note> is alwayes Veniſon. They feed for the moſt
part on fiſh, fruite, herbes, and rice: and by the
meanes of their temperate dyet they are very ſound
and healthfull, liuing ordinarily vntill they be very
old, vnleſſe they meete by chance with ſome violent

their liuing ſo well vpon a little, that <hi>Nature is content
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19094:158"/>
with few things,</hi> although ſenſuality be neuer ſatisfied.
Adulteries are with them moſt ſeuerely puniſhed.
They abſteine altogeather from dyce-playing, and
ſuch like games, deeming that by thoſe meanes, men
become deſirous of others goods. They are alſo ſo
farre from theft and robbery, that they iudg nothing
more vnworthy in a man: for which cauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

guifts of nature are obſcured by pride, a malady deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted in this Nation. For they ſo contemne other
nations in reſpect of themſelues, that they are for the
moſt part very arrogant and inſolent in their carriage
towards ſtrangers. This one thing only excepted they
want nothing, but the light of the Ghoſpell, being of
themſelues a nation (if there be any in the world)
borne, and in a manner framed to al ciuility. For euen
the country people themſelues are very ingenious, &amp;
deſirous of learning; in ſo much, that as euery thing
ſeemeth moſt conformable to reaſon, ſo they do moſt
willingly imbrace it. They are very attentiue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
eſpecially of God, and diuine matters. They
are moreouer commonly very good ſchollers, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a more ſtrict manner of lyfe, liued indeed more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
and hardly then the <hi>Bonzies</hi> were reported
to do; which was moſt certainly true, ſeing that he
found in thoſe places not only want of things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,

he was accuſtomed vnto; ſo as meere hunger and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

did conſtrain him to change, as it were, his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
manner of dyet, and euen his very taſt alſo. For
he kept himſelfe aliue with ryce inſteed of bread, and
for the moſt part,<note place="margin">

                  </note> with fruit and hearbes inſteed of
meate, &amp; this dreſſed after the <hi>Iaponian</hi> faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which
new kind of frugality he moſt willingly imbraced,
for the vehement deſire he had of gayning ſoules to
God, like one, <hi>Whoſe meate and drinke was to do the will
of him that ſent him.</hi> And he was alwayes wont to ſay,
that he was much behoulding to <hi>Iaponia,</hi> becauſe that
euen then, when he was by the inhabitants inuited to
a Feaſt, he found none of thoſe daynties, wherwith
mortall men, being often deceiued, ſought more to
pleaſe their Senſuality, then to ſatisfy Nature, euen
to the ouerthrow rather of their forces, then to the
ſtrengthning therof: ſo as that vnuſuall dyet, and the
manner of dreſſing it, held him to greater tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
therein. Yet for all this, he was of no leſſe ability of
body then before. For he had his health no where bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then in <hi>Iaponia;</hi> by which it is euident, that a ſpare
dyet doth not diminiſh, but increaſe ones health, and
forces.</p>
               <p>But now he had much more to do, in acquainting
his tongue with their language,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponian</hi> language</note> then his palate with
their dyet. For although the <hi>Iaponian</hi> language be not
of its owne nature very hard, yet haue the <hi>Iaponians</hi> by
their endeauours brought it to be exceeding difficile
to learne. There is not any language more copious
then theirs. For to expreſſe diuers conceits of things
in a different ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner it hath wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful ſtore of words,
all ſignifying the ſame thing; and in vſing thereof, it
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19094:160"/>
hath a certayne kind of Elegancy, and as it were, a
ſmacke proper to that country. They do not without
great conſideration, vſe any word which firſt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
but, as ſome are more elegant, ſome of a lower
ſtrayne, ſo do they keep a proportion with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and perſons to whome they are applyed. Nay,
which is very ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, they ſpeake far otherwiſe, then
they write. The men vſe one kind of language, and
the women another: and the letters which they ſend
one to another, are written with one kind of chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
and their Bookes with another. By which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſnes,
and variety both of ſpeaking and writing,
much labour and tyme is required to learne their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
And no man of ciuility muſt be ignorant in
this kind. For if he do ſwarue any thing from their
manner of ſpeach, they will laugh at him, as at an
ignorant and ruſticall fellow; no otherwiſe then we
are accuſtomed to do, when in ſpeaking of latin, any
one ſhould make an odious iarring, in choice eares,
by harſh and barbarous words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis</hi> therefore thinking that it now ſtood him
vpon, to learne their language howſoeuer; when he
had cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Iaponian</hi> to ſet downe the chiefe
heads of the Chriſtian doctrine in writing, he met
with many rubs. For <hi>Paul</hi> being a man without lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
was no whit a better interpreter then a Mayſter.
And although his endeauours were aboue his forces,
yet he effected leſſe then the matter required. For he
interpreted thoſe points ſo ill, that there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
in his ſpeach. And he alſo wrote ſo badly, that
the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> who were euen learned, could hardly
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19094:161"/>
read his writing without laughing. But <hi>Xauerius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an vndaunted courage, which alwayes ſtriued
agaynſt difficulties, &amp; making ſmall account of mens
laughing at him when their ſaluation was in hand,
went perſeuerantly ſtil on in the buſineſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dealing in the beſt in manner he could with the
people, he by the ſanctity of his lyfe, and diuine fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of ſpirit, wrought ſo efficaciouſly with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
he did more good by himſelfe, then eyther by <hi>Paul,</hi> or
any other Interpreter. For at the nouelty of the thing,
and of the doctrine he taught, the inhabitants came
flocking about him by whole troupes, partly out of
deſire to ſee ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers wholy different from them, both
in habit and behauiour; and partly alſo, to know
what Religion they had brought out of the other
world. But becauſe for want of perfect language, they
could not well explicate their owne meaning, nor yet
reſolue thoſe who asked them queſtions, ſome ſcoffed
at them, others mocked at their ſtrange habit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
&amp; others pittyed them being ſtrangers, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that ſuch men comming out of another world
as farre as <hi>Iaponia,</hi> to bring thither a new Religion,
ought neyther to be fooles, nor to bring with them
matters of ſmall moment: ſo as by this variety of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
many were moued with a deſire to know the
new Religion they had brought, and receyued much
profit therby.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Iaponian</hi> hauing ſetled
his affayres, began to be admired by his Countrymen,
becauſe hauing trauayled ouer <hi>India,</hi> he recounted to
them many ſtrange things, &amp; neuer heard of amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19094:161"/>
them. Going therefore to ſalute the Prince of <hi>Saxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
who remayned 15. miles from <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> he is by
him courteouſly entertayned. After mutuall gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
the Prince asked him many queſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
matters in <hi>India,</hi> &amp; of the Portugheſes wealth
and manners. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing well ſatisfyed him by his

then this veneration of the Picture, the Prince went
not: yet his mother being in loue therewith, greatly
deſired to haue a patterne of it, but there was no pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
found who could performe what the pious woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
requeſted. She had alſo afterwards a great deſire to

the principall points therof ſet downe in the <hi>Iaponian</hi>

               <p>Wherfore ſeing his endeauours to haue no effect

himſelfe with farre better ſucceſſe at home, then he

his owne family and kindred, neuer leauing to teach

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19094:162"/>
alone, ſometimes altogeather, vntill he had drawen
many of them to the Chriſtian faith: ſo as within a
ſhort ſpace his wife, daughter, and many of his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes
both men and women, were inſtructed in the
Catechiſme, and baptized, the people no wayes miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>But <hi>Xauerius</hi> vnderſtanding for certaine,<note place="margin">The Ninxit or chiefe Prieſt of the <hi>Bonzies.</hi>
                  </note> that the
peoples affections depended wholy vpon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the ſame he ſhould find all things eaſy; thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
firſt of all, to bend all his forces againſt their
eſteeme and credit amongſt the people, as againſt the
maine fort of ſuperſtition. Wherfore meeting vpon a
very fit occaſion with the chiefe man of the <hi>Bonzies</hi>
(whome they call <hi>Ninxit,</hi> &amp; who farre excelleth the
reſt not only in yeares and dignity, but alſo in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

himſelfe into his familiarity. Then falling
from one diſcourſe to another, by little &amp; little he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to buckle with him about matters of Religion.
And not in vaine. For he found him preſently, not to
ſtand conſtantly to what he ſaid, as well concerning
the immortality of the ſoule, as in other points, but to
ſtagger in his opinions, when he was preſſed with the
truth; ſo as he had no great difficulty in ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

the people, he maketh meanes for acceſſe vnto the
King: wherin <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Iaponian</hi> ſtood him in great
ſteed. For he eaſily drew the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Saxuma,</hi> who

admitted to the King, and finding him well diſpoſed,
brought him without any great difficulty, to giue free

This liberty was no ſooner graunted, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

he ſo dearely loued. When he entred into his houſe &amp;
beheld her aliue and in health, he could hardly belieue
his owne eyes; and with teares trickling downe for
ioy, asked her by what meanes ſhe was reſtored againe
to life? As ſoone, quoth ſhe, as I was dead, there
ſtood ready at hand certaine cruel executioners, who

two other ſingular men, by whoſe meanes I was
deliuered out of thoſe executioners hands, &amp; reſtored
to life againe. At this relation of the maid, the father
ſtood a while aſtoniſhed through admiration. Then
perceiuing, manifeſtly, that it was done by <hi>Xauerius</hi>
help, he leadeth his daughter to him to giue him than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
Aſſoone as ſhe ſaw <hi>Francis</hi> &amp; his companion, ſhe

cryeth out: Behould, Father, theſe be the two men
that reſcued me from Hell. Then he with the mayd

This man, as we ſaid before, was by <hi>Francis</hi> made

a reward due to his paynes. For when a great

               <p>
                  <hi>Antony</hi> therfore being in a great throng of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

thoſe who were afraid to make haſt away,
and withall affoarded his help and aſſiſtance to others
that were weake, and cold not fly ſo faſt. In the meane
time the enemy approached, &amp; he fearing leaſt ſome
of the Neophytes being intercepted by the Barbarians
might through payne of torments, be drawne from
the faith of Chriſt, reſolued like a good Paſtour there
to ſpend his life for his ſheep,<note place="margin">Ioan. 11.</note> if need required. The

lifting vp his hands to heauen, offereth himſelfe to

was the Barbarians cruelty, leſſe then his valour. For
being thruſt through the body with three launces, he
fell downe dead. And it is reported, that when they
were ſtripping him, as he lay thus grieuouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

by the <hi>Bonzies,</hi> which brought great calamity to the

then euen death it ſelfe. Many were now by
diuine inſtinct become Chriſtians; and many alſo by

of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> when as the <hi>Bonzies</hi> (which thing <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
had long for ſeene) hindred the courſe of the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
For when they perceaued, that by bringing in,
and increaſe of Chriſtian Religion, the reſpect both
to their Gods, and their owne authority came to be
ſet at naught, they began in good earneſt to be all on
fire with rage &amp; anger. And ſo thruſt forward as well
with madnes, as by the Deuill himſelfe, they come
in great troopes to their king, telling him very reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
and plainly: <q>That he ſhould looke very wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:19094:166"/>
what he did, and ſhould prouide both for his owne
ſafety and of the common good, whileſt it was in his
power. If he did permit his ſubiects to entertayne
ſtrange Religious, their Countrey Gods would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly
become a mocking ſtocke euery where: and
if they were once incenſed, what could he expect els,
but that <hi>Cangoxima,</hi> and his whole kingdome would
within a while be vtterly ouerthrowne? Did not he
ſee, that the Chriſtian Religion was wholy repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

before thoſe of their owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, there would
be cauſed extreme ſorrow to the country Gods? And
certaynely it was a leſſe fault for the people to offend
therein, then for the King to winke at others offences.
The ſlower that Heauen was in puniſhing, the more
enraged would the wrath thereof be when it came.
For no doubt but the firſt founders of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
would be reuenged of <hi>Cangoxima</hi> for ſo great
a diſgrace, and that both he &amp; his kingdome would be

if he had any reſpect, or reuerence of his Country ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,

               <p>The King being ſtroken with this ſpeach of the

As ſoone therfore as <hi>Xauerius</hi> came thither, he found
very many of the Nobility, and more of the vulgar

they had long ſince heard many things by report.
He therfore obſerued this order, that twice euery day
at the corners of ſtreetes, and in croſſe wayes before
a great concourſe of people he explicated the Ghoſpel
of Chriſt out of a written paper, for he had not yet
gotten the <hi>Iaponian</hi> language perfectly; yet all did not
with the like proſperous ſucceſſe giue eare vnto the
word of God: many did indeed hearken very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>

Mercy it ſelfe opened the way vnto Religion, &amp; ſome
began already to be Chriſtians. But <hi>Francis</hi> thinking
it not worth his labour to remaine any longer in that
Citty, determined to go vnto <hi>Meaco,</hi> with intention

ryce (which himſelfe alſo begged as he trauailed)
with no leſſe want of food then payne of body. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the inſolency of the Country people, to theſe his

wanting to giue them ſatisfaction, hauing now
gotten ſome pretty skill in their language. Twice
therefore euery day did he preach vnto the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </gap>ended his ſermon, he ſpent ſome tyme in conference

to their queſtions, or elſe by queſtioning them. Theſe
diſputes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming one vpon the necke of another, held
out moſt commonly till it was very late in the night,
ſo that he had ſcarcely any leaſure to prouide for his
corporall neceſſities. And in all this buſineſſe nothing
hindred him ſo much, as his vnperfectneſſe in the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponian</hi>
language. For oftentymes when any vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

of all qualities, and many tymes it could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine

afterwards a notable Preacher, and brought
very many of his Country-men to the light of the

ſo to gratify his loue, that they could neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy

certaynly knowne to be naught: If then God were
good, why did he create ſuch deteſtable creatures as
they were? Then <hi>Xauerius</hi> anſwered, that God had
created them all good, who by their owne fault were
become bad, and therfore were tormented eternally
in Hell. But then they vrged him, why did God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
men, whome he had created to ſerue him, to be

their affections rather inclined to vertue, then proue

ſhips that <hi>Xauerius</hi> was arriued, the men came all out

For that the thundring out of ſo many great ſhot,
ſounded to the <hi>Iaponians</hi> eares, as though there had
byn a battayle at ſea. Whereupon the King, who
remayned in the Citty not farre from the Port, was

when the <hi>Bonzy</hi> was ready to oppoſe him, the King
bad him go to ſomething elſe, for that was already
iudged for good by the Arbitrators, whoſe ſentence
they were to ſtand vnto. He therfore demandeth of

the paſſengers &amp; marriners caſt one vpon another on

as for his companions, cryeth out: O Ieſu Chriſt, God
of my hart, I beſeech thee by thoſe fiue wounds which
the Loue of vs gaue thee vpon the Croſſe, help theſe
thy ſeruants, whome thou haſt redeemed with thy
precious bloud. A wonderfull thing. The ſhip on a
ſuddayne mounted vp aboue the waues, and got out
of preſent daunger, euery one acknowledging Gods
moſt liberal, and helping hand therein.</p>
               <p>When they had thus eſcaped their owne perill, all
their care was for their neighbours: and euery one
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:19094:206"/>
who had kindred, or friends in the loſt boate, began
greatly to lament their misfortune. After they had
thus a while bewayled their friends, they fall to pitty
themſelues. For they were toſſed vp and downe in
an vnknowne ſea, where neuertheleſſe together with
the Cock-boate, they had loſt almoſt all hope of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
themſelues. <hi>Xauerius</hi> therefore, ſeeing them all
weeping, and halfe dead through feare, biddeth them
take courage, and telleth them withall, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three dayes the daughter would agayne come to her
mother, ſignifying thereby that the Boate ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
agayne vnto the ſhippe. They generally gaue
no great credit to the matter,<note place="margin">A predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the ſhip.</note> yet they were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather

ſoone as it was light, <hi>Francis</hi> commeth forth amongſt
them with a cheerfull countenance, and ſaluting the
Mayſter of the ſhip after a courteous manner, willeth
him to command one to clime vp the Maſt, to eſpy
whether the Cocke boate were in ſight or no. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
an ancient and expert marriner, called <hi>Peter,</hi>
anſwered in a gibing manner, that they ſhould then
recouer their Cock-boate, when they had loſt their
ſhip. To whome <hi>Francis</hi> replyed: why, Peter, thinkeſt
thou any thing hard for God to do? I for my part am
not out of hope, but that by the goodneſſe of God, &amp;

               <p>Then when he who had aſcended the Maſt ſayd,
that it could not yet be ſeene, <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis</hi> ſhut himſelfe cloſe

part of the day in prayer, and at laſt commeth out tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them good newes, that they ſhould preſently ſee
the boat returne home againe: and forth with intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Maiſter to ſtrike ſayle, and to ſtay for the
boate, for certainly all that were in her, eſpecially
the two Saracens, ſhould by Gods and his B. Mothers
help be ſaued. The maiſter of the ſhip refuſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and the others cryed out vpon it, both becauſe
it was in vaine then to expect the boate, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they could not do it, without manifeſt perill
of their ſhip. For euen ſtill they thought they ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes the danger which they had ſo lately eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.
But the Maiſter, being at laſt wearyed out
with <hi>Francis</hi> intreaties, cauſeth the ſmall ſayle which
then was only vſed, to be let downe. Hauing thus
ſtayed his courſe for a good ſpace, and the boate not
yet appearing, and the ſhip alſo ſeeming to be in
ſome danger becauſe the ſea was ſtill very rough and
the wynd boiſterous, he commandeth the ſayle to be
hoyſed vp againe. But <hi>Xauerius</hi> ſtill vrged him, and
intreated the marriners to expect yet a while, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
aſſuring them that the boat would come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
without any danger to their ſhip. But when the
marriners, who were out of all hope, and moued alſo
with the preſent danger they were in, would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
haue hoyſed vp the ſaile, the Father
runneth vnto them, and laying his hand faſt vpon
the yard, beſought them by the pretious death, and
woundes of our Sauiour, that they would be pleaſed
to expect yet a little longer. With much ado they
obeyed; and he ſet himſelfe againe to pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:19094:207"/>
In the meane time <hi>Antony Dias</hi> was at his requeſt
gone vp to the toppe of the Maſt, who looking all
about, tould them he could yet ſee nothing; and
therefore intreateth <hi>Xauerius</hi> to giue him leaue to
come downe: but he, on the other ſide, wiſhed him
to ſtay there ſtill a while. And as he prayed earneſtly
with his hands lifted vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he biddeth the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and the reſt to be of good courage. Now all this
while the ſhip (being as it were warranted by <hi>Francis</hi>
from any preſent danger) was toſſed with mighty
waues, and floated vp and downe the ſea without any
harme at all. And hauing in this manner expected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
three houres, and the matter held for deſperate
by ſome, behold vpon a ſuddaine <hi>Dias</hi> cryeth out that
the boate was in ſight, and comming towards them.
Then they being all exceedingly comforted, began
to giue thankes to God, and to <hi>Francis Xauier.</hi> As
ſoone as the boate came within all their ſights, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
they turne the ſhip croſſe-wiſe to receiue her,
and ſhe, God certainly guiding her, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth directly
vpon the ſhip. As ſhe approached neerer vnto them,
the marriners, now leaping for ioy, went about, as
the cuſtome is, to caſt out a rope vnto her: but <hi>Xauerius</hi>
tould them that there was no need ſo to do,<note place="margin">The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of her ſelfe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the ſhip ſide.</note> for ſhe
of her owne ſelfe would come cloſe to the ſhip ſide.
And ſo it came to paſſe indeed; all the company being
aſtoniſhed at the miracle. At laſt ſhe came ſo right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſide, that the poore men might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly
taken vp. Beſids this, although ſhe were in the midſt of
the waues, yet remained ſhe firme without any to hold
her, vntil ſhe was againe faſt bound vnto the ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:19094:208"/>
Beſides this ſo euident a miracle, another ſtrange &amp;

out vnto them that they ſhould firſt help forth <hi>Xauerius</hi>
who was ſtil in the boat. When the marriners replyed
that <hi>Xauerius</hi> was well &amp; ſafe in the ſhip, &amp; had neuer

another, that all the while they were toſſed by the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

&amp; driuen vp and downe in the ſea, <hi>Xauerius</hi> was
ſeene comforting them, &amp; putting them in hope to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape

to vnderſtand, that <hi>Francis</hi> whileſt he prayed for their
deliuery appeared alſo vnto them (as it is recounted
of <hi>S. Nicolas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Myra</hi>) by whoſe prayers it was
manifeſt they had byn ſaued from ſhipwracke. This
thing was much ſpoken of by all the paſſengers,<note place="margin">He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels a calme ſea.</note> and
marriners. But <hi>Xauerius</hi> affirmed, that it was Gods

the ſhip, with all ſpeed to make ready all his ſayles,

that melancholy cogitation. But he, carrying himſelfe
with a cheerfull contenance, ſhewed manifeſtly, that
he had no griefe of mynd, and withall very ioyfully
openeth to his friends <hi>Xauerius</hi> his prediction, and the
euent thereof. At laſt, when he had tould them the
whole matter, he intreated that they would euen that

preſently to dye. It ſo fell out indeed: for being well
ſtroken in yeares, he was preſently taken away by
ſuddayn death; and the very ſame day his friends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

contemned the Viceroyes command, wherwith he

was caſt into fetters, being accuſed to haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to reuolt from his King; and forthwith, bound

thence ſent into Portugall to the King; where being
deſpoyled of all the goods which he had vniuſtly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
branded with ignominy, condemned to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
impriſonement, and his body couered all ouer
with a moſt loathſome leaprouſy, he ended his dayes
in ſuch miſery, that the King ſeemed not ſo much to
reuenge the tranſgreſſion of his Command, as God
the violating of his diuine Maieſty. At laſt this wretch
being euen tyred out with calamities, opened his eyes,
and by wholſome pennance, waſhed away the ſtaynes

               <p>Neither was there wanting, at the ſame time a

               <p>In the meane <hi>Iohn Mendoza,</hi> a noble and wealthy

when the time for nauigation came, he could not get

a ſhip, for that there was but only one in the Hauen,
&amp; that not fit for ſea, as being old, &amp; halfe rotten, &amp;
her keele ſpecially ſo very weake, that ſhe was ready
to fall aſunder: So as the ſea men and marriners gaue
their opinion abſolutly of her, that ſhe would not be
able to brooke the ſeas, but ſtraight grow looſe in her
ioynts and leake, and ſo be quickly caſt away. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the factour being ſad, knew not what to do. But
when he vnderſtood, that <hi>Xauerius</hi> holy <hi>Body</hi> was to
be tranſported vnto <hi>Goa,</hi> he ventured in her, not only
all his merchandize, but his perſon and life alſo, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
aſſured confidence in God, that by the merits of
<hi>Xauerius,</hi> of whoſe admirable vertue he had had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <p>In the meane time <hi>Peter Alcaceua</hi> of the Society of
Jeſus being ſent by <hi>Coſmas Turrianus,</hi> was come vnto
<hi>Malaca,</hi> to bring away thoſe ſacred Reliques vnto <hi>Goa.</hi>
Wherfore he, togeather with <hi>Tabera,</hi> conuey the holy
ſhrine into the ſhip, to the exceeding ioy, both of the
marriners, and paſſengers, as thinking themſelues
ſtrongly armed therby againſt al tempeſts. There was
a chamber in the ſhip prepared of purpoſe for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Body, richly hung with ſilke, wherin the ſhrine
was placed, togeather with ſtore of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perfumes

did aboundantly requite. For when they were in

that ſhe could be haled neither forward, nor back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

At length, after the Marriners had laboured for

to auoyd the great preſſe of people, the
Beere was placed within the Cancells of
the Altar. It was told the people that when Maſſe was

would, might ſee the Body. Whereupon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
made ſo great a throng that they brake downe

was kept ſafe by nothing more, then by the preſſe of
people, hindring one another. Then the Rectour of

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and that when afterwards the chappell was voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>The Viceroy therfore yelding to his requeſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth
himſelfe, and all the Nobility followeth
him. But the people remayned ſtill immoueable, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and requiring to haue the Body ſhewed vnto
them: for vnleſſe they had their deſire, they ſayd they
would not ſtirre a foote. And by ſtanding out thus
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:19094:250"/>
ſtifly, they obteined at laſt their demand. For when as
no delay would ſerue the turne, F. <hi>Melchior</hi> was forced
at length to giue way vnto the tyme, and putting the
preſſe of people a litle backe, vntill the Cancels were
agayne ſet vp and faſtned, <hi>Xauerius</hi> body was ſhewed
to them in his Prieſtly robes, as he was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which when the multitude beheld, they were
ſo deſirous to ſee it neerer hand, that ruſhing on with
great violence they agayne brake downe the Cancels.
Whereupon the Fathers through a ſuddayne feare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſhut the Coffin agayne, that there might no
violence be offered thereunto, &amp; would by no meanes
open it any more. So as the people being out of hope
to ſee it agayne, and weary with expecting, they that
ſtood neereſt, &amp; had ſeene it though a far of, at length
retyred, and told the reſt what they had ſeene. They
being ſet on fire by what they ſayd, neuer left vrging
vntill the Cancels were agayne ſet vp, and the Body
alſo ſhewed them.</p>
               <p>The ſame day in the euening <hi>Anthony Perera</hi> a
Portugheſe, arriued at <hi>Goa</hi> with preſents, and letters
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King of <hi>Bungo</hi> to the Viceroy of <hi>India.</hi> He was
ſent thither by the King to procure <hi>Xauerius</hi> returne
agayne into <hi>Iaponia,</hi> although it were now too late.
The contents of the Kings letters, were theſe: That
<hi>Francis Xauerius</hi> had oftentymes diſcourſed before him
of God the Creatour and redeemer of the world, and
that his words had taken faſt hold within his hart,
&amp; the in moſt bowels of his ſoule. Wherefore he was
now fully determined and reſouled to be baptized by
<hi>Francis</hi> his owne hands, although it were with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:19094:251"/>
of looſing his kingdome. <hi>Xauerius</hi> had indeed at
his departure promiſed him, that he would ſhortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
vnto him, if God ſpared his lyfe. But becauſe
his returne was not ſo ſpeedy as he had hoped, he
thought good to ſend one expreſſely vnto <hi>Goa,</hi> who
might certify him of the cauſe of his ſo long delay.
Wherefore he intreated the Viceroy, to ſend <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
vnto him with the firſt opportunity: whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
would certaynely be both a great incitement to
the Chriſtian Religion, &amp; alſo a pledge of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſes
friendſhip vnto his perſon. When the Viceroy
had peruſed the Kings letters, he eaſily perſuaded Fa.
<hi>Melchior Nunius</hi> (who was one of the chiefe Fathers
of the Society in <hi>India</hi>) to go himſelfe with all ſpeed
vnto the King of <hi>Bungo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this meane tyme <hi>Xauerius</hi> Body was expoſed at
<hi>Goa,</hi> not only to the view, but alſo to the admiration
of all the behoulders. But the great deſire of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was not ſatisfied by ſeing him, but rather more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed:
Yea the ſelfe ſame perſons did oftentymes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
agayne to looke vpon him, &amp; others came floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
almoſt euery moment to behould him. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
therefore through neceſſity, were conſtrayned
to change their determination. And ſo to ſatisfy the
longing deſire of ſuch an infinite multitude, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was expoſed three dayes in a Chappell well fenced
with ſtrong Cancells to the full view of all, and euery
one that would might looke vpon it at their leaſure:
So as there came from all parts an infinity of people
to behold, &amp; touch the ſame with their beades, which
they performed with aboundance of teares and much
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:19094:251"/>
inward feeling of deuotion.</p>
               <p>Now whilſt ſome became doubtful of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his body, the ſame was made therby not only
more certayne, but more glorious alſo. For ſeeing
the miracle did ſurpaſſe all humane beliefe, there were
not wanting ſome, yea Religious perſons, &amp; men of
good authority,<note place="margin">By order from the Viceroy a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his body.</note> who gaue out, that <hi>Francis</hi> his body
being bowelled, was by art, &amp; certayne precious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmings
kept thus liuely. The Viceroy therefore,
to examine the truth of the thing, commaunded <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Saraina,</hi> a Phyſitian of great fame and experience
to try, and looke into the Body. But he beginning
to launce the belly with an inſtrument, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
freſh bloud to iſſue thence, being aſtoniſhed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the miracle, gaue ouer his deſigne. Then putting his
finger into the hole he had made, he findeth his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
intiere &amp; ſound, without any ſigne of balme, or
other preſeruatiue applied; which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke
teſtimony vpon his oath. Wherfore the matter
being throughly examined, and diuulged abroad, <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius</hi>
Body began to be greatly honoured &amp; reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
not more by others, then by thoſe who had byn
authours of the falſe rumour aforeſayd, euery one
kiſſing his feete and hands, and touching them with
their beades. And ſo great was the opinion of <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius</hi>
ſanctity, that euery one did ſtriue to get, yea
purloyne ſome ſmall particle of his body, or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
in ſo much that all the care and vigilancy the
Fathers could vſe to looke vnto it, did hardly hinder
the violence of the deuout pepole.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme <hi>Xauerius</hi> prayſes were ſpread
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:19094:252"/>
all abroad, &amp; his worthy actes, prophecyes, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were blazed far and neere, not only by thoſe who
had themſelues byn eye-witneſſes thereof, but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, who had heard the ſame from credible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;
ſo as all <hi>India</hi> ſounded forth his ſanctity, as it
were with one mouth. And likewiſe for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the former miracles there were many others
added anew. For that many who went to behould
that ſacred ſpectacle, affirmed vpon their oath, that
there came thither many perſons who hauing eyther
loſt the vſe of ſome of their lymmes, or otherwiſe ſick
of ſome diſeaſe, were by touching <hi>Francis</hi> his body
healed, &amp; returned home ſound, and in perfect health.</p>
               <p>Now, when theſe three dayes were paſt, although
the people had not yet their fill of behoulding &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the ſacred Body, the ſhrine was for a time
placed in a Sepulcher, which they had prepared for the
purpoſe, vpon the right hand of the high Aultar, vntil
a fayrer monument were erected and adorned, fitting
the dignity of ſo worthy a man, according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
deſires, and deuotion of the Cittizens of <hi>Goa,</hi> if
the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> as they hoped, would procure
his Canonization from the Pope.</p>
               <p>About the tenth day after his buriall,<note place="margin">The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Vicar againe exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the matter.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
Ribera</hi> the Biſhops Vicar, and Inquiſitour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
determined, in reſpect of his charge and office, to
examine the matter with his owne eyes, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoſe things were true which had byn diuulged

lighted torches attending, throughly felt, and
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:19094:252"/>
viewed the whole body all ouer. And finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which was not entiere, he gaue teſtimony ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vnder his hand and ſeale to all poſterity. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the reuerence, and deuotion to <hi>Xauerius</hi> dayly to
increaſe. There were all moſt none, who came not
with veneration to his ſepulcher; many brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flowers and garlands, and the number of white

great. And this deuotion of the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

And from two children, who were grieuouſly
ſicke of the Pox, it tooke away both the ſickneſſe, and
the markes thereof. All this the ſollicitous woman of
<hi>Baticala</hi> related vpon her oath.</p>
               <p>It is further more euidently knowen, that many
ſicke were at <hi>Goa</hi> recouered by touching <hi>Francis</hi> his
body. Amongſt whome one was a woman-ſeruant,
who in the time of labour, being out of her ſenſes, &amp;
in extreme danger of death (for the child being dead
in her wombe, and lying ouerthwart, ſhe could by
no meanes be deliuered) was vpon a ſuddain preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
&amp; deliuered of the dead child, by applying vnto
her certayne hayres of <hi>Xauerius,</hi> which were religiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
kept in a reliquary. This, her maiſter <hi>Anthony Saa</hi>
teſtified vp his oath; who alſo further more affirmed,
that there was in his houſe a another woman of that
Country, who being alſo in labour of Childbirth,
and brought to ſuch extremity, that there was no
hope of her life, was by the meanes of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary
applyed vnto her, deliuered preſently, and quit
of the danger.</p>
               <p>It is alſo certainly knowen,<note place="margin">A Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth his ſight by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying <hi>Francis</hi> his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to his eyes.</note> that many others haue
with diuers reliques of his cured ſundry diſeaſes. This
following is worthy of note. <hi>Antony Rodriguez</hi> a man
of no ſmall ranke, had through a long rheume ſo loſt
the ſight of his eyes, that he could not ſo much as ſee
thoſe with whome he ſpake, although they were cloſe
by him. He therfore being out of hope to find any
help by art of Phyſicke, hauing tryed all kind of
medicines, but in vaine, cauſed himſelf to be carryed
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:19094:266"/>
to <hi>Xauerius</hi> Sepulcher, and intreating the Fathes to
open the Shrine, put <hi>Xauerius</hi> hands to his eyes, and
preſently began to ſee, finding that thick dimneſſe to
be driuen away; and ſhortly after he fully recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his ſight. This alſo he himſelfe affirmed vpon his
oath.</p>
               <p>No leſſe memorable was that which hapned to
<hi>Baltazar Dias</hi> a Prieſt. He being tormented with the
Squinancy in his throat,<note place="margin">The key of his ſhrine driueth away the rheume.</note> could not ſwallow downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing at all: wherefore diſpayring of all humane
help, he had recourſe to diuine; &amp; intreating the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Society to lend him the Key of the Shrin
wherin <hi>Xauerius</hi> Body was kept, toucheth his thoate
therewith, and the rheume on ſuch a ſuddayne went
ſo away, that the Key ſeemed by <hi>Xauerius</hi> fauourable
aſſiſtance, to haue opened an entrance into his thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.</p>
               <p>But this is farre more glorious. A certaine woman
of good note, named <hi>Ioane,</hi> hauing byn tormented
with a long ſicknes, was now brought to the point of
death at the very time that <hi>Xauerius</hi> body was brought
to <hi>Goa,</hi>

Wherupon being ſtirred vp by the ſolemne ringing
of the bells, and alſo by the fame of his ſanctity and
miracles, ſhe earneſtly beſought <hi>Christopher Perera</hi>
her husband, and others that were preſent, to permit
her to be carryed to <hi>Xauerius</hi> funerall. They affirmed
plainly it could not poſſibly be done, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
danger of her life, and would by no meanes yield
thereunto. Yet the woman loſt not the fruite of her
deuotion. For from that time forward ſhe began to be
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:19094:267"/>
better, and euery day more &amp; more amending, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while after perfectly recouered; ſo powerfull was
the deſire, not only of touching, but euen of ſeeing his
body, in reſtoring health to the ſicke.</p>
               <p>It is alſo recounted, and that by aſſured teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
that a certaine whip made of little cords, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Xauerius</hi> was wont to diſcipline himſelfe, being
kept with great deuotion by a certaine <hi>Neophyte,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Francis</hi> his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline reſtoreth many to their health.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
diuers ſick perſons to their health, and wrought
many other wonderfull things. For which cauſe <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius</hi>
name both was, and is, not only glorious, but
alſo greatly reuerenced in <hi>India,</hi> and throughout the
whole Eaſt; all the people thereof ordinarily, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
his protection and patronage. And as often as
any ſhip paſſeth by the Iland of <hi>Sanciana,</hi> where, as
we ſaid, <hi>Xauerius</hi> was firſt buried, the Marriners and
paſſengers haue got a cuſtome to call vpon <hi>Francis,</hi>
as a Saint raigning amongſt the bleſſed in heauen.</p>
               <p>Neither was <hi>India,</hi> or the whole Eaſt able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the vertue, and glorious Name of <hi>Xauerius</hi>
within their owne bounds, but paſſing ouer the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
it penetrated into <hi>Europe.</hi> There is in Portugall
a Citty called <hi>Ebora,</hi> a place of ſpeciall note, wherin
there is a Colledge of the Society of IESVS, built by
<hi>Henry</hi> the Cardinall, who was afterward King; a
worke well beſeeming both the bounteous liberality
of ſo worthy a Prince, &amp; the magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Citty
alſo. In this Colledge, at the ſame time that newes
was brought of the death and miracles of <hi>Xauerius</hi> (as
we haue byn informed by one of good credit, whilſt
we were writing things of the ſame nature) two of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:19094:267"/>
the principall Fathers, <hi>Leo Henriquez</hi> the Rectour of
the Colledge, and <hi>Andrew Capreda</hi> the Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
very worthy and venerable man, were ſore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with a burning feuer; who vpon the report of
the wonderfull effects which had bin wrought by <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius,</hi>
conceiued both of them great hope of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their health. <hi>Leo</hi> therfore cauſed the <hi>Indian</hi> letters
wherein was written <hi>Xauerius</hi> happy departure out of
this lyfe, &amp; his funerall made glorious by the miracles
which had happened therein, to be brought, &amp; read
vnto him. As ſoone as they were read, he preſently
as it were, moued by diuine inſtinct, and ſtirred vp
with admiration of <hi>Xauerius</hi> vertues,<note place="margin">Two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Europe recouer their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth by calling vpon <hi>Francis.</hi>

vpon his elbow in his bed, and lifting vp his hands &amp;
eyes to heauen, calleth vpon him with no leſſe deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then confidence againſt the violence of his feuer,
beſeeching that he would be no leſſe fauourable to his
owne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had byn to ſtrangers. And his confidence
&amp; ſupplication were neyther in vayne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For his health
followed vpon this prayer, &amp; he preſently felt his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
to be as it were driuen away, by Gods diuine ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
and his former ſtrength to be agayne reſtored vnto
him. Whereupon crying out aloud with ioy, and
teares in his eyes, he giueth humble thankes to God,
and extolleth <hi>Francis</hi> his miraculous vertue, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment
of all that were preſent. So as inſtantly
finding himſelfe to be wholy ſound and luſty, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
out of his bed, and runneth with all ioy, and
alacrity to <hi>Capreda</hi> his ſicke Companion. <hi>Capreda</hi>
knowing how extreme ſicke <hi>Leo</hi> was but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
began to be amazed, and to aske him what the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:19094:268"/>
matter was? Whereupon <hi>Leo</hi> declared vnto him, not
more in words, then by effect, what soueraigne help
he had receiued from <hi>Xauerius</hi> in the curing of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and withall counſayled him to do the lyke, and
without doubt he ſhould in the ſame occaſion find
the lyke help from him. <hi>Capreda,</hi> without more ado
followeth his aduiſe, ſtirreth vp himſelfe to confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; calleth vpon <hi>Xauerius:</hi> nor is he fruſtrated of his
hope, but freed from his feuer, ſooner then any one
could haue expected. Thus was the Societyes ioy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled,
by this double miracle, &amp; <hi>Francis</hi> his ſanctity
more euidently demonſtrated. One of theſe Fathers,
wherof we now ſpeake, to wit <hi>Leo Henriquez,</hi> is yet
liuing in Portugall, as a glorious witnes of <hi>Xauerius</hi>
approued vertue. The report whereof, afterwards as
ſoone as it was ſpread abroad, cauſed many not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Society, but euen ſtrangers alſo to admire his
power, and reuerence his ſanctity.</p>
               <p>There was (to ſay nothing of leſſer matters) ſtill
liuing in <hi>Paris,</hi> euen when we write theſe thinges, a
certayne honeſt and deuout perſon, venerable no leſſe
in reſpect of vertue, then age. This man was wont
to make this relation; to wit, that when newes was
firſt brought of <hi>Francis Xauerius</hi> death, whome he had
neuer knowne but by report, and heare-ſay only, he
felt himſelfe wonderfully ſtirred vp with reuerence &amp;
veneration towards him. Whereupon his wife being
at the ſame tyme ſicke, and in danger of death by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of her labour in child-birth, yea &amp; giuen ouer by
the Phyſitians, he recounted to her certayne paſſages
of <hi>Xauerius</hi> ſanctity and vertue, and withall perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:19094:268"/>
her earneſtly to implore that holy mans aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,<note place="margin">Being called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon at Paris he obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an eaſy deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uery for a woman in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</note>
and no doubt he would help &amp; cure her. She gaue
diligent eare vnto her husbands counſayle, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hauing called vpon <hi>Xauerius</hi> for help, ſhe was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
and ſafe deliuered of her child. And thus were
both the mother, &amp; the child by <hi>Xauerius</hi> merits freed
from preſent danger of death.</p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Xauerius</hi> natiue ſoyle euen at this tyme
without all knowledge of her Childs great ſanctity.
For it is euidently knowne that his death was by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
prodigious ſignes foreſhewed in the ſame place
where he had receiued life. There is in the Caſtle <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerium,</hi>
being the manſion houſe wherin <hi>Xauerius</hi> was
borne, a Chappell wherin is to be ſeene a Crucifix of
exceeding great deuotion, and very much eſteemed
in thoſe parts. There hapned at this tyme a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
accident, miraculous both for ſight, &amp; the euent
therof. For certaine it is, that this Image, or Crucifix
of our Sauiour, being made of wood, did manifeſtly

                  </gap>weate, as often as <hi>Xauerius</hi> had any great ſuffrance in
<hi>India,</hi> which they of the Caſtle found out, by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which he himſelfe had ſent from thence, by calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the times. But vpon the very yeare wherin
<hi>Xauerius</hi> departed this life, it ſweat bloud euery friday
after, for a whole yeare togeather, and made an end
of ſweating vpon a Friday alſo. Which many ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,

were certaine ſignes and teſtimonies, of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
vertues and guiftes, which the diuine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
had with a moſt liberall hand, heaped vp togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his ſoule. For he was not more glorious in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
then in heauenly Vertues, ſome wherof we
will ſet forth to publicke view; which, although he
vſed all art and diligence to conceale, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
diſcouer themſelues of their owne accord.
And theſe I ſhall recount more willingly then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
in reſpect, they are not bare tokens alone, but
liuely examples alſo of his rare ſanctity. And wheras
thoſe other ſerue only for admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe are brought
within the compaſſe of imitation.</p>
               <p>Wherfore to begin with that vertue which is the
ſource &amp; fountaine of the reſt, it is to be obſerued that
<hi>Xauerius</hi> was extraordinarily addicted vnto Prayer,
Meditation, and Contemplation of heauenly things.
For although he had his mind perpetually fixed vpon
God, and diuine matters; yet did he aſſigne vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
euery day, a ſet and determinate time, which,
by withdrawing himſelfe from al exteriour affayres,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:19094:269"/>
he imployed in meditating vpon celeſtiall things. But
the meditation wherin he chiefly exerciſed himſelfe,
was vpon the life and death of our Sauiour knowing
very well, that he might there behould, and imitate
moſt excellent and exemplar patternes of all kind, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely
repreſented in that noble maiſter-piece.</p>
               <p>This moſt wholſome, and fruitfull manner of
meditation (as being indeed the principall modell of
a Chriſtian life, and a ſingular incitement to diuine
Charity) he moſt diligently obſerued himſelfe, and
commended the ſame alſo vnto others, imploying all
his faculties heerein, with no leſſe conſtancy of mind,
then feruour of ſpirit. The which did neuer more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
it ſelfe, then whilſt he laboured amongſt the
ſick in the Hoſpitalls. For when his other continuall
labours would not affoard him any part of the day
free for that purpoſe, he hauing his mind more vpon
prayer then vpon ſleepe, did alwayes vſe to take ſome
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owers from his corporall reſt,<note place="margin">His night prayer.</note> that his ſoule might
not be defrauded of her heauenly food, and repaſt;
ſuch poſſeſſion had the ſweetnes of his diſcourſing
with the diuine Maieſty taken of his hart. He ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſlept but two, or at the moſt, three houres of the
night, and that in ſuch ſort alſo, as his very ſleepe
was not without prayer. For oftentimes in his ſleepe
he brake forth into theſe words: <hi>O good Ieſu, O my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>our,</hi>
&amp; other the like; ſo as one would haue thought
him to haue bin praying, and not ſleeping.</p>
               <p>It is moreouer certainly knowne, that he did not
ſo much as breake off this cuſtome of prayer, euen in
his greateſt imployments in the Promontory of <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinum;</hi>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:19094:270"/>
for he held his meditation to be the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
affayre which he had in hand. At <hi>Meliapora</hi>
alſo, when he lodged neere to <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his Church,
as we haue before declared, riſing in the night tyme,
he went often into the Church, &amp; could not eyther
by the ſpeeches of men, or ſtrypes and other moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Diuells be affrighted, or debarred from
diſcourſing with God; with whome be often ſpent
the whole night almoſt in prayer.</p>
               <p>Lykewiſe at <hi>Malaca,</hi> when he remayned there in
a chamber made of Mattes, certayne perſons moued
with the opinion of his ſanctity, did oftentymes by
ſtealth, as themſelues did afterwards reporte, looke
through the chinckes and ſlifters of the Mattes, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
what <hi>Francis</hi> was a doing in the night tyme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
they found him alwayes (though he had byn but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before, long kneeling at a Crucifix) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely
perſeuerant in prayer, both in ſpirit and body,
vntill ſleepe ſeizing vpon him, conſtrayned him by
force to yield a while vnto neceſſity of nature; &amp; then
laying himſelfe downe vpon the ground, and reſting
his head vpon a hard ſtone inſteed of a pillow, he in
that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner refreſhed his body for a while, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worne
out with continuall toyle and labour day and night;
ſo as one would haue thought him to haue vſed ſleepe
as a medicine; and whilſt he tooke his reſt, to loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe then reſt.</p>
               <p>But he, well knowing that God giueth more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
audience to thoſe who pray in places which
be more religiouſly honoured, whenſoeuer he could
find opportunity, he alwayes vſed to make his prayer
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:19094:270"/>
with much more feeling in the Church;<note place="margin">As often as oppor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunity ſerued he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he would commonly take vp his lodging next to
the Church, that he might go thither ſecretly in the
night, for that purpoſe. And thoſe of the Society at
<hi>Malaca</hi> obſerued, that like another <hi>Samuell</hi> he was
wont often to lye vpon the bare ground in the Veſtry
vntill the dead of the night, and then would ſteale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, and there fall to his prayers vpon his
his knees, before the high Aultar, in preſence of the
Bleſſed Sacrament: and when his knees were weary,
he would eyther lay himſelfe along vpon the ſteps of
the Aultar, or elſe leane vpon his hands, and ſtill go
on with his exerciſe, vntill eyther ſleepe conſtrayned
him to giue ouer, or elſe the light of the morning
came vpon him. And when he could not haue the
commodity of a Church, he notwithſtanding held on
this exerciſe of prayer, in ſome other place.</p>
               <p>A certayne Prieſt in whoſe houſe <hi>Xauerius</hi> lodged
related, that he vſed oftentymes to pray late in the
night, &amp; ſomtimes to ſit vpon a litle ſtoole (eyther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch a ſeate was more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious, or elſe becauſe
he could kneele no longer, being wholy tired out with
kneeling) and ſo go on with his deuotions. Moreouer
many Cittizens of <hi>Malaca</hi> of good account haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
teſtimony, that <hi>Francis</hi> when he was in familiar
conuerſation with them,<note place="margin">He goeth into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary places to pray.</note> would oftentimes withdraw
himſelf priuately from their company; &amp; after much
&amp; long inquiry made, they ſhould find him eyther in
ſome vncouth wood, or deſert and forlorne place,
deuoutly at his prayers, or elſe a diſciplining himſelfe
there; who not to interrupt his deuotions would le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:19094:271"/>
him thereunto, &amp; diſſemble the matter as though
they had perceiued nothing.</p>
               <p>And in this feruour of prayer, <hi>Xauerius</hi> was no leſſe
conſtant by ſea, then by land, wherof ſo many demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
in his often nauigations are extant, which
we haue already ſet downe, that to ſeeke out more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
therof, would not only be ſuperfluous, but a
troubleſome labour alſo. For though he were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in many &amp; differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t places, &amp; with ſundry perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
yet he remayned alwayes like himſelfe,<note place="margin">His pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er in the ſhip.</note> and kept as it
were, one faſhon and method throughout the whole
courſe of his life. Notwithſtanding we will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
that which properly belonged to the ſea. For
there be certaine and euident proofes, that whilſt he
was a ſhip-board, he did vſually ſit vp watching in
prayer from midnight, vntill breake of day; and in
the midſt of any tempeſt, or whatſoeuer danger, he
called on God with a moſt patient and quiet ſoule. In
ſo much that the marriners and paſſengers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
both themſelues, and their ſhip to haue bin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often ſaued by <hi>Francis</hi> his prayers.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he was alwayes feruent and inflamed
in his prayers,<note place="margin">His fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in prayer.</note> &amp; moſt commonly ouerflowing with
heauenly ioyes: the which was ſeene and knowne by
many, &amp; moſt euident arguments. For to ſay nothing
of thoſe extraordinary contents which he receiued
from God, amidſt his exceſſiue labours in <hi>Comorinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
and <hi>Maurica,</hi> wherof we haue already ſpoken in their
proper places; at <hi>Goa</hi> he was obſerued by the Fathers
there to walke oftentymes in the dead of the night
in the garden, with his eyes fixed vpon heauen, &amp; to
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:19094:271"/>
be wholy carryed away with contemplation, and loue
of God: ſo that one would haue thought for certayne
that his ſoule,<note place="margin">He pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

byn departed out of his body. And afterwards when
he came agayne to himſelfe, opening his Caſſocke
from his inflamed breaſt as his cuſtom was, he would
oftentymes repeate theſe words: <hi>It is inough O Lord,
it is inough,</hi> &amp; this in ſuch a tune, as manifeſtly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that ſo aboundant was the heauenly ioy which
ouerwhelmed him, that humane Nature was ſcarſe
able to beare it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Goa</hi> alſo, as he was conuerſing familiarly with
the other Fathers, there came vpon him oftentimes
ſuch exceſſiue ioy of ſpirit, that it conſtrayned him
to with-draw himſelfe from the ſight of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could by no meanes conceale the aboundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Conſolation which he felt.<note place="margin">The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour &amp; ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> And euen in humane
affayres, there appeared in him ſuch a diuine ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of heauenly Ioy, that they who conuerſed with
him, being often ſtroken with a reuerent reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, could not forbeare behoulding and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him, as if he had byn a ſecond Moyſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in his iourney to <hi>Meaco,</hi> wherein, as we
ſayd before, he ſuffered extreme miſeryes and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
being notwithſtanding as it were almoſt in
a continuall rapt through the exceſſiue comfort and
conſolation, which his ſoule receaued in meditating
vpon celeſtiall obiectes, and with that ſweet conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with God; he often ſtroke his legges, and feete
agaynſt ſtubbs and ſtones, yea hurt and bruiſed them
ſore, without euer feeling therof; going forward with
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:19094:272"/>
ſuch ioy &amp; iubily of hart, that he euen ſeemed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of the happineſſe of the Bleſſed in heauen, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to meditate vpon their lyfe. And verily it is
an admirable thing to conſider that there could be in
him,<note place="margin">A great combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation &amp; action togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> ſuch a combination of contemplation, &amp; action
togeather. For it is incredible (as we haue byn cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely
informed) that he, being a man perpetually
imployed in ſo weighty affayres, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and nauigations moſt hard and difficile, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo of ſo affable &amp; pleaſant a conuerſation; ſhould
notwithſtanding, be endowed with ſo extraordinary
a guift of diuine contemplation, and comforted ſo
aboundantly by the holy Ghoſt, and with continuall
ouerflowing of diuine ſtreames into his ſoule. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly
this diuine man, whereſoeuer he was, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
he did, kept alwayes his habitation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and with God. Wherupon it followed, that euen
from his very exteriour imployments, and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amidſt aboundance of people, he came alwayes
to mentall prayer &amp; meditation with his ſoule ſo freſh
and rectifyed, that preſently he could caſt, and as it
were, euen emboſome himſelfe into the moſt ſweet
conference with his heauenly Spouſe. In ſo much, as
one would haue thought him to haue alwaies bin kept
in a moſt ſtrayte ſolitude, he had his ſoule ſo firmely
fixed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, euen amidſt his greateſt imployments.</p>
               <p>No leſſe was the feeling of deuotion which he
found, nor the diligence which he vſed, in Vocall
Prayer, as they call it, and in reciting the Pſalmes,

that hauing a deteſtation to the leaſt ſtaynes which
might be in that kind, he could not without horrour
heare it once named, as we may eaſily coniecture by
that which now I am to recount.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he remained at <hi>Liſbone</hi> in Portugall, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

with <hi>Simon Rodriquez.</hi> Being once vpon a ſuddayne
in the dead of the night, as he lay in his bed, awaked
out of his ſleepe, he became ſo vnſually moued, that
there guſhed out a great deale of bloud from his noſe.
Wherof when <hi>Simon</hi> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times asked him afterwards
the cauſe,<note place="margin">His hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of impure thoghts</note> he kept it cloſe, and would by no meanes
ſpeake of it, as long as he was in Portugall. Yet at laſt,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was vpon his departure, &amp; ready to take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for <hi>India,</hi> he tooke <hi>Rodriquez</hi> aſide into a priuate

time to declare vnto you that which you haue ſo often
in vayne demaunded of me: for this (as I ſuppoſe)
is the laſt tyme, that I ſhall euer ſee you in this lyfe.
You ſhall therefore know, that there was that night
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:19094:275"/>
am impure thought preſented to me in a dreame, the
which, I endeauouring all I could to reiect, cauſed

               <p>And theſe ſignes, and humane teſtimonies were
no leſſe confirmed by the integrity of his Body, after
his death, then by the ſentence, and approbation of

as granted to his extraordinary Virginall Chaſtity.
And he,<note place="margin">His vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in matter of chaſti.</note> to preſerue this ſo ſingular and heauenly a

Moreouer in the greateſt reproaches, ſufferances,

for thoſe who cauſed him the ſame, and that he would
vouchſafe, rather to receyue them to mercy,<note place="margin">He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> then to

dayly for that outragious Man, praying to God, that
though he had begun to fall, he might not yet be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

               <p>The loue of voluntary Pouerty alſo, which ſhined
in him,<note place="margin">His loue to Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall pouerty.</note> was not inferiour to the moderation of his

the pouerty of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>who when he was rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
poore for vs,</hi> he bare ſo ſpeciall an affection vnto
Euangelicall Pouerty, that he dayly found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
the Riches of Pouerty to be ſuch, that they
not only diſcharged and freed the mind from all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
care, but enriched it alſo moſt aboundantly
with celeſtiall treaſures, and cauſed him who had
nothing, not to be in want of any thing. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he alwayes for the moſt part, liued by begging,
euen in the Colledge at <hi>Goa</hi> it ſelfe, where all things
were at hand without ſeeking for: neither alſo, when
he trauailed as well by land, as by ſea, had he any care
at all of any Viaticum, or prouiſion of victuals.</p>
               <p>Of this his extraordinary Pouerty his whole life
affoardeth vs notable examples. For to ſay nothing
of ſuch as be of leſſe note, let vs call to memory his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture

out of Portugal towards <hi>India,</hi> how he would
carry nothing with him but a ſorry mantle, to vſe in
the Promontory of <hi>Good Hope</hi> (a place much peſtred
with the extreme vnſeaſonable colds of the Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Pole) and a few bookes for his neceſſary vſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Kings Officers by expreſſe order from his
Maieſty vrged him earneſtly to the contrary. And
in the ſhip it ſelfe he could not by any intreaty, either
of principall perſons therein, or of the Viceroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
be drawne from begging his victuals, and other
neceſſaries. For he chooſe rather for Chriſt his ſake,
to aske of the Souldiars in the Nauy, not only victuals,
but ſhooes alſo, ſhirts, and other things neceſſary, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

pouerty. His iorney alſo into <hi>Comorinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> was not much

only a payre of bootes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, his apparell and habit was of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

eſteeme as one of the greateſt fauours of the diuine

commodities doth moſt commonly inuite the people
to ſatiate, and fill their vnbridled ſenſual appetits. And
ſo their ſoules being not acquainted with Euangelical
pouerty, are extremely oppreſſed through the want
of heauenly graces and delights. And many times alſo

               <q>
                  <p>In this buſines, my friends bring two da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers againſt

his money, may breake his promiſe, and eyther
leaue me in ſome deſert Iland, or elſe caſt me headlong
into the ſea, that ſo his bargayne of paſſing me ouer

may make me (being a ſtranger) an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of comming into <hi>China</hi> agaynſt the Kings Edict
without publicke warrant, &amp; eyther put me to death
by torments, or elſe caſt me into perpetuall priſon.
Againſt theſe dangers, I obiect others farre greater,
which themſelues do not perceyue. And the firſt is,
leaſt we diſtruſt the diuine Goodnes and Prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
For we come hither for Gods only Cauſe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
to theſe Countryes his ſacred Law, and his ſonne
Chriſt Ieſus the Redeemer of mankind, whereof God
himſelfe, who gaue me this mind, is my witneſſe.
So as now to caſt off our hope, and confidence in
his Diuine Prouidence and power, for the dangers
we are ſaid to be ſubiect vnto in labouring for his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
ought certaynly to be eſteemed a far greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then whatſoeuer the enemyes of God, and Men,
are euerable to bring vpon me. Eſpecially ſeeing,
that neither the Diuels themſelues, nor their miniſters
can hurt vs at all, but only by the permiſſion and will
of God.</p>
                  <p>What can we ſay to this? That if God do appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
and further our endeauours, we ſhall by his fauour
not only be deliuered from dangers, but alſo follow
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:19094:286"/>
the admonition of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">His vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage agaynſt danger.</note> who ſayeth:

Wherefore for as much as we hould theſe dangers of
the ſoule farre greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe of the body, we eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
it far better, and more ſecure, to breake through
thoſe of this lyfe, rather then to hazard the ſaluation
of our ſoule. I am fully reſolued, God willing, to
go into <hi>China,</hi> in deſpite of all his enemies. For, <hi>if
God be with vs, who ſhalbe against vs?</hi> We do, without all
doubt, go vpon great danger, although there were
nothing elſe but perpetuall ſeruitude: But this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
comforteth me, that it is much better, to
ſerue in captiuity for Gods cauſe, then to enioy liberty
by running away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In which words
he doth indeed ſufficiently ſhew an vndaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
againſt all dangers. And how much <hi>Xauerius</hi>
contemned all the miſeries of this world, appeared
alſo by another letter of his to <hi>Iames Perera,</hi> whereof
we haue inſerted a clauſe in its proper place.</p>
               <p>This greatnes of <hi>Xauerius</hi> mynd was not leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the inſolency of Chriſtians, then againſt the
threates and terrours of the Barbarians. The Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the coaſt of <hi>Comorinum</hi> being a Portugheſe, &amp;
potent, through his couetouſneſſe, had held the Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phytes
in cruell ſubiection. Which when <hi>Francis</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
he threatned, that vnleſſe he carryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
moſt mildly towards the Chriſtians there, he
would by letters complaine vnto the King of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
of his inſolencies and Tyranny. Likewiſe he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his companion to declare to a certayne Portugheſe
Captaine, who treated the new Chriſtians iniuriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:19094:286"/>
that vnleſſe he ceaſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cruelty, he would be
far more ſauage then <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew only
the bodies of the Innocents, but he alſo ſlew their ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
and this would certainly be the effect therof, that
if through his inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies the Fathers ſhould leaue that
Coaſt, the little infants would dye without Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>The Gouernour alſo of <hi>Malaca,</hi> who, as we ſayd
before, moſt iniuriouſly, and obſtinately hindred
his iorney into <hi>China,</hi> was by <hi>Xauerius,</hi> who turned at
laſt his patience into ſeuerity, excommunicated, and
the ſentence publiſhed formally in the Churches; to
the end others, through feare to incurre the like igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny,

               <p>But nothing more declared the incredible greatnes
of his mind, then a certaine infinite deſire (as we
may call it) which he had to preach the Ghoſpell
throughout the whole world. For not contenting
himſelfe with the vaſt Countryes of <hi>India,</hi> he exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his deſires, and endeauours to <hi>Malaca,</hi> the <hi>Ilands</hi>
of the <hi>Moluca's, Maurica, Iaponia, China,</hi> and in fine

no doubt, if he had liued vntill he had diſpatched his

betweene thoſe that were at variance &amp; debate among

for the zeale &amp; deſire he had to help his neyghbours, &amp;

was his only deſire; in this he tooke his greateſt ioy,

That when himſelfe firſt of al trauailed ouer the Iland
of <hi>Iapon,</hi> he came by chance to a caſtle there ſcituate in
a corner of the Iland, where he met with three of the
habitants of that country, who asked him what was
become of <hi>Francis Xauerius?</hi> At which ſuddaine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
he at the firſt ſtood a little aſtoniſhed, then paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a while vpon the matter, he found that <hi>Xauerius</hi>
had ſometimes bin there amongſt them, and had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
many of the inhabitants to the faith of Chriſt;
had alſo built them a Church, and ſo diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the Neophytes, that Chriſtian diſcipline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſtil amongſt them, without any other Maiſter.
For <hi>Xauerius</hi> being to depart from <hi>Iaponia,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for them for time to come, &amp; giuen them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their owne language the life of Chriſt, and a
briefe Summe of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, as alſo the
Roman Kalendar, with a table of the moueable feaſts,
a forme alſo for the inuocation of the Saints, which
we call the Litanies, the Seauen Pſalmes, togeather
with the forme and manner of Baptiſme, aduiſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to aſſemble themſelues all togeather vpon holy Dayes
and there to read ſomething of the life of Chriſt, and
out of the holy Scripture; to obſerue the Feſtiuall
dayes, to inuocate the interceſſion of the Saints, and
to recite the ſeauen Pſalmes. Moreouer he ordayned
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:19094:289"/>
that the clarke of their chiefe Guide ſhould baptize the
little infantes, vnleſſe ſome neceſſity otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded.
And the Neophytes hauing kept theſe precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
which <hi>Francis</hi> had giuen them in memory, were ſo
throughly inſtructed in matters of Chriſtian Religion
that they came not farre ſhort of thoſe of Europe,
Wherupon <hi>Froes</hi> concluded, that he had no more to
ſay, but that by <hi>Xauerius</hi> example, Religion ought ſo
to be ſowen, and planted euery where, that it might
be able to vphold it ſelfe by its owne proper forces.</p>
               <p>And although <hi>Xauerius,</hi> as much as in him lay,
ceaſed not at any tyme, to aduance his Neophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
by thoſe of the Society: yet his Charity was not
ſo imployed in helping of whole Cittyes &amp; Nations,
as that he neglected particular perſons, how peruerſe
and obſtinate ſoeuer they were. At his departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Iland of <hi>Ternate,</hi> of an exceeding great number
of Chriſtians that inhabited therin, he left only two,
whome he could not draw to forſake their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubins.
Wherfore when he came backe to <hi>Amboynum</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
ſucceeding in place of indignation) he wrote
vnto a certaine <hi>Ternatian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His zeale of ſoules</note> a friend of his, intreating
him to ſalute thoſe two perſons in his name, in the
moſt friendly manner he could deuiſe, and ſignify
vnto them, that if they would at laſt reſolue to ariſe
out of the ſincke of ſinne, he would preſently make all
haſt thither, &amp; in the meane time he would not ceaſe
to pray to God our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Father for their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Malaca</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth a Iew.</note> as he preached vnto the people,
there was oftentimes preſent at his ſermons a certaine
Iew, a man of ſufficient learning, but (as the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:19094:289"/>
of that nation is) moſt obſtinate; and who ſcoffed
no leſſe at <hi>Xauerius,</hi> then at the truth it ſelfe. He being
intangled both in vices and errours, ſtifly oppoſed the
Ghoſpell, and his authority kept back many other Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
from the faith of Chriſt. <hi>Francis</hi> therfore treating
this man ſweetly by all kind of obſequiouſneſſe, and
vſing to ſuppe with him in a friendly manner, ſo
wrought with him at laſt, that being quite altered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
what he was, became of an obſtinate Iew, a vertuous
and deuout Chriſtian. And this Charity of his to his
Neyghbours, was not more forcible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> induſtrious.</p>
               <p>There ſtandeth betweene <hi>Goa</hi> and <hi>Cocinum</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe

much frequented by reaſon of a good hauen in that
place. <hi>Xauerius</hi> comming thither endeauoured by the
way to draw a certaine perſon to make his Confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but in vayne; wherupon he deſiſted for a while fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
intreaty, that when the other thought himſelf ſecure,
he might at vnawares more forcibly ſet vpon him. For
being preſſed hard therto, as one moſt obſtinatly bent
he had paſſionatly ſworne neuer to yield therein to
<hi>Francis.</hi> Therfore as ſoone as they came to land <hi>Xaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
reſolued to try all the remedies he could deuiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſo deſperate a diſeaſe, &amp; ſo faygning as though
his mind were ſet on other matters, got this obſtinate
man into a wood, in a courteous manner vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of recreation, beſet (according to the Nature of
that Country) with many Palme-trees. As ſoone as
they came into a priuy place where none could ſee
them, <hi>Xauerius</hi> ſuddainely caſting of his clothes, and
baring his backe, falleth downe vpon his knees,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:19094:290"/>
&amp; preſently (the other ſtanding amazed, &amp; expecting
to ſee the iſſue of ſo ſuddaine an alteration) pulleth
out a very ſharpe diſcipline full of iron pricks, and
beating his owne backe extremely, before the others
face, cryeth out, that he willingly ſuffred that torment
for his ſake thereby to turne away Gods indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from him. In the meane time the Wood runge againe
with the mighty ſtripes of the diſcipline, and he that
ſtood looking on, in that amazement, like one out of
himſelfe, was all beſprinkled with <hi>Xauerius</hi> his bloud.
Wherfore turning his admiration, into compaſſion
of hart, he inſtantly caſteth himſelfe at <hi>Xauerius</hi> feete,
and beſeecheth him, to leaue off reuenging anothers
fault vpon his owne backe, for now he was ready to
purge himſelfe of his ſinnes by Confeſſion. <hi>Xauerius</hi>
being glad he had thus wonne the victory, preſently
apparelleth himſelfe, &amp; hearing his Confeſſion, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that wretched man, backe againe into the right
way, and hope of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>But now his Prudence &amp; induſtry was farre more
ſeene in curing the diſeaſes of the Citty of <hi>Malaca,</hi>
which was almoſt brought therby vnto a deſperate
ſtate. For when he perceiued the <hi>Malacenſians</hi> minds
to be ſo inueterate, and drowned in the corruption
of all wickedneſſe, that they would by no meanes
heare of remedy, he, being an exquiſite Phyſitian of
ſoules, found out a new &amp; ſoueraigne antidote wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to cure them. Wherfore ſetting vpon them in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and couert manner, he vſed to inſinuate himſelfe
into the company of the ſouldiars when they were at
their wanton ſportes, comming oftentimes vpon
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:19094:290"/>
them as they were at play, ſeeming as though he tooke
delight in their game and conuerſation;<note place="margin">He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all to gayne all to Chriſt.</note> and if any
one vpon his preſence, or otherwiſe through ſhame-faſtneſſe,
abſteyned from playing, he in a ſweet,
and friendly manner would exhort him to be merry
for he alſo loued the like paſtime; and that ſouldiars
ought not to liue like Monkes: and if it were vſed
without offence to God, it was better to play, and be
merry, then to ſpeake ill of other men, or to commit
any other wickedneſſe. Then hauing wonne their
affections by this his gentle behauiour, he would by
all manner of obſequiouſneſſe inſinuate himſelfe into
the greateſt familiarity with them that was poſſible,
that ſo he might find out their ſecret inclinations, &amp;
thereby take ſome occaſion to apply fit remedies to
their diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Now, for others who were intangled with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
loue and kept Concubines, he would oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
himſelfe appoint certayne daies to dine or ſuppe
with them, where ſitting at table, and by bringing in
ſome familiar diſcourſe, as commending of the diſhes
of meate which were ſerued in, and inquiring of the
mayd-ſeruant, that had ſo well ſeaſoned the ſame,
requeſting his Hoſt oftentymes to ſend for her, &amp; then
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend her for her diligence &amp; skill in Cookery, &amp;
the like; he opened to himſelf away for his future deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes.
If he found one that would not willingly admit
him to his table, he at vnawars would earneſtly intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
him, that he might ſee his houſe, &amp; being brought
in, did often wyn the mans affection by his ſweet,
conuerſation, &amp; then concealing his determination he
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:19094:291"/>
left no corner of the houſe which he did nor ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as if he had hunted after ſome wild game: where if
by chance he light vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hoſts Concubine, he inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what that woman was, &amp; to whome ſhe belonged;
making as though he liked all well that he ſaw, yet ſtill
watching for an occaſion wherin to effect his buſines.
Finally, he became in ſuch ſort euen all to all, that
among ſouldiars he ſeemed a ſouldiar, &amp; among mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
a merchant. Wherefore not only the Portughe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but alſo their Concubines themſelues by reaſon of
his ſingular affability, deſired greatly to haue him
come to their houſes and table, neuer ſo much as once
dreaming of what he aymed at.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Xuerius</hi> as ſoone as he had gotten himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with them, he would begin couertly to apply
his cure to their feſtred ſoules. If he met with any that
had a beautifull and handſome mayd with whome
he was in loue, he would commend her vnto him, &amp;
tell him that indeed for her extraordinary beauty, &amp;
good diſpoſition ſhe deſerued to be an honeſt woman,
and was worthy to be marryed to ſome man of good
account. Then would he aske his Hoſt that if he loued
her, why did he, to both their diſhonours, and vtter
ouerthrow, rather keepe her as his Concubine, then
honeſtly and religiouſly to take her to his wife? Thus
turning the cauſe of the diſeaſe to the cure therof, he
tooke away ſinne, &amp; brought honourable wedlocke
into place therof. But if the woman were deformed,
he would demand whether he were wel in his wits or
no, who could ſet his affections vpon ſo ill fauoured a
Creature, &amp; for whome all the Portugheſes talked of
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:19094:291"/>
him, and laughed him to ſcorne? Or why did he not
rather ſeeke a wife fit for him? For that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a great honour to him, as it had bin to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whome he would then name.</p>
               <p>But now, with others that could not ſo freely
marry, by reaſon that they were inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled with many
Concubines at once, he tooke another courſe. Firſt
he would aske them, why they kept in their houſe ſo
many maydes, who ſerued almoſt for no other vſe
but to ouerthrow their ſoule, and conſume their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
beſides the often diſquiet of the houſe by their
chiding and brawling. And if they either could not,
or would not put them all away, he aduiſed them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to rid themſelues of ſome one of them. Then
comming againe vnto them after ſome dayes ſpace, he
in a friendly manner would importune them, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
the ſecond, &amp; ſo one after another al but one, for
they ſhould be both leſſe hatefull to God, &amp; the ſooner
obtaine pardon, if they kept but one woman, then if
they kept many. At laſt, vpon ſome new occaſion,
he would vrge them againe either to put that one
away, or elſe to marry her, whome they ſtill kept
vnlawfully, that ſo at length they might appeaſe the
diuine wrath incenſed againſt them. And thus by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little he reclaimed thoſe loſt ſoules (by taking
away from them all enticements to ſinne) to a ciuill
and vertuous life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> had perpetually this property &amp; cuſtome
to ſeeke moſt of al to be familiar with thoſe who were
moſt wicked, thinking that where the ſicknes was
moſt grieuous, there was greateſt need of a Phyſitian,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:19094:292"/>
and antidote: neither would he euer giue them ouer
vntill he had reſtored them to their ſoules health. This
alſo was another chiefe care of his, that all men by his
owne and the Societyes examples, might be inflamed
to vertue and deuotion, and none offended by them.
Neither did he vſe to inculcate any thing more often
and ſeriouſly to thoſe of the Society who were ſent in
miſſion to any place,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> then, <hi>That they should prouide for
good things before God, and men.</hi> And beſides this he
oftentymes alſo put them in mynd by letters, of thoſe
precepts which he had giuen them at their departure.</p>
               <p>But if any one had at any time giuen offence, he
was ſo afflicted in mind therfore,<note place="margin">How gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>atly he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> that he might well

before all the riches and wealth of the world; ſeeing
God did commonly beſtow better, and more durable
riches vpon pious men, who made not ſo much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their owne commodities; as of the common
eſtimation of their Religion; then vpon thoſe, who
enioyed their owne rights and commodities, with the
loſſe and dommage of their good Name. Wherefore
in his letters which he wrote to thoſe of the Society,
he was alwaies wont to adde, that he had rather haue
a litle fruite without offence, then a great deale with
the offence of any. For that a little ſeed of ſoules ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

continue without weeds; whereas neuer ſo great a
Crop, once ouer-growne with diſpleaſures, as with
weeds, conſumeth and waſteth away to nothing. And
all this he obſerued in himſelfe with far more care &amp;

in him, as neyther of them detracting from the others

aſpect, they might by the remembrance of his
extraordinary alacrity, and admirable feruour, be the
more enflamed towards the purſuite of a bleſſed life.
For ſo often as they could get but an eſſay of this his
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:19094:293"/>
alacrity, or euen but a breathing only of ſo couragious
an hart, they neuer came away ſad or heauy from him.
Againe, the ſingular ſweetneſſe of his countenance
and ſpeach, drew vnto him as wel the bad as the good,
great and little, and got ſuch firme hold ouer the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of their harts, that he was able to drawe them
which way he pleaſed: ſo as he neuer demaunded any
thing of any one, how great, or hard ſoeuer, which
he did not at laſt obteyne.</p>
               <p>His ordinary diſcourſe alſo, he was wont to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with great dexterity, and to intermingle with
wonderfull variety, that it might not cauſe any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe
in the hearer. He was very skilfull both in
Aſtrology and Philoſophy, &amp; therfore alwayes when
he trauailed by the way, to relieue the weariſomneſſe
of the iorney, he would oftentimes bring in diſcourſe
of the motions of the celeſtiall Globes, &amp; the Planets.
Alſo the Eclipſe of the Sunne and Moone, he would
foretell long before it hapned. Againe, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the cauſes of thoſe things which we behould
to be admirable, both in the heauens, and the world;
what the cauſe, or origen of Hayle, Froſt, Snow, and
Rayne was; whence clowdes, myſtes, winds, and
thunder proceeded; what that was which cauſed the
ſwelling, and raging of the ſeas. Many other things
alſo, he would adde of the ſame kind; which as they
were very admirable, ſo were they delightfull to the
hearers; and in the end of all, he would referre them
to the honour, and feare of God.</p>
               <p>Of theſe things therfore, he diſcourſed ſo learnedly
and pleaſantly amongſt the <hi>Iaponians,</hi> who are wholy
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:19094:294"/>
ignorant of ſuch matters, that they were wont vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſay, that in <hi>Xauerius</hi> company one might trauaile
all <hi>Iaponia</hi> ouer without being once a weary; and this
delight of his diſcourſe carryed his companinons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
in ſuch ſort, that he ordinarily wonne them both
to himſelfe, and to God. Yea this ſweetnes of his
Conuerſation was tempered with ſo weighty a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
that in the height of his moſt pleaſant diſcourſes
what he ſayd, or did, breathed forth a moſt ſweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of ſanctity. Wherof al men had now gotten ſuch
an opinion, that although he conuerſed often, &amp; very
familiarly, euen with the moſt vitious, yet the ſame
was neuer any ſtaine to his reputation; ſince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

euill tongues, but alſo from the leaſt ſuſpicion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

               <p>Moreouer, <hi>Xauerius</hi> had this property, that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
did not any whit diminiſh, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
a moſt reuerend &amp; religious reſpect of all ſorts
of people towards him: in ſo much as one would haue

                  <hi>Conſaluus Fernandez</hi> a Maiſter of a ſhipp, and a man of

<hi>Xauerius,</hi> in that he oftentymes went in his ſhip, and

and reſpect vnto him, that whenſoeuer he came
vnto his houſe, he with his whole family, would go
out to meete him, and caſting themſelues proſtrate on
the ground, did alwayes receiue him in that manner.
And although <hi>Conſaluus</hi> were oftentimes intreated

by <hi>Francis,</hi> not to vſe that reſpect vnto him, yet he

                  <hi>Iames Perera</hi> alſo, who was ſo great and familiar

that whenſoeuer he ſpake vnto him, he vſed
to be taken with ſuch reuerend and religious a reſpect
towards him, that he ſeemed to behould God in his
perſon. Yet as occaſion required, <hi>Francis</hi> wanted
not Seuerity alſo, the ſting of Grauity, which we ſhall
heere recount by an example, or two. A certayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
Matron of good eſteeme, was wont alwayes to
to confeſſe to <hi>Francis</hi> when he was at hand. This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(as herſelfe afterward recounted to a Religious
man) <hi>Xauerius</hi> ſharply reprehended, becauſe ſhe had
vpon occaſion caſt her eye vpon an handſome, proper
man, and well attyred: Haſt thou, quoth he, looked
vpon a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thou deſerueſt that God ſhould not looke

heart, that ſhe could neuer after throghout her whole
life, endure to looke any man in the face.</p>
               <p>He was alſo, aboue all other things, a moſt ſeuere
reuenger of obſtinacy. In the Promontory of <hi>Comori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
vnderſtanding that a certaine Neophyte had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

of ſuch an abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he preſently cauſed
the houſe to bet on fire, to the end the ſeuerity of the
puniſhment might make others afrayd to commit the
like offence. And when as, many perſons of worth

requeſted him to mitigate the penalty, he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that the dwellers might carry out their houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

You ſhall therfore inſtruct the Portugheſe
children, and bondſlaues, and other ignorant perſons
in the Chriſtian precepts; and this charge you ſhall
not commit to any other, ſince it is a thing of ſo great
importance, for the ſaluation of ſoules, and gaining
of good will. You ſhall diligently viſit the poore, and
ſicke in the hoſpitall, and by telling them that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

food, it will be conuenient to commend them
to the Prefect of the Hoſpitall, and to help them with
ſuch things, as they ſhall want.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe fit, that you goe oftentimes vnto the
Priſons, to viſit the priſoners, and to exhort them
to make a generall Confeſſion of their life. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe kind of men you ſhall find many that
neuer made a true Confeſſion. You ſhall commend all
to the Sodality of <hi>Mercy,</hi> that no iniury may be done

to any one; &amp; for ſuch as be in extreme neceſſity, you
ſhall alſo begge meanes to aſſiſt them, therby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
them in their miſery. You ſhall likewiſe prouide
for the Sodality of <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſo farre as you ſhall be able.
Wherfore when any money is to be reſtored, and is
vncertaine to whome, I thinke abſolutely that you
had beſt giue it to the ſaid Sodality of <hi>Mercy.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

whoſe neceſſities thoſe helps may well be imployed;
notwithſtanding the deceipt and cunning of beggars
vſeth oftentimes to cauſe ſome note of infamy in this
buſineſſe; by whoſe impoſtures others may ſooner be
deceiued, then thoſe of the Sodality of <hi>Mercy,</hi> who by

of ſuch coſenage. Wherfore it is beſt to leaue that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
wholy to them of the Sodality, who may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
the Almes, according to the quantity thereof,
amongſt ſuch as are knowen to be truly in want.</p>
                  <p>This you ought to do, for many and weighty
reaſons. Firſt, becauſe if you diſtribute the money to
the poore your ſelfe, many will certainly aske of you
ſome reliefe, eſpecially for their bodies, which they
would aſſuredly neuer do, if they ſaw that you vſed
only to help the neceſſities of the ſoule. Secondly to
auoid the ſuſpitions, &amp; rumours of thoſe that ſhould
giue you ſuch money to be diſtributed amongſt the
poore. For (as men are apt to belieue the worſt) it is
to be feared, leaſt that exacting of money may carry
with it ſome ſuſpition of auarice; as though you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to turne the money, begd vnder colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing
the poore, to your owne vſe &amp; benefit. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:19094:298"/>
it is better to giue ouer that charge to others, of
whome there can be no ſuſpition. Yet if at any time
occaſion moueth you to the contrary, you may do as
may be moſt for the glory of God, and the good of
ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Yow ſhall alſo ſo carry your ſelfe before thoſe with
whome you conuerſe,<note place="margin">With friends we muſt liue as if they were to be our enemies.</note> although they be you friends,

the iniury rather to want of conſideration, then to
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:19094:301"/>
any malice, or ill will which the other had; or to tell

themſelues very carefully in all kind of vertues; and

You muſt therfore earneſtly beſeech of God, that

you impart his guifts to the people; wherby you do,
without doubt, deſerue that he ſhould not giue you
that authority, and eſteeme, which is neceſſary for
ſuch a buſineſſe. This certainly muſt be taken heed
of, with the greateſt diligence that can be poſſible.
Wherfore in your examen of conſcience, you ſhall
with a very inward care,<note place="margin">In exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of our con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience we muſt looke into our offices &amp; charges.</note> take an eſpeciall account of

the neerer you approach vnto celeſtiall guifts.</p>

kind of perſons attend rather to their owne, then to
Gods glory, &amp; are more ſollicitous about their owne
commodities, then of the ſaluation of ſoules. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their courſe is very vnſtable, &amp; ſubiect to ruine,
which being puffed vp with a blind deſire of glory,
ſetteth it ſelf forth with oſtentation to the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

vertue (being as it were nouriſhed with good feeding)
will ariſe to a greater grouth. For it is wonderfull to

of mind, the moſt certaine and greateſt plague,
and poiſon which can befall the Society. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe
he willed them to turne their conſideration
to the knowledge of their owne weakeneſſe, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to ponder oftentymes the difference between
the iudgments of mens and the iudgment of God, and
there indeed to lay the foundation of their Humility.
For he that attentiuely conſidereth, what a different
iudgement God, <hi>Who is the ſearcher of harts,</hi> frameth
of men, from that which men themſelues do, who
behould only exteriour actions; will vndoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
himſelfe to the loweſt ranke that may be in
Gods ſight, &amp; repute all humane prayſes (as ayming
far amiſſe from the truth) for nothing els but croſſes,<note place="margin">Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God.</note>
and ſcornes of men. Yet we muſt not for all this,
through conſideration of our owne weakeneſſe, looſe
courage in the war-fare and ſeruice of Chriſt: but we
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:19094:311"/>
are rather to endeauour, as well by diſtruſting our
owne forces, as by repoſing our confidence in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
aſſiſtance, to take hart in all thinges, ſince we
muſt imploy our ſelues in great matters for his ſake,
who alwaies is ready to put therto his helping hand.</p>
               <p>The way alſo to arriue to the perfection of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which he ſhewed them, was this. That euery one
ſhould in the firſt place haue a care of himſelfe, and
twice euery day (if it could be) or at leaſt once, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
his owne conſcience: vſing the greateſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
he could by all meanes to amend thoſe defects
which he perceyued in himſelfe; and that he ſhould
moreouer make the greateſt eſteeme that might be of
his daily meditation, and neuer ſuffer any day to paſſe
ouer, without affoarding his ſoule ſome ſuch kind of
repaſt. And this meditation he would haue to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
made with ſerious ponderation vpon the lyfe,
paſſion &amp; death of Chriſt our Sauiour, as being a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biect
of perfect vertue, and peculiarly proper to the
Society of IESVS. He counſayled them lykewiſe
after meditation ended, agaynſt the incurſions and
aſſaults of the diuell, euery day to renew their vowes,
&amp; to declare al the temptations of the enemy of what
ſort ſoeuer, together with their bad inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as wel
as their deſires of vertue, to their Ghoſtly Fathers, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
and other ſpirituall Directours, who were
able both to counſayle and aſſiſt them. For ſuch is
the force of this humble ſubmiſſion, that it doth not
only obteyne more light and help from God in the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of combat, but fruſtrateth alſo the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
Aduerſary, who perceyuing his plot to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:19094:311"/>
his aſſaults defeated, and his deſignes broken
off, becometh aſſuredly more remiſſe in his batteries,
and at laſt flyeth away with loſſe of the victory, ouer
whome he had before triumphed.</p>
               <p>He alſo required blind, and ſimple Obedience in
thoſe of the Society, that leauing their owne iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and opinion, they ſhould in all things (excepting
ſuch as were contrary to the diuine Law) obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any reply, or demurring vpon the matter. That
they ſhould not demaund of their Superiours ſuch
things as they deſired after an odious, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
manner, or by any inuention wreſt their comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to their owne wils; but that euery one ſhould freely
direct his iudgment and opinion to that of his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and leaue himſelf wholy therin to the iudgment
of thoſe that repreſent the perſon of God; houlding
this for certaine, that in all things which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
God will ſo inſpire them, as may be moſt for
his diuine honour, and their profit. For, quoth he,
they that ſhould do otherwiſe, would oftentimes fall
into great troubles, vexations, and miſeries. Which
inconueniences, thoſe who are perniciouſly blinded
with errour might thinke proceeded from the Croſſe
of our Lord, or from the Obedience; when as indeed
they were the fruites which ſprung from their owne
peruerſe iudgement, and ſelfe will. Wherefore they
ſhould alwaies make choyce rather to obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
eſpecially ſeeing that it is alwayes ſecure to be
ruled by another, but often daungerous to gouerne
ones ſelfe. For although one may ſometymes rule
himſelfe well, yet there be very few, as being decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:19094:312"/>
with a certayne blind loue of themſelues, who do
not moſt commonly the contrary.</p>
               <p>He further more commanded them, that if at any
time they were imployed in humble &amp; abiect offices,
they ſhould carefully,<note place="margin">Humble offices are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</note> and ſeriouſly performe them,
and draw out of them the greateſt profit of humility
which the could, fully perſuading themſelues, that
they could not at that tyme do any thing more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull,
and acceptable to God, in whoſe name they
were commanded: remembring alſo themſelues, that
ſmaller exerciſes were entrances alwayes vnto grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
&amp; that he who was not quicke in the loweſt, vſed
not to be excellent in the higheſt: whereas contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he that went with alacrity about little thinges,
would eaſily find courage in matters of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
For as our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth;<note place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

faythfull in the leaſt, is ſo alſo in the greatest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer he prudently admoniſhed them, not
to forſake, or neglect the place or ſtation which was
aſſigned them by their Superior, although they might
be in hope to do more good ſomewhere elſe. For it
was infallibly a deceipt of the infernall enemy to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
vayne flouriſhes of the future and vncertayne
fruit that might be reaped in other places, thereby to
draw vs from the preſent, &amp; aſſured good which we
do in the place aſſigned vs; that ſo, whileſt we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
with wauering cares, he may make a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſtocke of vs, and ſend vs away without any fruit
at all: Seeing, that as long as you remayne in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
what to reſolue vpon, you are not well able
eyther to labour in another place where you are not,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:19094:312"/>
or in that where you are, becauſe you mynd is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
elſe. For confirmation of this wholeſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he vſeth that common ſentence of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Gal. 10.</note>
                  <hi>While we haue tyme, let vs do good.</hi> Wherefore he wiſhed
ſuch to be confident, that if what they deſired was
pleaſing to God, he would vndoubtedly moue their
Superiour to ſend them thither where it ſhould be moſt
for his diuine honour.</p>
               <p>He was alſo wont to ſay, that they were indeed
grieuouſly miſtaken, who deſired to be honoured for
the vertue, and notable deeds of their predeceſſours,
from whome they themſelues were become degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
imitating therein thoſe, who adorning themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
with other folkes apparell, ſought to be honoured
and eſteemed for great perſons. It were indeed better
for them by following their anceſtours foote-ſteps, to
emulate their vertue and worth, then degenerating
from them, to boaſt of others goods, as if they were
their owne.</p>
               <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">We muſt not go to help o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our tyme.</note> this aduiſe of his was not more prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
then profitable. He charged thoſe that were ſtill in
trayning vp at home in regular diſcipline, that they
ſhould not be ouer deſirous to go into the field to
fight before their tyme, nor truſt too much vpon their
owne forces, although they ſhould ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect
to no great fault: For certayne it is, that young
beginners are many tymes guarded, not ſo much by
their owne vertue, as by the place where they liue,
which eaſily defendeth them from the aſſaults of their
enemies, and allurements to ſinne. Wherefore in the
time of their Nouice-ſhip they ſhould carefully arme
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:19094:313"/>
themſelues with ſolid vertue, that afterwards they
might liue ſafely in the midſt of their enemies darts.</p>

which being modeſtly, religiouſly, and prudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
would certainly preuaile not a little towards
the curing of mens ſoules. This therfore ſhould be
their ayme, by laying before their Auditours, the
fouleneſſe of ſinne, and the greatneſſe of the offence
againſt the diuine Maieſty, togeather with the wrath
which from heauen is threatned againſt ſuch enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

               <q>
                  <p>The chiefeſt office of a Preacher, ſayth he, is to
cauſe in his auditour great feeling of his ſinnes, and
to terrify him from future crimes and enormities,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:19094:313"/>
by laying before him the infallible, and neuer ending
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the damned. To diſcouer alſo the deceiptes
and treacheries of Sathan; and in fine to treate of ſuch
things, as may be rather vnderſtood, then admired, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by the vulgar ſort. Wherfore in his Sermons he
was not to cite too many teſtimonies out of holy
ſcripture, nor to handle ſuch things as were doubtful,
&amp; in controuerſy among Doctours;<note place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture ought not to be too much v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> but ſuch as were
certayne, plaine, and fit to draw men to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their liues, and good deportement in their
behauiour. He ſhould therfore much inſiſt vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
of vices, making grieuous complaints for
the iniuries which are done to our Sauiour Chriſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
threatning reuenge from heauen, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
torments, which are prepared in hell for lewd,
and wicked perſons, togeather with the imminent
terrours of death, which often times ſeizeth vpon me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
when they leaſt expect it.</p>
                  <p>Certaine points alſo were to be propounded by
way of colloquy either of a penitent ſinner with God,
or of God all-enraged with a ſinnefull man. But all
meanes muſt be vſed, that by the feruour of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ach,
the auditours may at laſt open the eyes of their
harts, to behould the wounds of their ſoules, &amp; cure
them by meanes of the Sacraments. And thus his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
will in the end proue profitable, and fruitfull;
notwithſtanding he is to take great heed, that he do
not let fall any inconſiderate words, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
or touch any one in particuler either preſent
or abſent, eſpecially if they be Prelates or Magiſtrates.
For if ſuch perſons ſhall chance to offend, it will be
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:19094:314"/>
better and more ſecure to admoniſh ech of thempri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately,
and diſcreetly at home in his owne houſe, or
in confeſſion. For to reprehend them publickly is no
way conuenient. ſo apt are men, when they are tould
of their faults, to be rather exaſperated therat, then to
amend the ſame; eſpecially Gouernours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
whoſe authority certainly ſeemeth much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
when they are reprehended before their

for that which is accounted freedome amongſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

with ſtrangers: &amp; the rigour alſo of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
it ſelfe, muſt be tempered with cheerfullneſſe
of countenance, and mildneſſe of ſpeach. Wherefore
let al ſterne looks &amp; harſhneſſe of words be layd aſide,
&amp; let there be intermingled imbracements ſuitable to
that purpoſe (if the ſtate of the perſon will allow it)
with frequent ſignes of humility, that being woone
therby, he may with a more contented mynd receaue
that ſoueraigne antidote of your admonition. For if
the reprehenſion, which of it ſelfe is allwayes bitter
inough, ſhould be preſented vnto ſuch men in a harſh
or crabbed manner, perſons of great ſpirits being not
able to brooke the affront, will certaynely contemne

Concerning which ſubiect, as alſo about the diligent
endeauours of a Preacher, he giueth to F. <hi>Gaſpar</hi> this
diuine inſtruction. You ſhall, ſayth he, neuer prefer
a priuate good, before a common. Wherefore prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
muſt not be omitted for the hearing of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
nor the inſtruction of Children or ignorant
people be put of for priuate exerciſes of charity. If you
come into a Towne which you do not know, your
chiefe care ſhall be, to inquire of ſome perſons of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme

vices, and corruptions may, by reprehending after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
more ſharpely in Confeſſion, be wholy taken
away. For the chiefe meanes to help ſoules is to know
the diſpoſition and behauiour of the people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and the diſeaſes (as much as may be) of euery
one in particular, to wit, who diſagree amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
who beare emnity to one another, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
what iniuſtice in matters of equity, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe

<pb n="590" facs="tcp:19094:315"/>
and iudgements there be among them. Theſe thinges
therefore muſt be inquired after, of prudent and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced

help thoſe with whome you conuerſe, in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their ſaluation, then if you can throughly
ſound out their inclinations and conditions, and all
ſuch things as hinder them in the way of vertue. This
indeed ought to be their chiefe ſtudy, who imploy
themſelues for the gaining of ſoules. This in fine, is
the true reading in liuing bookes, which will teach
you, what you cannot find in dead papers. For the
things which are deliuered in writing vſe not alwayes
to be ſo good for practiſe, as thoſe which are taught
in liuing bookes, who are the perſons with whome

meanes to remember this, and deeply to ponder the
ſame, That there be many Preachers now tormented
in hell, who were more copious, and eloquent then
you are, and haue alſo conuerted more from a lewed
and wicked to an honeſt and veruous lyfe: and who
(which is euen a prodigious thing) hauing byn the

for this reaſon principally, becauſe becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
inſolent through pride &amp; arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy they did not
referre the diuine guifts which God had beſtowed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

So as hunting greedily after popular applauſe, &amp;
puffed vp with a vaine opinion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, they were
by an inſatiable deſire of pride &amp; glory, eleuated to a
moſt dangerous precipice, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they fell down
headlong to their euerlaſting deſtruction Let euery
one therfore call his wits togeather, and looke wel to
himſelfe. For if we will atrentiuely diue into the truth
of this doctrine, we ſhall eaſily ſee, that we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all in our ſelues wherin to glory, vnleſſe we
do perchance deſire to be honored for our imbecillity,
imperfections, for ſuch be the flowers, or rather weeds
indeed, which our garden affoardeth, and are truly &amp;
properly our owne. For if in our good workes there
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:19094:317"/>

you do not contemne your companions and brethren
as though your burden, or labour were more then
theirs: But rather perſwade your ſelfe, that by their

if any controuerſy chance to aryſe among you, you

Remember likewiſe, that if the other part ſhall at any

to adde courage to the fearefull, by extolling
the diuine clemency, &amp; by compaſſionating of them,
vntill they haue freely vngorged themſelues of all the

great warineſſe vſed. For there want not ſome, who

to their owne deſtruction. Wherefore againſt
ſuch peſtilent baſhfulneſſe, all meanes &amp; endeauours
poſſible muſt be vſed. And to get out their ſinnes from
ſuch perſons, there is no better way, then to ſhew
them, that we haue heard farre more grieuous, and

there were any thing to be reſtored, then if they

they muſt apply certaine admonitions, and remedies
for the cure of their ſoules; nor muſt they be abſolued
preſently after their confeſſion, but rather when they
haue reſtored thoſe things they ought. Wherfore of

Theſe things ought rather to go before abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

With theſe therefore you ſhall deale in this manner:
Firſt you ſhall get out of them their ſuſpicions and

the moſt part, cauſe to their ghoſtly Fathers a great

                  <p>If there happen any debate betwixt man and wife,
to take away al controuerſy, &amp; to appeaſe their mind,
you ſhall firſt of all procure, that ech of them, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:19094:322"/>
therun to by fit meditations, do make a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their former life; and as you ſhall ſee it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
you may differ to abſolue them for a while, that
they may come againe better prepared for the amend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of their liues, and eſtabliſhing of concord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themſelues. If the women tell you, that if they
might abſteine from the company of their husbands,
they ſhould be much more diligent in the ſeruice of
God, do not by any meanes belieue them. For beſides,
that ſuch feminine feruour groweth eaſily cold, it can
hardly euer be vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without grieuous offence to
their husbands. Take heed how you lay the fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the huſband in the preſence of his wife,<note place="margin">The busba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds part muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiues</note> although he
be certainly in the fault; but ſuppreſſing the matter
with ſilence for the preſent, you ſhall afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him &amp; you alone draw him to purify his whole
life by Confeſſion. And when he is at Confeſſion,
then you ſhall reprehend him in the moſt modeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that you can, and aduiſe him to looke carefully to
the peace of his howſe. But by all meanes you muſt
haue a care of this (being a buſineſſe very apt to breed
ſuſpitions) that you neuer by taking the wiues part,
ſeeme to take againſt her husband. Wherfore he muſt
firſt by little and little, in a friendly manner be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
to acknowledge his owne fault, and at laſt
you ſhal gently and louingly giue him abſolution. For
the Indians affections are moued by loue, but violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
ouerthroweth them.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall therfore (as I ſayd a little before) take
heed of accuſing the husband in the hearing of his
wife. For as the nature of women is to be a little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:19094:323"/>
&amp; malepart, they will eaſily caſt their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
in the teeth with their faults, eſpecially if they be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
guilty by Prieſts themſelues. Wherfore it is better
by diſſembling the matter, to lay before the wiues,
the reſpect which they owe vnto their husbands, and
to ſhew them alſo, that they, for the contempt which
they haue oftentimes had of their husbands, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
indeed to be ſeuerely chaſtiſed. If therfore there
happen to them any trouble from their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, they
ought to beare it humbly and patiently, and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
vnto them. Do not eaſily giue credit to either
of them when they complayne of one another, (for
oftentimes they are both deceiued themſelues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
others alſo) but you ſhall with the greateſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
that may be, heare them both, &amp; not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
eyther of them before you haue examined the matter.
This I ſay, that you may the better, and more eaſily
make accord between them, and auoyd ſuſpicion your
ſelfe. But if at any time you cannot make any reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
between them, you ſhall refer the whole buſines
to the Biſhop, or the Vicar General, but in ſuch ſort, as
not to wrong either of the partyes that are at varian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which you cannot but do, if you ſeeme to fauour
one more then another. You muſt vndoubtedly vſe
great prudence to giue no offence at all in this bad
world. And the euents of things, which are carryed
heere, muſt be alwaies forecaſt; for our aduerſary the
Diuell doth not ceaſe, <hi>but roameth about ſeeking whome to
deuoure.</hi> And it argueth great want of prudence, not
to foreſee the inconueniences that may ariſe of actions
which be vndertaken with neuer ſo good intention.</p>

Moreouer he would not haue Ghoſtly Fathers to
take mony vnder pretence either of reſtitution, or
almes, but according to the intention of the giuer,
procure it to be laid out in pious vſes, or els giuen
to the Sodality of <hi>Mercy:</hi> for ſo that Sodality might
the better prouide for the neceſſity of the poore, and
they alſo for the conſeruation of the Societies repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
If any come to confeſſion not ſo much to
cure their ſoules, as to ſeeke ſome reliefe for their

ſufferances of the ſoule, are more intollerable then
thoſe of the body: and at laſt (if it be iudged expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient)
to commend them to the Sodality of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, he aduiſed ſuch as heard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions
not to make too much haſt with their penitents, but
to vſe all diligence about them, and that they ſhould
rather deſire to heare a few co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions well made, then
many haſtily poſted ouer. For how could they els ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refully
apply remedies to their ſoares, vnleſſe they cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

well made, is better then many paſſed ſleightly

them, that they ſhould take ſome tyme to looke
into the Confeſſions which they had heard, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely
conſider whether they had done any thing
amiſſe therin, &amp; to ſatisfy for the ſame in their owne
Confeſſion, and after to amend the fault; ſeing ſuch
diligence is a great help for the well diſcharging of a

ſince there was nothing more gratefull to

following therein the example of the Apoſtles, <hi>Who
when they heard,</hi>

                  <hi>that</hi> Samaria <hi>had receyued the word of
God, ſent vnto them Peter and Iohn,</hi> who were the chiefe
of the Apoſtles. Wherefore he held it fit, that ſuch as
were choſen to this Apoſtolicall function, ſhould be
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:19094:324"/>
men extraordinary, and of tryed fidelity, vertue, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
and ſanctity of lyfe. But becauſe ſuch imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
required ſuch men, as alſo for that he had found
by experience, that ſuch charges were expoſed to
moſt grieuous temptations of the Diuell, vexations,
and miſeries, therfore in theſe labourers of our Lords
vineyard he required prudence and ſanctity, rather
then knowledge and learning; well knowing that
Vertue was abſolutely neceſſary for the ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
of ſo many and great difficulties, and that Sanctity
was of more importance then learning, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
of Ethnicks. But where vertue and learning
were beautifully combined togeather, ſuch, he ſaid,
were indeed ſingular, and perfect preachers of the
Ghoſpell, and ſpecially fit for <hi>Iaponia,</hi> and other ſuch
places, where the Barbarians, being a ſharpe-witted
people, do by their ſubtile interrogations make ſound
tryall of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>He required moreouer, in all ſuch as laboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Ethnickes, a propenſion, and deſire to learne
their ſtrange language, ſince without that knowledge
there could be ſmall profit made in gayning the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
to the Chriſtian faith, or in the inſtructing
of new Chriſtians. For which cauſe the Apoſtles,
before they began to teach the Gentils, were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
endowed with the guift of all tongues. And
his chiefe deſire was, that all ſhould be inflamed with
ardent zeale of ſauing ſoules, ſo as neuer to omit any
occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that kind, but preſently to lay hold therof,
and follow it cloſe. He likewiſe charged them to inſiſt
thoroughly vpon the ſaluation and inſtruction of the
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:19094:325"/>
Neophytes, to teach Children their Catechiſme, and
aboue all things to baptize children and infants, ſo as
none, if it were poſſible, might euer dye without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
the only ſafeguard of that tender age. He alſo
exhorted them, that by gayning the affection of the
Neophytes, they might be loued &amp; reſpected by them
euen as their parents. For loue naturally taketh all
things in good part; and to one that loueth nothing is
hard.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in the inſtructing of new Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
they ſhould ſhew no leſſe fortitude then perſeuerance
as well by enduring their vices, as bearing with their
weakeneſſe; and as good husbandmen expect with
our Sauiour, the harueſt of the ſeed they had ſowen, &amp;
the fruites of their labours though it were long firſt,
knowing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 125.</note> 
                  <hi>that they who ſow in teares, shall reape in ioy.</hi>
And if they found the Chriſtians at firſt not to be ſuch
as they deſired, they ſhould carry themſelues towards
them as good parents do towards vntoward children,
putting their confidence in God, who in due tyme
bringeth forth ſuch fruit in men, as is to be hoped for
&amp; wiſhed. Wherfore they ſhould attend vnto them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
ſince God our common Parent, although we
infinitely offend him, doth not ceaſe to beſtow his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
vpon vs. Yet would he not haue too much time
ſpent with the ancient Chriſtias, leaſt the new ſhould
be defrauded. But if in ciuility their conuerſation
could not be auoided, they ſhould at leaſt wayes bring
in diſcourſes of heauenly matters, and of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the good of their ſoules, that ſo they being
plyed continually with ſuch pious admonitions, they
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:19094:325"/>
might either grow better; or elſe being wearyed out
therewith, might ſuffer vs to buſy our ſelues with hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Neophytes.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe eſteemed more of a little fruit with
approbation of the people, then of a great deale with
offence, though neuer ſo ſmall of any, becauſe a little
fruit reaped with example of vertue, was both of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
continuance, and alwayes receiued new increaſe;
wheras oftentymes a great deale, with offence vnto
the people, did by little and little dry vp, and wither
away. Hetherfore charged them to behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
mildly &amp; humbly towards all, <hi>hauing</hi> (as the Apoſtle
ſayth) <hi>peace with all men,</hi> and by all meanes to auoid
contentions, eſpecially with Religious men &amp; Prieſts,
and to be mindfull alwayes of Gentleneſſe and Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that ſo they might gaine all to Chriſt. He vſed
alſo to ſay, that what good ſoeuer was not gained by
vertue, could not any way be gotten, but by vertue.
Wherfore they ſhould take great heed, that they did
not, according to the practiſe of the world, ſeeke (or
ſeeme to ſeeke) after dignityes and honours; neither
by words or deeds endeauour to get the fauour rather
of men, then of God, ſince the high authority, which
alwayes accompanieth Vertue was a guift not of men
but of God. And it often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that whilſt
by humane fauour (neglecting the diuine) men ſeeke
to purchaſe authority, and euen ſweat agayne to get
it, they by the great prouidence of God, wholy looſe
it; to this end no doubt, that they may not haue ſo
baſe an eſteeme of things diuine. For they who in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the ſame haue more regard to humane fauour
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:19094:326"/>
then diuine do manifeſtly ſhew, they do not reſpect
the diuine honour, ſo much as their owne; and that
ſuch ſacrilegious ambitions wil turne at laſt vnto their
owne confuſion and deſtruction. Euery one therfore
ought firſt to haue a ſpeciall care of his owne ſoule &amp;
then to help other mens. For he that neglecteth his
owne, will hardly haue a care of anothers ſaluation:
neither can he well be mindfull of another, who is
forgetfull of himſelfe. Wheras contrariwyſe, he that
hath care of his owne good, will alſo haue a care of his
neighbours. Wherfore no day ſhould paſſe without
meditation of diuine matters and perfect examination
of their conſcience, obſeruing wherin they had fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the diuine ſeruice, or in their owne duety; and
withall conſider with themſelues, how many things
God, through their default, had ceaſed rather effect,
then what he had performed by them: ſince the one
was an incitement to humility and perfect vertue, the
other to pride and folly, challenging thereby Gods
workes vnto our ſelues; then the which a more deadly
plague may not be found among religious perſons.</p>
               <p>Now, for asmuch as he eſteemed the education of
children to be a mayne &amp; principall mayſter-piece, he
ordayned, that they ſhould deliuer the Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to whole troupes of children togeather, neuer
omitting ſo fruitful an employment, nor committing
it to others. They ſhould neuer exaſperare or prouoke
any child to anger,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> but <hi>forbeare threates</hi> (as they A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
aduiſeth) to the end that ſo tender an age might
with the more alacrity imbrace their wholeſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.
Towards magiſtrates, and Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:19094:326"/>
Prelates they ſhould carry themſelues with all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and humility, and vpon no occaſion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
maintayne iarres or quarrels agaynſt them, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they ſhould by neuer ſo great iniuries be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked.
For Magiſtrates are ſooner woone by others
ſuffering, then by withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their authority. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould communicate vnto them, as to the
Patrons of their endeauours and labours, part of their
fruit, and gayne, attributing vnto them (next after
God) all the good they had receyued: ſo as by this
meanes they who labored in the Vineyard of our Lord
ſhould haue more helpers and defenders of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſt, fewer aduerſaries. He lykewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
them to employ themſelues no leſſe frequently,
then willingly in the exerciſe of charity &amp; humility,
by helping the ſicke of the Hoſpital, and priſoners the
Goales, both with charitable attendance, as alſo with
almes which they ſhould gather for them; but ſo,
as their help might profit them both corporally and
ſpiritually. For by ſuch exercyſes of Charity we ſhall
haue our owne ſoules inflamed with diuine loue, and
others alſo wilbe ſtirred vp to the lyke deeds, and the
ſeruants of God get credit, and authority towards the
aduancement of the Chriſtian cauſe. But eſpecially,
they ſhould neuer make account of ill rumours made
agaynſt them without cauſe, which do often ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and weaken the endeauours of thoſe that be
fearefull. Concerning this, there is extant as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>
                  <hi>Xauerius</hi> prudence was not more ſeene, in giuing

as well by nature as by diſpoſition; what zeale of
ſoules appeared in ech of them, what fruit euery one
reaped, with what griefes or afflictions ech one was
oppreſſed, tryed, and afflicted. And laſtly ſo great was
his care euen in the ſmalleſt thinges, that he would

he charged alſo the Superiours, to ſignify vnto him
with all ſpeed, whether euery one had carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

               <p>Moreouer, although in his trauailes throughout
