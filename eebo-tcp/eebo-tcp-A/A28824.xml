         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. <hi>Singer, Bodicoate,</hi> and <hi>Smithyes</hi> who made the firſt demand,
I know not who they all are, that I am asked to Aſſociate
with: But if they be,</p>

with mine, whoſe Bells and Bonſires have never failed hitherto to Argue

II. The Kirke of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ſold their Royal Refugee K. <hi>Charles</hi>
the I. into his Enemies hands; or if they be,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Voluntary Addreſſers,</hi> with <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> both of them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
never touch'd or ventur'd, firſt to <hi>Charles</hi> the I. in the <hi>Proteſtation,</hi>
and in the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant;</hi> then to the <hi>Rump Parliament,</hi> then
to the two <hi>Cromwells,</hi> then to the <hi>Rump</hi> again, then to the <hi>Committee</hi> of
<hi>Safety;</hi> afterwards to <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the II. into whoſe Aſſociation
I thank God I never entred before; or if they be,</p>
            <p>IV. Any of the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> who will be ſure to forſake King <hi>William</hi>
when their <hi>expected Maſſias</hi> Appears.</p>
            <p>I fear that by puting my name to the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> now a foot, in ſuch
Company as aforeſaid, I ſhall bind my ſelf in the ſenſe of an honeſt man
to ſuch uncertain Creatures, as will not be firmly bound to me, but will
leave me in the lurch, as they have left others their Aſſociates hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and incaſe they ſhall hereafter break and divide into two Contrary
and Hoſtile Parts, or Factions; that both ſides will with equal reaſon
expect I ſhould joyn with them, by virtue of my having entred into an
<hi>Aſſociation</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>For which Cauſe (before I do it) it were wiſdom to take as much time
as the Law allows me, for enquiring more perfectly who my Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
are, and in the mean time to continue King <hi>William</hi>'s moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Subject as my Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> obliges me to be, which hitherto
has been exactly obſerved.</p>
            <p>But hearing that ſome of you were at my houſe again to day for a
more ſpeedy anſwer, and finding alſo, that ſeveral of my beſt beloved
and moſt honoured Pariſhioners, have done the ſame without demur,
and by conſequence can put ſuch a tolerable ſenſe upon the words as I
have found it hard to do.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons being willing to ſuffer in ſo worthy Company, by
the foreſeen Knavery and falſhood of other our fellow Aſſociates, I have
taken the more pains to hunt out for ſome good ſenſe that the words may
be capable of.</p>
            <p>And therefore in that ſenſe I am ready to put my Name to the <hi>Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
whenſoever you ſhall ask it; which ſenſe is as here follows, in
three Articles.</p>
            <p>I. By theſe words (true and I awful King) I mean while he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be owned for ſuch by the three Eſtates of this Realm, freely
and fully aſſembled in Parliament, for I have no other skill of ſuch
Rights and Titles.</p>
            <p>II. By the <hi>King's Enemies,</hi> which I promiſe to be <hi>revenged</hi> of, if it lies
in my power, I do not mean all thoſe whom ſome of my fellow Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
may think, or call his Enemies, (for ſo they have called me their
fellow avenger for one,) But whom my ſelf not only ſuſpect or believe,
but know and can prove to be his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103739:2"/>
III. By promiſing to be revenged on them to my power, I do not
mean (tho it were in my power) to kill or hurt one of them, becauſe
all Religions teach Revenge to be a ſin in a private perſon, according
to that precept of St. <hi>Paul, Revenge not your ſelves,</hi> but only that if I be
Commiſſioned by the Publick Magiſtrate, whom the ſame Apoſtle calls
<hi>an Avenger to execute wrath,</hi> to bring the King's Enemies to a legal Tryal,
That ſo Juſtice may be done them; I will diſcharge my Office in ſuch
deligated Revenge. <hi>Witneſs my hand.</hi>

               <date>MAY 1. 1696.</date>
            </head>
            <p>I Had yours laſt Poſt, wherein you deſire my thoughts of the Miniſter
of <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Paper delivered at your Quarter Seſſions. But I muſt
tell you, that I look upon my ſelf to be as unfit to Reflect on it, as
'twas for him to write it. 1. Becauſe of my great diſtance, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Man, and his Hiſtory and Principles, Converſation
and Communication, which to underſtand, might furniſh a Reflector
with great advantages; whereas I know no more, (nor ever heard any
more) of him, than that he is the Miniſter of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who, you
ſay, wrote ſuch a Paper: and ſo whether I may uſe him too ſharply, or
too gently, I cannot ſo well judge. 2. Becauſe the matters of State, which
are his Subject, are the fartheſt from my Studies: And for ſuch things
I ſubmit my ſelf to the Information of thoſe, whoſe Profeſſion and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
it is; not ſo much as pretending my ſelf to any accuracy therein.
For you know, I lye low here in the Country obſcurity, ſeldom looking
out of my little Pariſh, or ſo much as ſeeing any Accounts of the Publick
News, but what you now and then tranſmit. And 3. Becauſe at this
time I am taken up with buſineſs, that ſets my Thoughts on working
quite another way: ſo that I am more than ordinary indiſpoſed for
the undertaking wherein you would engage me. Yet when it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the requeſt of a Friend, and alſo to ſhew my forwardneſs to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103739:3"/>
do any thing that I am able for the ſervice of my Dear, as well as
Dread Soveraign King <hi>William,</hi> to whom (as I am a Proteſtant Subject,)
I cannot but own my ſelf more obliged than to any Perſon in the
world; and for whom I lately entr'd the Aſſociation, as formerly I
took the Oath of Allegiance, without the leaſt heſitation; I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to ſay ſomewhat, which (tho Mean and Dilute, my paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and me, as well as ſome Anſwers and Reflections, which I
ſee, even in Print; (particularly what you laſt ſent me) that run at a
low Ebb; and do not ſay half that might be ſaid, nor with that <hi>Acumen</hi>
and Quickneſs, which an Ingenious Man would wiſh. 'Till the thing
then be better done, (which I doubt not but we ſhall ſhortly ſee, from
ſome of the Town Pens) I will make a little bold with my Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Tho he ſeems to be a man of Accompliſhments above my Level, and
too nimble for me at Diſputation, yet I do not fear the honeſt Defence
of a good Cauſe, againſt any one, let him be never ſo much to big for
me in other reſpects. Nor do I think I ought to ſpare one of my own
Sacred Calling, when that Calling gives him the ſad advantage of
poyſoning the more People with ſuch wild Tenents, as are diſtructive
to all Government. As you and I, and the world too well know, what
ſervice to their Countrey, too many of our Clergymen have thus done
of late years.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, my Thoughts are, That it would have made as much
for the Credit of this Miniſter, if he had refuſed to ſign the Aſſociation,
as to do it with ſuch gloſſes and ſarcaſtical Reflections upon his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
in which he ſeems not to ſhew ſo much Loyalty to his Soveraign,
as Deference to his beſt Beloved and moſt Honoured Pariſhioners: who
(after all his Hunting out for ſome good ſenſe which the words of the
Aſſociation might be capable of) were his beſt Caſuiſts, (by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice)
to inſtruct him, how tolerable it was to do that, which for ſome
Parochial Conſiderations) he might have found intolerable to omit. I
am apt to conjecture by his writing, that he is a <hi>De Facto-</hi>Man, that
was for declaring ſuch ſenſes of his Swearing, as now he does of his
Aſſociating. However he tells the world, that he is a Captious Man:
For as he begins with a Cavil, ſo methinks he diſcovers more of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictous,
than of a Conſcientious Spirit through out.</p>
            <p>His great Quarrel is at the Company, with which he is to Aſſociate;
moſt of which, (in my opinion) his modeſty ſhould have thought good
enough for the Miniſter of <hi>Richmond:</hi> When he has all the Lords and
Commons in Parliament (but an inconſiderable handful) and all his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Fathers (but one, whom few think fit to be called a Father) and
the moſt and beſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, and Commonalty
throwout the Land, for his Aſſociates. Yet it's a mortification to him,
to joyn with the Mobb. I know not if ever that frightful Beaſt gave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103739:3"/>
him a Kick, to leave a prejudice there: But under that name of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
I doubt not but he may find as honeſt, as in any <hi>Jacobite</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
Nor need he count it any diſparagement to go with the multitude,
when it is not to Evil: Yea when the multitude run not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but after ſuch another multitude, worthier than themſelves as
I have nam'd. And after he has better conſidered it, I hope he will
conclude it more <hi>Eligible,</hi> to follow them into the Aſſaſſination, than to
follow Sir <hi>John Friends</hi> Tutors, that would lead him into the Aſſociation;
whither that Doctrine lately preached at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> carries the Party,
without Remorſe. But this <hi>Bellua multorum Capitum,</hi> (which he could
ſo hardly condeſcend to ſhake hands with) often gives us the trueſt ſenſe
of the Nation) as one Man. Nor is their Blaze and Noiſe ſo Equal, but
they could make a vaſt difference between King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration and
King <hi>William</hi>'s Aſſociation, being Dull and all <hi>a-mort</hi> at the one; but
full of Tranſport, and all Life and Briskneſs at the other.</p>
            <p>What his Traiterous <hi>Scots</hi> did for their Royal Refugee King <hi>Charles,</hi>
I fear we have as Traiterous Engliſh ready to do for their Royal Refugee
King <hi>William.</hi> And tho there's no hold of ſome mens Oaths or Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations;
yet I have more Charity, than to call all pretenders Hypocrites,
and am willing to hope my Partners honeſt, till I catch 'em playing the
Knave. And 'tis my conſolation, that now I joyn with a vaſt body of
honeſt Men, that are hearty <hi>Williamites,</hi> tho here and there a parcel
of rotten ſticks cleave to the ſame Tree.</p>
            <p>I leave ſuch as have wheel'd about all the points of the Compaſs,
to make their own Defences, but I cannot be ignorant, That there are
more Weathercocks belonging to our Churches than what are on the
Steeples. And ſuch as will do what they count hardly tolerable to be
done for the keeping of their Poſts, ought not to complain of others
for ſh<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fting from <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Rump,</hi> then to the <hi>Cromwells,</hi> then to the
<hi>Rump again, then to the Committee of Safety, afterwards to King</hi> Charles
<hi>and</hi> James. I would ſooner loſe all, for being a profeſſed <hi>Jacobite,</hi>
than hold the Truth in unrighteouſneſs, to hold my Benefice, and Swear
to King <hi>William,</hi> while I hold in with his worſt Enemies. <hi>O my ſoul,
come not thou into the ſecrets of ſuch men: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto their Aſſembly mine Honour
be not thou united: for in their anger they would have ſlain a man:</hi> (even
the Man of God<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s right hand, whom he has made ſtrong for himſelf.)
<hi>And in their ſelf-will, would they have digged down a Wall,</hi> even the Wall
of our Government, that ſaves us from Ruine ruſhing in upon us, I
wonder not at all, that the Addreſſers with Lives and Fortunes, call'd
Voluntary, ſhould fail King <hi>James</hi> in his need; when I remember, with
what mean baſe Artifices, thoſe Addreſſes were gather'd; and how
Notorious they were, to be a labour'd contrivance, for the ſerving of a
Turn, and none of the Nations Act and Deed.</p>

Now for his Circumciſion-men, (who are brought in here, I know
not how, unleſs to ſtur the Aſſociation.) He need not trouble his head
with frights of their deſerting him, if they do but keep their faith with
King <hi>William,</hi> till ſuch time as their expected Meſſias appears. And
ſhould any of the reſt leave him in the lurch, by deſerting the King,
whom they acknowledged for their Rightful Prince: This Miniſter may
yet be ſecure, in ſpight of 'em, if himſelf follow not after 'em; becauſe
he will have better and ſtronger than they on his ſide. However, I
hope he will not think, (with ſuch <hi>Traitors)</hi> that they have equal reaſon
as the other to expect his joyning with 'em, by virtue of that Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which obliges both him and them to ſtick to their Soveraign King
<hi>William,</hi> againſt all his Oppoſers. And ſhould the Knavery and Falſhood
which he foreſees, throw him upon ſuffering, he would not have only the
worthy Company of his beſt Beloved and moſt Honoured Pariſhioners,
but of all his Proteſtant Country-men and Aſſociates, that are upright and
faithful in the Land. And to adventure in the ſame Bottom with ſuch,
I know not what good Man would ſcruple.</p>
            <p>His 3 Articles of Explanation, he might have ſpar'd: For who, that
hand not a mind to be troubleſome, would ſtumble at ſuch Straws? But
now he has given them, they need themſelves a little to be explained.
For (1.) Tho he profeſſes to learn all his skill of Rights and Titles,
from the 3 Eſtates of this Realm aſſembled in Parliament, (wherein I
commend his Choice, for going to ſo good a School for that inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.)
Yet there may be equivocation in the Terms, <hi>[Freely and Fully]</hi> for
I know not but ſomebody may queſtion, whether their Election were
Free, or whether their Acts be valid, ſhould any of the Members be
wanting there, or ſhould there be ſome in the Houſe, that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with the reſt, to own the King as Rightful. But I have another
Conſideration upon this Article, which will affect him more than any
thing I have yet ſaid, if what I think herein ſhall be confirm'd by the
Learned in the Law, unto whom (concerning this Point) I muſt refer
you. For I am really of the Opinion that 'tis no leſs than Treaſonable to ſay,
I will own the King for my Soveraign, no longer than the Three Eſtates
of this Realm freely and fully aſſembled in Parliament ſhall own him for
True and Lawful. Tho I cannot entertain ſo hard and wicked a thought
of the Parliament, That the Majority of 'em will ever turn ſuch Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades
to his Majeſty, yet (when this Writer urges me to put
the Caſe) ſuppoſe they ſhould? ſure they would only render themſelves
reſponſible for the Treaſon; but not at all Diveſt the King of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Authority. Still he is never the leſs King, for their Deſerting and
Renouncing him; as long as he does not Deſert them, nor Abdicate
the Government; nor can they (at their Pleaſure) call back the Truſt
which they have lodged in him, or the Allegiance that they have given
up to him. Even they that made him King, have not ſuch Power to unmake
him. Tho he can when he will, make them no Parliament, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103739:4"/>
cannot when they will make him no King: Till by his own Act, he
forfeits his Right, and Diſſolves the Contract. (2.) Tho this Miniſter
be not oblig'd to take Vengeance on all that any may call the King's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
or whom he only ſuſpects for ſuch: (Nay I will add, that tho
he ſhould be Conſcious himſelf is one of 'em, and that they who call
him ſo, really do him no wrong: he is not therefore bound to accuſe
himſelf.) Yet I ſee not where's the Difficulty or Hardſhip put upon
him or any, to prove who are the King's Enemies meant in the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
when the Honourable Houſe of Commons has there given ſuch
Intimations, that are as a marke in their Fore-heads, by which they do
notoriouſly prove themſelves Enemies, in their horrid attempts againſt
his Sacred Majeſty, his Crown or Life, by Plots and Treaſons, by Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
and Rebellions, or Aiding and Aſſiſting, Abetting or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame. Certainly, if I have not on a very thick pair of <hi>Jacobite</hi>
Spectacles, I cannot but ſee and know all theſe to be the King's Enemies.
(3.) For the Vengeance to be taken upon 'em, (which is the Tender
Point, ſo much ſtuck at by ſome, whoſe Conſciences yet ſeem not ſo
to ſtartle at the Murder of the King.) What true lover of his King and
Country will think that word too hard for ſo black a Villany? And tho
this Miniſter is not ſuddenly (upon ſuch a <hi>Nefandous Fact)</hi> to turn Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
nor to get a Bagonet to his Girdle, or go to work with his
Fiſts or his Cudgell, to knock down the Kings Enemies: yet ſure if he
have ſuch a ſenſe of the Guilt and Wickedneſs as he ought, he will not
ſtay till he has got a Commiſſion from the Publick Magiſtrate to bring
them to Juſtice and Condign Puniſhment. For as he is a Man fearing
God, a faithful Subject, and an honeſt Aſſociate, he ought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at 'em; but (whereever he is aware of them) to detect 'em, and what
he underſtands, and can witneſs againſt 'em, to complain and make
known to the Magiſtrate, and ſhew his Concern, and uſe his Endeavours,
that the Impious Bloody Criminals may have their due Deſerts, and what
the Law allots them; that ſuch heavy heanious Guilt allow'd, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
may not lye upon the Land. But God grant that neither he nor I
nor you, may ever have the occaſion to put us upon that Office.</p>
