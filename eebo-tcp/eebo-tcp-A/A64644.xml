            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any one ask, who is <hi>He</hi> presumes to Publish the Papers of that Learned, Pious, and peacable Prelate (worthy of eternal Memory,) without appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation first had, of such as hold the Chair in the several Parts of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Discipline? <hi>I Answer,</hi> The Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of each Party are not yet agreed, nor do I know when they will be: and the times require that some means be used to advance the Peace of the Church, and preserve the Nation. That Peace I mean, whereby the minds of men may be disposed to lay aside all old ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities, and upon a common Principle of Union, become charitable, and so perpetual Friends.</p>
            <p>The Faithfull and true Ministers of the Gospel of Peace, will (I hope,) give their allowance to this attempt, Pious and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable in its intention. For the contrary minded who would have Fire come from Heaven to consume all those, who receive not their Dictates, I shall only rebuke them with that of our Saviour to his Disciples, ye know not of what manner of Spirit ye are? <note place="margin">Luke 9. 55.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Peace therefore and Christian Concord, is not the matter these men seek, but perpetual Parties and Sidings, wherein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they hope to appear Somebody; which temper (even in the minds where it ought least to be,) hath embroyl'd the world in miserable Feuds. And this being perceiv'd by men experienced in Publick business, hath produced variety of complaints. <hi>Sir Edwyn Sandys</hi> discoursing of the division of <hi>Protestants</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Europae specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum <hi>172.</hi>
               </note> abroad into <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> complains. <hi>That the Ministers of each side have so far bestirr'd themselves, that the</hi>

               <hi>Coal which a wise man, with a little moisture of his mouth would soon have quenched, they with the wind of their breath have contrariwise so enflamed, that it threatneth a great ruine and Calamity on both sides.</hi> And a little after, reprehending the heat and extremity of contention. <hi>They make more account</hi> (says he) <hi>of some empty Syllogism than of the Peace of the Church, and happiness of the World.</hi> The most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Pious <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> bemoaning the Discords of Christian <note place="margin">Votum pro pace 62.</note> Leaders, Says, <hi>Si in eorum Bellorum quibus tam diu vastatur Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa causas inquirimus, inveniemus hoc incendium, maximè ab ijs quos pacis praecones esse debuerunt excitatum.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> after all his Travells in the matter of Ecclesiastical Peace, found at last the difficulty to lie at home, among those of his own Profession: which caused him to lay down this Maxim. <hi>That</hi>

               <hi>neither can a Civil Confederation be truly framed among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, nor when it is framed can it be faithfully maintained, except the foundation thereof be laid in the minds of the Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The expedient here proposed by this Learned and Pious Prelate, for Composing the Controversies and contentions about Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Government, will not make the wounds wider I hope, I do not see how it can. And if it bring with it a healing vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to unite and consolidate Parties discontinued, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I shall not repent me of acting the Empyrick in applying this Sovereign Receipt, (which came fortunately to my hands) to the curing all those fretting ailments have so long troubled the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will this attempt of mine be insecure, if the Learned and Pious Guides of either Party be consulted. It is Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s judgment, <hi>That a moderate Episcopacy, with a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>assistant Presbytery, as it will certainly satisfie the desires of those whose pretensions are regular and moderate, (crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more, and in some things less than the Laws of the Land,) so it will appear to be that, which all Parties can best Tolerate: and which next himself, both Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Independant and Erastian, will make no question to choose and prefer, before any of the other Pretenders.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (no friend to modern Episcopacy) earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultating <note place="margin">Gildas Salv. 338.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49590:3"/>
the Pastoral care and oversight of Souls: <hi>I speak not this,</hi> says he, <hi>against any Bishops, that acknowledge the Presbyters to be true Pastors to Rule and Teach the Flock, and take themselves only to be the Chief, and Presidents among Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, yea, or the Rulers of Presbyters that are Rulers of the Flock. But of them that Null the Presbyters Office, and the Churches Government and Discipline, by undertaking it alone as their sole Prerogative.</hi> Me thinks, (as <hi>Agrippa</hi> said <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> to <hi>Paul,</hi> Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian,) I might here step in, and tell these Learned and Pious Controvertists, That, almost they may be persuaded to be Friends.</p>
            <p>But the Principal defence I intend my self against the censures of my Publishing those Papers, Is, the sense of the late King himself, in his Posthumous admired Book. <hi>Not</hi> (says he) <note place="margin">pag. 144.</note> 
               <hi>that I am against the managing of this Presidency and Authority in one man by the joynt Counsel and Consent of many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; I have offered to restore that.</hi> And again, <hi>I was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">pag. 173.</note> 
               <hi>willing to grant or restore to Presbytery, what with reason or discretion it can pretend to; in a conjuncture with Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</hi> So that, the purpose the late King had, of uniting his divided People, (If God had so permitted, whose judgments <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> are wonderfull, and his ways past finding out,) was upon Grounds agreeable to the design of this Paper. And therefore what was by <hi>Him</hi> so Piously and Prudently intended, for resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> to the Church, is so much the more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary now, by how much we understand That intention of the said <hi>King:</hi> and that the same Parties remain still estranged in conuntenance and conversation.</p>
            <p>And yet it would not be so, if some instrument or medium could be used to bring them to debate (with an humble Christian Spirit,) on terms of reconcilement and uni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty. Which, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it shall, by Gods gracious Dispensation and Providence over us be granted: so much of our passions and interest must be laid aside, as not to think it imaginable, in the traverse of such long and sharp disputes and diffirences, That one Party should be totally guilty, and the other altogether innocent.</p>
            <p>When I consider a Presbyterian, will it be well to fetch a Character, from all the frailties and failings of men of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49590:4"/>
Persuasion? If one Preached, <hi>It would never be well till twice</hi>

               <hi>7. Prelates be hanged up, as the 7. Sons of</hi> Saul <hi>were hanged up in</hi> Gibeon. And another, <hi>That the bloodiest and sharpest War was to be endured, rather than the least error in Doctrine and Discipline.</hi> And another, <hi>Wishing that all the Prelates in the Kingdom and himself were together in a bottomless Boat at Sea, for he would be content to loose his life, so the Bishops might loose theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will not all these seem strong and tearing winds, rending the rocks of all Order and good Government, in which God was <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 11. 12. Gen. 3. 8.</note> not. Rather than the small and still voice, which walked in the Garden in the cool of the day, when God came to enquire calmly after <hi>Adams</hi> sin? Or will they not seem rather so many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which we have seen fulfilled sadly upon that place, and those persons, whoyet were as ignorant of the Prophetick import of their own expressions, as <hi>Caiphas</hi> was of Christs offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the world, when he counselled the <hi>Jews, That it was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 14.</note> 
               <hi>expedient that one man should die for the People,</hi> And yet knew not the import of Christ dying for the People.</p>
            <p>When men pass sentence upon themselves, God often sees it executed: The <hi>Israelites</hi> no sooner wish <hi>they had died in the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>or in the Wilderness:</hi> But the Answer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <note place="margin">Num. 14. 2.</note> 
               <hi>As I live saith the Lord, as you have spoken in mine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Ears, so will I do to you.</hi> And the Heathen Poet could teach us the same lesson. <hi>Evertere domos totas optantibus ipsis,</hi>

               <hi>Dii faciles.</hi> I do not like raking Fire out of Embers, by search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the faults of men, who Perished in their own Flames, and are objects of our Pitty more than Passion. Otherwise no Nation under Heaven could afford examples equal to that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the proof of rigid Presbyterian Discipline. Of which how much is settled after more then <hi>100</hi> years are run out since the Nobles, Gentry and People, have been vehemently. sollicited to kill and slay each other, or any body else rather than be, without it, the present state of Affairs there may bear us witness.</p>
            <p>Would it be a good course of judging of Episcopal Government, to rake into the Records and Histories of <hi>1600.</hi> Years, for the errors of all Bishops, whòm worldly Interest, or Passion, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49590:4"/>
other human frailties have carried beyond the gravity, austerity, humility and Apostolical Piety of their Primitive institution. And will this serve to level imparity, the principle of all Order and Government? and secure the modern Presbytery from the like irregularities or excesses? Certainly those accusations and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which Politicians say secure other States, subvert the foundations of the Churches peace: which are laid in Charity, the Characteristick note of a Christian. <hi>By this ye know if ye be my Disciples,</hi> (says Christ) <hi>If ye love one another.</hi> And <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 35.</note> in ancient times the common saying was, <hi>Ecce quam diligunt Christiani?</hi> That execrable delight and joy, which any one takes to accuse, or to find faults in others, he hath from the Devil, <hi>Who is the great accuser of the Brethren.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident to what a miserable extremity the divisions about Church-Government, had brought a great Nation. From disputing and fighting for this and that Form, we at last knew no Form at all: Every one doing what seemed good in his own eyes. God having justly taken away from Both, what was so intemperately desired, and contended for on either side.</p>
            <p>Both Episcopacy and Presbytery that strive for it, Do it surely for this common end, That the people, being taught to know God aright, might glorifie him in their Lives and Conversations. The <hi>People,</hi> I say, who are more easily disposed to Innovations and Disobedience many times, by the artifice and insinuations of a few; than can be reclaimed again by the Authority, Eloquence and Wisdom of many. They are therefore a commiserable body, and being commonly the Masters of error (the weakest part of whom being their mind and meer servants to the Ambition of others) How much doth it most truly import the Sacred Function, to be wholly employ'd in saving the Souls of these men, from perishing in a Famine of Spiritual food and nourishment.</p>
            <p>But while both strive for the Rule and Form of doing this (without imputation of Ambition or Usurpation) Is it not pitty to think the matter should ever come to that pass that one half of the Nation must be first destroyed. And instead of settling Christs Discipline, that no body at this rate, should be left to become Christs Disciples, whom Error or the Sword had not devoured.</p>
