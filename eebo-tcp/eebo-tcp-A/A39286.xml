            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving peruſed yours of the 21. of <hi>January</hi> from <hi>Leyceſter,</hi> unto the Gentry of <hi>Devon,</hi> I finde an expoſtulation or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the caſe in reference to our preſent diſtractions, and extream grievances of the people, then and every where remonſtrated unto you, Therefore, my Lord, ſince you have wiſdome to diſcover the ſeveral intereſts which you then mention to be interwoven both in Church, State, &amp;c. It will alſo be as conſiderable to conſider that thoſe perſons are but few in reſpect to the whole, and they are onely thoſe who now obſtruct our peace, and cauſe the Nations thus to complaine; So that to make any concluſion with your Excellency, that thoſe are rational or ſatisfactory grounds (under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) cannot be admitted ſince it oppoſes the peoples freedom, their ancient Rights, and that which is of more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even the Scriptures which (without yea and nay) are the revealed will of God, for that the Government apparently declares it ſelf to be built upon, or by the blood and ruines (not to name all our conſciences tells us) of our brethren, Countrey-men and friends, and is upheld by perſons whoſe intereſts at this day in temporals denies them any thoughts of Chriſt and his Laws, which is reſtitution and ſevere repentance, and who certainly, although for a few dayes of momentary joy they are ſeemingly by ſucceſſeful errours allowed of, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long deface this State, and once glorious Church of God, by which further I muſt tell your Lordſhip, and all muſt confeſſe, that thoſe foundations thus built upon are altogether ſandy and fallacious, and all thoſe who ſeek and endeavour to be Builders in that <hi>Babel</hi> by the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wrath of God ſhall be deſtroyed even in the imaginations of their own hearts. And now, my Lord, I am come to that particular where the people and the ſecluded Members, as I humbly conceive, are denyed a right upon a ſuppoſition of neceſſity, and as to that the anſwer is eaſily reduced to this, who or what brought us or them to this neceſſity, was it not former crimes? if ſo then, My Lord, all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities are lawful if not ſo, and that they dread not puniſhments or loſſe of worldly intereſts for ſome deviations and crying ſins, why do they not acquieſſe in this, that the power is in the people, as they for their own ends ſomtimes did declare (thoſe Members being twice the major part, and thrown out by <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his adherents, theſe men then countenancing and contriving the ſame which your Lordſhip knows hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned upon them to the great deſtruction and hazard of theſe Nations, Therefore my Lord, I would to God I might be the Prophet to forewarn you of the violence and oppreſſion which is in their hands, that you might be kept from ſo ſinful compliances, for to defend a few diſcontents in ſelf intereſt onely is obſtinancy almoſt beyond parallel: And therefore, my Lord, ſince Noble actions do always attend a generous mind. It is my greateſt hopes, and not onely mine, but the expections and longings for of theſe Nations (ſince the priſe is put into your hands,) That you ſhould now be the happy inſtrument of their Redemption, by ſuch conditions as may ſecure all perſons ſo concerned, or elſe what meanes all thoſe Addreſſes made unto your ſelfe from the City of <hi>London,</hi> tumults and importunate deſires for a Free Parliament of the Nations in General, whoſe burthens are unſufferable to uphold the envious ambition of ſome few, and cannot but be grievous as clamourous in your eares.</p>
            <p>But, My Lord, there are yet ſome conſiderable Obſervations and remembrances to be laid before you; was it not their ſinne in that place of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard that kill'd? and was it not the aggravation that they alſo took poſſeſſion? Is not rebellion as the ſinne of witchcraft? is it not our Saviours expreſſe command, give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars?</hi> and is not this the Royal Law? do as you would that others ſhould do unto you; innumerable are the Texts, and readings in Hiſtory that might be here inſerted, which doubtleſſe, My Lord, you will recollect to your eternal honour, and the everlaſting peace and ſettlement of theſe afflicted Nations, whoſe perjuries in breaking Allegiances, Vowes and Covenants, both with God and man, and lead thereunto by their various Governours, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if we had been in trouble until we were double damn'd in ſinning, and cauſing others to finne is matter of amazement. In a word, to conclude your Excellencies trouble, be pleaſed to let this Maxime remain with you, That Government which once becomes a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word to the people is not durable, this is ſo, we have tried all formes and models, and this is yet the judgement upon us, that we ſtrive againſt his providence, and will not be healed: How many who had commands almoſt equal with your's, have outlived the days they might have been renowned, who by countenancing factions and crying ſins afterwards fell into tribulation and great ſcorn, being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by their own confederates: And this, my Lord, is the portion and fate of all ſuch who put their truſt in man, taking indirect meanes to attaine glorious ends, as they pretended, and this perpetuates our thraldome and miſeries, My Lord, It is therefore my hearts deſire, that you may imploy the talent God hath now put into your hands to theſe purpoſes, which will for ever make you famous and precious in the ſight of God and Good men; and ſure I am, it will abundantly illuſtrate that joy which you may gain in that immortalitie and glorious life to come, in the intrim you cannot but find the ſecret overflowings in your own breaſt, the ſtreames of which the people pray may never be diverted by thouſands <hi>per annum;</hi> and this, my Lord, with the preſent condition of that noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> and others, who are now under great ſufferings for aſſerting their Countreys Right, and freedome of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which is the ſenſe and perfect deſires of theſe Nations, is humbly offered unto you as becometh your Excellencies</p>
