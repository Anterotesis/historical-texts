            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE externall worship of God, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church (Gentle and indicious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) are like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins: they are sick together, in health together: they liue together, they die and dwine together. As long as the government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> stood in integritie, as it was established by lawes, civill and ecclesiasticall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word, so long was the worship of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in puritie. Since the former government was altered, and the insolent domination of Prelates hath entered in by unlawfull meanes amongst us; popish rites and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Ceremonies have followed, and are like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile universally. They haue verified in their persons their common tenent, <hi>No Ceremony, no Bishop.</hi> The libertie graunted to our Church, to indict and hold generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies from yeare to yeare and oftner <hi>pro re nata,</hi> was the cheife bulwarke of our discipline. This bulwarke was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down to the end a more patent way might be made for their exaltation. When vote in Parliament (the needle to draw in the threede of Episcopall authoritie) was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the great griefe of the sincerer sort, many protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made, that no alteration in discipline, or divine service was intended: many cautions and limitations were made to bound the power of the minister voter in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were ordayned to be countable to the generall
<pb facs="tcp:7885:3"/>
Assemblies, for the manner of their entrie and behaviour in this new office: But like bankrupts, not being able to render accompt, they laboured that no accompt should bee made at all: that is, that there should be no ordinary gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall assemblie to take accompt. Some few extraordinary Assemblies haue been convocated of late yeeres at their pleasures, for their purposes, and according to their device, constituted as they thought good: wherein they procured, or rather extorted with terror and authoritie, a sort of prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence aboue their bretheren. They were Lords in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Councell, Session, Checker, Lords of Regalities, Lords of temporall lands, Presenters to benefices, modifiers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters stipends, grand-Commissioners in the high Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Was it wonder then if so great Commanders comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Assemblies constituted, as is said, and carved to themselues a spirituall Lordship, when their worthy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were banished, imprisoned, confined, or deteyned at Court, that they might the more easily effectuate their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. They haue broken the caveats made with their owne consent, violated their promises, and haue sought prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence both in Church and Common- wealth, with the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of others, and the renting of their mothers belly. Wee haue notwithstanding been so silent hitherto, that the world hath iudged our silence, rather slumbring and slothfulnesse then true patience. They are not satisfied with the wrongs already committed, but do still provoke us with new irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant occasions: and specially by obtruding upon us supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious will-worships, and polluted inventions of men. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth us therefore to set pen to paper, and say somewhat for the surer stay and better information of professors, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly affected to the sincerity of religion, lest they bee delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the glorious name of a pretended and null-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,
<pb facs="tcp:7885:3"/>
or seduced with temporizers, swallowing up all abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations or corruptions whatsoever. The meanes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and publishing are to us very difficill: wee wish therefore every good Christian to take in good part our meane travels, and not impute unto us want of good will, but of meanes, if they be not served hereafter continually after this manner. Wee shall bee ready God willing for our owne part, as need shall require, and opportunitie will serue, to defend the cause we maintaine against any of our opposites their answers, or replies whatsoever, worthy of answer. Wee haue seene of late some Pamphlets, which haue rather exposed their authors to laughter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, then deserved any serious Confutation. In the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle before <hi>Basilicon Doron</hi> his Maiestie protesteth upon his honour, that hee misliketh not generally all Preachers, or others, who like better of the single forme of Policie in our Church, then of the many Ceremonies in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and are perswaded that their Bishops smell of a <hi>papall Supremacie,</hi> that the <hi>surplesse,</hi> the <hi>corner cap,</hi> and such like, are the outward badges of <hi>popish errours.</hi> And that he doth equally loue and honour the learned and graue men of either of these opinions. His Maiestie useth this Provision, that where the Law is otherwise, they presse by Patience and well grounded reasons, either to perswade all the rest to like of their iudgement, or where they see better grounds on the other part, not to be ashamed peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to incline therunto, laying aside all preoccupied opinions. Wee are able to proue that no Ecclesiasticall law hath been made in any free and formall Assemblie for the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by-past, or presently intended, either in Government or Ceremonies. The ratification of civill Lawes already made, or to be made, cannot rectifie the <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> as long as
<pb facs="tcp:7885:4"/>
wee are able by good reason to impugne their authority, and evince the vicious constitution, the informall and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proceedings of these Assemblies, where the said Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Lawes are said to haue been made. Put the case that no exception might be made against the Law, his Maiesties provision permitteth us to perswade others with well grounded reasons. The verity of our relations, and validity of our reasons, we refer to the tryall of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry iudicious Reader, making conscience of his oath, promise, subscription, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his profession.</p>

            <head>THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASSEMBLIE HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at PERTH in <hi>August, Anno Dom.</hi> 1618.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Vesday the 25 of August, 1618, the first day of the Assemblie. The generall Assemblie was indicted by his Majestie to be holden at <hi>Perth</hi> the 25. day of August 1618. Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made twentie dayes before by open proclamation with sound of trumpet. For obedience to the proclamation and his Majesties particular missiues, the persons following conveined at the said Burgh the appointed day: his Majesties Commissioners my Lord <hi>Binning</hi> Secretary. <hi>Lord Skoone. Lord Carnegie.</hi> Their Assessours <hi>Sir Gideon Murray</hi> Treasurer Deputy, <hi>Sir Andrew Ker</hi> of <hi>Pharnihirst,</hi> Captaine of the guard. <hi>Sir William Olphant</hi> the kings Advocate, and <hi>Sir Wil. Livingstoun</hi> of <hi>Kilsyth.</hi> Noble men, the <hi>Earls of Louthiane, Lord Ochiltrie, Lord Sanquhar, Lord Boyde.</hi> Barons: <hi>Waughtoun, Lutquharne, Glen-vrquhart</hi> younger, <hi>Clunie-Gordoun, Boningtoun-woode, Weymis, Balvaird, Bilcolmie, Balcarras, Balmanno, Bombie, Blackbarronie, Lagg. Burgesses</hi>: for <hi>Edinburgh David Akinheid George Fowlis.</hi> For <hi>Perth Iames Aedie, Constant Malice.</hi> For <hi>Dundie; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Alexander Wedderburne</hi> younger, <hi>Robert Clay-hils</hi>: for <hi>Aberdine,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Mortimer.</hi> For <hi>Sterling, Christopher Alexander</hi>: for S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droes, Iohn Knox, Thomas Lentroun</hi>: for the Vniversity of S. <hi>Androes, Doctor Bruce.</hi> Bishops, all except <hi>Argyle</hi> and the Iles. Ministers, Commissioners from presbyteries.</p>
            <p>According to the ordinance, and laudable custome of this Church anent the sanctification of her meetings by fasting and prayer, intimation was made vpon the Sabboth preceding in the Church of <hi>Perth</hi> of a fast to be observed the first day of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie: but the fast was little regarded, sauing that two sermons were made. The first was made in the morning by <hi>Patrik Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdine.</hi> His text. Ezra. 7.23. he observed and enlarged this ground,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7885:5"/>
that nothing should be done or determined in the Church by any superiour power whatsoeuer, but that which is according to the commandement of the almightie King. The other sermon was made at the tenth houre by <hi>Iohn</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> in the lytle Church. His text. 1. Cor. 11.16. was very pertinent, but he ranne quicklie from it. He discoursed the space of two houres first in defence of ceremonies in generall. Next, of the fiue articles in particular. His best arguments for proofe or improbation was some testimonies cited out of <hi>Calvin, Martyr, Beza</hi> but perverted. The said Arch Bishop in his discourse, made ample protestation that he vnderstood not of the intended novations before they came of his Majestie. Item, that his Majesty would haue had these fiue Articles registred as Canons in the booke of the generall Assemblie, without either reasoning or voting: but by his meanes his Majestie was put of, till the consent of the Church should be obtayned. This his protestation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with a dreadfull execration, that the curse of God might light on him, and his, if he had not spoken truely. Immediately after the said discourse; was holden the first Session of this assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie in maner following.</p>
            <p>There was set in the litle Church a long table, and at the head thereof a short crosse table. At the crosse table were set chaires for his Maiesties Commissioners and the Moderator. At the syde of the long table were set forms for Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Bishops and Doctors. The Ministers were left to stand behind them, as if their place and parte had been onely to behold.</p>
            <p>The Arch-bishop placed himself at the head of the table in the Moderators chaire beside his Majesties Commissioners. After prayer he notified to the assemblie, that Maister <hi>Thomas Nicolson</hi> ordinary Clark had dimitted his office in favour of Maister <hi>Iames Sandelands</hi> Aduocate. He commended the said Maister <hi>Iames,</hi> as a man qualified for that office, and readie to further the brethren in their particular affaires: And so without formall voting or lyte he tooke him sworne and admitted him Clerk. The Brethren were ordained to giue in their commissions to him after the rising of this session.</p>
            <p>After that, Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> Deane of <hi>Winchester,</hi> by birth a Scotishman presented his Majesties letter, directed to the Lords of the privie Counsell, and the Bishops. This letter was twise read in open audience. Terrours were mixed with allurements to mooue the assemblie. After the reading of his Majesties letter the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop had a speach, wherein he protested, that neither he nor the Church of England had craued these nouations, nor geuen counsel thereanent, and that it was against his will, that euer they were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7885:5"/>
motioned. Yet now he is perswaded, that his Majestie would be more glad of the consent of this assemblie therevnto, then of all the gold of <hi>India</hi>: assureing them on the other parte in case of their refusall, the whole estate and order of our Church will be overthrown, Some Ministers will be banished: other some will bee deprived of their stipend and office; and all will be brought under the wrath of authority. He advised them rather to consent in time, then afterward to beg favour by offering conformity, and finde none. He alledged a letter written to him by a banished mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, M. <hi>Iohn Sharp,</hi> requesting liberty to serue God in his own countrey, and offering to submit himselfe in all things. But the letter was neither read nor seen. O, sayd he, I know when some of you are banished, and others deprived, yee will blame us, and call us persecuters; but we will lay all the burden upon the King. And if you call him a persecuter, all the world wil stand up against you.</p>
            <p>After his owne speach, he required <hi>Doctor Young</hi> to speak, if so be, hee had intention or commission to that effect. The Doctor after his preface of insinuation, layd out the proceedings of the last assembly holden at <hi>S. Androes,</hi> the taunt and reproches brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed out at Court against the same: his Maiesties high displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure kindled by occasion thereof, like a flame of fire ready to consume all, except it were quenched in this present assembly by condiscending to the fiue articles. Hee taxed the state of our Church, whereof he was ignorant. It pleased his wisdom to bring in the Puritan and the Papist, like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> conspiring <hi>Si non contra Christum Deminum, tamen contra Christum Domini.</hi> In end with words framed for the purpose and uttered in a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning maner, hee went about to catch consent to the fiue articles.</p>
            <p>The ministers defenders of the established order perceiuing the drift of these discourses, and all other meanes to be prepared and disposed for dashing of simple men, modestly required foure things. 1. That none be admitted to vote, but such as are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized with lawfull commission. The Archbishop answered, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Maiesty had written to noble men and Barons willing them to be present at this assembly, if any man had any exception against them, they should be heard. It was replyed that they were not to except against their honorable persons or presence; but earnestly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rave that the order of the Church might be observed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is provided that without commission none haue place to vote in generall assemblies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the liberty of the Church be not broken in the election of the Moderator, and that a lawfull lite be made to that effect. It was answered by the Archbishop that, this Assembly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7885:6"/>
within the bounds of his diocesse he would understand who will take his province over his head. So he intruded him selfe in the Moderators office without election.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the articles proponed in short and generall summes, might be put in forme, and amply extended as his Majesty would haue them inacted, that they may be the better aduised and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. The pretended Moderator answered, let alone these toyes, trouble us not with needlesse questions, we shall speak of these things in the priuy conference.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That some of either opinion may be set apart to collect, and put in order the reasons of either side for the more sure &amp; easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the assemblies. The pretended moderator reiected this also as impertinent.</p>
            <p>He proceeded at his owne pleasure without advice or informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the provinces or presbyteries to the nomination of the priuy conference, before that the Clark had received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions. Hee nominated besides his Majesties commissioners, their assessours and the noble men, all the Barons except three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Bishops, the Commissioners of <hi>Edinburgh, Perth, Dundie,</hi> 37 Doctours and other ministers. The most parte was such, as were already resolved to yeeld. Others were not experienced in the state of our Church, some few of the other opinion were taken in, to try the force of their arguments in private, that in publick they might either be evaded, or suppressed. After the said nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the conference was appointed to convein at 3. afternoone and the assembly at 8. hours in the morning. So endeth the first session.</p>
            <p>The conference convenied at 3. afternoon. His Majesties let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was read again. The Moderator aforesaid seconded the same with many terrours. To make them goe quickly to worke, he affirmed that foure articles were already concluded in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies holden last at <hi>Aberdine</hi> and <hi>S. Andrewes</hi> respectiue, howbeit not in forme as his Maiesty required: that kneeling allanerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to be consented unto. For assisting of his declaration a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute was read containing the poynts conferred upon at the places foresayd. And no further evidence was produced for probation of the alledged agreement. But particularly mention was made, that his Highnesse altogether refused cautions and conditions added by the said Assemblies as frustrations of his Highnesse intentions. And as was affirmed by the said Moderator, his Maiestie was still offended at that Assembly holden at S. <hi>Andrewes.</hi> For removing of that offence the Moderator aforesaid would haue had the Article of kneeling voted in the conference without reasoning. But after much businesse and earnest dealing, the said Article by plurality of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7885:6"/>
votes was put to reasoning. For clearing the state of the question, the Ministers defenders of the established order, required againe that the sayd Articles might be extended to the full, and put in perfect forme. 2. That the party of the other iudgement, would proue them necessary and expedient for our Church, according to the revealed rule, <hi>Affirmanti incumbit probatio</hi>: or otherwaies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our former order already established, as defectiue, superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or confused. 3. That time and place might be granted to all, having calling and interest to reason freely, and heare reasoning in presence of the Assembly for their better direction. 4. That the reasons of moment might be proponed and answered in writing, and some few of either side appointed to put them in due forme and order.</p>
            <p>The Moderator notwithstanding of the reference of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the privy conference, reiected them: and as for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pursuer, and party defender in the reasoning, he determined by himselfe, that the Ministers defenders of the established order must either proue the Articles to be impious and unlawfull, or else they must proue disobedient to his Maiesty. It was replied, That poore subiects neither ought, nor conveniently could dispute a question so affected with disobedience to their Soveraigne, as was there alledged. But if reformation be intended, and the truth of the Articles proponed be sincerely to be searched so farre forth as they may proue good and expedient for this Church; the order agreed upon by his Maiestie at <hi>Perth</hi> 1597. cannot of reason be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, viz. That matters touching reformation of external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be proponed, <hi>ordine &amp; decenter animo aedificandi, non tentandi,</hi> for searching the truth the undoubted ground of true unity. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of whatsoever could be alledged, the Ministers stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for their possession, were forced to be persuers, and either to obiect against the said Articles, or else to be reputed disobedient to his Maiesty, and to haue no reason on their side. The time being spent, some few reasons were alledged by the Ministers, which were cut off rather by cavilling and quarrelling at mens persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then solidly answered. The conference was appointed in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at eight houres, notwithstanding the said houre had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the second Session of the Assembly.</p>

               <p>THE privy conference convened at 8 houre in the morning. Much time was spent with the Bishops discourses, and other preparations for making way to summary reasoning. Some
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7885:7"/>
few Arguments were proponed by the Ministers against kneeling in the act of receiving the sacramentall elements of bread and wine; but answered as before. The pretended Moderator to cut off reasoning instantly required, that kneeling might bee voted in the conference. The Ministers alledged that the proper use of the conference is to prepare and put in order matters that are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in the face of the Assembly; and therefore required that the Articles might be formed: and after long debait it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by plurality of votes, that they should be formed. The rest of this short time was spent in naming of Bishops and Doctors for forming and extending the Articles and Acts that were to passe thereupon. The conference was appointed to conveine at 4. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone.</p>
               <p>The Assembly being frustrate of their diet in the morning, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at 4. afternoone at the call of the Bell, by the Moderators ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. He shewed unto them, that that houre was appointed for the conference allanerly. But seeing they conveined, hee thought good to make known to them, that the foure Article<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> formerly condescended upon at <hi>Aberdine</hi> and S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> as also the fift Article against kneeling, after long reasoning were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the conference, and ordained to be formed and produced before them. And so hee desired them to depart to the end that matters might be exped, for ending the Assembly the morne. But opposition was made in the contrary, that kneeling was not voted, and the other foure Articles were neither reasoned nor voted. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the removall of the Assembly, the act of kneeling as it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was read in presence of the conference, The pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator urged that kneeling should be voted. It was answerd, that it was an intolerable novelty in this Church, a great prejudice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, purposes, and priviledges, and a presumptuous usurpation of a few to vote and conclude under the colourable pretence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, matters of weight belonging to the whole Church. They required therefore that according to order, reasoning and voting might be reserved to the full Assembly. The pretended Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor answered, First, that it was the custome of the Lords, of the Articles in parliament to proceed after that manner. Next, that he would not spare to commit twenty preiudices to please the King. And thus kneeling was put in voting without regard of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and concluded by plurality of votes. The rest of this short time was spent in talking upon Symony, the planting of the Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and order to bee taken with beggars. The conference appointed the Assembly to conveine the morne after Sermon.</p>

               <head>Thursday <hi>27.</hi> Aug. the third day of the Assembly.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WIlliam,</hi> B. of <hi>Galloway</hi> made a Sermon, his Text <hi>Rom·</hi> 14.19. His doctrine was far contrary to that which he taught before the estates of Parliament <hi>An.</hi> 1606 He set at naught the ancient order of our Church, sometime highly commended by himselfe, and extolled his new light. He presumed to teach them a new kinde of Catechisme, under whom he himselfe might be as yet catechised. The second and last Session of this assembly began after dinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ended this day.</p>
               <p>The Kings Commissioners, and the Bishops, masters of this Assemblie, determined to end all this after noone: and hauing the assise enclosed for that effect, assured them that out of that house they should not go untill his Majestie were satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of his desire. The pretended Moderator earnestly aggread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the nncessity of yeelding and instantly urged present voting without furder delay strongly enforcing, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie behoved to bee satisfied, and assureing them, that his Highnesse would accept of no other answer but yeelding. To effectuate his purpose, hee blew out many threatnings in most peremptory maner. Hee insulted uppon the ministers assembled, as if they had been hirelinges, saying, I know you all well ynough. There is neuer a one of you will suffer so much as the losse of your stipends for the matter. Think not but when the act is made I will get obedience of you. There is none of you that voteth in the contrary mindeth to suffer. Some men, said hee, pretend conscience and feare more to offend the people then the King: but all that will not doe the turne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had formerly affirmed in the case of requiring consent, that although the act were made, his Majestie would be mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in vrgeing obedience thereto. And they knew him to be more fauourable to his brethren then any <hi>Bishop of England.</hi> Hee tooke it also vpon his conscience, though it was not trew that there was neither lass nor ladde rich nor poore in <hi>Scotland</hi> some few precise persons excepted, who were not onlie content but also wished that order of kneeling to be receiued: whereof he had profe and experience in his own citie of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and in this Town since he came hither. Hee made mention of a pamphlet casten in the pulpit at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> wherein it should haue been affirmed, that the Bishops were bringing in Papistry, and that good professors will fight in defence of their own reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. By way of answer thereto, he confessed that the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7885:8"/>
make not the separation betwixt us and the Romane Church, but their Idolatry, the which if the Romanists would forsake, they would meet them mid-way, and ioyne with them. And as if the Ministers had known any such professors disposed to fight for the religion, or had been of purpose to ioyne with them, he disswades them to leane to such words, for he had seen the like of that before time at the 17. day of December. Hee wished if such a thing should happen, it would please his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to make him a Captaine, never any of these braggers would come to the field.</p>
               <p>After these blasts and terrours, the Ministers with modest importunity insisted that the matters depending might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cleared by further reasoning and advisement; so much the rather, because these matters had not been reasoned in full As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, for the information of all that had interest. After much dealing, and many earnest speeches and desires to be heard, some fashion of liberty was granted to a few, but with such checkes and limitations to the partie that preased to propone and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that quickly they were cut off and sourely rebuked, rather borne downe with authority, then satisfied with reason. His Maiesties chiefe Commissioner, &amp; pretended Moderator, straitly enioyned them either to propone a new reason, or else to hold their peace, when as the argument either had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in conference; or if proponed, not answered; or if answered, not suffered to be replied unto. And suppose all this had been done in the conference, yet all was new to the full Assembly, and ought to haue been repeated and fully discussed for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all voters. Yea many Ministers had not so much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> accesse to heare or propone one argument: they had no seates provided for them, as the other party had: Gentlemen thronged in before them. The defenders of the Articles were permitted to discourse as long as they pleased, to gybe, mocke, and cavill, so light account made they of the matters in hand, or the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full schisme ensuing upon such disorders, that their behaviour was offensiue to the beholders. The best arguments and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers were taken from the authority of the Kings sword. Hee will ranverse all, except we yeeld; or the authority of his word; as when it was alledged out of <hi>Zanchius</hi> upon the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that things indifferent abused to Idolatry should be altogether removed. The pretended Moderator opponed the iudgement of the King of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> to the iudgement of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> or any of the learned. In a word, the pretended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator professed plainly, that neither their reasons nor their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7885:8"/>
number should carry away the matter. These Articles must be concluded, and should be concluded, although there were none but the eleven Bishops, with the authority of his Maiesties Commissioners, they shall impose them. After some few rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons proponed and answered, as is said, it was confessed, that if his Maiesty could haue been pleased, or put off, they would haue reasoned against these Articles, and the introducing of them in this Church. Doctor <hi>Lyndesay</hi> being posed in conscience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that they had neither reason, nor Scripture, nor Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them, yet to avert rhe Kings wrath of this Church, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was best. Kneeling was chiefly agitate. Some velitation there was made against Holy dayes. Nothing spoken of the three other Articles, boasting and posting confounded all.</p>
               <p>The ministers not being permitted to reason and pursue their arguments verbally with such liberty, as of reason should haue been granted, and fearing prejudice in voting, gaue in some difficulties in writing, to be considered and removed, before the articles should passe in voting, like as they were ready, if place had been granted to present in writing particular reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst every one of the said articles, as was plainly professed. But for cutting them short of that intention, the presenter of the said difficulties in a bosting manner was commanded to subscribe the same, and rebuked as not haveing commission. They suspected a protestation, against the proceedings of this Assembly, for preventing whereof they had declamed before against the protestation subscribed at the last parliament, as treasonable, and seditious. But when it was perceaved, that he sought a penne for subscribing of the same, the Moderator receaved them. Two of them was read, but no wayes respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the rest were suppressed.</p>
               <p>The ministers notwithstanding of the preceding terrours most humbly and earnestly requested his Majesties Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, that the concluding of the articles might be continued, which their reasons in writing were sent to his Majesty, and answer returned. But this humble request was dispysed.</p>
               <p>Before the roll was called, his Majesties letter was read again in open audience of the said assembly, no doubt to the end the last impression might incline the voters to consent. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters defenders of the established order required againe, that none might haue place to vote, but such as were authorised with lawfull commission: but that order could not be admitted. Yea the pretended Moderator answered, that if al <hi>Scotland</hi> were there present they should haue vote.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:7885:9"/>The question put in voting was thus formed. <hi>Whether will yee consent to these articles, or disobey the King?</hi> the words chosen to distinguish the votes were: <hi>agree: disagree: non liquet.</hi> The question proponed was affected with this strait condition: <hi>he that denyeth one, denieth all.</hi> The question being thus contrived, the Moderator certified them, that whosoever voted against the articles, his name should be marked and given up to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. For gathering the votes, he took the roll in his owne hand from the Clarke, to whom of office it belongs so to marke the votes, that accordingly he may forme the acts truely as his oath and office bindeth him. First were called his highnes commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and their assessours; then the Noblemen, Bishops, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons; then the Doctors and Ministers, last of all the burgesses. The Doctors and Ministers were called on without order. He called first on those, of whom he was assured to be on the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue side without respect of the order of Province or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as for example, the Arch Deacon of <hi>Sanct Androes</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Patrik Galloway</hi> a man of many pensions were ranked with the Ministers of the North. Some wanting commission were called and voted affirmative: diverse others having commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whose negative they were assured; were omitted. In cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the names, he inculcate these and the like words: <hi>haue the King in your mind: remember of the King: looke to the King.</hi> In the end by plurality of votes the fiue articles were concluded and consented unto. 1. Kneeling in the act of receaving the sacramentall elements of bread and wine. 2. five holy dayes: the day of Christs nativity, Passion, Resurection, Ascension, and the Penticost. 3. Episcopall confirmation. 4. Private Baptisme. 5. Private communion. His Majesties Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and their assessors: all the noble men, except one: all the Barons except one: all the Doctors except <hi>D. Strang</hi>: all the Burgesses and a number of Ministers voted affirmative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, one Doctour, and fourty five Ministers voted nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: some few, <hi>non liquet.</hi>

Conforme to this advice, the Emperour answereth as followeth. <hi>By God almighty we favour no party, but shall keep our selues equall to all, no way making necessity in any point.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in this assembly, the necessity of yeelding was inforced vnder no lesse paines then the wrath of authority, imprisonment, exile, deprivation of Ministers, and utter subversion of the estate and order of this Church. Such as by the providence of God had their mouthes opened to reason, were checked, quarrelled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, boasted, interrupted, and for their discouragement, it was plainly professed that neither the reasoning nor the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of voters should carry the matter away. The party defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was forced to persue. The collecting and putting in order of the reasons of either side was refused.</p>
            <p>In free and lawfull assemblies private reasoning is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but it is requisit that there be also free reasoning in publick for the full information of all who haue the right of voting. Nevertheles in this assembly publick reasoning was hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and when it was obtained, it was not full and free to propone, and persue with replyes.</p>
            <p>In all free and lawfull assemblies, humble requests for mature deliberation in maters of great importance hath been heard, &amp; granted. But in this assembly humble supplication for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation till matters were more ripely considered, or till his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties answer was returned to the petition of the defenders of the established order, was peremptorily refused.</p>

In all free and lawfull As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies good advisements hath been heard &amp; followed. But in this Assemblie some difficulties presented in writing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and removed before the voting, were peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>In all free and lawfull Assemblies publick voting should be

free of all terrours according to the rule, <hi>nihil consensui tam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium est, quam vis atque metus quem comprobare contra bonos mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res est.</hi> Nevertheles in this Assemblies, his Majesties letters were read the fourth time, immediatly before the publick vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to move the Assemblie. The pretended Moderator threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to mark their names who dissented, and breathed out many terrours and threatnings, and so he made good in publicke, that which he profest in private, that he would commit twenty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices to further his Majesties purpose.</p>
            <p>In all free and lawfull Assemblies the estate of the question to be voted, ought to be so formed that it carry with it no danger. Nevertheles in this Assembly the matter to be voted was proponed with sensible danger, <hi>agree, or be reputed disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Majestie,</hi> that is, either make a constitution to bind all Ministers, and professours of this reformed Kirk to returne to these fiue articles which they haue vomited, or else yee shall be reputed disobedient.</p>
            <p>As the acts which are to passe in voting should be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in number: cleare in order, particularly expressed from point to point, because they should contein directions of certain actions to be performed, &amp;c. So the matters offered to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting should be distinctly, clearly, and particularly proponed. Nevertheles in this Assembly all was shut up in a confused cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>a multis interrogatis,</hi> and voted at once voting in one sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Iustly therefore may their conclusions be called <hi>Leges Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all free Assemblies such order is observed in calling the names of the voters, that no publick prejudice be committed. Nevertheles in this Assembly neither the accustomed order of Provinces, nor Presbyteries was observed; but such were called on first, as were knowne to be affirmative voters, to discourage and disperse the negatives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo</hi> sayeth Epist. 25. that some that came to the Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were rejected, and others were brought in who at the pleasure of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> were brought to yeeld captiue hands to their impious subscriptions. For they knew it would be preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to their estate, unlesse they did such things as were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. It is <hi>crimine falsi</hi> in gathering of votes, either to passe by them, who haue place and power to vote, or to admit such as are not lawfullie authorized. Nevertheles in this Assemblie not only were some past by who were knowen resolued to vote negative, but diverse others also disposed to vote affirmatiue were admitted, or rather brought in without commission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7885:11"/>In all free and lawfull Assemblies, not onely Ministers, but all others of whatsoeuer rank, ought to be authorized, with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, or els they haue not the power of voting. Neuertheles in this Assembly, persons of all ranks not authorized with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, were admitted to vote, as may be seen by the induction following.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased his Maiesty in former times to send but some few Commissioners in his Highnesse absence, to concurre with the Assembly, and to propone his Highnesse desire thereunto, &amp;c. Neverthelesse in this Assembly, not onely his Maiesties Commissioners, but also their Assessours gaue euery one vote, whereas his Maiesties selfe being present; never clamed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then the power of one vote.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in Iuly 1568. it was ordained that Barons should be chosen Commissioners in Synodall assemblies. At <hi>Dundie</hi> in March 1597. after the full establishment of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, it was appoynted in presence of his Maiestie, that Barons should be chosen Commissioners with consent of Presbyteries, and that one Baron onely should be directed out of the bounds of a Presbytery. Neverthelesse in this Assembly, the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Barons had neither commission according to the old act, nor according to the new.</p>
            <p>In the yeare of God 1568. it was ordained that Burgesses should be chosen Commissioners by the Councell and Kirke-session of their Burgh coniunctly. And in the yeare 1597. that they should be chosen with consent of the Presbytery. Item, that every Burgh haue power to direct but one Commissioner, except <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to whom it was permitted to direct two. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse in this Assembly, neither of the said acts were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Montrose</hi> 1600. it was statuted and ordained, that none of them who shall haue vote in Parliament in the name of the Church, shall come as Commissioners to the generall Assembly, nor haue any vote in the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlesse they be authorized with commission from their own Presbyteries to that effect. This act was never repealed, no not at the pretended assembly holden at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> but by the said assembly they stand countable to every generall assembly for their proceedings. Howbeit the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were spoyled of their authority in many things at the sayd pretended assembly: yet of the power of election of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners they were not spoyled. Neither is there any other order of election of Commissioners, and constitution of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the assembly set down by any act of our Kirke, their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7885:12"/>
was established <hi>Anno</hi> 1597. Nevertheles in this assembly, they not onely presented themselues without commission, but sate as Lords over-ruling it. They had practised the ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the established lawes before they were proponed to the Assembly, they ought therefore to haue been secluded and sharply censured; but they usurped the place both of Iudge and party.</p>
            <p>At S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> in Aprill 1582. it was thought expedient that Presbyteries should not be astricted to direct their Moderator in commission, but whom they iudged fittest for the purpose. That constant Moderators should be constant members of the generall assembly, is a forged clause foysted in an act of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended assembly holden at <hi>Linlithquow</hi> the yeare of God 1606. The which assembly neither the Church then did, nor the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops now will stand to. Nevertheles in this assembly, some Moderators of Presbyteries voted without election, and onely by vertue of the forged clause of the act aforesayd. If any Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery directed their Moderators in commission upon igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and errour, having respect to the forged clause aforesayd. Their ignorance and errrour is not lawfull consent. It is in the meane time to be remembred, that the present Moderators are not of the quality of these constant Moderators, but of a new Edition set out at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> viz. They are the Bishops Deputes placed by them in Presbyteries.</p>
            <p>The Assessours to his Maiesties Commissioners, the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Barons, Bishops, Burgesses, and Moderators imposed upon Presbyteries with some Ministers voting without warrant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing substracted from the number of affirmatiue voters, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues will not be found inferior in number to the affirmatiues authorized with commission. And suppose inferiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, yet not in weight, for the negatiue voters adhered to the iudgement of the Church, heard no reasons for the novelties proponed, were not overcome with perswasions or terrours, as was the affirmatiues.</p>
            <p>The affirmatiue voters authorized with commission, either had their commissions procured by their Bishops, or else were mercenary Pensionars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Plat-servers for augmentation of sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: or gapers for promotion: or of suspect credit for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite received or hoped for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or had subscrybed other private Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in private more dangerous then the present Articles: or had been threatned privatly by their owne diocesian Bishops with deposition: or were not well informed in their judgment for lack of full and free reasoning: or were circumvented with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7885:12"/>
promises made to them, by theit Bishops, that they should not be urged with the practize, if they would only consent to make an act to please the King: or were terrified with the publick threatnings before mentioned. Iudge therfore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their votes should be pondered or numbered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In omnil us causis pro facto accipitur id in quo quis alium terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facit quo minus fiat.</hi> In this Assembly the affirmatiue voters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that they assented not <hi>simpliciter</hi> to the Articles proponed as knowing truths, but onely to avert the wrath of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, standing in their owne Iudgment against them, and not for them, in respect of the estate of this church. Hence it may be clearely seene that their votes were only affirmatiue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their feare, but negatiue in respect of their iudgment, and duetifull affection to this Church.</p>
            <p>Other informalites may be observed, but these are sufficient to proue the nullity of this pretended Assembly whereby the established estate of this Church is so farre prejudged, or rather simple people for their facility indangered, if they upon the pretended authority of this Assembly shall adventure to make defection from their former profession confirmed by so many and well advised Assemblies, and blessed by the experience of Gods great loue in his best benefites, or to violate their solemne oath, and subscription. The pretender may as safely professe that he wil alter his profession, or violate his oath, and subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, suppose there had been no Assembly at all. But to detaine simple people in their bygaine revolt, it will be cryed out and inculcat that some few persons (and to make them odious they wilbe called mall-contents, troublers of the estate, seditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and what not? for the which contumelies and reproches account must be made one day) that they may not, nor should not iudge upon the nullity of the Assemblies. It is trew by way of iurisdiction or superordination (as they call it) no private man should presume so to doe, for that iudgment belongeth to another free, and lawfull Assembly. But by the iudgment of discretion every christian man ought to iudge how matters of religion are imposed upon him, and by what authority. If thou mayst not discerne as a iudge, thou mayst discern as a Christian. If yee shall admit indifferently whatsoever is concluded under the glorious name of an Assembly, then may wee be brought to admit not only the English ceremonies, but also Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, and Papistry. If Ministers giue way to their Parochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to practize the obtruded Ceremonies at their pleasures. If sworne professors intangle themselues againe with the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7885:13"/>
whereof the Lord hath made them free, let the one and the other take heed how they defend themselues from the iust challenge of back slyding, and the rest of the inconveniences, that may ensue on their change.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament by acts, authorize matters affected with such informalities, and nullities, matters of themselues so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious to our profession, their ratification of a vitious thing can not be a rule to a Christian manes conscience. But it is to be hoped, that the Lord shall so dispose the hearts of stats-men to the loue of the truth, quietnes of the Church and Country, and peace of mens consciences, that no unreasonable burthen shall be knit upon the members of Christs bodie by any deed of theirs under the name of a benifit to the Church. <hi>Invito benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium non datur.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 The articles proponed, if they be concluded, they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouate and bring under the slander of change the estate of this Church, so advisedlie established by Ecclesiasticall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, acts of parliament, approbation of other Kirkes, and good likeing of the best reformed christians without and within this kingdom, and so evidentlie blessed with happie successe and

sensible experience of Gods greatest benefits by the space of 58 yeares, and aboue; so that wee may boldlie say to the praise of God that no Church hath injoyed the trueth and puritie of religion in larger libertie. And vpon some such considerations, it pleased his gratious Majestie to continew the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in her established estate, as may be seen in the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, and <hi>Thomas Sparke</hi> his booke written there vpon. <hi>Ipsa quippe mutatio, etiam quae adiuvat utilitate novitate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbat: quapropter quae utilis non est, perturbatione infructuosa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequenter noxia est,</hi> sayeth <hi>Augustine</hi> Epist. 118.

            <p>THE Religion, Doctrine, and Discipline received, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and defended by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and namely the publick ministration of Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, sitting at the table in the act of the receiving the bread and wine of that Sacrament, the observation of the Lords day, and the examination of children, for the first time at the ninth yeare of their age, for the second at the twelfth, for the third at the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, excluding and abhorring private baptisme, private com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, kneeling in the act of receiving the Supper, holy dayes, or feasts of Christmas, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and sending down of the Holy Ghost: were brought in at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion, and enioyed ever since in manner and forme as followes.</p>
            <p>After due tryall and advisement taken of the heads in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and particular aboue written, the whole Church was of one heart and iudgement concerning the same, and every man was permitted to heare reasoning, and such as would were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reason, every man professed himselfe to be perswaded in his own minde.</p>
            <p>The particulars to be embraced and followed, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be avoyded, were by Ecclesiasticall authority in free, full, and lawfull generall Assemblies, publicke confessions, and solemne protestations aduisedly established.</p>
            <p>The estates of Parliament agreeing in iudgement with the Kirk concerning the said matters by their acts ratified and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Kirk constitutions, and appoynted civill penalties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the transgressors of the same, with prouision of order whereby they might be called, convicted, and punished.</p>
            <p>The sayd unity of iudgement authorized by the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Kirk, and lawes of the Countrey, and the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars established by these bands, having been tried by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and otherwayes, haue proved expedient, profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary by the space of fiftie nine yeares, and now iustly haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the force of good and commendable custome.</p>
            <p>For our furder confirmation of the sayd religion, doctrine, and discipline in generall, and in the particulars before named, all and every one of all estates of this Realme haue solemnly sworn, that they shall continue in the obedience of the doctrine and discipline of this Church, and shall defend the same accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <hi>Queritur,</hi> if one or moe Preachers or Professours in the sayd Kirk, standing to the Kirkes former iudgement; and able to defend the same by good reason, at least seeing no warrant in the contrary, may dispense with the sayd oath, or follow the plurality of preachers, &amp; professors dispensing with the same in the assembly. And what power may compell the alteration of iudgement, or loose the sayd oath in any case aforesayd? Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the full answer to the wise and well reformed Christian walking before God, and looking for a crown upon the glorious day of our Lord.

            <p>The persons takers of the oath are all baptised Christians of perfect age, able to examine themselues, and so to eate of the Lords Supper, honoured with callings, and all professours of Christian fellowship, of Christ the searcher of hearts, and of life and iudgement eternall, free of madnesse, and of all restraint of superiour power in this case, understanding periury and the paines thereof, at their owne liberty, and free of all coaction: as at length may be seene in the confessions of faith registred in the Acts of Parliament, printed in the booke of Discipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmes in meeter, the confession of faith subscribed by the Kings Maiesty and his houshold, published by open proclamation and yet standing in print.

            <p>Before and at the tyme of their solemne protestations, it was well knowen to all the promisers, Swearers, Subscribers, that 1. At <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 18. day of Octob. 1581. And from the reformation to that year it was resolued, and by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7885:17"/>
concluded that in tyme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming no sacrament be ministred in priuate houses, but solmnely according to the good order hitherto obserued. 2. At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in Ianu. 1560. it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this Kirk that Christ sat with his disciples at a table, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he instituted the supper, and that sitting at table was the most convenient gesture to this holy action. 3. That the Popes fiue bastard sacraments, whereof Confirmation is one, with all rites ceremonies and false doctrines added to the ministration of the sacraments were abhored. And that examination of children, aftet the maner agreed vpon in the Kirk, was sufficient to unite baptized infants with the Kirk in the participation of the Lords Supper. 4. That at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in Ianuar. 1560. the Kirk judged vtterlie to be abolished from this Realm, keeping of holy dayes such as the feast of Christmas &amp;c. Imposed vpon the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men without warrant of Gods word, and many other things of the like nature condemned by preaching, and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by publick censures of the Kirk. Hence it is euident that no exception can be taken against the persons promising, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and subscribing, for despensing with the said oath.</p>
            <p>The matter whereunto they bind themselues by oath is the religion, doctrine and discipline receiued, beleeued and defended by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In respect of this matter, the oath is partlie assertorie, and partly promissorie. They affirme as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. 1. That it is Gods vndoubted truth and veritie grounded onelie vpon his written word. 2. That it pleaseth God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth salvation to man. 3. That they are now throughly resolued in this truth. 4. That they detest all vain allegories, rites, signes and traditions brought into the Kirk without, or against the word of God and Doctrine of this true reformed Kirk. Such assertions can not be loosed, an assertorie oath can not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with, for it is already past. <hi>Assertorij juramenti materia in necessitatem transijt.</hi> They haue all alreadie sworne that they are persuaded in their consciences in the points aforesaid. This persuasion is not to be performed, but is already past and sworne. We can not therefore go in the contrary except we will be perjured. The promissory part is, <hi>to continew in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, or to defend the same.</hi> The indurance of the said continuance and defence is <hi>all the dayes of our liues.</hi> The execration whereby they inforce the truth and promise of their oath is, <hi>under the paines contained in the law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearfull judgement.</hi> This continuance and defence in respect of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the matter affirmed, and of the nature of an oath and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7885:18"/>
promise, and in respect of the indurance, and execration adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, leaveth no place to alledge the events of posterior accidents incident to the matter sworne to, to loose or dispense with the said oath, or promise, as it may be clearly seene in the nature of an oath.</p>
            <p>The formes whereby the foresaid persones are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and defend the said religion are 1. Publick profession before God and the world 2. Printed and published confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. Subscription. 4. Obedience to the lawes of the Country. 5. Christian subjection to the order of the Kirk. 6. The solemne covenant. lastly. The oath. All these formes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all people, but specially amongst Christians are reputed for strong bands. If wee consider the zeale of our Christians to God and his trueth, the oath may be called <hi>juramentum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionis,</hi> the oath of affection. If their willingnes to cleaue to their bretheren in sincerity of profession it is <hi>voluntarium et quasi conventionale,</hi> it is voluntary, and as it were by paction. If their loyalty to his maiesty and reverent obedience to the Kirk it is <hi>judiciale,</hi> an oath before a Iudge. If suspition or any other sort of undutifulnes, it is <hi>Purgativum,</hi> an oath of purgation. If the fulnes of the forme, it is not simple, but componed, haueing a most fearfull execration expressed. If yee consider the matter sworne to, viz. The religion, Doctrine, and discipline, as it is affirmed for undoubted trueth, it is <hi>assertorium,</hi> an assertory oath. If the continuance in defence of the doctrine and discipline, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory, Whereby the particular acts of their future continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and defence are bound to be established in religion, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and discipline. In respect of the which establishment and future continuance and defence, it is a thing bygone, and past <hi>in rem judicatam,</hi> worthy of the said continuance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but nowayes subject to the changes accessory to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by oath addebted to these duties. The matter affirmed in this oath, concerneth God, our brethren and the rest of our own soules in the course of profession. The duty that wee performe to God, is to take him to be Iudge and witnesse of our sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and constancy of our profession. The duty that wee doe to our neighbours is to put them in assurance of our brotherly disposition and carriage in the communion of Sanicts. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and the ease that we bring to our selues is, that we lay, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The force and effect of this forme being considered in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7885:18"/>
persons swearers upon whom God principally hath laid the law of swearing, should be a strong cord to restrain us from the variable inconstancy and customable changes that falleth in the world for the reasons following. 1. An oath is the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cord, whereby we are bound to sacred verity, and the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing knife whereby we cut away superfluous controversies. 2. The effect of an oath is a most solemne and sure obligation, and therefore by the consent of all the Doctors the oathes of compulsion, and hurtfull, in matters prestable, and not impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are to be keept. 3. A lawfull oath by God alone may be loosed, who is the chief CVI for whose sake it is taken. 4. It is a note of the Antichrist to dispense with oathes. It was well said, that dispensations <hi>nihil aliud sunt quam legum vulnera.</hi> What is more religious in religion then an oath? What shalbe the force of bands or contracts? with what coards shall societies be knit if men shalbe freed from their lawfull oaths, or rather forced to violate them?</p>
            <p>To elude the oath the temporizer objecteth that all oathes of inferiors are made, <hi>salvo jure superiorum,</hi> seeing therefore the King &amp; the Kirk, our superiours, haue made those innovations, wee are freed of our oath, so far as innovation is made. Answer, that an oath made by the inferior, with knowledge and consent of the Superiour can not afterward be loosed by the Superiour. The Canonist giveth this example, a scholer is sworne to his Creditor not to departe from the schoole beyond the boundes and limits agreed on betwixt him and the creditor, before he make payment at the appointed day, his father commands him to returne home. If he contracted the debt for his study, he had the tacite consent of his father. For setting him to schole, he did assent to all necessaries serving for his studies. The father here is by his owne tacite consent spoiled of his authoritie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling his sonne. But farre more when he geueth his expresse consent. In the present case, wee had the consent both of the King our father, and the Church our mother, yea they went before us in example, subscribed, and sworne the Confession aforesaid themselues. The Bishop of <hi>Elie</hi> in <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Torti</hi> answering to <hi>Matheus Tortus</hi> adviseing his Majestie to graunt libertie of conscience hath these words, Pag. 81.82. <hi>Integrum jam hoc illi non est: nam quod cum ea qua decet reuerentia dictum volo, non semel perjurus sit, sed bis si te audiat.

If his Maiesty may not permit another forme of Gods worship then that which was received already, nor the use of Papisticall rites, farre lesse in the Bishops iudgement, may his Maiesty inioyne, or command other formes and rites. As for our other Superiour, the Kirk, it cannot be denied but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all estates haue subscribed and sworne since the yeare of God 1580. The oath and subscription was universall <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. 1581. 1582. <hi>&amp; anno</hi> 1590. When the generall band was made for the maintenance of true Religion, and his Maiesties state and person. The said confession was published with the generall band, and subscribed. So againe <hi>anno</hi> 1596. when the covenant was renewed in the generall Assembly, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Assemblies, in Presbyteries and particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the oath was universall. Besides the universall oathes and subscriptions, upon divers occasions, some particular persons at divers times haue subscribed. So, a particular rank of persons, as for example schollers passing their degrees, since the yeare 1587. subscribed and swore the confession of their faith at their <hi>Laurocation.</hi> In like manner, every Burgesse at his admission pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested before God to defend the religion then professed and authorized by the Lawes, to his liues end. In like manner, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Presbyteries, and Synods of late yeares: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The Ministers of the Synod of <hi>Lowthian</hi> assembled at <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anno</hi> 1604. subscribed the confession of faith. The two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Archbishops now liuing, were present and subscribed with the rest of their bretheren. Any man may see, that few are excepted, who haue not made their personall oath. And least any man think himself exemed, let him consider that the generall Assembly, the Kirke representatiue made a solemne oath by holding up their hands, at the renewing of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant anno 1596.

The yong ones were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in our oath: for the Parents did binde for them, when they were baptised, to bring them up in the confession of faith, as it was then professed in the Kirk, as grounded upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant unto the covenant of grace made betwixt God and men for themselues and for their seed. So yee see the oath of the Kirke of <hi>Scotland</hi> was partly personall and partly reall. Is any Assembly, never so lawfull, free, and formall, able to free us of this oath, let be a pretended Assembly, disturbed, and divided in it selfe, and drawing down in one session, these things which were builded up in many yeares, and by many famous and notable Assemblies, consenting in one heart. But as I haue sayd, our oath was with consent of the Assembly and Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Seeing we are sworne severally, how can the same persons assembled together in one body collectiue, dispense with this oath, seeing they haue sworn to defend during their liues. To consent to any alteration, is not to defend during their liues, but rather to betray the cause, and incurre perjurie. If they may not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their oath assembled collectiue, farre lesse may a generall assembly representing onely the collectiue body free them of their oath, least of a null and unlawfull Assembly.</p>
            <p>They alledge they haue not violated their oath, because the substance of Religion is kept, and onely some indifferent points altered. But I answer. First that an oath cannot be said to be kept, vnlesse it be kept in all the parts and contents, and in the forme and manner expressed, <hi>Nam juramentum servandum est in forma specifica.</hi> Wee swore to keepe the same forme or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that was vsed in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and specialie in the use of the sacraments. This specification (the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi>) admitteth neither English, <hi>Lutherane,</hi> nor Romane rites in the worship of God different from our profession. Next our oath was in a matter of religion which is not changeable as statutes of republicks and corporations are. And euery point of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a faith is a note of profession, whereby wee professe our selues to be distinguished either in substance, or puritie of religion from others. Confessions of faith should not be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as <hi>Hilarius</hi> complained of his tymes <hi>Annuas &amp; menstruas fides de Deo decernimus.</hi> Thirdly put the case, the points of our profession that are innouated were matters indifferent, as they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7885:20"/>
were not so vnderstoode at the tymes of our oathes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, but were declamed against, as points of plain papist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, yet seeing indifferent things abjured for their abuse may not be receiued how can wee receiue them, except it were proued, that our oath was at the begining vnlawfull; or that our former formes are become vnlawfull, not expedient for edification of the Kirk, Or lesse edificatiue then the ceremonies presently vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. It was plainely confessed in the last pretended Assembly, that they were not expedient for our Kirk, &amp; that they yeelded to hold off an outward and externall inconvenience, a matter uncertaine and depending in the effect vpon Gods providence yea a matter now denied, as importing tyrannie for so is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, reported. In rhe meane tyme our assertorie oath is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie past, and wee become perjured if wee come in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This is a high degree of perjury, when not onely we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travein our oath by practise, but make Lawes in the contrary, and thereafter inveigh against our oath as Puritanisme. If sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and constant professours shall be still pursued for their constancie in their profession, and the conscience they make of their oath: Do we not expone the whole Nation to a woefull vengeance, and perpetuall ignominy.</p>

the blessed body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ; like as the most humble and reverend gesture of the body in our meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lifting up of our hearts, best becommeth so divine and sacred an action.

                  <p>THE manner of Christs proceeding, from the paschall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Eucaristicall, is to be observed, for the better understanding of the Institution. Before and in the dayes of Christ, the Paschall supper consisted, of two services or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and a conclusion.</p>
                  <p>After the ordinary washing of their hands, they sat downe to the first service, and eate the Paschall lamb with unleavened bread.

In the conclusion of the second service of the Paschall supper, the Lord of the house took an unleavened cake of bread and blessed it, after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Blessed art thou o Lord our God, King of the World, who hast

sanctified us by thy precepts, and hast given us a commandement concerning the eating of unleavened bread.</hi> Christ likewise took the bread and gaue thanks. The Lord of the house, after thanks-giving brake the bread, and gaue it unto the company, saying, <hi>This is the bread of misery, which our fathers eat in Egipt: whosoever hungreth let him come neare and eat, whosoever hath need, let him come neare and celebrate the Passeover.</hi> Christ after thanks-giving brak the bread, and gaue it to his disciples, saying, <hi>take yee, eat yee, this is my body that is broken for you.</hi> Therafter the Lord of the house tooke the cup, and blessed it after this manner. <hi>Blessed art thou O Lord who hast created the fruit of the vine,</hi> after he had tasted the cup he gaue it to the nearest and so it was caried from hand to hand. This cup was called, the cup of praise and thanks-giving, because they sung a Psalme after it.

                  <p>The first breach of the institution made by kneeling, is the taking away of that commendable gesture of sitting, used by Christ and his Apostles, at, and after the Institution. Christ and his Apostles sate at table, after the forme of their usuall sitting at ordinary bankets and feastes. They sat at the first service of the Paschall supper. <hi>Baradius, Swarez, Iansenius,</hi> and others affirme, that there is no circumstance in the text, Exod. 12, to inforce standing at the Passeover. Next, suppose the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there expressed did import standing, yet it was not inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an ordinary rite, but as many other circumstances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed only to the first Passeover in <hi>Egipt,</hi> as to eate with haste, and with loynes girded up, and to sprinkle the lintill and two sideposts of the doore with blood, as <hi>Beza</hi> hath observed <note n="d" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>That sitting was institute, I proue it by two reasones. First, the gesture that Christ retained in passing from the conclusion of the Paschall Supper, that he did institute: sitting he retained, therefore sitting he did institute. In the conclusion of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Supper some things were changed, other things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, a third sort were neither changed, nor retained as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the institution, but onely of occasionall necessitie which could not conveniently be changed, but were done necessarly: as for exemple, vnlevened bread because there was no other, the circumstance of the time, the parlour and such other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances belonging to the Passeouer, they were retained of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, by reason of the present occasion of the Paschall Supper and could not conveniently haue bene changed. But as for the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7885:22"/>
gesture of sitting, he might haue changed it, in standing, or kneeling without working any miracle, if it had not been his minde that we should receaue the sacrament of the Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Supper, with the same gesture the Iewes receaued the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Supper. The second reason, we are bound to imitate Christ, and the commendable example of his Apostles, in all things wherein it is not evident, that they had speciall reasones mouing them thereto which doe not concerne vs. Yea it is grosse hypocrisie for us, to pretend more reuerence and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the act of receving, then the Apostles did when Christ was present, or the Apostolick Kirks did lately after the Institution. Wherefore doth the Apostle propone the custom of the first Kirks. 1. Cor. 11.16. 1. Cor. 14.33. 2. Tim. 3, 14. If they did not oblige us to imitation? When Christ was in the state of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millitie they sate: he was worshiped vpon extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones. Math. 9.18. and 8.2, and 14.33. and 20.20. Ioh. 9.38. they were not now in any common action, or at an ordinary Supper, they had now reason to kneele if they should haue kneeled at all. After his resurrection, when he was in <hi>Emaus</hi> with some of the disciples, it is said Luk. 24, 30. <hi>that as he sat at meate with them, he tooke bread, blessed it, brake it, and gaue it unto them.</hi> This place is interpret of the Sacrament by <hi>Augustine, Paulinus, Esychius, Theophilactus, Beda, Euthimius, Hieronimus,</hi> all aledged by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>

Last of all, after his ascension and glorification in the heauens, the Apostlick Kirk sate at table. The manner of the partaking of the table of devils was by formall sitting at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the house of the Idole:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohnathan</hi> the Chalde paraphrast Amos. 2.8. interpreteth the garments wheron the vsurer sate beside euerie Altar, to haue bene bedds prepared in the houses of their gods, to sit on when they feasted vpon things sacrificed to Idols. The people of Israel sate down to eat and drink at the Idelatrous feast of the golden calfe. The Apostle compareth the partaking of the Lords table, and the table of deuils. 1. Cor. 10.21. Next, they sate at the loue feasts: we can not thinke that they rose from the tables, either before or after the loue feasts, to receaue the Sacrament seuerally out of <hi>Pauls</hi> hand. <hi>Bilson</hi> sayeth, they sate at table <note n="l" place="margin">Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>p.</hi> 460</note> and to this purpose alledgeth <hi>Augustin:</hi>

                  <p>It is objected that the sitting of Christ and his Apostles was not upright but sitting with leaning. If we imitate the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Christ, we should sit after the same maner.</p>
                  <p>Answer. It was the custom receaued amongst the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and in the dayes of Christ, descending from the Romanes, or as others alledge from the Persians, Ester. 1. the table was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in the midst of the hall or parlour, and the beddes about the table except the part that was free for the seruice of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: They sat upon the beddes somewhat leaning toward the table and their feet lying out at the out-side of the bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was a space between the beds and the walles of the Hall or Parlour, that servants might haue roome to stand at the feet of the guests, and make service. They that stood behinde to serue, were sayd, <hi>stare à pedibus,</hi> to stand at their feet, as <hi>Petrus Ciacconius</hi> proveth out of <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>

The delicate and sinfull woman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. is sayd to sit in a glorious bed, and a table spread before her. <hi>Iosephus</hi> translateth the sitting of <hi>Ioseph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> brethren by the word <hi>Kataclinein,</hi> signifying, <hi>halfe silling, balse leaning,</hi> howbeit upright sitting was the gesture used in <hi>Iosephs</hi> time, a man standing leaning, is sayd to stand as well as when he stands upright, siclyk sitting. Leaning is a position of the body common to sitting or standing. The Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues at this day sit upright at their Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is a difference betwixt customs brought into the Kirk by invention of men, and the custome brought in by Christ, and entertained by his Apostles; as there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7885:23"/>
the Lords day and the Holy dayes invented by men. It is safer for mans conscience to imitate Christ and his Apostles, then to depart from them, and imitate the custome of Kirkes, which may erre. Yea, Christs example seconded with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Apostles, is equivalent to a precept as I haue sayd. Yea this gesture may very well be comprehended under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse precept of Christ in the institution, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> doe this: that is, <hi>hoc totum facite,</hi> doe all this. For wee must not thinke that nothing belongeth to the institution, but that which is mentioned in <hi>Pauls</hi> narration, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. for then a table should not belong to the institution: no doubt our Saviour instructed them how to discerne the Lords body, how to eate and drink, before he commanded them to eate and drinke. But the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, and <hi>Paul</hi> writes of the Sacrament as of a thing knowne to the Kirke by practise, presupposing a table, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants convened and sitting at the table.</p>
                  <p>The second breach of the Institution made by kneeling in the act of receauing, is the taking away of the vse of a table. Christ and his Apostles sat at table. 1. Cor. 10. Luk. 22. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore serves the name of a table if we kepe not the proper use and imployment of it? The fathers call it the Lords table, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly table, the sacred table, the mysticall table, the spirituall table, the Rationall table: whereto serue all these commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if in the mean time it be not used as a table, but rather as an altar? If it be not used as Christ and his Apostles vsed it, that is by sitting at it to receaue of the dainties set vpon the table? The Sacrament is called a Supper and therfore a table is ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to it. It is neuer termed a Sacrifice in the Scripture. We sit at tables, but not at altars: we eat and drink at tables, but not all altars. The ancients called this table an altar, but vnproperly &amp; in respect of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of Christs sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. This improper speach was dangerous, &amp; hes proven hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Kirk transforming indeed a table into an Altar. If we reteine no more but the name of a table, the Papists can, and do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> giue that name to the lidd of their Altar. The people of God had an altar for the sacrifice, and a table for a feast. Siclyk the Ethnicks. So Christians haue one altar for one sacrifice, to wit, Christ who is Preist, Altar, and Sacrifice Heb. 13.10. and a table for the feast after this sacrifice once made, to wit, the Sacrament of the Supper. As the Israelites and the Ethniks sate at the tables of their feasts made of things sacrificed, so do we at our sacred feasts, to distinguish betweene an Altar and a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a sacrifice and a Supper made of the thing sacrificed. A dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7885:24"/>
or Cupboord may serue as well for disposing of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reaching them to the communicants as a table. If a table should serue, to no other vse but to sett on these Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and reach them from the table; Christ and his Apostles vsed not the table after that maner. As it serued them to the Paschall Supper, so it serued to the Eucharisticall.</p>
                  <p>The third breach of the institution made by kneeling, is the taking away of that mysticall rite representing Christs passion, to wit, the breaking of the bread. The Apostle sayes not, The communion of one bread; but, The communion of one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bread hath in it a mystery of our unity. When the bread is carved in little morsels before it be presented to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is not the sacramentall and mysticall breaking in the use of the Sacrament which ought to bee performed after the thankesgiving according to Christs example. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth: <hi>Cum illud quod est in Domini mensa benedicitur &amp; sanctificatur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>&amp; ad distribuendum comminuitur.</hi> When that which is blessed on the Lords table, sanctified, and broken in small peeces to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed, &amp;c. This breaking was needfull both for mystery and distribution. The breaking of the bread was thought so needful in the Sacrament, that it was called, <hi>Breaking of Bread.</hi> The Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack interpreter translateth the breaking of bread <hi>Eucharist,</hi> Act. 2.24. and 20.7. <hi>Pareus</hi> on 1. Cor. 11. proveth at length this rite not to be indifferent, but a thing commanded. Where kneeling is practised, we read not in their Service-bookes of this brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread after thankesgiving: whereby the passion of Christ is not set forth to the communicants as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The fourth breach of the institution made by kneeling, is the change and restraint of the commandement given to many in the plurall number, <hi>Eate yee, drinke yee:</hi> to one in the singular number, <hi>Eate thou, dainke thou. Fenner</hi> in the doctrine of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, expresseth the pith of this phrase in a liuely maner. <hi>It is fittest</hi> (sayth he) <hi>to note out the fellowship and communion of the Church in this worke, the person of Christ by the Minister, bidding all his guests with one loue as from him to bee mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, and eate with faith one spirituall meat together.</hi> Our faith is further succoured, when we may together, and with one heart, apply our selues to the meditation and fruit of this speech of Christ by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which in the particular speaking doth loose that our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together, and maketh the mindes of Christians hang the longer in the waiting for this sentence, and the comfort of it, and their minds are offered unto greater occasions of slips and with drawings, by humane infirmity, when these things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7885:24"/>
which may more effectually be done together and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                  <p>The fift breach of the institution made by kneeling, is, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the enunciatiue words of Christ, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you</hi>: whereby he declares his comming in the flesh and suffering for sin, the maine ground of our redemption, and, changing them in a prayer to blesse our body and soule. <hi>The body of our Lord Iesus Christ which was given for thee, preserue thy body and soule unto everlasting life.</hi> The Papist in this poynt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neerer to the institution: for hee giveth not the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> except the host be first consecrated at some Masse, with these words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> This prayer inserted betwixt the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and the distribution, and repeated to every communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, is idle battalogie. The use of the prayer and thanksgiving for the use of the elements, indureth all the time of the action. Christs words in the institution containe partly a command, partly a promise, partly institution. Christs promise is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their definitiue words, <hi>This is my body that is given for you: This is my bloud which is shed for the remission of the sins of many.</hi> When the forme of the words is altered, the promise is obscured. It is not enough to rehearse the words of the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the prayer immediatly preceding the action, but in the action every rite and ceremony should haue the words of the institution concurring. <hi>Let the word be ioyned with the element, and so it shall be a sacrament,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixt breach of the institution made by kneeling, is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the distribution that ought to be amongst the communicants. When Christ said, <hi>Take yee, eate yee,</hi> he insinuates that they should take and divide amongst themselues. The word <hi>Edoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he gaue,</hi> doth not import that he gaue immediatly. The Disciples in setting the bread before the fiue thousand, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.41. gaue the bread to the fiue thousand, <hi>Math.</hi> 14.19. the fiue thousand distributed among themselues. <hi>Cajetanus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Math.</hi> 26. acknowledgeth, that the Disciples were in so great distance from Christ, that their hands could not meet with his hands, <hi>Beza</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 2.</note> that howbeit Christ had sitten in the midst, as Painters make him to sit, yet in respect of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their sitting, it behoved either Christ to rise and come to them that were farre distant, or them to come to him, if he had given the elements to every one in their own hands. <hi>Tossa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> sayth, that Christ gaue to the two neerest,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In Mat.</hi> 26</note> and they reached to them who were further off. In the first booke of Discipline penned <hi>Anno.</hi> 1560. it is ordained that the Minister breake the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7885:25"/>
bread, and distribute the same to those that be next him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the rest every one with reverence and sobriety to break with other, because it is neerest to Christs action. Further, we haue a plain precept, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Divide it amongst you,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the communion Cup, and not of the Paschall. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists make mention of foure things belonging to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion cup. 1. Thankesgiving. 2. Distribution. 3. Assertion that it is his blood. 4. A protestation that he will not drink of the Vine untill the kingdom of God shall come: the assertion that it is his blood, is set down afterward by <hi>Luk. v.</hi> 20. the other 3 are set down in this 17. vers. It is therfore the same cup. Next, if it had not been the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion cup, and consequently the last, the communion cup behoued to haue come after: but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with the protestation: for how could Christ protest of the Paschal cup that he would drink no more of the fruit of the wine, If he drank after it of the Euangelicall cup. The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal canon interdyted to eat or drinke after the cup of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing or praise, the cup of praise in the end of the paschall Supper was changed as I haue said into the Eucharistical cup, &amp; was all one with it: and the protestation of not drinking, more agreeth with the Canon made of the last Paschal cup all one with the Evangelical. This cup was caried about from hand to hand, and diuided amongst them by them selues. The two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists doe not so much as mention the cup of the Passeouer and yet make mention of this protestation of not drinking more of the fruite of the Vine. The verses immediatly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the protestation, make mention only of the cup of the Lords Supper. Math. 26.28. Mark. 14.24. <hi>Fulk</hi> saith, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue pronomen</hi> (this) <hi>Math.</hi> 26.29. <hi>declareth, that be spake of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ine in his hand that is of the communion cup.</hi> If there was two cups then either the words of the protestation were repeated, or set downe by <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> out of the owne place, and wrongfully applyed, but none of these two is to be admitted. Thirdly <hi>Luke</hi> omitteth the mention of thanksgiving and the commandement to drink of this cup verse 20. howbeit both be expresly set downe by other Evangelists, and the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with the actiones concerning the bread requireth the same. Whairfore rhen did he omit them? even because spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king before of the same cup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verse. 17. he had made mention of these two points, he eschueth to repeat them as already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever action or command is inclosed within the institution, may not lawfully be broken: but that the communicants should distribute amongst themselues, was both an action at the first supper, and a precept, as I haue proven.

                  <p>The eight breach of the institution made by kneeling is, the altering of the purpose of the institution, or nature of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. It was instituted to be a supper, a spirituall feast: it was the will of Christ therefore, that we should behaue our selves as ghuests invited to a banket. Ghuests invited to a banket, even to a Princes banket kneele not in the act of backeting. They are invited indeed to a spirituall refreshment, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Supper should cary the resemblance of a supper, in the formes and fashions therof, or els it could not rightly be called a Supper; for it is not only the matter, that is, the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and foode, that maketh a banket, but also the ordering of the ghuests, and kindly interteinment of them. The Sacrament of the Passeover was also a holy Supper, and the people of God vsed it so: they kneeled not in the act of receaving of it. When they receaved the law of the Passeover, they bowed the heads and worshipped. Exod. 12.27. Yet did they not so in the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. They were more reverent and devout, in hearing the law of it out of the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> then in the participation of it.</p>
                  <p>Let no man object against us, the examples of some kirks, where some of the former breaches are made without kneeling: seeing kneeling hath made them all, and seeing we haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, standing to us in force of a command, wherin nothing should be altered, in matter, forme, or order; nothing added; nothing diminished: for divine institutions admit, neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition nor diminurion <note n="*" place="margin">saith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> in 1. Cor. 11.</note> the Apostle alledgeth the institution against all abuses, <hi>that which I receaved of the Lord, that haue I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto you,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Doubtlesse</hi> (sayth Pareus) <hi>he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this history of the institution from the Lord, with other revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he was ravished to the third heavens.</hi> It is not my inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. (would the Apostle say) but the Lords ordinance, concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto me to be kept as a iewell. It is not for nought, that the Evangelistes with one consent doe set downe the forme of this institution, and that the Apostle trieth all corruptions in the Supper by it, as by a rule. <hi>Ciprian</hi> saieth Epist, 3. lib. 3. we must follow the trueth of God, and not the custome of men. And in an other place he saieth when the channels ar corrupted we should run to the fountain. It is not so much our purpose to taxe others as to defend our selues</p>

                  <head>Kneeling considered, as it is a breach of the second commandement.</head>
                  <p>KNeeling in the act of receaving the Sacramental elements, is not only a breach of the institution in the Gospell, but also of the second commandement of the law.</p>
                  <p>The first breach of the commandement made by kneeling is, the sinne of Idolatry. Idolatry is committed in this act divers wayes. The Papists kneele in the act of receaving, because they beleue verely, that the bread is transubstantiat into Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and upon this supposition of transubstantiation and bodily presence, they kneele. This is the grossest idolatry that ever was in the world. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> kneeleth upon his supposition of consubst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntiation, and Christs reall presence by consubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this also is idolarrie and the supposition false. A third sort kneele for reverence of the Elements, not giving to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that high kind of worship called commonly <hi>cultus latriae,</hi> which the Papist giveth, but an inferior kinde of worship due (as they thinke) to consecrate creatures: this also is Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling for reverence of the elements, is Idolatry, because it is a religious worship of a creature. It is not civill worship they giue in the act of receiuing the sacred Elements: the matter and motiue of their reverence is a matter of religion, to wit, because the elements are holy signes and seales: it is therefore religious worship. Religious worship is divine worship. All manner of worship pertaining to godlinesse and religion, is religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.<note n="g" place="margin">

They are worshipped onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the person, yet notwithstanding of this dependant and respectiue worship, they affirme the sacred things are worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>per se,</hi> howbeit, not <hi>propter se,</hi> by themselues, howbeit not for themselues; because by themselues they haue relation, or coniunction with or representation of the persons adored: that is, they haue in them a cause of adoration, howbeit a dependent cause. <hi>Swarez</hi> sayth, <hi>Honor illis exhilitus non in illis sistit,</hi>

Civill worship is convoyed mediatly to the person of the Prince, by bowing to sencelesse creatures, as to the chaire of Estate, the cloath of Estate, the Kings letter and seale, because the estate thinkes it expedient for Princely Maiesty that these things be reverenced, which serue in a speciall manner for the Princes use, as signes of his presence or pleasure.

This venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reverence, is a respectiue or relative reverence giuen them

for Gods sake. Kneeling for reverence of sensles creatures, is, to take the proper gesture of relatiue adoration, and apply it to relatiue reuerence. For religious kneeling in all the Scripture is a gesture of adoration, and soveran worship. <hi>Augustine,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the brasen serpent, Sacred writings, and the bread in the Sacrament, sayeth. <note n="m" place="margin">

                  <p>The Ministers of <hi>Lincolne</hi> in the third part of their defence laid to the charge of their Church representatiue, that kneeling is intended for reverence of the elements. I refer the reader to their proofes: for the present let it only be observed, upon what occasion kneeling was urged. In their first reformation it was left free. <hi>Gardiner, Boner,</hi> and other Papists sought to make the first booke of common prayer odious, amongst other things for want of reverence to the Sacrament. The Papists made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and challenged proudly in their Articles a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for reverence of the Sacrament: and on the other side, some, inconsideratly fixed railing libels at <hi>Pauls-cross,</hi> and other places, terming the Sacrament <hi>lack of the box, the Sacrament of the Halter, round Roben &amp;c.</hi> These proceedings moved <hi>Rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y</hi> in his preachings at <hi>Pauls-Crosse</hi> to proceede so far, that the cheefest papists seemed to desire no more, but that his practise might be answerable to his doctrine. This stirre made also <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Ridly,</hi> at the second revewing of the booke of common prayer, to inioyn kneeling, with this reason; <hi>that the Sacrament might not be prophaned, but holden in a holy and reverent estimation.</hi> They feared to offend superstitious people in a time of strong opposition, untill they were better taught, neither was their judgement cleare in this cause: for they thought it not idolatry to worship the consecrate elements, with an inferiour kinde of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7885:28"/>
worship, and for the relation they haue to the thing signified, providing they yeeld not unto them soverain or godly worship, as they called it. They were but newly come forth out of the darke denne of popery, and could not see all things in the first dawning of the day.</p>
                  <p>In the late act, we are ordeined, to kneele for reverence of the divine misteries. I see not wherein this differeth from the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rochesters</hi> argument. <note n="p" place="margin">Discourse of kneeling pag. 124.</note> that great and reverent dreed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full misteries, must be receaved with greate and dreedfull hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of soul, and humiliation of body: therfore in the act of receauing we must kneel. If this argument were good, then the Sacraments and sacrifices of the old law should haue been thus worshipped: And if we will measure by the sight, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and sacrifices of the old Law were more dreadfull then the sacraments of the new. For the slaughter of beasts, and Sheding of blood, was more dreedfull, then the pouring out of wine. The auncients held the sight of this Sacrament, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from pagans, but also from the Catachumenists, they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched darkly, they wrote darkly, to the same end. This doing was not commendable, it made the mysterie of this Sacrament both dark and dreadfull. <hi>Augustine</hi> hes already said, <hi>they may be honored as matters religious but wondred al as matters of marvel they can not.</hi> But to returne to the purpose, to kneel for reverence of the mysteries is nothing els but to worship the mysteries.</p>
                  <p>Wheresoeuer the publick intent of a Kirk is to worship the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, every privat man following that intent, is formally an Idolater. If his priuat intent be divers from the publik, yet he is still materially, &amp; <hi>Interpretatiuè</hi> an Idolator. If a man receiue the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in the papisticall Kirk on his knees, howbeit he kneel not vpon the supposed conceit of transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but his own privat intent, he is materially guilty of their grosse Idolatrie. <hi>Ismenias</hi> stouping down before the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to take up a ring, which he let purposly fall, was not excused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because this stouping in common vse, was the adoring of the King of Persia.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling directed to the bread and wine in the hands of the Minister, is idolatrie, howbeit the inward motion of the minde and affection of the hart be directed only to God, or his Son Christ, as the only object of adoration. This immediate convoy of worship to the principall obiect, is nothing else but that finer sort of Idolatry and relatiue worship, which <hi>Durandus, Holcot, Mirandula, Alphonsus, Petrus Cluniacensis,</hi> and others, giue to their images. They say Images are not otherwise adored, then that before them and about them, are exhibite the externall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7885:29"/>
signes of honor: the inward affection is directed onely to the principall object: as the services done at a funerall show, to one emptie coffine, as if the corps were present. See <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

This kinde of relatiue worship will not be found different from the relatiue worship of <hi>Durandus</hi> and the rest: For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Swarez</hi> draw <hi>Durandus</hi> and the rest from <hi>In illa, et per illam Imaginem,</hi> in and by the image, to <hi>Circum</hi> and <hi>coram, about,</hi> or <hi>before the Image.

                     <hi>that the image is neither the formall, nor the material, the total, nor the partial object of adoration in their opinion; but that only at the presence of the images the principal called to remembrance by the image is adored, that the image is an occasion, amids, a signe stirring up a man to adore the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</hi> Their adoration then was also abstract from the object, as they pretend theirs to be. The bread and wine or any other creature whatsoeuer, differeth not in this present case, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they were ordained of God to be signes and seals of his graces, yet they are not <hi>in statu accommodato ad adorandum</hi>; they haue no such state in the seruice of God, as that by them, or before them God or his sonne Christ should be adored. Next If this kinde of relatiue worship were to be allowed, then all the holy signes both in the old and New Testament should haue serued to the same vse. Then they who are far distant from the table should kneel, for the Elements are to them, <hi>objectum a quo significatiuè.</hi> Then at the sight of the sunne or any bewtifull creature, we should kneel seeing they put vs in minde of Gods incomprehensible bewtie. And seeing many of them doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the historicall use of images, we may fall down before the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> providing the action of the minde be abstracted from the image. Thirdly all the parts of Gods worship ought to be direct, and not oblique. <hi>Perkins</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Idolatry. p. 677.678</note> sayth, <hi>it is idolatrie to turne, dispose, or direct the worship of God, or any part thereof to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place or creature, without the appointment of God, and more specially, to direct our adoration to the bread or the place where the bread is, what is it lesse then Idolatrie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Kneeling before the elements referred directly to Christ. is, either a gesture signifying the humble submission of the mind in generall, whereby we make obeysance, as if he were bodily present: or else it signifieth more particularly our humiliation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7885:29"/>
In prayer: this is but a speciall, the former was a generall; The like reasons serue against both. It is trew we can not kneell to God in prayer, but there are many things before us, a Kirk, a house, a wall, a tree, a starre, &amp;c. But we set them not before us purposly; we are by no direction tyed unto them, they stand only before us by casuall position, neither can we chuse other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to doe. It is true, likewise, that God directed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Law to bend and bow themselues toward the Ark, and the Temple wherein the Ark was, and the Mountaine whereon the Temple was situate: partly least that rude people should turne their worship another way; partly because of his promise to heare them when they shold pray toward the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the Ark; partly because of his singular maner of presence in the Ark: he was said to dwell between the Cherubines, the Ark is called his foot-stoole? and sometime the face of God; the glory of the Lord. It is reason, where God is present after an extraordinary maner, as when he spake out of the bush, and the cloud, that odoration be directed to the place of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary presence. The Altars; the offerings and other holy things wanted the like presence, and the like promise. The Ark and the Cherubines upon the Ark, were not seene: and therefore could not be readily abused to idolatry.</p>
                  <p>The Sacramentall elements haue neither the like presence, the like promise, nor the like commandement. Worship is tyed no longer to any certaine thing or place on earth. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.21.22. Adoration is tyed in the new Testament to the manhood of Christ, the true Ark and propitiatory: and is caried to that place, in which we certainly know the said manhood to exist substantially sayeth <hi>Perkins,</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Idolatry pag. 677.678.700 701.</note> and therefore it is, that wee lift up our eyes to the heavenes, where he is, and direct our very externall worship unto him.</p>
                  <p>It is objected, and said, that wee may pray in the act of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; therefore wee may kneele in the act of receaving. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. This objection insinuates that kneeling is the proper and onely commendable gesture of prayer, and therefore the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rochester</hi> exponeth the standing of the publican <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11.13. to haue been kneeling, because (sayeth he) the Iewish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was to pray kneeling. But if he had remembred the Lords owne saying Ierem. 15. <hi>though Moses and Samuell stood before me &amp;c.</hi> he might haue understood that they prayed stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as wel as kneeling. <hi>Drusius</hi> observeth, <note n="x" place="margin">In Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note>

Manabem,</hi> an Hebrew Rabine expoundeth it, <hi>he prayed before the Lord.</hi> Next the prayer meant of, is either some publicke prayer uttered by the Minister, or the mentall prayer of the communicant. As for the prayer of the Minister in the act of distribution, it is flat against the institution, as I haue already sayd. The Minister is ordained by the institution to act the person of Christ, and pronounce the words of promise. <hi>This is my body</hi>: as if Christ himselfe were pronouncing these words, and not change the promise into a prayer. <hi>Fenner</hi> in his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion <note n="z" place="margin">Pag. 95.</note> layeth this down as a ground, <hi>That in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement we are forbidden the practise and use of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rite, or outward meanes used in the worship or service of God, then he hath ordained,</hi> Ioh. 4.22. 2 King. 18.4. and that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we are commanded to practise all those parts of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which he in his word hath commanded, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge onely the proper use of every rite and outward meanes which the Lord hath ordained. Deut. 12.32. 2. King. 17.26. Further, we are forbidden by the second commandement to pray by direction before any creature, This publicke prayer is but a pretended cause of kneeling, as the Ministers of <hi>Lincolne</hi> make manifest in their abridgement: for no Canon of our neighbour Kirke hath directed any part of this kneeling in the act of receiving, to be assigned to the said prayer. In populous congregations, where there is but one Minister, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants sit a quarter of an houre before the Minister repaire to them with the sacrament. And last, the prayer is ended before the delivery of the elements. As for our Kirk, no such prayer is ordained to be uttered by the Minister; therefore no such prayer can be pretended. In the late Canon it is sayd, <hi>That the most reverent and humble gesture of the body in our meditation and lifting up of our hearts, best becommeth so divine an action.</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not prayer, and the heart may be lifted up by the act of faith and contemplation, as well as by the action of prayer; so that neither publick nor mentall prayer is expressed in our act. But let the words be interpreted of mentall prayer, even men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer is not the principall exercise of the soule in the act of receiving the sacramentall elements: the minde attending on the audible words, the visible elements, the mysticall actions, and making present use of them, men should not be diverted from their principall worke and meditation, upon the Analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the signes and things signified. The soule may send up in the meane time some short ejaculations and darts of prayer to heaven to strengthen her owne weaknesse, and returne to her
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7885:30"/>
principall worke of meditation and application of the benefites represented. These short ejaculations of the minde are onely occasionall, as a Christian feeleth his owne present estate, and are incident to all our actions both civill and religious: In the act of receiving our earthly food, in going out the way, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word. If a man be moved inwardly, when he heareth, that the word was made flesh, shall he kneele as they do in the Romane Kirke? If a man should kneele at every inward moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde, when he heareth the word, what confusion would there be in the congregation? A man looking occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to a crucifix, may remember Christ, and send up some ejaculations, shall he therefore kneele? The three children prayed mentally no doubt when they were brought before the golden Image, but lawfully they might not kneele before it. <hi>Perkins</hi> destinguisheth notably betwixt publick, private, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret worship: <note n="a" place="margin">Idolatry pag. 70<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, the Institution, and the second commandement hinder kneeling at this time, suppose mentall prayer were the principall exercise of the soule. I heare there is alledged a third sort of prayer, to wit, that the very act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is of it selfe a reall prayer.

                  <p>Their other obiection that we may praise God in the act of receiving; therefore we may kneele, may be answered after the same manner. There is no publicke thankesgiving ordained to be made at the delivery of the elements: mentall praise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be meant. Mentall praise is no more the principall worke of the soule, then mentall prayer; what was sayd of the ejaculations of the one, let it be applied to the short e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is false, I may on my knees, <hi>Giue us this day our daily bread</hi>; but I may not receiue it on my knees. The people of Israel prayed for food, yet they were not esteemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, for not kneeling when they received the Manna.</p>
                  <p>It is again objected, that in the act of receauing, we receaue from Christ an inestimable benefit, ought not a subject kneele when he receiveth a benefit from a Prince to testifie his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes? Answer, this relation from Christ to the Sacrament, as betweene the giver and the gift is common to all the Sacraments both of the old, and new law, ordinary, and extraordinary. Next we receaue the mysticall pledges, not out of the hands of God himselfe or his Son Christ immediatly, but out of the hand of the Minister. The person who receaveth the gift from the King, is supposed to receaue it immediatly: and suppose mediatly, yet ceremonies of Court, &amp; mediate ciuil worships, are not rules of religious adoration; which should ever be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Thirdly the manner of delivery of the gift and the will of the giuer, are to be considered. If the Prince call his Nobles to a banket, it is his will that they sit at table with him, as <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> sat at King <hi>Sauls</hi> table. Christ hes declared by the Institution, after what maner he wold haue vs receaue these mysticall pledges. Kneeling cannot agree with the actions and precepts of the Institution.</p>
                  <p>The second breach of the second commandement made by kneeling, is, the shew of conformity with the papists. The Lord forbade his people to be like the Gentiles, Leuitie. 18.3. and 19.27 &amp; Deut: 12. the christians were forbidden to decore their houses with bay leaves, and greene boughes, because the paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vsed so to doe, or to rest from their labours, those dayes that the Paganes did. If conformity in things not haueing state in Idolatrous seruice, but onely glanceing at the honor of the Idoll, be condemned; far more is conformity in the grossest act, wherin the life and soul as it were of their Idolatrie standeth, Such as is the gesture of kneeling among the papists. And for this cause <hi>Hooper</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">On Ionas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7885:31"/>
the same cause condemned this gesture. This outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity tickleth the papist, and offendeth the godly.</p>
                  <p>The third breach of the second commandement made by kneeling is, the reteining of a monument of vile idolatrie. All humane inuentiones polluted with idolatrie, except they be of necessarie vse, ought to be remoued from Gods seruice. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture had a spot of profanation from the beginning, being at the first birth in this act dedicat to Idolatrie. The brasen serpent set up at Gods own command, was not spared when it was abused. We detest the very garment of a theese, or a whore, though it be innocent. <hi>Biza</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Epist. 8.</note> sayeth, many things may be tollerate for the weake, which may not be restored after they are tane away. He commendeth them, who haue abolished kneeling amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things <hi>tanquam apertas Idolomanias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth breach of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> comandement made by kneeling, is, the continuall occasion and danger of idolatry. Wee are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biden all occasions and provocations of idolatry. There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pronnesse in all men to idolatry; great ignorance in the common people, and Superstition rooted in the hearts of men: Papistes daily increase, the idol of the bready God is still in great accompt in the Romane Kirks round about us, and in private corners amongst us: and yet men are not ashamed to say, that all memory of former superstition is past, and no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill is to be feared againe. The virgines in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they walked with yong men, talked with them, went to bed with them, but when it came to the act they absteined. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

Place should not be given to the devill, no man is long safe who is neare the point of danger. The <hi>Belgick</hi> Kirks in their Synods permitted not liberty of kneeling, for the same respect of bread-worship as may be seene in, the harmony of their Synods, set forth of late by <hi>Festus Homius</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 13.</note>, <hi>Liberum est stando, sedendo, vel eundo caenam celebrare non autem geniculando ob artolatreias periculum.</hi> If a lawfull use could be devised yet this danger cannot be eschued. Information by preaching is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient remedy: meate doth not nourish so fast as poyson doeth corrupt. The watchmen are some time ignorant, or negligent, many want doctrine. It is better to fill up the pitt, then to set one beside it to warne the passengers that they fall not in, such ceremones ought to be appointed, which by their goodnes and edification may help the preaching of the word, and not such as the word must daily haue need to correct. The strength of many poore Christian soules should not be tryed by bringing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7885:32"/>
them to the very brink of danger.</p>
                  <p>The fift breach of the second commandement made by kneeling, is, a shew of wisdome in wil-worshipe and humility, Coloss. 2.23. a worship is set up by mans voluntary devotion in a principall part of Gods service, under colour of humility. We ought to come indeed, and receaue with humility these misticall pledges: but is there no reverence and humility, but in kneeling? <hi>Swarez</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">

It was his honor to command, and their humility to obey. Sitting was not pomp, glorious pride, or prophane gesture, as men are not ashamed so to call it; because it was obedience to the Lord. This their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended humility, is a naturall humility; like unto <hi>Peters,</hi> when he refused that Christ should wash his feet. <hi>Obedience is better then sacrifice. Fenner</hi> in the doctrine of the Sacraments.<note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 130</note> hath a notable saying, [that the whole honor of the Sacraments is, that they remaine unto the Church of God in that simplicity he left them; and that no action here is worth any thing, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Gods word, which is sanctified to a profitable use, and made an instrument of the working of the holy Ghost.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> There is no new worship appointed, but an action already appointed for Gods service is applyed to the said Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>Answ.</hi> The parts of Gods worship may not be applyed to other when <hi>comlines, commodiousnes, institution,</hi> and <hi>command</hi> will not suffer. A man may not kneele all the time of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; he may not reade in the act of receaving; baptisme may not be ministred in the midst of the communion, and many such instances might be alledged. <hi>Aquinas</hi> sayth, <note n="l" place="margin">2.2. <hi>quest.</hi> 81. <hi>ad</hi> 5.</note>

By super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity he meaneth excesse, a vice in all morall vertues. To bee short, a rite Sacramentall, devised by man, pretending humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and shouldring out other rites instituted by God, cannot
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7885:32"/>
be but presumptuous wil-worship. Such is the gesture of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as we haue already proued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Eucharist is a part of Gods worship, therefore we ought to kneele in the act of receiuing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> In a large sence every act whereby God is honoured may be called the worship of God, as oathes, vowes, sacrifices, &amp;c. But adoration is the worship of God in a strict sense. Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is the gesture of adoration, but not of every part of Gods worship. Receiving, eating, drinking in the sacrament, are parts of Gods worship, but they are not gestures of adoration. All the Sacraments both of Iewes and Christians, were parts of Gods worship as well as the Eucharist, and yet they kneeled not in the act of participation.</p>

                  <p>THE Lutheran Kirkes do acknowledge reall presence by way of consubstantiation: it is no wonder therefore that they approue kneeling.

If the manner of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence be not determined, there can arise no other but a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed worship of such a confused and determinate presence.

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:7885:35"/>It will not follow that we may change sitting into kneeling, because the ancient Kirk and some reformed Kirks haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sitting into standing; because kneeling maketh so many breaches both in the institution, and in the second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and is no wayes a table gesture.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the beginning of the Reformation to this present yeare of our Lord 1618. the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath diverse waies condemned the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of all holy dayes, the Lords day onely excepted. In the first chapter of the first booke of discipline penned anno. 1560. the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy dayes to Sancts, the feast of Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masse, Circumcision, Epiphanie, Purification, and other fond feasts of our Ladie are ranked amongst the abhominations of the Romane religion, as hauing neither commandement nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance in the word. It is farther affirmed that the obstinate maintaineres &amp; teachers of such abomination should not escape the punishement of the ciuill Magistrate. The book aforesaid was subscrybed by the Lords of secret Councell.

In the Assemblie holden <hi>anno</hi> 1575. complaint was made against the Ministers and Readers beside <hi>Aberdine,</hi> because they Assembled the people to prayer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching vppon certain patron and festival dayes. Complaint like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was ordained to be made to the Regent vpon the Town of <hi>Drumfraies</hi> for vrging, and convoying a Reader to the Kirke with Tabret and Whistle to read the prayers all the holy Dayes of Yoole, or Christmas vpon the refusall of their own Reader, Item an article was formed to be presented to the Regent, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that all dayes heretofore keeped holy in tyme of Papist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beside the Lords day such as Yoole day, Saints dayes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like feasts may be abolished, a civill penaltie appointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the observers of the said dayes.

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of dayes was abjured in the confession of faith penned <hi>anno</hi> 1580. An Article was formed in the Assembly <hi>anno</hi> 1581. craving an act of Parliament to be made against observation of feast dayes, dedicated to Saints, and setting out of bone-fires. In the Assembly holden in February <hi>anno</hi> 1587. it was humbly moved to his Maiesty, that Pasche and Yoole was superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously observed in <hi>Fyffe,</hi> and about <hi>Drumfrets.</hi> In the Assembly holden <hi>anno</hi> 1590. his Maiesty in open audience of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly praised God for that he was borne to be a King in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerest Kirk in the world: sincerer then our neighbour Kirk of <hi>England</hi>: for their service was an evill-sayd Masse in English: Sincerer then <hi>Geneva</hi> it selfe: for they observed Pasche and Yoole. In the Parliament holden <hi>anno</hi> 1592. the act of King <hi>Iames</hi> the third anent the Saturday and other vigils to be kept holy from Even-song to Evensong was annulled. Item, the act made by <hi>Queen Regent</hi> granting licence to keepe Yoole and Pasche. In the Assembly holden <hi>anno</hi> 1596. when the covenant was renewed, superstition and Idolatry breaking forth in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of festivall dayes, setting out of bone-fires, and singing of Carrols, is reckoned amongst the corruptions which were to be amended. The Pulpits haue sounded continually against all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivall daies. The Censures of the Kirk haue been put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all due form against the observers. In the pretended As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly holden at <hi>Perth</hi> in <hi>August</hi> last past, it was concluded, that hereafter every Minister shall make commemoration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable benefits received from God, by and through our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, his Birth, Passion, Resurrection, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and sending down of the Holy Ghost upon the dayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for that use. That they shall make choyce of severall and pertinent Texts, and frame their Doctrine and exhortation accordingly.

A Prince may not inioyne Cessation from Oeconomicall and domestick works but for weapon shewing, exercise of armes, defence of the country or other publick works and affaires. But that is not to injoyne a day of simple Cessation, but to inioyne a politick work in place of the oeconomicall. Every particular member ceassing from their particular work exerciseth another work serving for the preservation of the whole bodie. The curse that <hi>Adam shall eate with the sweate of his browes,</hi> is mitigated by the permission of six dayes labour. The Lord permitteth unto man six, lest he devoure the seventh day which is sanctified. What if the Kirk representatiue injoyne a weekly holy day, as another sabboth, ought the Kirke to be obeyed? what power hath the Kirk representatiue, to inioyne an anniversary day more then a weekly or hebdomadary holy day. If a day of simple Cessation from all maner of work Oeconomicall and politicall may not be inioyned, a festivall day may not be inioyned. I say further that the poore craftsman can not lawfully be commanded to lay aside his tooles, and goe passe his time, no not for an houre, let be for a day as long as he is willing to worke, and perhaps urged with the sharpnes of present necessity. And yet farther that he ought not to be compelled to leaue his worke to goe to divine service except on the day that the Lord hath sanctified.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7885:37"/>
no wise man will deny that this sanctification belongeth onely to God, &amp; that it is manifest sacriledge to attribute these things to men, which are onely of divine ordination. <hi>Willet</hi> sayth: <hi>It belongeth onely to the Creator to sanctifie the Creature.</hi> In the booke of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> cap. 33.7.8. it is demanded, <hi>Why doth one day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell another, when as the light of every day of the yeare is of the Sun?</hi> It is answered, <hi>By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished, and he altered seasons and feasts. Some of them hath he made hie dayes, and hallowed them; Some of them he hath made ordinary dayes.</hi> The common tenent of the Divines was acknowledged by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> in his Sermon at the last Christmas. <hi>It may offend you,</hi> sayd he, <hi>that this is an holy day. I say there is no power either civill or Ecclesiasticall can make an holy day: no King, no Kirk: onely the Lord that made the day, and distinguished it from the night: he hath sanctified the seventh day.</hi> The like was acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>M. P. Galloway</hi> in his Christmas Sermons. If the speciall sanctification of a day to an holy use dependeth upon Gods commandement and institution, then neither King nor Kirke representatiue may make an holy day.</p>
                  <p>The observers of dayes will say they count not their anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie daies holier then other dayes, but that they keep them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for order and policie, that the people may be assembled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exercises. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Papists will confesse that one day is not holier then another in its owne nature, no not the Lords day: for then the Sabboth might not haue been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the last, to the first day of the weeke. But they affirme that one day is holier then another, in respect of the end and vse; And so doe wee. They call them holy dayes: and so doe wee. They vse them as memoriall signes of sacred mysteries whereof they carie the names, as Nativitie; Passion; Ascension. &amp;c. And so doe wee. The presence of the festivitie putteth a man in minde of the mysterie, howbeit he haue not occasion to be present in the holy Assembly. We are commanded to obserue them in all points as the Lords day, both in the publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and after the dissoluing of the same. Yea it is left free to teach any parte of Gods word on the Lords day; but for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie of the festiuall, solemne texts must be chosen: Gospels Epistles, collects, Psalmes must be framed for the particular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of these dayes, and so the mysticall dayes of mans appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shall not onely equall, but in solemnity surpasse the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sabboth appointed by the Lord.

Why hath the one proper service and not the other? Why did not <hi>M. Galloway</hi> curse the people for absence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one, as wel as from the other? Whey are the dayes of the one changeable, and not the other. To make solemne commemoration of Christs nativitie vpon any other day, then upon the putatiue day of his nativity, would be thought a great absurdity; siclike of his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Ascension. &amp;c. And last, how could <hi>M. Galloway</hi> affirme that <hi>the evidence of Gods Spirit appeared in the Christmas Sermons that are extant, more liuely then in any other Sermons</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Next it may be objected that the people of God might haue indicted dayes of fasting at their owne determination, and an interdiction of all kynd of work. Answer. They had a generall warrant from God. Ioel. 2.15. to <hi>proclaime a generall fast,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the occurrence of their calamities and other affaires of the kirk. The light and law of nature leadeth a man to this observation of an occasionall fast: nature teacheth him present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to withdraw his hand and heart from worldly affaires, and to lift them up to God to deprecate his wrath when his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is aboue our heads. The like may be said, by analogie, of thanksgiuing, that we ought to praise <hi>God</hi> in the mean time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we receiue the benefit. But to make of the occasionall dayes of fasting, or feasting, aniversarie and set festivall and fasting daies is without warrant. It remaineth therefore that it is the Lords soueraignty to make or ordaine a thing to be holy. God first sanctifies by commandement and institution: man sanctifieth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7885:38"/>
thereafter by observation, applying to an holy use the time san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by God. It was a part of the Idolatry of the golden calfe to <hi>proclaime a holy day.</hi> It is numbred among one of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> sins that he ordained a feast after the deuise of his own heart 1.

                  <head>The third Reason.</head>
                  <p>Wee come from priuiledge to fact. As <hi>de jure</hi> none may, so <hi>de facto</hi> None did, appoint holy dayes vnder the law but God, and that either by himself, or by some extraordinary direction. Therefore none can be allowed vnder the Gospell without the like warant. Seeing the tymes vnder the Gospell are not so ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious, as the tymes under the law. Against this reason two instances are commonly alledged the one of the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> instituted by <hi>Mordecai</hi>: the other of the feast of dedication in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>Iudas Maccabeus,</hi> and graced with Christs presence, as is alledged, Ioh. 10. But the answer is easie.</p>
                  <p>The dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were simply called the <hi>dayes of Purim</hi>: not the holy dayes <hi>of Purim.</hi> They are neither called <hi>Chag,</hi> nor <hi>Mogned,</hi> nor <hi>Gnatsarah</hi> as the other anniuersarie feasts are called in the old Testament. No mention is made of holy conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on these dayes nor divine service proper to them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their returne to the temple, and promise that the memoriall of the dayes of <hi>Purim should not fall from among them, nor perish from their seede</hi> Ester 9.27.28, It is true that now a daies they read the booke of Ester. And therefore call it the feast of <hi>Megilla,</hi> after the reading wherof they spend the rest of the time in revelling, more madde then the Gentiles were in their <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanalis.</hi> This reading was not the first institution, but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the later Iewes, The dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were instituted onlie for ciuill dayes, and the ordinance required no farther, but that they should make them dayes of feasting and joy, and sending of portions one to another, and gifts to the poore Ester 9.19.22. to be documents and testimonies of their fasting and crying, that is in remembrance of their fasting and prayers, by which they obtained that deliverance. At the instant time of their deliverie, it is sayd they rested, but in the Edict when the daies were made anniversarie, rest from all kind of worke was not forbidden: therefore <hi>Hospinian</hi>

The Apostle condemneth difference of dayes as he condemneth difference of meats.

In every respect all their anniversary dayes are abolished, and they had none other, but such as were abolished. Therefore in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect they belonged to the ceremoniall Law.

                  <head>The fifth Reason.</head>
                  <p>The prerogatiue belonging to God in the old Testament, was transferred to Christ, God and Man, the law-giver in the new Testament, <hi>one that was faihfull in all the house of God.</hi> But so it is, that Christ neither by his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, nor by directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his spirit inspiring the Apostles, instituted any other day but the Lords day. If there had been any other dayes dedicated to Christ, the Apostle spoke unproperly and obscurely when he sayd, <hi>he was ravished in the spirit upon the Lords day.</hi> If there had been a day for his Nativity, another for his passion, he should haue sayd, he was ravished in the spirit upon one of the Lords dayes. Seeing <hi>Iohn</hi> out-lived the rest of the Apostles, It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there was no other holy day observed in the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call times. Neither was the institution of the Lords day so much a new institution, as a change of the ordinary Sabboth. The extraordinary Sabboths were in every respect ceremoniall. The ordinary Sabboth had both substance and ceremony. By reason of the substance it was changed into the Lords day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering analogically to it. The morall use of the ordinary sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both was for the service of God in generall both private and publick. The mysticall use was to be a memoriall of things by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, and a shadow of things to come. The morall use indureth, the mysticall uses are evanished. Christ appeared the first day of the weeke, and every eighth day thereafter untill he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, saith <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>In Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin c.</hi> 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iunius.</hi> And that therefore the Apostles delivered to the Kirke the observation of this day from Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and institution,, which he confirmeth with the iudgement of <hi>Cyrillus</hi> and <hi>Augustine.</hi> The blessing of the seventh day was translated to this day instituted by Christ, because all sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion floweth to Christians from Christ. But it is sufficient that the Apostles inspired by his Spirit, haue recommended this day to the Kirke.</p>
                  <p>There is another reason to proue that there were no other dayes appoynted in the Apostles times. The Apostle had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to treat of holy dayes, reasoning against the observation of Iewish dayes, they direct them to no other as the purpose requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The Apostle condemneth not onely the observation of the Iewish daies, nor the Iewish observation of the Iewish daies to a typicall use. For the converted Iewes did not obserue them as shadowes of things to come, for then they had denied Christ: but he condemneth observation of dayes as a Iewish
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7885:41"/>
custome and rite, as a pedagogicall and rudimentary instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not beseeming the Christian Kirke. <hi>Zanchius</hi>

                  <p>Against this Argument is first alledged, that the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth with the observation of dayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.6. <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle beareth with the infirmity of the weake Iewes, who understood not the fulnesse of the Christian liberty. And the ceremoniall law was as yet not buried. But the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle reproveth the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who had attained to this libertie, and had once left off the observation of daies. Next, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall dayes had once that honour, as to be appointed by God himselfe: but the anniversary dayes appointed by men haue not the like honour.</p>
                  <p>It is secondly obiected, that seeing the Lords day was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in remembrance of Christs resurrection, the other notable acts of Christ ought likewise to be remembred with their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall festivities. <hi>Answer.</hi> It followeth not that because Christ did institute in remembrance of one benefite, therefore men may institute for other benefites. 2. Christs resurrection was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite including the rest, as an accomplishment of the worke of redemption, and answered anagogically to the common benefit of creation by the beginning of a new creation. 3. We deny that the Lords day was appointed to celebrate the memory onely of Christs resurrection. For then the Lords resurrection, the proper subiect of all Homilies, Sermons, Gospels, Epistles, Collects, Hymnes and Psalmes belonging to the Paschall seruice should be the proper subject of deuine seruice euery Lords day. Then the Lords day shovld be a festivall day: and it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to fast on it. It was instituted for the remembrance of all his actions, and generalie for his worship. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> sayth <note n="c" place="margin">

of Gods people. The other testimony importeth not the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Ester feast upon any anniversary day, but rather the Apostle teacheth us to celebrate this feast of the Passover all the yeare long, with the <hi>vnleavened bread of sincerity and turth.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Fulk</hi> in his answer to the <hi>Rhemists</hi> upon the same place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Augustine,</hi> referring this feasting not to the celebration of Ester, nor to the receiuing of <hi>Pasche</hi> communion, but to our whole life. It is therefore onely the Bishops conjècture that the incestuous person was cut of against the feast of Ester, that a little leaven might not leaven the whole lump. His last proofe is taken from the custome of baptisme and the Eucharist mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred upon Pasch day, as if they had been ministred only on that day. It was the decree of <hi>Pope Innocentius</hi> in the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill</hi> that all should communicate at Ester. The Christian Sabboth was called the Lords day, the day of light, and the day of Bread. The day of light because of baptisme ministred ordinarily on the Lords day: for the Ancients called baptisme, <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> The day of bread because of the administration of the Supper ordinarily upon the Lords day, as <hi>Iunius</hi>

The Apostles were led all their life time by the infallible direction of the Spirit. If they had accorded on the observaton of Ester they had not disagreed on the day. But their most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient records, the bastard Epistles aboue mentioned report that <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> kept the fourtenth day of the moone, as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes did, and <hi>Peter</hi> the Lords day following the fourteenth day of the moone. It is well said in the preface to the harmony of confessions; that the old contention about the celebrating of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster tossed very hotly the space of two hundred yeares or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, betwixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> was long since of us thought worthy of laughter. <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, <note n="n." place="margin">

The golden number inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to find out the new moone, for observing the right day, after that they accorded upon one day hath often failed, and

So God suffered the Christian world to wander, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their golden number; to let the world see such customes had not his allowance.

                     <hi>á posteriori,</hi> that seeing the Lords Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, &amp; comming down of the holy Ghost, is celebrated with anniversarie solemnity, through all the world, they must needs haue been ordained ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Apostles, or by generall Councels. But so it is, that those dayes were solemnly kept before there was any generall Councell. It must follow therefore that the Apostles ordained them. <hi>Answer.

                     <hi>I am of opinion, that as many other things crept in of custome in sundry places, so the feast of Easter to haue prevailed among all people of a certain private custome and observation: insomuch that not one of the Apostles hath any where prescribed so much as one rule of it to any man. The successe &amp; event hath manifestly declared unto the world, that of old it was observed, not of Canon, but of custome.</hi> And a little after, <hi>They that keepe Easter the</hi> 14. <hi>day of the moneth, bring forth</hi> Iohn <hi>the Apostle for their Authour. Such as inhabite Rome, and the West parts of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>for themselues, that they should leaue such a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: yet there is none of them that can shew in writing any testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs for confirmation and proofe of that custome.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Socrates</hi> translated by Doctor <hi>Hanmer</hi> a formalist,<note place="margin">See farther in Socrates in the same chapter.</note> for answer to <hi>Augustines</hi> rule. In the dayes of <hi>Iustinus Martyr,</hi> that is, in the midst of the second age after the Apostles, there is no mention made of any other holy day then the Lords day. In his second Apologie he seemeth to affirme, that the Christians had onely two times of publicke meetings: the one ordinary upon the Lords day: the other extraordinary and uncertaine, viz. when any was converted to the Christian faith, and baptized. As for the questions extant among <hi>Iustinus</hi> workes, the learned do not acknowledge them for his. In <hi>Augustins</hi> rule there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the nativity day. As for the other foure daies mentioned, put the case they were universally observed in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, that is, in the fift age after the Apostles, yet except they were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7885:43"/>
perpetually observed, <hi>Augustines</hi> rule will not helpe them. If If they cannot proue Pasche to be Apostolicall, how will they proue the Penticost, the Passion, Ascension day to be Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call? There is Sermons extant amongst <hi>Cyprians</hi> workes upon the Passion and Ascension dayes. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth these Sermons of Christs cardinall workes to be <note n="r" place="margin">

The observing of the passion day brought into the kirk, set dayes of fasting, the Friday fast, Lenton fast, and a number of superstitions accompanying the said fastings together with the opinion of merit by fasting. Set anniversary fasts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our Divines. The right manner of fasting is to fast when some iudgement is imminent, some great worke to bee performed. And as for the private man, when hee is greatly tempted to sin, and cannot overcome his tentation, then is it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test time for him to fast. The Paschall fasts were also abused for the Paschall communion following, as if Easter communion required greater preparation then any other communion in the yeare.</p>

We assume, Christs nativity, death, resurrection, &amp;c. Are not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

meditation of a Christian in private; but also are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and intreated in the ordinary and publick service. Every communion sunday is a passion holy day. Euery sabboth that Christs nativity is preached, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuity. But to ordain an anniversary day, or houre of rest for commemoration of his nativity, or passion, and specially vpon a weeke day is a Iewish rudiment, and a prejudice to Christian libertie.</p>
                  <p>As for the 5. day of November it is not an holy day. It is not a day of cessation from work, which is one of the chiefe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an holy day.

                  <head>The <hi>8.</hi> Reason.</head>
                  <p>That which lawfully hath been abolished by civile and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall lawes, and by consent and uniforme practize in the contrary without interruption, and beyond the prescription of time allowed to things moueable (put the case holy dayes were things moueable, and indifferent) and hath been borne downe by sermons of all the most reverent Preachers since the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, corrected with censures, and abjured by publick oaths of Preachers and professors, cannot lawfully be received, and put in practize againe. <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Saravia</hi> urged for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their ceremonies, Law, custome, prescription, and craveth that the impiety and unlawfulnes of their ceremonies be proved; or els that the non-conformists conforme. May we not plead after the same manner for our former order so long established, and that they proue it was impious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull before we make a change. And so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue sworn. Our oath by it selfe bindeth more then Law, custome, and prescription: farre more when it concurreth with them. The assumption is evident by that which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set downe in the beginning. If <hi>Zanchius</hi> aproved the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of holy dayes in some Kirks where they were, because they haue been poluted and grossely abused: much more would he and other divines knowing the trueth of our case think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to reinduce them amongst us.</p>

                  <p>Of the ancient Kirks I haue spoken before. Some excuse
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7885:46"/>
the Ancients with good intention, because to winne the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles they converted their dayes into Christian holy dayes. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers excused them with the circumstance of time, that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among Paganes, they made profession before their eyes of Christs birth, Passion, resurrection &amp;c. by observing such dayes. But the wisdome of their intention has proven folly, as the 7. reason maketh manifest. The like circumstance of time is not offered: Therefore we may not be excused. It is grosse ignorance to say that holy dayes were so many hundreth yeares before Papistry. For Papistry hath been in the Kirk ever since the dayes of the Apostles: yea the mystery of <hi>iniquitie</hi> was working in their times. The errors of the Orthodoxe Kirk were the beginnings of Papistry, at length they grew to a great masse. So how beit the whole lump was not formed, till the Antichrist came to his full strength, yet many particulars were entered before, and like brooks came into the great river. As the Antichrist was borne and did grow in yeares, so did Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. As for the reformed Kirks, except our neighbour Kirke, they haue abandoned dayes dedicate to Saints. Some admit dayes dedicate to Christ, some two, some fiue: But not with the full consent and good liking of the learned, But either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the authority of the Magistrate, or wilfulnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or because remaining in the midst of their enimies, they are not permitted otherwayes to do. <hi>Farrellus</hi> and <hi>Viret</hi> removed all holy dayes out of the Kirk of <hi>Geneva,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> testifies. The same decree which banished <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> out of Geneva brought in other holy dayes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epist.</hi> 118.</note> They were all again abrogate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the sabboth day. Howsoever after came in the keeping of Pasche and the Nativity. <hi>Caluin</hi> was so far from liking of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, that he was flandered of intention to abolish the Lords day. The Belgick Kirks in their Synod holden at Dost anno 1578. wished, that onely the Lords day might be celebrate. Yea <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe in his booke <hi>de bonis operibus,</hi> set forth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1520. wished that there were no feast dayes among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but the Lords day. And in his booke to the Nobilitie of <hi>Germanie,</hi> he saith, <hi>Consultum esse ut omnia festa aboleantur, solo Dominico die retento.</hi> It were expedient that all feast dayes were abrogate, the Lords day only retained. Howsoever forraigne divines in their Epistles &amp; Councels speak somtime sparingly against holy dayes, when their advice was sought of Kirks newly risen out of Popery, and greatly distressed: they never advised a Kirke to resume them where they were removed, neither had they leasure to consider narrowly the corruption of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7885:47"/>
every errour, that prevailed in their time, the work of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was so painfull to them. I wish therefore that the judicious Reader would ponder the reasons set down in this treatise. As for our neighbour Kirk standing in the midest betwixt the Roman and reformed Kirks as <hi>Bucerus</hi> once said is more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in their feasts,<note place="margin">Brightman. In <hi>Apocaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psen. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>De festis lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> as in other ceremonies, then the other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Kirks as <hi>Gretzerus</hi> the Iesuit hath observed. <hi>Calvino-Papistae Angli ut in aliis quae ad ritus et ceremonias pertinent, longe liberalio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res sunt quam puritani in Gallia, Germania, Belgia: ita et in festis retinendis longe largiores.</hi> They obserue not onely the fiue holy dayes already mentioned, but other dayes also dedicate to Christ. The feast of circumcision was not remembred in the Kalendars, but within this 500. year. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is the first that maketh mention of the Epiphanie day. Neither was it institute at the first for the wise men. There is no homily of any farther extent for the feast of purification before the dayes of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> The feast of the Trinitie was not keept at Rome it selfe in the dayes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. They keepe also a number of Sancts dayes: so that their dayes in number are moe, then the Iewes themselues observed. The reasons already alledged against dayes dedicate to Christ, may serue also against dayes dedicate to Sancts and Angels. We may looke assuredly that the fiue dayes presently urged will bring in all the rest, to make up our Conformity with our neighbour Kirk, which to us is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. They were never remoued from amongst them: we haue abandoned and abjured them. If the Apostle reproved the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians so sharply that beginning in the spirit, they returned to the flesh, that is to the ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, some time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by God, what reproofe deserue we after wee haue begun in the Spirit, and runne so well, and so long, if we returne to human traditions &amp; superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude then, to esteem one day aboue another in respect of any mystery certainly known, or commonly reputed to haue been wrought upon that day. To testifie this estimation by cessation from worke. To devise a particular service to be done upon it accounting that forme or part of service acceptable to God, because it is performed on that day: is to obserue a day: and in this maner doe we obserue anniversary dayes. The same consideration may be applyed to an anniversary houre.</p>

               <p>Imposition of hands, was a ceremony used in personall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and blessings before the Law, under the Law, and under the Gospell, <hi>Iacob</hi> imposed hands on the sonnes of <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he blessed them Gen. 48. <hi>Moses</hi> layd his hand upon <hi>Ioshua</hi> his successor; Numb. 27. The elders that were admitted to be Councellours in the great Synedrion, were admitted with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> were promoved to their high degree of doctorship, by imposition of hands. In the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we read, that Christ layed on hands on the children whom he blessed; Math. 19.13. The Apostles gaue the gifts of tongues, Prophesying, and working of miracles, by imposition of hands: Act. 8. the faithfull indued with the gift of healing, and casting out devils, layed on hands on the persons cured. Mark. 14. office-bearers in the Kirk were receaved with imposition of hands. Act. 6. 1. Tim. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> when they were sent forth in a special embassage, were commended to the grace of God by imposition of hands: Act. 13. when the Chatechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists wer throughly catechised, they were admitted to the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the communicants by imposition of hands, Heb. 6.</p>
               <p>Imposition of hands used in so divers actions, civile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, was no Sacrament, for who will admit, that the inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of Magistrates and Doctors, or admission of rulers to be Counsellers, is a sacrament? it was only a simple rite, and signe of limitation or restraint, specifying, or setting forth, the party, on whom wee desire God to powre his blessing: that is, it was only an indicant and demonstratiue signe of the person on whom the blessing was powred, and not a significant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue signe of the blessing or grace it selfe bestowed. A sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification may indeed be devised, as some divise this analogie betwixt it and the thing signified; that the imposition of the hand, doth in some sort resemble the hand of God streatched forth for the protecting, assisting, and safe keeping, of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and so it may be <hi>signum factum,</hi> a signe, made and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to signifie such a thing: but it is not <hi>signum destinatum,</hi> a signe instituted by God to signifie such a thing, for we haue no warrant for such a signification in all the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The imposition of hands mentioned. Act. 8. was not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but extraordinary and temporary. The Apostles gaue the extraordinary giftes, of tongues, prophecy, and such like, for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7885:48"/>
they were seene of them that stood by, and served for a general confirmation of the truth of their doctrine. The gift of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and strength against all temptations of sin, and assaults of the Devill, is a grace invisible, serving for the confirmation of every Christian in particular, and bestowed onely upon the faithfull; whereas the former gifts called <hi>gratiae gratis datae</hi> by the Schoolemen, might haue been bestowed upon persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified, this place maketh <note n="a" place="margin">

The Spirit was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ was not as yet glorified.</p>
               <p>The Imposition of hands mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. is exponed by <hi>Theophilactus</hi> to be that wonderfull imposition of hands by the which they received the Spirit to prophesie and worke mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Others expone it to bee the imposition of hands ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory, or consecratory of Ministers in their office. A third sort take it for an ordinary and common rite, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the catechised were initiate, and entred into the society of the communicants.

The Catechumenists were either Infidels of perfect age, converted to the faith, or else the children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians come to perfect age. The first sort were tried of their sufficient knowledge in the Catecheticall doctrine, before they were baptized and admitted to the communion.

As it was nothing else but a gesture of prayer in the re-entry, so was it onely a gesture of prayer in the entry. The reformed Kirkes obserue the same order in admitting to the Lords table, either the children of Christians, or strangers from other parts: they admit them not but with prayers, and after due examination of their knowledge, and personall profession of the known truth. The Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> at the first reformation ordained, that children should be examined for the first time, at the ninth year of their age; for the second, at the twelft; for the third at the fourteenth: &amp; since hath practised continual examination in the Catecheticall doctrine, with prayers reiterate, for their growth in knowledge and Sanctification; and without sufficient tryall they were not admitted to the Lords table. And this was thought sufficient, to unite the baptized with the society of the communicants. The gesture of <hi>imposition of hands</hi> other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Kirks, and ours also, haue omitted: because it was a rite indifferent: for it was but an indicant signe of the person admitted: and because it hath been, and is still abused to make up a bastard Sacrament; <hi>the Sacrament of confirmation,</hi> which we haue condemned, not only in the confession of faith, but also in the confession of <hi>Helvetia</hi> approved in the generall Assembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh Anno</hi> 1566. And thirdly, because this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of personall prayer is omitted in other cases, as reconciling of Penitents, Schismatiks, and Converts, even where Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is used, that the world may see, it is not used by them in confirmation as a gesture of personall prayer and blessing, but to a further intent.</p>
               <p>Imposition of hands was not called <hi>Confirmation</hi> vntill it was turned into a sacrament. This name of <hi>Confirmation</hi> was giuen of old, not only to the action of anoynting the forehead of the baptized with chrisme in the forme of a crosse: but also, to the giving of the cup to the communicants.<note n="g" place="margin">

it is vsed only in the first sense. and howbeit the oylie crosse be remoued, yet the corruptions which came in with it, remaine still with the imposition of hands, the only sensible matter, that is, the essence of this Sacrament in the opininion of many Schoolemen.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:7885:50"/>Our first reason then against them, is, the want of instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or example in the Scripture. They can alledge no other place Act. 8. where <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are sent to <hi>Samaria</hi> to impose hands on those who had bin baptized by <hi>Philip.</hi> If <hi>Phillip</hi> might haue done it, what needed the Apostles to haue travelled to <hi>Samaria</hi> for that purpose? none but Apostles imposed hands: Bishops are the only successours of the Apostles. <hi>Answer.</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and not granting that Bishops are the Apostles successours, first it is untrue that the Apostles only imposed hands, when the holy Ghost was bestowed: for <hi>Ananias</hi> layed hands on <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 9.17. he not onely cured him of his blindnes but also said <hi>the Lord hath sent me unto thee, that thou mayest be filled with the holy Ghost.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were sent, not onely to impose hands, but generally to advance the work begun by <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. There is no imposition of handes mentioned in that place, but extraordinary, and onely extraordinary effects are reckoned, as hath already been said. They exercised this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power not as Bishops, but as Apostles. Bishops are not their successours in their extraordinary power, for then they might giue the gift of tongues and prophecying. 4. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that imposition of hands to haue been ordinary, and accompanied at that time with miraculous gifts, as accessory to the strengthning grace of confirmation; it followeth not that the Bishops succeed only to the Apostles in the said ordinary part of their power: because the Apostles being both Bishops and Presbyters, the text maketh not manifest, whether they impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hands as Presbyters or as Bishops as <hi>Durandus</hi>

               <p>Next confirmation belongeth not to the power of jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but of order.

They reserved unto themselues also the christning of bels, and conjuring, or hollowing of Churches and Churchyards and of alters and superalters, and hallowing of chalices, and so forth whatsoeuer is of honor or profite, which confirmations, and the other conjurations also, they haue now committed to their suffragans: because they themselues haue no leasure to minister such things for their lusts and pleasures and abundance of all things, and for the cumbrance that they haue in the Kings matters and busines of the Realmes. One keepeth the privie seale, another the great seale, the third is confessor that is to say a privie traytor and a secret Iudas he is presedent of the Prince his Councel, he is an Embassadour; an other sort of the Kings secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.

               <head>Of the Administration of the Sacraments in priuate places</head>
               <p>IN the ninth head of the first booke of discipline, it was thought expedient, that baptisme be ministred vpon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dayes of preaching: not that it is unlawfull to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise whensoeuer the word is preached: but to remoue a grosse error wherewith many are deceived, thinking that children be damned if they die without baptisme, and to make the people hold the administration of the Sacraments in greater reverence. In the order of baptisme set dovn before the Psalmes in metre, it is said, that the Sacraments are not ordained of God to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in priuate corners, as charmes or sorceries; but left to the Congregation and necessarily annexed to Gods word, as seales of the same. In the Assembly holden at <hi>Edinburgh anno.</hi> 1581. in October, it was ordained that the sacraments should not be ministred in private houses, but solemnly, according to the good order hitherto observed, vnder the paine of deposition, In the confession of faith the cruell judgement against infants depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without the sacrament, and the absolute necessity of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme are damned. This lawdable order hitherto observed, was altered in the late pretended Assembly holden at <hi>Perth.</hi> where was made an act anent the administration of baptisme in priuate houses, when necessity requireth. Item, an act anent the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and giuing of the holy communion in private houses to sick and infirme persons.</p>
               <p>A Sacrament is a publick action, to be performed publickly, by publick ministers: neither can any necessity or sufficient cause be alledged, wherefore any sacred and publick action, should passe in priuate: Because Gods ordinance is to vs a Supreame law and necessity, which we ought to obey rather then foster popular ignorance and infirmity. These are <hi>Tilenus</hi> words. <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>The Sacraments were appointed, not onely to be signes and seales of invisible graces, bvt also to be testimonies before the world of our piety and thankfulnes towards God, and badges of our profession, distinguishing true Kirks from false. All Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are certain kindes of protestations of our faith sayeth <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

               <p>We haue spirituall and invisible fellowship and communion with the whole Kirke. Outwardly we professe the same faith and kind of worship, but we doe not communicate with the whole Kirk in the publick exercises of religion and ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7885:53"/>
of the Sacraments, except only mediatly in some particular congregation. Visible communion in the holy things of God, is the end of our vnion and consociation with a particular Kirke. That which we may not attain to in our communion with the whole Kirke militant immediatly? we do it mediatly in our communion with a particular congregation. This communion ought not to be violate.</p>
               <p>The minister in ministration of the Sacraments, hath not the only and cheife interest, but togither with the minister, the kirk witnessing, consenting, approving, and concurring with praier and thanksgiving. He is the mouth, but he is not all. The keies of the sacraments are giuen to the Kirke, howbeit the exercise and dispensation of them bee concredited to the pastours.<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotio.</hi>
                  </note> All other actions which concerned the whole Kirk, were done with consent, and in presence of the Kirke: as elections, ordinations, excommunications. By the same reason ought the Sacraments to be ministred with consent, and in presence of the Kirk, seeing they are workes of publick nature, and publick fruit belonging to all.</p>
               <p>Sacraments ought to be preserved from contempt, neglect, and corruption. The Sacraments are irreligiously handled, when they are ministred in private places: The Imperiall constitution in <hi>Iustinian</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Novel.</hi> 57</note> 
                  <hi>dischargeth that holy things be ministred in private houses.</hi> Not onely are the Sacraments ministred irreligiously in priuate, brought in contempt, and the publik vse neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also hereticks take occasion to corrupt the pure administration of the Sacraments by these privie practises,</p>
               <p>The Sacraments are not tyed to the materiall Kirkes made of dead stones, but the Kirke made of liuely stones. If therefore the congregation bee in a woode, a house, or a Caue, the Sacraments may bee ministred in a house, a woode or a caue. But then the Sacraments are ministred, not in priuate but in publick because they are ministred in the sight of the whole Congregation.</p>
               <p>Christs promise to be in the midst of two or three conuened in his name, cannot be extended to the administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: for then where two only are convened, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might be ministred, and so the priuate masse defended. Christ reasoneth onely from the lesse to the more. If he will heare the prayers and ratifie the censures of two or thre, farr more of the whole Kirk.</p>
               <p>Baptisme is a ceremonie initiatory of our entrance into the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7885:54"/>
bosome of some visible congregation, or as <hi>Caluine</hi> sayeth <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 185.</note> It is a sacred and solmne introduction into the Kirke of God, and is a testimony of our heauenly burgesship, vnto the which those are written vp, whom he adopteth to himselfe, It ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be publick.</p>
               <p>Baptisme is a signe of Christian profession before the world; it is called therefore <hi>the stipulation or interrogation of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> 1. Peter. 3. it ought therefore to be publick.</p>
               <p>The Congregation should make fruit of the ministration of Baptisme, in remembring their owne baptisme, and the promises made in baptisme repeated unto them: it ought therefore to be publick, seeing the comfort and benefite in some respects should be common.</p>
               <p>Not only the parents, but the Kirk presents the infant before God and concurreth with the minister in prayer for the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the infant, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayeth, <hi>vt manu facta ambire grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am pro baptizando possumus.</hi> It ought therefore to be publick.</p>
               <p>Priuate baptisme hath sprong of the opinion of the necessity of baptisme, and doth still foster the same damnable opinion. In the ancient Kirk two solemne times were appointed for baptisme, to wit, <hi>Pasche</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> whereby many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without baptisme. <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> many delayed baptisme till their latter age. The Clinicall baptismes, that is baptismes in the bed were not of that accompt that publick baptisme had. When the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the necessity of priuate baptisme prevailed, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed many absurdities, the defence of baptisme by women, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme by a pagane, baptisme with puddly water, and disputation whether the mother should be baptized for the safety of the infant in the mothers belly, that is, whether they should be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati antequam nati,</hi> get the sacrament of the second birth, before they get the first birth.</p>
               <p>In private baptisme the doctrine of baptisme is omitted, for hast to saue the soule of the infant, as is thought, and so the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not ministred according to the dignity of it: and this hath bredd a negligent and carelesse ministration of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in publick. The <hi>Trullian Synod</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Can. 59.</note> decreed, that baptisme <hi>Nullatenus,</hi> in no case be ministred in a priuate oratory if it be done otherwise, let the Clergie-man be deposed, the laikes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, If in no case, where was then the case of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie?</p>
               <p>Private baptisme hath bred a new kind of baptisme, that is, a baptisme by supposition. For if the childe baptized in private
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7885:54"/>
convalesse they baptize it over again, in case they doubt it was baptized in a right forme, saying, <hi>If thou be not baptized,</hi> N. <hi>I baptise thee in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> What if the childe was already baptized? is not the publicke baptisme rebaptization? but the decree of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third is warrant sufficient for this conditionall baptisme.</p>
               <p>Baptisme was solemne in the primitiue Kirk, as we may read of <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and Christs Disciples baptizing, and the new Converts in the Actes: some were not baptized in any visible Kirke, because they had not the occasion, as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, and the Centurion. No man will deny but in the infancy of a Kirke, a private baptisme may be tolerated: but we speak of a Kirke constituted. When the Kirk of God was in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, no wonder that circumcision was ministred in families: but after that the Kirke was constituted among Gods people, the ministration of circumcision was publick, and is at this day mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in the Synagogue, where a Synagogue is to be had. The Lord appoynted a precise day for circumcision, which might not be prevented. It was no wonder therefore if they had not ever opportunity of a solemne convention. There is no precise day set down for baptisme. The mark of circumcision howbeit secret, was permanent, and easily tried, baptisme is not so. The Kirk therefore ought to be assured of the baptisme of such as are reputed fellow-heires with whom they must haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints and visible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy exercises. As any particular member is cut off from their fellowship by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with consent, and in the presence of the Kirk, 1. Cor. 5 4.5. so ought every particular member be received in their fel. lowship with their knowledge and consent convened together.</p>
               <p>The Lords Supper ought to be publicke, we haue a spirituall union with the whole Kirke; but because it is not possible to celebrate a sacramentall communion with the whole Kirk mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, the Lord hath appoynted us to celebrate a sacramental communion with some particular Kirke. <hi>We that are many, are one bread, and one body, because we are partakers of one bread,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. We cannot then be one body sacramentally, except wee bee partakers of one bread. Other feasts may be private in private houses, but the Lords Supper ought to be publicke, 1. Cor. 11.12. <hi>When yee convene to eate, tarry one for another,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.33. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxis</hi> a word signifying as much as Synagogue, was one of the names given of old to this sacrament.</p>
               <p>This sacrament is a bond of loue, a sinew of publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7885:55"/>
a badge of our publick profession. The Kirkes interest, the dignity of the sacrament, and other generall reasons before mentioned, may be applied in particular to this sacrament, to proue that the ministration thereof ought to be publicke.</p>
               <p>The communion was sent to the sicke in the time, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the action in <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> his time. It became afterward to be reserued for the use of dying persons. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> who misconstrued <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. for the necessity of baptisme, did also misconstrue the words of <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>Except a man eate the flesh, &amp;c.</hi> for the necessity of the Eucharist. This erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the necessity of the Eucharist, made the ancients to giue it not only to aged persons departing this life for their <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and that for the space of six hundred yeares: yea some put the Eucharist into the mouthes of the dead, lest they should want their voyage victuall. Such horrible prophanations of the holy Sacrament proceeded of this opinion of necessity: and yet in all antiquity we read not that the communion was celebrated at the sick mans bed side. The consecrated bread was onely sent to him.</p>
               <p>Clinicall communions haue not onely bred, and still do foster the opinion of absolute necessity, but also of <hi>opus operatum,</hi> of a preposterous confidence in the last voyage victuall, of coldnesse in the publike service of God, when we are in health, of distrust of our salvation, if we want it at that time. <hi>Calvin</hi> sayth, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 361</note> 
                  <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillimum est hic cavere ne alios superstitio, alios ambitio &amp; vana o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentatio ad petendum sollicitet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They say the sick should not be left destitute of comfort. This reason ariseth of the opinion of necessity, as if there were no other meanes to comfort the sick,, or as if the comfort of the publick communion indured onely for the present time, and not for the time to come. There is a faire occasion offered, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. of private communion, and yet there is no mention made of it in that place. If the vow, and desire of baptisme may supply the want of baptisme, then may also the vow and desire of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist doe the like; seeing the <hi>Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some Diuines condiscend thus farre, that the communion

may be sent to the sick in the time of the publicke action. But <hi>Tilenus</hi> sayth, <note n="k" place="margin">
