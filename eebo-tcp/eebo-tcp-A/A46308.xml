         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe War in which the <hi>Confederates</hi> are at
preſent engag'd againſt that Disturber of
all <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, having been
of late the chief Subject of Diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all ſorts of People; nothing certainly can be

<hi>Flanders;</hi> wherein is very carefully and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And, whereas in moſt <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> many Things
are taken meerly upon Truſt or Heareſay, our Author
(who was a Perſon of Worth and Note, and had a
Conſiderable Post in the Army) being an Eye Witneſs of
every Tranſaction; the Reader is not in the least Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being impos'd upon, or of ſwallowing Fables and
Falſities inſtead of Truths. But, beſides the <hi>Military</hi>
Tranſactions, you have likewiſe here a <hi>Topographical</hi>
Deſcription of thoſe Places the Army paſs'd through in
their March; in which, the Situation of the <hi>Towns,</hi>
their <hi>Fortifications, Buildings, Curioſities, Cuſtoms</hi>

            <p>And, what is ſtill more inviting; all thoſe who are

to reſcue from Slavery many of thoſe poor Creatures who

come up to moſt of the Houſes in the Town; for the
Conveniency of their Paſſage there are ſeveral Draw-Bridges,
which are raiſed to give way when their occaſions
lead them to bring them up or down. The Banks of
the Rivers, which are the Streets, are planted with Lime
and Elm-Trees, which give their Shade in Summer and
Shelter in Winter, and are a very great Ornament to the
Town; the middle of whoſe Streets, are very curiouſly
Paved with Stone; and the outſide for two yards broad,
with Clinker-Brick: Their Doors and Window-ſhutters, are
all painted Green: Their Houſes are neatly kept within,
and placed in admirable order without: Their Men are
tollerably faſhionable, but their Women are generally Fat,
burly and unſightly; they all go in Slippers, and their
Coats come down but half way their Legs. Here is a
ſumptuous <hi>Stadhouſe</hi> and <hi>Exchange,</hi> and I think every thing
that can contribute to the compoſing of a lovely, decent,
rich, commodious City. On the 14th we went to <hi>Delf,</hi> in

Trots him all the way, and in two hours time comes to his
Journeys end. There are about ſorty of theſe Boats (which
are much like your Aldermens Barges on the <hi>Thames</hi>)
which will contain about Forty Paſſengers; theſe Boats are
ſo ordered, that one of them is to go this Courſe every
half hour: There are likewiſe at <hi>Delf</hi> other Boats, which

            <p>
               <hi>Hague,</hi> Here is the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Court about a
quarter of a League from the Town (for this is not a City,
although it doth ſurpaſs ſeveral Cities iin Grandure.) In a
Grove hard by, is a very fine Mall. In the <hi>Stadhouſe</hi> of
this Town is the Burgermaſters Chamber, wherein is
placed the Strappado: Two Leagues from this place is
<hi>Hounſlerdike,</hi> where the Prince hath a very ſtately Pallace,
whereunto appertaineth ſeveral Rarities, among which is
an Oſtridg and ſome Indian Oxen; He hath likewiſe another
fine Pallace in the Grove near the <hi>Hague,</hi> in which is a very
ſpacious Hall adorned with ſeveral curious Sculptures; from
the <hi>Hague</hi> to <hi>Skeeveline</hi> is a Walk about two Miles in length,
paved all the way with Clinker-Brick. About half way is the
Heer <hi>Bentings</hi> Houſe, now Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> whereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a very famous Orange Garden, with a large Bird-Cage
which is ſixteen Rood long, and twelve Foot broad:
To the top of the great Steeple of the <hi>Hagus</hi> is Three
hundred Steps, and in the Church thereof is the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Obdam,</hi> the famous Admiral of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet,
who was blown up together with his Ship as he was coming
to an Engagement with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet. Moſt of the
Gentry and Nobility in this part of the Country, have Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
in this Town; they uſe few Coaches, but generally
ride in an open kind of Chariot, which defends them from
neither Wind nor Sun; the Carriages thereof are not ſlung
as in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that they are little better than a gilded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104184:5"/>
Car: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="June. 20. 1689."/> The Women appear very modeſtly (or rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
Coy) not ſuffering a Man ſo much as to touch
their Hands, without ſhewing a diſlike thereunto. This
Town is likewiſe famous for a Spin-houſe, in nature of a
<hi>Bridewell,</hi> which is for reſtraining of Burgermaſters Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which lead lewd lives, upon diſcovery whereof they
are confined to this houſe for a year and a day. And from
hence we were ordered to <hi>Breda,</hi> to joyn the Troop of
Guards formerly gone thither; in Obedience to which we
came back to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and began our Journey from thence
on the Twentieth, and in two days arrived at our Journeys
end, through a Country where to ſee a Stone is a Miracle; the
Land there ſeems lower than the Sea, and I do believe ſo it
is; for, half the Country would be overflown with the Sea;
were it not for a great Multitude of Windmills that are kept
conſtantly imploy'd in draining the Land by a pretty kind of
Stratagem. There are ſeveral Towns, and good Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the Road, wherein I obſerved no great Superſtition
(wherewith <hi>Brabant</hi> is horribly peſtered) ſave in the matter
of the Stork, which they account lucky both to particular
Perſons and the publick State; they being poſſeſt with a
fond conceit, that they have a ſecret Inſtinct in them, which
teaches them to abhor Monarchy, and that therefore they
will breed no where but in a free State; and therefore they
build their Neſts for them in the Tops of their Chimneys,
where they delight to breed. But if they chance to breed
on the Top of a Burgermaſters Chimney, they will rather
chooſe to loſe the benefit of the Fire-place, than diſturb
this lucky Bird; the Laws of the Land Protect them, and
make it Penal to deſtroy them; for which there is a natural
reaſon, eſpecially in a Country where Frogs and Toads do ſo
much abound, of which Vermin theſe Birds are great
deſtroyers: and of which ſort of Vermin, and Proviſion
for the Storks, there is ſuch plenty here, that if almoſt
all the Birds in the Air were Storks, they may be feaſted in
<hi>Holland.</hi>

a very fine Caſtle and Garden here. There is likewiſe a
very remarkable Steeple here, which is in height four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty four Steps, all of carved Stone; wherein is a
delicate Ring of Bells, which chime every half hour, to
give notice of the Clocks going to ſtrike, which ſtrikes here
ſo often; theſe Bells will readily and ſweetly chime to any
time. Near to the Top of this mighty Structure, in a
round Ball, liveth a Trumpeter and his whole Family, which
by reaſon of the height, ſeems to them that ſtand on the
Ground, to be no bigger than that you may graſp it in your
Arms: This Trumpeter is to ſound every Night, after the
Gates are locked, to give an Account that the City is ſafe.

In this City are twenty five Colledges, Nunneries,

the Jeſuits Chappel in its Structure and Ornaments, which

We are now come into the Land of Idolatry, where the

               <hi>Lovaine</hi> Is a large uniform plentiful City, whither all

            <p>
               <hi>Perway,</hi> Several Branches of the Army being not yet

fifteen great Cannon, twenty ſix of a leſſer ſort, and
twenty five ſmall Field-Pieces, with four Mortars, and
thirty Tin Boats; all the Camp we found plenty enough

 <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> We were encamped here until the Fourteenth, and

of the Army, and one of the Baggage and Artillery; here
were great Parties commanded out every Night, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Alarums, but nothing of Action, ſaving that a Party
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> under the Command of a Lieutenant, run
away from a <hi>French</hi> Party, the Commander whereof, and
ſome of his Men were taken by another Party of ours;
but our Lieutenant that fled was ſhot, and every Tenth

At the Camp ſeveral Souldiers were by a Prieſt inveagled
to deſert our Army and go over to the <hi>French,</hi> ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

having this Motto on them (<hi>Altare Privilegiatum.</hi>)
They keep their Markets at their Churches on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,

            </p>

               <hi>Charleroy,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/>  Here I had the Opportunity of obſerving
the Strength of a moſt regular Fortification, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Key of <hi>Flanders;</hi> it was two Leagues diſtant
from the Camp; in the Town was a ſtrong Guard, and
on the Road to the Camp were placed ſeveral Guards.
This Place is memorable for nothing but that it is a good
Garriſon, which was the Deſign the <hi>French</hi> King had in
building it: There is plenty of Meadowing about the
Town, which makes it a good Quarter for Horſe, and the
neather part of the Houſes of the Town are all Stables,
which occaſions the uncleanlineſs of the Streets. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
entertained the Duke (after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> manner)
with all ſorts of the beſt Wine, and rode with us round
the Walls, which are raiſed ſo high, that none of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
appear to any Body without the City; at this Town I
obſerved a great Market of <hi>French</hi> Horſes, which had been
lately taken from their Army, and here expoſed to Sail by
Beat of Drum. At the Dukes Departure he was comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the Diſcharge of the great Guns round the

commanded on a Party to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to guard our new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements
to the Camp, which were come thither out of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> This City was twenty Miles from our Camp;
the Road lying through ſeveral great Woods, made our
Paſſage dangerous, and gave us reaſon to expect an Attaque
from a <hi>French</hi> Party which lay in Ambuſh for us, but miſſed
us. <hi>Bruſſels</hi> is large, but not very ſtrongly fortified, there
being only a dry Foſs round the Outworks; within it are a
hundred and twelve Churches and Chappels, among which
are an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunnery, and ſeveral other Religious Houſes;
the private Houſes and Streets are but too much furniſhed
with Images and Crucifixes, which are moſt devoutly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
by the Prieſt-ridden <hi>Mobile.</hi> The great Church
here is ſumptuouſly adorned, the outer Iſles being hung with
Tapeſtry and Arras, which are raiſed on three large Rows of
Marble Pillars, compiled aſter the <hi>Dorick</hi> manner of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture;
the Rails, as you go up to St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Altar, are
made of maſſie Silver, ſo are the Pillars of the Altar, of
which ſort there are above a hundred in this Church, which
the Spectators may ſay do all vie with one another for
Beauty and Riches; all the Windows, which are very large
and ſplendid, are glazed with painted Glaſs; before theſe
Altars, ſome Ladies or other (blinded with Popiſh Zeal)
are conſtantly proſtrate, ſo that all I can ſay on their Behalf,
is, that they look like Chriſtians; the Men and Women
of this Town appearing much more gentile and faſhionable
than thoſe of <hi>Holland;</hi> whereof (on a fair Day) you may
ſee abundance in a Walk which is in an handſome, natural,
regular Grove, leading to the Governours Pallace, which is
likewiſe very great and ſplendid, having on one ſide thereof
an Exchange; about it are divers magnificent Statues, with
curious Gardens and Water-words; near the Houſe is pitched
a Tent which was taken from the <hi>Baſſa</hi> before <hi>Buda,</hi> it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

for the better Security thereof: It is ſaid that Camlets

here. The Inhabitants have good Opportunities of Education,
ſaving the Superſtition of their wicked Religion, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream

that. Here is a great Ordinary at two Guilders, which is

Dogs, which they harneſs, and draw with them (in ſmall

officiate inſtead of Prieſts: They have a notable

accompanied with Flutes and Organs. They entertained
the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> with a Ball, and in Requital he treated
them with a Collation one Evening at the Camp; their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs

they keep their Coaches (ſome with ſix Horſes) and live
very Court-like. None are admitted into this Society, but
ſuch as can evidence their Extract to have been Noble for

There are of this ſort at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Monts,</hi> but are

though as fertile a Soil, and as good a Climate as can be in

At this Camp we intrench'd our ſelves, and one

cut a large Pace, through a great Wood, quite another

among which was <hi>Wall-Court,</hi> to which all the Peaſants
of the Country, to the Number of Five Thouſand had
flocked, bringing with them all their Proviſion and Subſtance,
thinking thereby to ſecure themſelves, under Cover of the

of the Country, not to ſell any Proviſion to our Army,
on pain of Death, and burning their Houſes, whereupon
all Proviſions began to grow very ſcarce and dear; whereat
our General being enraged, ſent two Regiments of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
Foot, to require admiſſion into the Town, and
that they ſhould bring their Proviſions to the Camp, where
they ſhould receive the utmoſt value for them, which if they

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Aug. 15. 1689."/> This is the Walled Village which was (more ſuperſtitiouſly
than wiſely) ſo vigorouſly Attaqued by the <hi>French</hi> Army, on
St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s day, which is their Kings Birth day; out of a fond
conceit, that that day is always proſperous to their Arms;
which day being on the Sixteenth of this Inſtant, proved
the direct contrary, their raſhneſs being the occaſion of
the loſs of moſt of the principal Officers of their Army,
beſides 3000 Sentinels killed in the Field, and a number
wounded, with the loſs of not above 50 or 60 on our ſide,
among which was only one Officer of Note, who was a
Major. The Engagement began on a Party of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
who gave way on the firſt Charge; but, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> being
there alſo, who were the Guards (that day) for cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Forragers, on whom the Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> Army
chiefly was (and indeed if they could have paſſed that
Guard, they might have taken 5000 of them) they bore
the Brunt of the Battle, and by their bravery, gained the
advantage of the Gound; which if the <hi>French</hi> could have
got, they would have made uſe of it to our great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
All this while the <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> in <hi>Wall-Court,</hi> were
not idle, but received the Attaque made on them, with a great
deal of courage, committing a great ſlaughter on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
who demonſtrated a great deal of deſperate va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to little purpoſe. This Rancounter laſted ten Hours, the
Cannons playing all that while on both ſides; theirs did
us on miſchief, but ours cut off ſeveral of their Horſe, and
made Lanes through their Foot as they Retreated; which
they did not do, till they ſaw the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment, and
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards advance; whereupon they ſounded a
Retreat, and ſent to our General for leave to bury their
Dead; to which the General gave his conſent, after having
taken from them 12 of their Cannon, not eſteeming it advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeable
to follow Victory too far. In burying their dead they
had the Boars to aſſiſt them, for which reaſon, before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped,
the General ordered their Villages to be burnt,
and gave the Soldiers leave to Plunder their Churches,
wherein they found great Booty. The <hi>French</hi> Army is now
Encamped within a Mile of us, and our Advance-guards
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104184:11"/>
can ſee their whole Camp. In the Fight, and after the Fight,
ſeveral Deſerters came in to us, who gave us Account that
a Multitude of their beſt Officers were ſlain, and that
Marſhal <hi>De Humiers,</hi> narrowly eſcaped; one of his Field
Officers being cut off by a Cannon Ball, whilſt he was lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Shoulder. Here we ſtay'd till the 19th, when
we Marched about two Leagues, deſigning to Encamp;
but the <hi>French</hi> being Encamped too near us, and the Place
of our Encamping, not ſtrong, our General thought fit to
change his Meaſures, and ſo marched the Army three
Leagues further, that day, a Party of the <hi>French</hi> following
us, but at a great diſtance. Near our Camp we received an
Alarum, that the <hi>French</hi> were in the Rear of us; whereupon,
our General in half an hour put the whole Army into an
advantageous Poſture to receive them; but finding the
Alarum to be falſe, and that it was only our own Rear
Guard; we Marched to our Camp, where we ſtay'd till
the 22th: And being informed, that the Enemy deſigned to
get betwixt us and <hi>Charleroy;</hi> having likewiſe Advice from
the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> not to Engage them, we Marched
early that Morning, without ſound of Trumpet, or beat of
Drum, through a very thick Wood, having the Evening
before ſent away our Cannon and Baggage toward the <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruff,</hi>
after having forraged and ravaged, in the <hi>French</hi>
Territories. For three Weeks through this Wood the <hi>French</hi>
followed us; whereof having Advice, and finding a little
Plain in the middle of the Wood, our General there drew up
the Army, lined the Wood, Manned a Shottoe, and turned our
Cannons upon them; which their Out guards perceiving,
<hi>Wall-Court</hi> being freſh in their memory, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to be ſo Mannerly as to keep their diſtance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
we Marched in a retreating Poſture, relieving their
Rear, every half hour; by this means, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Guards,
who led the Van in Morning, Marched in the Rear
in the Afternoon: thus we Marched over the <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruff</hi>
by the help of four Bridges, on Copper Boats, guarded
with Cannon; as ſoon as we got over, we Encamped at a

the Morning, by break of day, the <hi>French</hi> having raiſed two
Batteries over Night, laid on us with ten Pieces of Cannon
of twenty four pound Ball from one Battery, and eight Pieces
of eighteen pound Ball, from the other Battery; but we
were prepared for them, and had provided ſixteen Cannon
to play againſt them, which were managed ſo well, that we
did a great deal of Execution, both on their Battery, and
Guards, and Attendants: We killed three of their Eminent
Officers with one of our Balls, and found ſeveral of their
Horſes next day dead, near the Batteries: Of our ſide, we loſt
only two Men and a Woman; a Bomb fell among the Officers
of Colloner <hi>Hayle</hi>'s Regiment without doing any harm, the
Fuzze being ſtifled; two more fell in a Meadow near our
Guards, with the ſame ſucceſs; there likewiſe fell two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Balls among our Tents, which injured neither Man nor
Horſe. All the prejudice done, was, that ſome of the Tents
were torn, among which the Duke of <hi>Ormonds</hi> was one; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
which, the Duke ſtood his ground (with
the Troop drawn up) for three Hours, in the heat of the
Cannon adoing, the General having forgot to ſend him
Orders to draw off, without which he was reſolved, not to
quit his poſt: This ſort of game laſted from four in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
till eleven, during which ſpace of time, the Cannons
never ceaſed playing. In the end we conſtrained them to

more capable of Improvement in the World: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sept. 27 1689."/>  But the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

its Name; it is walled round, ſituate in the midſt of this

<hi>Monts.</hi> Within theſe Walls is a famous Chappel, joyning to
the Cloyſter, adorned with admirable Carvings, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Painting; in it are many rich Altars, which they
(at laſt) refuſed to let our Guards ſee, becauſe, ſaid they,
they have given Offence in not kneeling, at the lifting up

where (among other Fopperies and Trumperies) I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a little Prayer, hanged up in Latin, to be learnt

effect, <hi>That it would pleaſe the Lady of</hi> Cambrogue, <hi>for the ſake
of the five Wounds, which her holy Image ſuffered in that place, by
the hands of an unſanctified Jew, to grant five things; Namely,
that in the Hour of Death, they may not want the Company of a
Priest, whereby they may have the benefit of Auricular Confeſſion,
Abſolution, receiving the Sacrament, and being anointed with

of Silver, and ſell them to the People, whom they perſwade,
ſhall by the wearing of them be kept from Sickneſs, Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

That the very Marble Statues, and Monuments muſt yield to

It is ſaid, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army being about to

On the top are Five round Turrets which are made uſe of

to the Eaſt End of the aforeſaid place, and is from our Camp
Four Leagues; in it are ſeveral Churches, Monaſteries, Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,

magnificent Churches, one of the Canons, the other of the
Canoneſſes; the latter is in every particular much after
the nature of them at <hi>Neville,</hi> but the Church is much more
a ſplendid Church, and moſt of the Ladies are related to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>William,</hi> or Siſters to ſome of the

(at their own Houſe) with the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
Theſe Ladies meddle not with Conſecrating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

me here a Superſtitious Ceremony, namely, the carrying of
the Hoſt in Proceſſion, attended with Organs, Voices, and
other Muſick playing all the way, whilſt Prieſts went with
their Incenſe-pots fuming before it; it exceeds any <hi>Opera,</hi>
which is a ſhew they much admire in theſe parts: In this

which ſtrive every way to exceed one the other in Beauty and
Riches, wherein they come pretty near one the other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

where we remained as long as we could get any Forrage,
which was all devoured for Twenty Miles round, betwixt

without any great miſtake; at laſt there grew a real ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

ſufficiently revenged on the <hi>French,</hi> by the <hi>Lunenburghers,</hi> who
being a Forraging with their Carbines only, were ſet upon
by ſome <hi>French</hi> Soldiers diſguiſed in <hi>Boors</hi> Frocks, but they
received them ſo warmly, that they killed Eight and twenty
of them, and took about Seventy Priſoners, with very little
loſs. The day before we went to <hi>Monts,</hi> we marched a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of Eight thouſand Men towards the <hi>French</hi> Camp,
together with Ten pieces of Cannon; when we came near
their Out-guards, we ſent a Lieutenant of Horſe with Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
men to Fire on them, which he did, but they ſtirred not,
neither returned their Fire: It was near a Wood, where it

us; however this Alarum was ſo great a ſurprize unto
them, that ſeveral of their Sutlers run away from them,
and ſeveral of their Officers ſent away their Baggage: We

at <hi>Nevil,</hi> on the when the Duke took his leave in
order to go for <hi>England,</hi> and the next day we marched, having
free Quarters all the way to <hi>Breda,</hi> to Winter Quarters;
where we arrived on the Twenty fourth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>  and met with an
account that the Granadeers who were taken by the <hi>French,</hi>
had made their eſcape to <hi>Newburgh,</hi> where they are taken up
as Deſerters; but we have ſent for them, and in a ſhort time
do expect them with us, where we now remain laid up for
the next Campain.</p>
